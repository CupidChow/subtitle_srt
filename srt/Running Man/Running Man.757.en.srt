1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,110
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,940
(June's lush greenery sets the scene
at a luxury hotel in Incheon.)

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,880
- This is nice.
- It's pretty.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,250
(June's lush greenery sets the scene
at a luxury hotel in Incheon.)

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,050
- It's amazing.
- Gosh, what is this?

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,820
- Is this an LED screen?
- Is this a palace?

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,990
- My goodness.
- Look at the ceiling.

8
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,760
- This is...
- The whole place is an LED screen.

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,890
- Hello.
- Hello.

10
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,220
Hello.

11
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,130
- The ceiling is unbelievable.
- My goodness.

12
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,700
Is the ceiling an LED screen too?

13
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,830
- It's an LED display.
- This is...

14
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,930
This is impressive.

15
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,400
- It looks great.
- It's really nice.

16
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,870
- My gosh.
- It's unbelievable.

17
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,240
It's magnificent.

18
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,010
- You're wearing glasses today.
- You did.

19
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,070
- You're handsome.
- Good for you.

20
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,510
- All right, Daniel.
- You kept talking about it,

21
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,710
- so I put them on.
- Good.

22
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,650
- Now he looks like Daniel.
- He's Daniel now.

23
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,080
His eyes are so small.

24
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,020
- What are you talking about?
- Why are your eyes so small?

25
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,850
- That's Daniel.
- Right.

26
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,320
You have to accept that
Jong Kook's eyes are bigger than yours.

27
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,490
- Right.
- Mine are a lot bigger than yours.

28
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,260
- Jong Kook.
- I asked people around me.

29
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,390
- So...
- Of all people...

30
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,590
They say my eyes are a lot bigger.

31
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,430
- That's true.
- I'm offended when you,

32
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,500
- of all people, say that.
- You should call me Mr. Big Eyes.

33
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,270
You should save my number
under the name on your phone.

34
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,070
- You're not Mr. Big Eyes.
- Mr. Big Eyes.

35
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,840
- Your eyes are so small.
- Mr. Big Eyes.

36
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,240
Hey, how could he call himself
Mr. Big Eyes?

37
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,710
- I know.
- My wife says...

38
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,240
His eyes are a little petty.

39
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,410
- Jong Kook, petty?
- They're petty.

40
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,010
- They look timid.
- You of all people can't say that.

41
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,450
- How...
- You're different from me.

42
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,920
- That's ridiculous. Seriously?
- His eyes are so small.

43
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,120
- We're different.
- The width...

44
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,850
(To end the controversy, we need
a scientific investigation.)

45
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,990
(His eyes are smaller!)

46
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,630
(Kim Jong Kook wins.)

47
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,530
Daniel, your eyes are long
horizontally.

48
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,800
- Horizontally.
- Right.

49
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,160
- I have Western features.
- I see.

50
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,330
- Who?
- Me.

51
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,830
- Western?
- You don't have Western features.

52
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,640
- You have an oriental look.
- Which country?

53
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,940
- Where in the West?
- Well...

54
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,270
- In the West...
- In the West?

55
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,840
- Somewhere in the West.
- In the West?

56
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,640
- The West.
- He's flustered by questions.

57
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,150
- He is.
- He is Empty Head.

58
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,450
He looks very flustered.

59
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,180
Do you not remember
"Lovers in Paris?"

60
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,220
Do we have guests today?

61
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,150
Yes. The person
for the love story of Running Man,

62
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,020
whom our viewers are
paying attention to, is here today.

63
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,960
- She's here today.
- My gosh.

64
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,330
Please come on in.

65
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,330
- Who is it?
- Today's guest?

66
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,960
- She seemed determined today.
- Where is she coming from?

67
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,160
- Is she coming from here?
- Here?

68
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,100
- I just saw her.
- You look pretty.

69
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,470
My goodness.

70
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,170
(She takes the two men off guard.)

71
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,340
- Hey.
- It's Ah Young.

72
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,640
Ah Young,
you're getting prettier over time.

73
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,910
- Hello.
- How have you been?

74
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,410
(The fish
in Ok Soon's fish tank, Catfish)

75
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,920
- Hi.
- Hey.

76
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,020
Be careful. You might fall.

77
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,990
(And Hairtail, who was caught
in the same net by accident)

78
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,060
- You're all dressed up.
- She's totally...

79
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,620
- She looks great.
- You're dressed up.

80
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,760
- She's all dolled up.
- Seriously...

81
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,230
- What's with you?
- She's all dolled up.

82
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,760
- Ah Young.
- Did you drink to calm your nerves?

83
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,900
- Why are you all dressed up?
- What's with you?

84
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,170
- In her heart...
- I mean...

85
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,540
You look quite determined today.

86
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,700
I heard there would be
two men who were interested in me.

87
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,040
- He's coming close to you.
- You're finally here.

88
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,640
(Hairtail heads
straight toward her.)

89
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,450
Why aren't you coming toward me?

90
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,880
- Why...
- Why aren't you coming toward me?

91
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,050
- What?
- She asks why you're not coming.

92
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,850
I'll watch you from a distance.

93
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,850
(The romance mode is still loading.)

94
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,250
She asks
why you're not coming closer.

95
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,060
- She's like a ghost. "Come here."
- She wants you to come.

96
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,590
His heart is growing distant.

97
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,130
- No.
- He's not growing distant.

98
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,160
- That's how Se Chan is.
- Here's what I think, Ah Young.

99
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,830
You look somewhat difficult
to approach today.

100
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,800
- You think?
- I think that's why.

101
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,270
- Right?
- Hey, what's with you today?

102
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,330
- You look different today.
- Today,

103
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,900
- You look determined.
- I tried to look mature today.

104
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,000
- Yes.
- Right. She's determined.

105
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,140
- Look at him.
- I tried...

106
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,010
(Staring at her)

107
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,640
(The romance mode is on.)

108
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,010
Stop staring at her like that.
Pull yourself together.

109
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,650
- By the way...
- She looks pretty.

110
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,980
- Thank you.
- By the way...

111
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,320
- Ah Young.
- Yes.

112
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,620
The screen in the back...

113
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,960
- looks perfect for you today.
- It matches you.

114
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,590
- It's really pretty.
- I know.

115
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,690
- It's perfect for you.
- So I feel really...

116
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,990
- Is that why my heart flutters?
- Really?

117
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,530
- What's going on?
- Really?

118
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,230
(The genre keeps changing
with no break.)

119
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,970
My gosh. She's no joke today.

120
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,940
What's with him?

121
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,440
Her eyes are so big and moist.

122
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,940
- What?
- Her eyes...

123
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,810
Hey, a middle-aged man
should stay out of this.

124
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,740
What's the theme of your outfit?
Is this a penalty?

125
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,910
- You'll find out later.
- He's Mapo-gu Sheriff.

126
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,150
Did you ask if it was a penalty?

127
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,350
- I thought it was...
- Did she just say a penalty?

128
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,920
- a penalty outfit like last time.
- Hey.

129
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,420
- Penalty?
- He's wearing this on purpose.

130
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,820
It does look like a penalty.

131
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,160
- He has a reason. You'll see.
- It's a penalty.

132
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,260
- This is...
- Penalty.

133
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,390
You know what?

134
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,160
It's funny that Se Chan can't move
closer to her.

135
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,700
Daniel came toward her right away.

136
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,130
- Right.
- Go.

137
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,900
Why are you staring at her
from a distance?

138
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,070
- I can move closer.
- Come here.

139
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,440
- Hello.
- My gosh.

140
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,040
- Hey.
- That looks good.

141
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,510
- This is...
- Where is your confidence?

142
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,110
You just stood from a distance.

143
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,580
- This is a love triangle.
- By the way...

144
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,180
- She looks different.
- By the way, the fact that...

145
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,850
Ah Young always keeps
these two with her...

146
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,990
That's why.
She always pushes me around.

147
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,050
She won't let one of them go.

148
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,390
When one of them tries to grow away,

149
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,520
- she pulls him back.
- Right.

150
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
She won't let them go.

151
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,830
- She's good at playing games.
- It drives them crazy.

152
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,830
It makes them crazy.

153
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,360
I hope things work out for them.

154
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,960
And Se Chan is really something.

155
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,700
- Ye Eun?
- Ye Eun...

156
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,140
Do you support them?

157
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,600
- Do you know what Ye Eun said?
- What?

158
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,510
"I hope
things will work out for them."

159
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,740
(She didn't sound sincere at all.)

160
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,140
Which one do you like?

161
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,140
- Is there a couple you want to see?
- Who's less bad?

162
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,050
- A couple you support.
- A couple I support?

163
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,280
(Who is Ddochi's choice?)

164
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,680
- Why?
- I'd pick Daniel.

165
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,420
- Why?
- That makes Se Chan look bad.

166
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,220
- Hang on.
- That's...

167
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,420
- Why...
- I didn't do anything.

168
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,230
Hey, look at these two.

169
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,960
(She carefully chose a date
for her friend anyway.)

170
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,430
I have some news to tell you today.

171
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,130
- What?
- Haha's new song to make...

172
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,140
- Nice.
- this summer even hotter,

173
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,870
"Sunny Day" will be released...

174
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,710
- on June 13.
- Yes!

175
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,440
- I'll perform it with you.
- He could've just released...

176
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,540
the song quietly on June 13.

177
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,250
- I'm singing too.
- We can't miss his performance...

178
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,410
on Running Man, right?

179
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,650
- Please show us.
- Yes.

180
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,920
- Here?
- Let me do it a little.

181
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,880
- Right here?
- This is really nice.

182
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,120
- What?
- What is he doing?

183
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,420
Running Man is like "Inkigayo."

184
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,820
We should let him pay for this.

185
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,130
We do.
We have to get money for this.

186
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,030
- I'm excited.
- To pay for our production cost.

187
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,870
- When he performs on a show...
- Right.

188
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,730
- like "Inkigayo,"
- He should pay money.

189
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,170
- he should pay.
- Right.

190
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,770
Yes.

191
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,900
- Where's Haha?
- You look cool.

192
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,540
Guys, the song is great.

193
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,070
- Actually,
- This is amazing.

194
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,680
Young K sings this part,
not Seok Sam.

195
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,080
It's Young K's part.

196
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,250
- But he's Old J.
- Old J is singing instead.

197
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,880
- Good luck, Dad!
- All right.

198
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,150
(He came up with the name
with a guilty conscience.)

199
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,020
All right. Shall I begin?

200
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,620
(The cowboy is ready
at the top of the stairs.)

201
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,390
- It's a live performance.
- He's performing live.

202
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,490
Let's go!

203
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,960
("Sunny Day" by Haha,
featuring Old J)

204
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,530
(He's performing the song
for the first time before its release.)

205
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,170
(She finds out something.)

206
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
(Shouting)

207
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,140
(He's even using a pony.)

208
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,280
Jee Seok Jin!

209
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,810
This is hilarious.

210
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,580
(The song starts refreshingly
with Young K's firm voice.)

211
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,260
(A sunny day where it rains)

212
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,890
(He starts singing
half a key lower.)

213
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,060
(Galloping)

214
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,400
This is so funny.

215
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,140
(With the elegant palace
and fountain in the background,)

216
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,810
(the Mapo-gu Sheriff starts
his cowboy show.)

217
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,040
- I'm sad
- I'm sad

218
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,540
I just focus on today

219
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,750
(Hey!)

220
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,450
Hey, try to stay on beat.

221
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,250
(The pony is running wild.)

222
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,490
- He's good. There you go.
- My heart is racing, I can't sleep

223
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,390
(Things are heating up
at the racetrack.)

224
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,860
(Let it go!)

225
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,140
A sunny day where it rains

226
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,700
I will laugh when I feel like crying

227
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,710
(Shouting)

228
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,610
(A variety of spectacles!)

229
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,810
He looks like a singer.

230
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,050
(The singer with his 1st album
is singing passionately.)

231
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,620
(Say!)

232
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,520
(Singing)

233
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,160
All right!

234
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Sunny day

235
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,860
Sunny day

236
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:13,100
(The showcase of the cowboy
performance group is over.)

237
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,130
(The audience is satisfied.)

238
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,230
- My goodness.
- Old J.

239
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,000
Haha.

240
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,400
Shout out to Young K!

241
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,810
- Hey.
- All right.

242
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,040
- I love the song.
- What was that?

243
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,610
- You're so good.
- The live performance was great.

244
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,180
You're a singer.

245
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,610
The song turned out really well.

246
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,950
- It's "Sunny Day."
- Thank you.

247
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,220
- A sunny day where it rains.
- A sunny day where it rains

248
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,690
I hope it will go well.

249
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,990
(The opening is sunny
thanks to Mapo-gu Sheriff.)

250
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,060
Thank you.

251
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,320
Today, our shoot takes place...

252
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,760
- in Incheon.
- All right.

253
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,660
This is the port city that first
accepted Western civilization.

254
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,230
- I see.
- Including jjajangmyeon,

255
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,130
many things were first started...

256
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,740
- in the city.
- Really?

257
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,740
So we prepared this race today.

258
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,610
It's called First in the City.

259
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,180
You will obtain cards with things
that were first started in Incheon.

260
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,310
- Cards?
- At the end of the race,

261
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,220
if you have a card with the thing
that was first started in Incheon,

262
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,450
you will get the prize.

263
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,290
- Oh, dear.
- We should get the first thing.

264
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,450
- The 1st thing.
- There are 3 levels of cards,

265
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,220
which are gold, silver, and bronze,
with five cards for each level.

266
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,290
Gold has only one card
with the first thing in Incheon.

267
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,500
Silver has two cards,
and bronze has three cards.

268
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,170
For your information,
the higher the card level,

269
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,770
the higher the value of the prize.

270
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,440
The prize for a gold card...

271
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,280
is 300 dollars worth
of Onnuri gift certificates.

272
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,610
And the lowest-value prize
for a bronze card...

273
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,110
is mosquito repellent.

274
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,650
- Mosquito repellent.
- Mosquito repellent?

275
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,980
(It's hard to get a high-level card,
but it offers a bigger prize.)

276
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,120
Okay.

277
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,550
You will be divided
into 3 teams of 3.

278
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,920
One person can have only one card.

279
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,130
And each person will receive a prize
for the card they have.

280
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,560
First, you will be divided
into three teams.

281
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,070
The three women will choose
a member they want...

282
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,630
- in turn.
- All right.

283
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,130
- Okay. Play rock-paper-scissors.
- I see.

284
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,700
- Come and play rock-paper-scissors.
- Come here.

285
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,910
Jong Kook. I mean...

286
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,440
- Jong Kook?
- All of a sudden?

287
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,180
- What was that?
- You want to pick me, right?

288
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,010
- She wants Jong Kook.
- Okay. Good.

289
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,750
- Nice.
- You feel comfortable around him.

290
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,420
- Right?
- Good.

291
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,680
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

292
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,450
(Ji Hyo wins.)

293
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,820
- Ji Hyo will pick Daniel.
- Ji Hyo will pick Daniel.

294
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,860
- Ji Hyo, pick Jong Kook.
- Who do you want to pick?

295
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,130
- Yu Jae Seok.
- Okay.

296
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,330
Okay!

297
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,430
- Hang on.
- Look at him.

298
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,960
- You don't seem happy.
- I'm happy.

299
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,400
He was a little late to say that.

300
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,630
- With Ji Hyo...
- It was late.

301
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,800
No, you were late.

302
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,870
- He said that a little late.
- Right.

303
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,970
- He doesn't seem happy.
- He was very late.

304
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,040
- Then...
- I'm really happy.

305
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,300
- Then...
- Kim Jong Kook.

306
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,040
Okay!

307
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,570
- Nice.
- Next.

308
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,310
Next.

309
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,710
(What is Ok Soon's choice?)

310
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,950
Yang Se Chan!

311
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,550
- Nice.
- I think...

312
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,420
- Ah Young will be good at...
- Yang Se Chan!

313
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,290
You want a servant.

314
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,520
- He's your first choice.
- My gosh.

315
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,260
Se Chan is her first choice.

316
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,130
She's so good at playing games.

317
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,630
(It's impossible to read her mind.)

318
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,400
(Shouting)

319
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,160
- I think she did it on purpose.
- Okay. Next.

320
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,530
- She chose him on purpose.
- She's playing hard to get.

321
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,970
- On purpose.
- She's so good at playing games.

322
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,040
- Ji Hyo.
- I choose...

323
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,100
(Ji Hyo's next choice)

324
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,170
Jee Seok Jin.

325
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,040
Jee Seok Jin.

326
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,410
- Hey!
- Why?

327
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,540
Why did you...

328
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,080
- Instead of him?
- I need to save him.

329
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,310
- But why...
- Okay.

330
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,620
- She's trying to enjoy the game.
- A sunny day where it rains

331
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,950
She's trying to enjoy it.

332
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,920
- A sunny day where it rains
- Hey!

333
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,520
- What are you doing?
- I'll laugh when I feel like crying

334
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,460
- Are you trying to lose?
- No.

335
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,530
- It's for our team.
- But why...

336
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,190
- But why...
- Haha!

337
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,800
- Okay!
- Okay!

338
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,240
(That's how Daniel is left alone.)

339
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,110
(Yes! He's on my team!)

340
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,310
(Shouting)

341
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,110
(Simple-minded)

342
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,410
- She's our queen bee.
- Good.

343
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,050
- Our queen bee.
- Queen bee.

344
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,820
- We will win.
- Okay.

345
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,780
- This is a good combination.
- I'll laugh when I feel like crying

346
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,590
- Okay.
- Nice. We will win.

347
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,120
- Our team is too weak.
- No.

348
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,460
We're not weak.

349
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,090
- He has power.
- Right.

350
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,730
- Power? Did you say power?
- Power.

351
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,490
- Power.
- Do I have power?

352
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,700
- Good.
- Okay.

353
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,760
There will be quizzes.

354
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,530
You will now pick your first card.

355
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,400
We have 15 cards here.

356
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,870
Each team will pick two cards...

357
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,710
that you think
were first started in Incheon...

358
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,310
- Two cards each.
- and decide...

359
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,110
- who will hold the cards.
- Two cards each?

360
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,880
So there are real ones
and fake ones, right?

361
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,420
I want to have Pumbaa.

362
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,950
(Ssaebssaeb's choice is Pumbaa.)

363
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,150
- Pumbaa belongs to me.
- I...

364
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,150
- like the arcade.
- Two cards per team.

365
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,460
- The thing that was first started.
- What should we pick?

366
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,020
I know a lot
about the history of soccer.

367
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,730
I have no idea.

368
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,930
Jjajangmyeon is not here.

369
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,130
Who should pick first?

370
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,530
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

371
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,760
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Who will play?

372
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,700
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- The three women.

373
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,270
- Win.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

374
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,470
- Good job.
- It's okay.

375
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,970
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- It's okay.

376
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,010
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

377
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,210
- Yes!
- Ye Eun!

378
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,240
- Okay!
- Things are going well today.

379
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,110
(Team Ye Eun picks 2 cards 1st.)

380
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,250
Pick the Cider card.

381
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,350
(Cider:
The first Cider factory in Korea)

382
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,780
(Jong Kook is sure about Cider.)

383
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,250
"Even if Cider is floating
in the sea off Incheon."

384
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,950
(She trusts Jong Kook
and picks Cider.)

385
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,160
This is it.

386
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,520
(Where exactly
did Cider first start?)

387
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,120
Okay. For now.

388
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,930
Star Cider,
the first Cider in Korea.

389
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,460
In 1905,

390
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,430
it was born in Incheon.

391
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,300
- You didn't know that, did you?
- I think this is it.

392
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,900
- No one would know. I saw this.
- Really?

393
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,510
You're the best.

394
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,240
- But I'm not sure about the rest.
- Go ahead.

395
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,610
- I don't know the rest.
- There are two.

396
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,610
- I think it's the arcade.
- Really?

397
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,610
Should we pick two cards?

398
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,650
- One more.
- Yes. You picked two,
so the next team will go.

399
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,120
- We're done.
- Two? Is that it?

400
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,690
- I see.
- Do you think this is it?

401
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,390
- You go 1st.
- We go 1st?

402
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,820
- What about Daebul Hotel?
- Okay.

403
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,190
This makes no sense.
So it must be correct.

404
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,390
Is Daebul Hotel the first
Western-style hotel in Korea?

405
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,500
- I think it is.
- Hang on.

406
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,430
The first Western-style hotel
in Korea was Daebul Hotel.

407
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,200
It is said to be a luxury hotel
that was for Westerners,

408
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,970
who entered the country
through the port.

409
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,640
(Seok Sam's was right
after 15 years!)

410
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,640
Because I think... It's the first...

411
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,440
Is Daebul Hotel the first
Western-style hotel in Korea?

412
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,780
I think it is.

413
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,650
Hang on. A privately owned
publishing company.

414
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,680
Yanghwajeom.

415
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,280
- This sounds plausible.
- They are picking it.

416
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,620
(The name sounds plausible.)

417
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,720
(Detective Jee thinks it's fake
because it sounds too plausible.)

418
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,360
I have this feeling.
It must be this or this.

419
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,660
- I'll pick this.
- I think it's okay.

420
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,590
- I also think this is...
- I know, right?

421
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,160
(He trusts Seok Sam's words
and picks the real card.)

422
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,760
- This one or...
- It's not bad.

423
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,030
- This one is a little...
- OB-GYN Clinic?

424
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,440
This is a little... Or...

425
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,440
Should we pick this?

426
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,470
(Now his guts say
it's Chemulpo Club.)

427
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,770
Korea's first
social club for foreigners.

428
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,280
This is good too.

429
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,310
I heard the word "club" a lot.

430
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,310
It's like a social club.

431
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,820
- Club?
- Club.

432
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,520
- Club.
- Club.

433
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,690
- That's what it is.
- Kurabu is...

434
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,720
- the Japanese word for "club."
- That's how they pronounced it.

435
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,990
- It's a club.
- I see.

436
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,320
- Should we go with that?
- Should we pick this?

437
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,890
- Yes.
- It's not bad.

438
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,930
It's our turn, right?

439
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,830
She said earlier...

440
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,470
that Incheon accepted
Western civilization.

441
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,900
One of the gold cards...

442
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,230
has Korea's first
Western-style shoe store.

443
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,340
A shoe store?

444
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,940
- That's the only Western thing.
- It's Yanghwajeom.

445
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,370
- Shall we pick it?
- Pick one card.

446
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,510
(Yanghwajeom is the only gold card
that says "Western" on it.)

447
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,440
- Bronze has three real cards.
- Yes.

448
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,880
So it has the highest probability.
Gold has only one real card.

449
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,980
So we should pick 1 gold card...

450
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,180
- and 1 bronze card.
- Ah Young.

451
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,620
Pick one.

452
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,150
- You've already made up your mind.
- Pumbaa?

453
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,690
- Pumbaa. Thank you.
- Pumbaa.

454
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,260
- Next.
- I like Pumbaa.

455
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,520
- Pick 1 more.
- Pick 1 more.

456
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,690
Perfect.

457
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,190
- At the club...
- We should find it.

458
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,030
Each team will reveal
the cards they picked.

459
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,700
You also have to decide
who will hold on to the cards.

460
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,200
There will be a next one.
You two can keep them.

461
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,340
Club.

462
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,800
(The two teams distributed the cards
by playing rock-paper-scissors.)

463
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,570
We played rock-paper-scissors,
and the winners got the cards.

464
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,740
(Ye Eun: Royal Arcade,
Jong Kook: Cider)

465
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,380
Is there a card you want?

466
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,510
Let Ah Young have one.

467
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,510
- Let Ah Young have one.
- Actually...

468
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,910
Do you want to have them both?

469
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,520
No, you should have one.

470
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,680
This is an individual game.

471
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,450
- Do you want to have this?
- Are you serious?

472
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,220
- Yes. I don't mind.
- You might lose the card.

473
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,160
- Then let's play Sky and Earth.
- Okay.

474
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,460
The two people who play
the same thing...

475
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,590
- will keep the cards.
- Okay.

476
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,460
Sky and Earth

477
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,260
(He showed
the back of his hand alone.)

478
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,400
- Can I have the card?
- Yes.

479
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,160
(Sullen)

480
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,330
What do you want?

481
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,870
- You can keep Pumbaa.
- What's with your face?

482
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,000
Do you want this card?

483
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,270
- No.
- No.

484
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,470
Daniel, this is...

485
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,870
- You two really hit it off.
- No, Daniel...

486
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,140
Do you want this?

487
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,040
- This isn't a lovers' quarrel.
- You two really hit it off.

488
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,540
- This isn't a lovers' quarrel.
- Hang on.

489
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,310
- Can I move to another team?
- Why?

490
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,150
- Wait. You two click well.
- When two of us...

491
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,280
- hit it off,
- He...

492
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,820
the other gets sullen.

493
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,020
One is sullen
when the other two hit it off.

494
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,190
- I mean,
- You are enjoying it.

495
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,050
- this is just a game.
- It's a game.

496
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,690
- Hang on.
- Ah Young is really...

497
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,290
- good at handling them.
- Right.

498
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,560
- Anyway, we're a team.
- We're a team.

499
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,130
- This is huge.
- The ceiling is so high.

500
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,870
- It's so cool and nice.
- It's really cool.

501
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,130
Kids will love this place.

502
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,870
(The swimming pool beats the heat
at the start of the summer.)

503
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,000
Patbingsu?

504
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,810
This is mango bingsu.

505
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,610
(Fruit bingsu stops
the summer heat from coming.)

506
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,040
- Is it bingsu?
- Jong Kook.

507
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,540
The blueberry bingsu is crazy.

508
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,950
- My gosh.
- Can we eat this?

509
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,780
- This is mango bingsu,
- It's amazing.

510
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,780
- What's this?
- Gosh, what's all this?

511
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,290
- It looks delicious.
- It's mango bingsu.

512
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,060
A sunny day where it rains

513
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,990
- Bingsu
- Ah Young.

514
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,490
- Yes?
- Come here, Ji Hyo.

515
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,860
- Okay.
- Hurry. We have bingsu here.

516
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,560
- Bingsu!
- Yes!

517
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,160
- Thank you.
- Bingsu.

518
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,560
- Bingsu.
- Thank you.

519
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,170
I like mango bingsu.

520
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,600
Come here. We have it here.

521
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,270
- Can I add the puree?
- Go ahead.

522
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,110
- What's that?
- Puree.

523
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,640
Puree.

524
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,180
Gosh, Ye Eun!

525
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,180
We don't add that much puree
at our age.

526
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,450
That's too much.

527
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,310
I like condensed milk.

528
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,520
- Let's add some condensed milk.
- Condensed milk.

529
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,620
- Gosh, look at this.
- Good.

530
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,950
(They care more about the taste
than their blood sugar level.)

531
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,090
Okay.

532
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,160
- Let's eat.
- Enjoy.

533
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,390
- Okay.
- Let's eat.

534
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,260
- Gosh, this is...
- Mango bingsu.

535
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,490
Mango bingsu is my favorite.

536
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,900
- It looks good.
- It's better with condensed milk.

537
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,600
This is like milk bingsu.

538
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,000
Thank you for the food.

539
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,540
- Thank you.
- Mango bingsu is my favorite.

540
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,600
They have mango bingsu,
and we have blueberry bingsu.

541
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,540
- Blueberry is good.
- I like blueberries.

542
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,210
- Did you add condensed milk?
- I did.

543
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,410
(Ah Young with fruit-like charms
loves blueberries.)

544
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,810
This is so good.

545
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,310
It's delicious.

546
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,380
(It's so cool
that it makes you a little dazed.)

547
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,820
- This is good.
- What is this?

548
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,920
- Ice cream?
- Yes, ice cream.

549
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,150
What is this thing
that looks like a lettuce leaf?

550
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,290
The leaf-like thing.
- Seok Jin.
- What is this?

551
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,990
- The blueberry bingsu is insane.
- Basil?

552
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,090
- I bet it's for decoration.
- For decoration?

553
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,830
- Mint.
- I see. Mint.

554
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,630
Gosh, you guys...

555
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,630
never leave Ah Young alone.

556
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,700
- We're on the same team.
- We're a team.

557
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,140
- We're a team.
- We're a team, Haha.

558
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,700
- We're a team.
- We're on the same team.

559
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,000
- That's not why.
- Daniel.

560
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,740
- You're obsessed with Ah Young.
- We're a team, Jae Seok.

561
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,240
We're on the same team.

562
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,410
They are like her shadow.

563
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,380
(They stay within a 1m radius
like her bodyguards.)

564
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,450
I guess we will walk on it.

565
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,450
They will spread them.

566
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,720
- How are we going to do that?
- We've come to a swimming pool...

567
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,620
to welcome the upcoming summer.

568
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,060
- Right.
- Here's the first game.

569
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,130
It's the Relay Waterbomb.

570
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,400
- What's that?
- Waterbomb!

571
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,760
One member from each team...

572
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,930
will wait at the starting line.

573
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,140
After hearing the intro of a song,

574
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,240
they will run to the float
and take the mic on it.

575
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,080
You win by correctly naming
the artist and the song.

576
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,580
The song and the artist?

577
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,580
Okay, got it.

578
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,610
- Guys, it's a team game.
- I don't know a lot of songs.

579
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,020
You will win two points
for each correct answer.

580
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,150
- Two points?
- If you do a good job...

581
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,560
- singing the song or dancing to it,
- You're good at dancing, right?

582
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,120
- you will win an additional point.
- Okay!

583
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,220
- I was built for this.
- Okay.

584
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,230
- The team with the highest score...
- Good.

585
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,130
- will get a chance...
- Who'll go first?

586
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,330
to choose another card
or swap what they have.

587
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,830
- So aim for the highest score.
- We've got this.

588
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,870
- We can...
- Okay!

589
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,270
We're at a huge disadvantage.

590
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,110
You should play songs
from the 70s and 80s for them.

591
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,540
- Only I know the latest songs.
- Hold on.

592
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,540
- Can you give us some oldies?
- Play some oldies for us.

593
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,010
Please choose a member
on your team...

594
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,250
who'll compete first.

595
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,820
- Do you want to go first?
- Please stand at the starting line.

596
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,420
- Ah Young, you go first.
- Me?

597
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,190
- You're the lady of the hour.
- We'll have Ye Eun compete, then.

598
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,620
- Should it be me, then?
- Good luck.

599
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,120
Ji Ye Eun, get out here!

600
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,390
Ye Eun?

601
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,590
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo, go ahead.

602
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,760
- Ji Hyo should compete.
- Is that so?

603
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
Ji Hyo!

604
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,530
You'll win this for sure.

605
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,000
- Kim Ah Young!
- Ji Hyo.

606
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,300
- Don't go easy on them.
- I'll try my best.

607
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,970
It's like Ji Hyo is
on "Let's Go! Dream Team."

608
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,910
- We need to stand close together.
- "Let's Go! Dream Team."

609
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,610
- Ye Eun...
- Splash some water on yourself.

610
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,640
Yes, do that.

611
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,380
Shouldn't I have done this?

612
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,380
(Splashing some water on herself)

613
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,080
- What if I get the cramps?
- We should stretch.

614
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,480
- I could get the cramps.
- I know.

615
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,850
When did Ji Hyo become
the drunken master?

616
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,590
If you're ready,

617
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,820
- we'll play the song.
- Sure.

618
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,060
Get ready.

619
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,860
(Wait, this song...)

620
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,900
Run!

621
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,670
(The song she danced to
while sacrificing her joints)

622
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,870
("Love Dive" by IVE)

623
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,570
- She should run.
- What on earth?

624
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,610
(Ji Hyo hesitates,
and Ah Young makes a run for it.)

625
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,980
How can you not know this?

626
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,750
- Do you know the song?
- Hey.

627
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,380
- Go, Ah Young!
- You're doing great.

628
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,780
- Look at that.
- Go, Ah Young!

629
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,050
(She runs with a lot of energy.)

630
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,160
(However, her legs give out,
and she takes a dive.)

631
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,360
But you were almost there.

632
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,530
(Screaming)

633
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,700
Ye Eun.

634
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,130
(Just then,
the pterosaur takes the lead.)

635
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,330
- Ye Eun.
- No!

636
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,140
- Ye Eun, over here.
- Okay.

637
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,400
To the float.

638
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,570
- Ye Eun.
- Catch up to her. Ye Eun, get up.

639
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,070
(Will Ah Young climb up,
or will Ye Eun beat her to it?)

640
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,210
Ye Eun, get up.

641
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,040
- Okay.
- "Love Dive."

642
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Ye Eun, get up.

643
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,550
(Power over speed)

644
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,680
(Ji Hyo defends the mic
by pushing her down.)

645
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
The artist.

646
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,450
- Ye Eun!
- "Love Dive" by IVE.

647
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,950
Okay!

648
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,290
Ah Young, seriously?

649
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,620
(The song is played.)

650
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,430
That's great.

651
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,230
- We got it right.
- Ah Young.

652
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,930
- Ah Young.
- Ah Young!

653
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,830
(Right up his street)

654
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,270
(The younger sister
can't dance smoothly,)

655
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,470
(and the older sister
forgot the moves.)

656
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,600
To me

657
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,640
- That's good.
- You're doing great.

658
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,710
(Flailing until the very end)

659
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,070
Good job!

660
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,810
- You did great.
- Ah Young, that was funny.

661
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,940
- That was pure comedy.
- What do I do?

662
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,810
- Ah Young, that was funny.
- You did great.

663
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,750
- You were almost there.
- She fell out of nowhere.

664
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,450
- That was funny.
- Ji Hyo got it right.

665
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,620
- Nice!
- Did Ji Hyo get it?

666
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,820
- No one scored with their dancing.
- I thought Ye Eun had won.

667
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,490
I couldn't tell which song it was.

668
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,990
- I can't believe it.
- I just couldn't tell.

669
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,590
She performed to that song.

670
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,760
At our concert.

671
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,730
- How did you know the song?
- That's the only one I know.

672
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,900
- That was funny.
- It was funny...
how she pushed Ye Eun down.

673
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,470
Ji Hyo's strong.

674
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,600
- She's really strong.
- Yes, she's strong.

675
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Ji Hyo's strong.

676
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,900
- She's as strong as any guy.
- Let's go.

677
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,110
(Power Ji Hyo is in the lead.)

678
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,270
Are you ready?

679
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,310
(The second song)

680
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,610
Play music!

681
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,850
Give me the answer.

682
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,610
(Ding-dong)

683
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,820
- Run!
- Just head over there.

684
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,880
- Hey!
- I know what it is.

685
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,890
- What's that?
- Run!

686
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,350
- Just head over there.
- What's that?

687
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,820
Run!

688
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,490
(The song that the three don't know)

689
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,660
What's this song?

690
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,230
- Run!
- Isn't it "Apartment?"

691
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,230
- It is.
- Right?

692
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,760
- Just run.
- "Apartment" by Yoon Soo Il.

693
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,500
(Beginning with the ringing
of the door bell)

694
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,140
("Apartment" by Yoon Soo Il)

695
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,170
- Isn't it "Apartment?"
- Just run.

696
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,210
"Apartment" by Yoon Soo Il.

697
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,710
- Ding-dong.
- What's that?

698
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,910
What is someone ringing?

699
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,510
- What is this?
- We would've easily known this.

700
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,280
- Just run. Ji Hyo, run.
- Run!

701
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,150
(Ji Hyo starts running
as soon as she hears the melody.)

702
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,920
- Run!
- Ji Hyo, run.

703
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,020
(Screaming)

704
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,520
Ah Young, you should run
along the path.

705
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,820
No!

706
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,360
(Engaging in a petty struggle)

707
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,360
Ye Eun, you...

708
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,400
- Look at Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo's incredible.

709
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,630
(Meanwhile, progamer Song
makes a run for it.)

710
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,900
Nice. Look at Ji Hyo.

711
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,270
- Ji Hyo's incredible.
- Go, Ji Hyo!

712
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,640
You know the song, right?
It's what you think.

713
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,470
- You know the song.
- "Southbound Train" by Nam Jin.

714
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,040
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

715
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,750
(Besides, "Southbound Train"
is by Kim Soo Hee.)

716
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,250
- What's with her?
- Go back.

717
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,410
- What is she doing?
- Get in the water.

718
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,280
- What was that?
- Walk back in the water.

719
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,450
(After getting it wrong,
you must get in the water to try again.)

720
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,250
Isn't it
"Southbound Train" by Nam Jin?

721
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,820
- Ah Young!
- Ah Young, you know it, right?

722
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,820
Hold on.

723
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,190
Ye Eun! Stop it.

724
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,630
(In a rough battle of their own)

725
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,660
No.

726
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,000
- Push her. Kick her away.
- Wait.

727
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,400
- You...
- Let's get up together.

728
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,870
I know the song.

729
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
- Push her in the water, Ah Young.
- Behind you.

730
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,470
- Behind you. Watch out.
- Behind you!

731
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,640
Make it back while they struggle.
That's it.

732
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,910
This will be a scene to watch.

733
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,380
(The strong lady runs on water.)

734
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,210
- That's it.
- You can overcome this.

735
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,880
(Like pulling out weeds)

736
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,220
No way.

737
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,150
(After removing dead wood,)

738
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,060
(she charges toward the mic.)

739
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,160
What on earth?

740
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,130
- What's the answer?
- Seriously?

741
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,290
What was that?

742
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,000
- What's the song?
- Hey!

743
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,400
- What's the answer?
- Why don't you know this song?

744
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,670
"Apartment."

745
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,300
- Name the artist.
- Whose song is it?

746
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,340
- Na Hoon A.
- Seriously?

747
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,840
Again. Make the run again.

748
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
- Who...
- Shoot.

749
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,710
Make the run again.
Start at the beginning.

750
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,920
How can she not know this?

751
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,820
- How could she...
- They won't know either.

752
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,690
- It's easy for us,
- She doesn't know?

753
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,750
but they might not know this.

754
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,720
- Hey. You see him a lot...
- The singer...

755
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,390
- on social media these days.
- It's a famous song.

756
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,390
Ye Eun, grab the mic
and give us your answer.

757
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,460
Recently, on a music show...

758
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,760
"Last Night Story" by Sobangcha?

759
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,130
(Incorrect)

760
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,130
- What the...
- The artist.

761
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,000
- Oh, no.
- Water went up her nose.

762
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,770
(Water went up Ye Eun's nose.)

763
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,770
- Water went up her nose.
- It's like she's about to cry.

764
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,980
Hey, stop drinking the water!

765
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,180
(Preserving her image
by covering it with cheese)

766
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,380
Jang Beom June.

767
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,650
(Meanwhile, she gets it wrong
by saying Jang Beom June.)

768
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,780
It was hilarious
to see water go up her nose.

769
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,950
- Under the stars...
- She doesn't know the singer?

770
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,420
- How can Ji Hyo not know this?
- Doesn't she know this?

771
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,050
The staff should give them a clue.

772
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,720
- Go.
- It's a clue about the artist.

773
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,020
- The song is "Apartment."
- Right.

774
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,290
The artist is...

775
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,660
- something Il.
- Get up there.

776
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
- Something Il.
- Get up there.

777
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,730
- Go up there.
- I know who it is.

778
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,570
I can't get up here.

779
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,900
Ji Hyo!

780
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,810
There you go.

781
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,310
- Yes, push her.
- Ji Hyo...

782
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,110
(She pushes Ye Eun
and gets her chance to answer.)

783
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,780
"Apartment" by Kim Jung Il.

784
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,910
- What?
- "Apartment" by Kim Jung Il.

785
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,220
(Who?)

786
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,320
- I know the artist.
- Kim Jung Il?

787
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,250
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on!

788
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,790
No, please. Give me a chance.

789
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,820
- Please.
- Give Ye Eun a chance.

790
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,620
- Give me a chance.
- Ah Young, say what comes to mind.

791
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,790
- Go ahead.
- Say it.

792
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,830
"Apartment" by Yoon Soo Il.

793
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,990
(Correct)

794
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,300
- Say it.
- "Apartment" by Yoon Soo Il.

795
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,560
(Yes!)

796
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,930
How did you know? How?

797
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,370
(The hunchback
actually knew the correct answer!)

798
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,070
- How did you know this?
- How did she know this?

799
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,870
(What a bummer.)

800
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,310
What do I do?

801
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,350
(Bouncing)

802
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,610
(Right, you get points for dancing.)

803
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,480
(Hustle!)

804
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,650
(The old men in the neighborhood
get up on their feet too.)

805
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,420
- Hustle!
- Hustle!

806
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,860
(The younger sisters' legs
have given out.)

807
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,290
(A bit too late)

808
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,400
You can dance for points.

809
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,930
(They're just three drunk ladies.)

810
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,770
You know...

811
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,170
No one scored points for dancing,

812
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,170
but Ye Eun wins points
for getting the right answer.

813
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,040
Okay!

814
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,740
How did you know it was Yoon Soo Il?

815
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,110
I sang the song, remember?

816
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,640
- Right, Yoon Soo Il.
- Yes, of course.

817
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,780
- For the entertainment awards.
- With Jae Hoon, right?

818
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,380
You'll swap players.

819
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,650
Please swap players.

820
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,920
- Who will it be?
- Is it you?

821
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,050
- Go ahead.
- Who will it be?

822
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,690
- Go with those who know songs.
- You two?

823
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,720
- Those who know songs.
- Hold on.

824
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,060
- I should compete with them.
- Right.

825
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,660
I don't know a lot of songs.

826
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,930
- We don't know a lot of songs.
- It should be me.

827
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,600
I can't believe
I'm part of this group.

828
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,600
Am I supposed to play among them?

829
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,700
- We won't scuffle a lot.
- Exactly.

830
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,140
- We need to know the song...
- Exactly, we need to know the song.

831
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,670
- for there to be a scuffle.
- Right.

832
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,170
I'm not wearing any underpants.

833
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,640
- I have mine on.
- I'm bad with song titles, though.

834
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,940
- I'm not wearing any underpants.
- Got it.

835
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,240
- Don't try to take my pants off.
- Sure.

836
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,180
- My leggings are see-through.
- Shoot.

837
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,350
You never know what'll happen.

838
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,080
- Ah Young, here.
- It's scary. Gosh, thank you.

839
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,550
Are you kidding me?
Daniel got Ah Young a towel.

840
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,620
- Stop flirting with her.
- Go, Se Chan.

841
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,860
Don't flirt with her...

842
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,090
- when Se Chan's not around.
- Don't flirt with her.

843
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,130
But we're teammates,

844
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,630
- and she's wet.
- I can't believe you.

845
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,160
- Thanks.
- Here's your song.

846
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,600
(Play, music.)

847
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,840
Please play the song.

848
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,840
(The song plays.)

849
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,740
- This!
- What's the song?

850
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,240
I know this song!

851
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,880
It's that song.

852
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,950
- "Home Sweet Home."
- What?

853
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,280
"Home Sweet Home."

854
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,480
- I knew it.
- Really?

855
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,820
BigBang, G-DRAGON.

856
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,850
- Really?
- They'll overpower him.

857
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,650
"Home Sweet Home" by BigBang.

858
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,220
- I know.
- Grab him. Grab Jae Seok.

859
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,020
- Grab him.
- Get out of my way.

860
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,260
- Wait. Hold on.
- Just a second.

861
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,760
Hold on a second. Grab him.

862
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,130
- Wait.
- They'll overpower him.

863
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,500
(Just then)

864
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,070
This is an easy one!

865
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,500
- Go, Se Chan!
- Out of my way.

866
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,270
Out of my way.

867
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,310
(The locust makes a run for it
while Short Kid falls.)

868
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,840
- Go, Se Chan!
- Haha, come on!

869
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,410
(Jae Seok finds his opportunity.)

870
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,580
G-DRAGON...

871
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,520
(Ssaebssaeb activates
an advanced technique.)

872
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,750
- Nicely done!
- "Home Sweet Home" by G-DRAGON.

873
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,890
Yes!

874
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,120
(Se Chan is correct.)

875
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,720
(Waddling over)

876
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,660
- What's the song?
- Dance at least.

877
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,730
- Dance, fool!
- "Home Sweet Home."

878
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,200
- He covered my mouth!
- Dance!

879
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,470
It's too late!

880
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,600
(They ignore his personal plight
and start the show.)

881
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,840
Try harder, fool!

882
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,870
- Dance!
- Hey!

883
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
This is it.

884
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,840
- Now's the time.
- I'm scared.

885
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,480
Home sweet home

886
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,550
(The fake G-DRAGON's hop about.)

887
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,210
- Come one!
- You're doing it!

888
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,450
(An angry man storms the stage.)

889
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,290
(They go from dancing
to spinning in a circle.)

890
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,730
(Clenching)

891
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,660
(What?)

892
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,970
He's pulling down the shorts!

893
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
(Pop!)

894
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,370
He's practically naked.

895
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,100
It has begun!

896
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,740
There's no reason for this.

897
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,880
He's practically naked.

898
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,980
What about his underwear?

899
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,050
- We agreed not to do this!
- Why did you do that?

900
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,650
I said I wasn't wearing underwear.

901
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,180
- Right now...
- Come on!

902
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,920
- We agreed not to do this.
- Are you okay?

903
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,490
We agreed not to do this!

904
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,790
He isn't wearing underwear!

905
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,890
I'm sorry.

906
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,760
I'm 48 years old!

907
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
I'm a dad of three!

908
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,560
We promised over there!

909
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,770
(Mr. No Panties is furious.)

910
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,740
What did you say
when I said I had no underwear?

911
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,100
"Mine are see-through."

912
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,210
Why couldn't you hold back?

913
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,580
Oh, dear.

914
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,850
(Dream, So Wool, and Song,
don't watch this episode.)

915
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,350
Oh, dear. This is so funny.

916
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,190
- I forgot you had no underwear.
- He got carried away.

917
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,320
I have a PTA meeting next week!

918
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,720
(He has a big event
right after this episode will air.)

919
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,200
Doesn't Dream get upset to know
what his dad does to earn money?

920
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,660
I'm sorry, Go Eun.

921
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,960
(He apologizes to Haha's wife.)

922
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,100
I'm sorry. But he covered my mouth.

923
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,100
- Let it go!
- He was too late.

924
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,970
- I was going to answer right away.
- Give us dance points.

925
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,670
- Give us a point for the bottom.
- Give us a point.

926
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,680
Haha, we'll give you
a point for dancing.

927
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,610
- Okay!
- Yes!

928
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,980
- Let's swap players.
- How do they know so well?

929
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,580
This is the final round.

930
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,020
- We'll decide the winner.
- Go.

931
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,550
- Daniel, let's go.
- Go for it!

932
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,590
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

933
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,690
- Go for it.
- Hey, guys!

934
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,290
Jae Seok! Why did you put me here?

935
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,290
- You're the only one left.
- He doesn't know any songs.

936
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,300
- He doesn't know the songs.
- You can do it!

937
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,970
Avoid the edge. Go down the middle.

938
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,970
- Okay.
- You fall right in at the edge.

939
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,840
- We'll give you a recent song.
- You need to know the song.

940
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,070
A new song.

941
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,510
- Play...
- A new song?

942
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,610
- You should've given me that.
- A new song?

943
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,840
Play the song.

944
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,180
(Buzzing)

945
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,950
Let's go.

946
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,120
(Hey!)

947
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,980
- What's this?
- What is this?

948
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,120
(What song made Haha's eyes widen?)

949
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,990
(Haha's new song "Sunny Day")

950
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,000
(They heard this song
just 1 hour ago.)

951
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,770
(Old Jee even sang
part of the song.)

952
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,300
(Buzzing)

953
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,970
- What's this?
- What is this?

954
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,210
(Old Jee caught on.)

955
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,740
He knows some songs.

956
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,810
Hey!

957
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,910
My gosh.

958
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,380
(The old man speeds ahead alone.)

959
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,120
- Do you know it?
- I have no idea.

960
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
(Just then)

961
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,550
(Jong Kook joins in.)

962
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,350
Jong Kook's stopping him.

963
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,960
He's catching up.

964
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,760
- He's catching up.
- Seok Jin!

965
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,560
(Seok Sam landed
as if he were escaping.)

966
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,960
Keep going!

967
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,100
It's Haha's...

968
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,200
(Will he answer correctly
in the shortest time?)

969
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,470
(Hesitating)

970
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,610
- "Sharala Day?"
- Darn you!

971
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,570
(He forgot the title!)

972
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,880
- What on earth?
- What did you say?

973
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,040
- Haha?
- Jong Kook!

974
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,580
- What is it?
- Move.

975
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,110
- Haha?
- Jong Kook!

976
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,780
- I got it.
- What is it?

977
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,380
- Do you know?
- I don't.

978
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,020
- Jong Kook!
- Let me answer!

979
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,450
- It's black.
- Jump in.

980
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,290
- Get in the water first.
- Get in.

981
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,020
You have to climb back up
if you're wrong.

982
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,890
- You have to come back.
- It's Haha's song?

983
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,860
Why don't you know it?
You don't know?

984
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,630
- What is it?
- You don't know?

985
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,460
- What is it?
- Isn't it DAY6?

986
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,970
(Heartbroken)

987
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,730
- No?
- You don't know?

988
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,070
- I don't know.
- What is it?

989
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,040
- We sang it today.
- Oh, "Sunny Day."

990
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,710
- It's "Sunny Day."
- Oh, I see.

991
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,940
I'm back!

992
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,380
(Yelling)

993
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,980
Haha's "Small..."

994
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,710
(Wrong)

995
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,150
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

996
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,180
I got it. Haha's "Sunny Day."

997
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,020
- Darn it!
- I see.

998
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,690
(Complaining)

999
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,860
Oh, come on!

1000
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,820
- I sang it today!
- This is nonsense!

1001
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,890
This is unfair.

1002
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,030
We sang it today!

1003
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,190
You must have...

1004
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,700
- He'd know it.
- Nino, Maximus...

1005
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,460
(Nino, Maximus, Keyser Soze)

1006
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,400
(They're singing
another of Haha's songs.)

1007
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,370
I won't die

1008
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,870
(Suspected of copying his own song)

1009
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,140
- Keyser Soze
- Don't do that.

1010
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,280
- Sonador, and Sparta
- I won't die

1011
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,810
- I won't die
- That was hard!

1012
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,380
It's hard. I liked that one.

1013
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,080
- The song is too new!
- It's great!

1014
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,490
- How would we know it?
- Just how?

1015
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,750
- No one would know!
- It's a new song.

1016
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,320
Haha's "Sunny Day."

1017
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,260
We'll give you one last chance.

1018
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,290
Daniel, start running
as soon as you hear the music.

1019
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,090
Think on the way.

1020
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,460
"Think on the way."

1021
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,030
It's better to fight over there.

1022
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,030
Okay!

1023
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,500
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

1024
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,470
Here comes the music.

1025
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,640
Just run!

1026
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,910
(Booming)

1027
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,440
What is this song?

1028
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,250
- Run!
- What is this song?

1029
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,920
- What song is this?
- "Like..."

1030
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,980
Kang San Eh.

1031
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,450
- I don't think so.
- It is.

1032
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,750
- It's not that.
- The salmon song.

1033
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,350
- It's not that.
- It is.

1034
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,390
(As Se Chan guessed,)

1035
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,290
(it is that song by Kang San Eh!)

1036
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,600
- Kang San Eh.
- It is.

1037
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,030
- What is this?
- Whose song is this? Do you know?

1038
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,000
- Hang on.
- Do you know it?

1039
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,440
- It's an old song!
- Yes!

1040
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,000
Hey. It's that one.

1041
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,300
Play it again!

1042
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,010
- I'm confusing the title!
- I know.

1043
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,310
- It's a really long title.
- He's not our team.

1044
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,810
- Run!
- Go, Seok Jin!

1045
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,680
(Booming)

1046
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,850
Go, Seok Jin!

1047
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,550
- The name...
- Dang, dang...

1048
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,720
(Shouting)

1049
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,190
- Run, Daniel!
- Stop him from going!

1050
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,820
I got it!

1051
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,960
(Seok Sam knows the song.)

1052
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,190
- I got it!
- Me too, but the title...

1053
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,690
- is confusing.
- I know it!

1054
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,990
(But his arms are literally tied.)

1055
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,630
- "Like Salmon Swimming Upstream."
- Yes.

1056
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:55,970
That's it, right?

1057
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,900
That's a really long title.

1058
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,240
Daniel! He doesn't know at all.

1059
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,700
You're right, he doesn't.

1060
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,410
- I know the singer.
- I know the song!

1061
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,610
Stop it!

1062
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,840
Wait.

1063
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,580
I got it! Stop playing it!

1064
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,480
Stop playing it!

1065
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,450
- Does he know?
- He's off.

1066
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,450
Does he know?

1067
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,350
(The long-legged guy
sets off first.)

1068
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,760
- Does he know?
- Go!

1069
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,760
Go. Slow down.

1070
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,790
Does he know?

1071
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,790
(Seok Sam's the last.)

1072
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,560
Wait where you are.

1073
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
(Yelling)

1074
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,000
(He fell in.)

1075
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,700
(Daniel has a great opportunity.)

1076
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,700
Let me answer.

1077
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,900
Seo Taiji and Boys.

1078
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,210
- What's wrong with him?
- What?

1079
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,510
What is it? I have no idea.

1080
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,610
- Climb up from where you are.
- Seo Taiji and Boys!

1081
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,910
- Shoot.
- Get there quick.

1082
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,080
I said Seo Taiji too.

1083
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,810
- Jump in and get back up.
- It's not Seo Taiji?

1084
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,920
- It's not Seo Taiji?
- I know!

1085
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,350
- It's not.
- What is it?

1086
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,790
Run over there! It's just the start!

1087
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,320
You have to stop him.

1088
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,990
Seok Jin.

1089
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,690
(Yelling)

1090
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,660
- Oh, dear.
- He's getting in his own way.

1091
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,960
Keep crawling!

1092
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,500
(Seok Sam's attempt
turned into boot-camp training.)

1093
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,570
- You can do this!
- Do it!

1094
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,500
Seok Jin.

1095
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,470
- Good luck.
- Move faster.

1096
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,140
Don't stop him.

1097
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,910
- Wait. What is this song?
- Who...

1098
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,550
Get to the mic first.

1099
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,010
- Get a hint.
- What is it?

1100
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,210
I know the song!

1101
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,750
Get a hint, Jong Kook.

1102
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,550
Do you think he knows?
Okay, have a go.

1103
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,350
You can do it, Seok Jin.

1104
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,390
He's fighting for survival.

1105
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,190
Listen to what he says.

1106
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,260
He's there.

1107
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,730
Kang San Eh. "Swimming Upstream..."

1108
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,770
(The tall guy caught on...)

1109
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,470
(and so did the muscly guy.)

1110
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,670
- Get up there!
- Stop it.

1111
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,940
Kang San Eh!

1112
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,110
"Like the Stream."

1113
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,510
- No!
- No!

1114
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,280
- It's longer.
- Is there salmon?

1115
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,710
Kang San Eh!

1116
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,280
- Salmon.
- "Like Salmon Going Upstream?"

1117
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,550
What is it?

1118
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,550
- No!
- What is it?

1119
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,490
- Seok Sam!
- What is it?

1120
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,090
- Get up there.
- Get back up.

1121
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,260
You're almost there.

1122
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,920
Why don't I know this?

1123
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,630
I sang it a lot at karaoke
when I was younger!

1124
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,900
"Like the Stream Going Backward?"

1125
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,300
- The stream...
- "Going backward?"

1126
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:13,040
(The title was as long
as the lyrics...)

1127
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,010
- I'll give you a hint.
- Okay.

1128
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,010
A hint!

1129
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,810
You got the first word right.

1130
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,550
And the second one too.

1131
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,810
Let me answer!

1132
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,020
Kang San Eh. "Like..."

1133
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,120
"Like the..."

1134
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,490
"Like the Salmon Swimming Upstream."

1135
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,660
Yes! No?

1136
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,190
- No.
- That's not it either?

1137
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,730
- There's another word!
- Kang San Eh.

1138
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,500
- Shoot.
- "Like the..."

1139
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,300
"Salmon Swimming..."

1140
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,830
"Upstream Like Salmon."

1141
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,300
(A random English word!)

1142
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,200
What are you doing?

1143
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,570
You need to get it!

1144
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,610
(They're almost there.)

1145
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,610
Kang San Eh.

1146
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,210
- Here's some info.
- Okay.

1147
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,750
Something comes
before the word "salmon."

1148
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,310
- Yes!
- Something comes...

1149
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,850
before the word "salmon."

1150
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,650
"Strong salmon."

1151
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,720
- "Strong."
- "Strong."

1152
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,720
"Like the..."

1153
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,930
(A word is missing.)

1154
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,090
- Is it "strong salmon?" Really?
- Yes.

1155
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,660
They'd never think of that.

1156
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,370
"Strong Salmon Swimming!"

1157
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,230
- It's not "strong."
- What?

1158
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,400
No?

1159
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,300
- It's not "strong?"
- Seok Sam.

1160
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,210
Kang San Eh, "Like the..."

1161
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,470
"Invincible..."

1162
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,980
- What is it?
- It's not "strong?"

1163
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,550
It's not "strong?" What is it?

1164
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,480
- I got it!
- It's not "strong?" What is it?

1165
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,020
- What is it?
- I'll answer. Kang San Eh.

1166
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,890
"Like the Strong Salmon..."

1167
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,190
"Swimming Upstream."

1168
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,950
- It's not that.
- It's not "strong?"

1169
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,460
(There is one more word
in front of "strong.")

1170
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,690
Gosh, this is...
If I get it wrong this time,

1171
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,160
they'll definitely get it right
after me.

1172
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,700
In front of
"Salmon Swimming Upstream,"

1173
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,200
- it's "Those!"
- "Those?"

1174
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,640
- It's "Those!"
- "Those?"

1175
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,710
"Those Salmon!"

1176
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,180
(He forgot the word "Strong!")

1177
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,410
("Like Those Strong Salmon
Swimming Upstream" by Kang San Eh)

1178
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,580
Let me answer!

1179
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,350
Kang San Eh's
"Like Those Strong Salmon..."

1180
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,250
"Swimming Upstream."

1181
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,760
(Correct)

1182
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,990
(Seok Sam got
the last question right!)

1183
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,430
- Swimming upstream
- Swimming upstream

1184
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,600
(A celebratory performance
in a good mood)

1185
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,710
- Nice!
- Hey!

1186
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,580
(Avoiding predators...)

1187
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,080
(and swimming upstream
against the tide of the pool)

1188
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,880
(The old salmon finally claims
his victory in the end.)

1189
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,290
So, Jee Seok Jin
got the correct answer.

1190
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,890
- Seok Jin's team is in first place.
- All right!

1191
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,090
(Team Ji Hyo wins the mission.)

1192
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,260
Hey, Seok Jin.

1193
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,660
You still got two questions right.

1194
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,730
- Right. It makes no sense.
- I mean...

1195
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,500
- Niel doesn't know it at all.
- Right.

1196
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,800
No way. I got two questions right.

1197
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,300
- Jong Kook's team is second.
- Okay!

1198
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,300
- And last place is Ah Young's team.
- Second place isn't bad.

1199
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,300
- Okay.
- It's fine.

1200
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,270
- It's okay. That could happen.
- Gosh, that guy...

1201
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,170
- "Strong."
- Let's forget about it.

1202
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,840
(As their rankings are decided,
it's time for a card switch.)

1203
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,780
I just found out
about that title today.

1204
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,910
It was so close!

1205
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,880
If the card you have doesn't seem
like the first in Incheon,

1206
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,850
- you may switch cards.
- Let's switch.

1207
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,450
The team that won this mission
has a chance to switch...

1208
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,890
both of you cards with cards
that the other teams have...

1209
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:23,730
or with the remaining cards.

1210
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,300
The second place team
can switch one card...

1211
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,270
with a card the third place team has
or with the remaining cards.

1212
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,030
The third place team can switch
your one card...

1213
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,270
only with the remaining cards.

1214
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,140
- You each have two cards now.
- Yes.

1215
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,340
- If you go, you can take one more,
- That sounds okay.

1216
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,940
- so you'll have three total.
- Oh, okay.

1217
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,740
- Then, you get to switch.
- Okay.

1218
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,480
You don't have to switch,
or you can if you want to.

1219
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,820
And today's penalty
also has to do with the cards.

1220
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,420
The person with a fake card
at the end...

1221
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,450
will all get the penalty.

1222
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,590
As we told you earlier, there are
four fake cards among the gold,

1223
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,260
three among the silver,
and two among the bronze.

1224
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,530
Gosh, this won't be easy.

1225
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,360
So, it'll be a strategy game
between going for...

1226
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,870
the one real gold card
or several in the bronze cards...

1227
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,570
- Okay.
- to avoid the penalty.

1228
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,970
Then,
the winning team will go first...

1229
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,270
- and pick a card.
- Let's go.

1230
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,740
- We can draw a card and see.
- Let's go.

1231
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,540
- We have to give one back, right?
- No way.

1232
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,810
(They choose a card
from the remaining ones first.)

1233
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,280
But doing this without any hints...

1234
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,890
- Shall we choose this one?
- Salt mines?

1235
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,520
- This one.
- Do you think that's right?

1236
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,720
I don't know, Seok Jin.

1237
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,790
But this one is right.

1238
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,290
- This...
- Is this right? Are you sure?

1239
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,530
It's reasonable that the nation's
first fashion show was here.

1240
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,960
This is a port city.

1241
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,970
- Then, let's take this.
- Let's take this.

1242
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,530
(They choose the fashion show card.)

1243
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,370
Then,
the Daebul Hotel seems to be right.

1244
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,640
Shall we switch
the Chemulpo Club card?

1245
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,840
The foreigners' social club?

1246
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,810
How about the shoe store?

1247
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,310
We could take out the Chemulpo Club.

1248
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,010
We should switch anyway...

1249
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,240
How about the Cider?

1250
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,550
Oh, right. Yes.

1251
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,050
(Jae Seok specifically chose
the Cider card, which is real.)

1252
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,880
- Sounds good. We'll switch this.
- Yes.

1253
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,250
We'll switch with this one.
That'll make them really annoyed.

1254
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,550
The Cider card.
We'll switch with that one.

1255
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,790
There's that chant about the Cider
on the Incheon shore.

1256
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,520
- You can switch up to two cards.
- Yes.

1257
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,060
What do you...
I don't want to switch.

1258
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,390
- The Daebul Hotel is...
- You can switch with these too.

1259
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,630
- We'll just go with this one.
- Let's go with it.

1260
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,860
But I think...

1261
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,430
No, we don't have to switch.

1262
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,830
That's right.

1263
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,170
Yes, we'll go with this.

1264
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,240
(They got 2 real cards.)

1265
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,070
- You have to take this.
- Oh, do I take this one?

1266
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,710
All right. Seok Jin...

1267
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,010
just switched with Jong Kook's card.

1268
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,280
So, you have to switch.

1269
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,410
- Which one did you take?
- Hand it to him.

1270
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,980
- There must be hints.
- Give him the Cider card.

1271
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,020
There weren't any hints.

1272
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,520
- Give us the Cider card.
- Why did you pick this one?

1273
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,420
There's a famous chant about
the Cider on the Incheon shore.

1274
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,090
- You can't drink it...
- But that's just a saying.

1275
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,560
Just take the Chemulpo Club.

1276
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,090
- Is that one real?
- Just hand it over.

1277
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,190
- Take it.
- Take the Chemulpo Club.

1278
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,460
(Sulking)

1279
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,630
- Let's take a card.
- My gosh.

1280
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,300
- I'm so angry.
- He's so full of rage.

1281
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,900
- I should win next time.
- The Cider one must be real.

1282
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,900
- It fell on the ground.
- Gosh, the Cider one is real.

1283
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,500
- The Chemulpo Club.
- What can we switch with?

1284
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,570
- Jong Kook, shall we go with...
- Honestly,

1285
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,910
I didn't know we could switch.

1286
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,370
- You should pick one first.
- That's so mean.

1287
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,910
Then, you can switch with
the third place team or these.

1288
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:56,580
- Shall we go with the Italy towels?
- Let's go with that one.

1289
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,010
- I have a good feeling about it.
- It's interesting.

1290
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,110
I have a good vibe about it.

1291
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,320
- I think I've heard this somewhere.
- This is ours.

1292
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,980
- Then, the Italy towels...
- Then, the arcade...

1293
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,550
- We can switch too?
- Let's switch with this one.

1294
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,190
- I think the arcade is wrong.
- Didn't we say we'd switch that?

1295
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,490
- We talked about it being in Busan.
- Right, it could be Busan.

1296
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,690
- With Japanese influence...
- That's right.

1297
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,090
- in that area...
- Yes, so Busan.

1298
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:14,430
- There's no way it'd come to Busan.
- We'll take this out.

1299
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,070
"The nation's first place
to import a piano."

1300
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,900
(Samunjin Ferry Dock)

1301
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,470
- A ferry dock?
- Yes, let's go with that one.

1302
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,640
We'll take this one.

1303
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,540
Okay. The Samunjin Ferry Dock.
I like this one too.

1304
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,340
- We'll choose this for Ji Ye Eun.
- Try it.

1305
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,740
- Italy towels, Samunjin Ferry Dock.
- Okay, let's try it.

1306
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,350
- Put this under my name.
- Stick it on.

1307
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:31,010
I heard
today's penalty was the worst.

1308
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,310
- Really?
- Then, should we go for the gold?

1309
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,450
- "The nation's first..."
- Then...

1310
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,280
If we go for the gold cards,
how about these two?

1311
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,090
- "The nation's first."
- If we go for the gold ones.

1312
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,350
- The shoe store isn't bad either.
- Right.

1313
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,860
- We can keep the shoe store.
- But the salt fields...

1314
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,290
- wouldn't be in Incheon, right?
- Right.

1315
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,630
Yes. Don't you think we're going to
either win big or be totally off?

1316
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,530
- Since we're in last place anyway,
- Why do you say that?

1317
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,030
should we just choose
all of the gold cards?

1318
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,130
Then, did you choose Kwanginsa?

1319
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:50,030
- No, I chose the OB-GYN clinic.
- Then, I'll go with Kwanginsa.

1320
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,970
- The OB-GYN clinic. Let's do this.
- What do you think?

1321
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,940
- If only one of us is right,
- Seriously...

1322
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,370
then do the other two
get the penalty?

1323
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,470
Anyone with a fake card
gets the penalty.

1324
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:00,310
- Everyone?
- A fake card?

1325
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,540
Only they get a prize.

1326
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,150
- In that case, let's choose again.
- Hang on.

1327
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,450
- I'll go with this.
- That won't work.

1328
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,520
(Laughing)

1329
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,720
- Gosh, they're so...
- What are they...

1330
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,050
- They're giggling away.
- My gosh.

1331
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,390
- She must be having fun.
- What is going on?

1332
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,090
- She's giggling so much.
- Those guys are...

1333
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,920
- Ah Young is...
- Is that how she normally laughs?

1334
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,420
- No!
- She doesn't, right?

1335
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,830
- How does she laugh, then?
- She laughs like this.

1336
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,160
- It's not like that, is it?
- No.

1337
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,760
- Ah Young has a firm grasp on them.
- You're right.

1338
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,830
Hey, if we don't get this right,
we'll get the penalty anyway.

1339
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,030
But the Pumba...

1340
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,030
- Do you have a feeling?
- I don't want to miss it.

1341
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,040
Then, take the Pumba card.

1342
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,100
I'll go with the OB-GYN clinic.

1343
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,400
You two can go. I can switch anyway.

1344
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,270
- All right. The OB-GYN clinic.
- Yes, I'll go with this.

1345
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,510
- We'll stick with those.
- So, you won't switch?

1346
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,810
- No, we'll just add the OB-GYN...
- Keep this.

1347
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,440
The OB-GYN clinic.

1348
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,780
Why do I keep getting
a strong pull from this one?

1349
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,180
Okay,
we're done switching cards now.

1350
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,380
Let's get changed and move...

1351
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,720
- to the next location.
- Yes.

1352
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,120
- Okay.
- Yes.

1353
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,190
- Okay!
- Let's go.

1354
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,160
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

1355
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,390
For lunch today,

1356
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,090
we'll have a dish...

1357
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:53,060
that was first developed in Incheon
in the early 1970s. It's jjolmyeon.

1358
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,230
- Jjolmyeon!
- Jjolmyeon!

1359
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,230
- I had jjolmyeon yesterday!
- The early 1970s?

1360
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,800
- I'm hungry.
- Was jjolmyeon first made here?

1361
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,970
- Yes.
- Is that so?

1362
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:01,040
An employee at a noodle factory
made a mistake...

1363
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,110
- while making naengmyeon.
- A mistake?

1364
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:05,370
- So that's how it was made.
- Yes, they made thicker noodles.

1365
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,180
And that was how jjolmyeon was born.

1366
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,880
- Indeed.
- I used to have jjolmyeon...

1367
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,050
- Art comes from mistakes.
- so much as a kid.

1368
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,850
- So, the winning team...
- Mistakes are art, jjolmyeon.

1369
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,650
will get
the sour and spicy jjolmyeon...

1370
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:17,990
- and pork cutlet as well.
- Yes!

1371
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,890
- The second place team...
- I love pork cutlet.

1372
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,990
- only gets two bowls of jjolmyeon.
- That's okay.

1373
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,430
- What about for last place?
- We really can't get last place.

1374
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,990
They'll get rice
and pickled radishes.

1375
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,830
- We can't get last place for this.
- This is...

1376
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:30,230
Let's win this one. I must win.
This won't do.

1377
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,000
- Seriously.
- We have to.

1378
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,270
- That sounds so delicious.
- So,

1379
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:36,940
the mission with lunch and a benefit
of switching cards on the line...

1380
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,070
- is Speak in Interruption Mode.
- Interruption?

1381
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,980
One team member explains
the keyword with their body.

1382
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,980
The other two will take turns
to guess the word correctly.

1383
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,380
Then, one representative member
from the other teams...

1384
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,690
will hold ropes tied to either arm
of the person giving clues...

1385
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,060
and bother their attempts
to explain the keyword.

1386
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,160
The team that guesses
the most words correctly...

1387
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,730
in three minutes
will decide your rankings.

1388
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,260
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1389
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,700
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1390
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,560
If you don't play, you lose.
Rock-paper-scissors.

1391
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:04,670
Okay!

1392
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:05,800
Hey, you guys go first
since you won.

1393
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,640
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1394
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:08,770
Okay!

1395
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,910
Why did that happen?

1396
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:10,940
Why did you lose?

1397
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:13,480
We'll go second.

1398
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,910
- We'll go second.
- Okay, second.

1399
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,480
- We'll go last.
- Will you go last?

1400
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,610
Okay.

1401
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,480
- Who will give the clues?
- That would be...

1402
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,250
- But you have to be sensible.
- You do.

1403
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,590
- I think...
- Do you want to explain the words?

1404
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,190
- Oh, okay. I'll do it.
- You have to do it.

1405
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,060
- Because you are...
- Okay, I have the power.

1406
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,290
- You're good at explaining things.
- Yes.

1407
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,160
- I have the power.
- You're powerfully good at this.

1408
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,660
Then, Ji Hyo,

1409
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,460
- please sit at that end too.
- I have the power.

1410
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,860
- What's up with him?
- My gosh.

1411
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,060
A 60-year-old man show.

1412
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,930
- Seok Jin, don't waste your energy.
- Why, all of a sudden?

1413
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:39,370
He's so weird lately.

1414
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,570
- Why were you...
- Suddenly...

1415
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,740
He does whatever he wants to.

1416
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,110
- He's adorable.
- He's regaining his youth.

1417
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:48,580
But we can't have Seok Jin play.
He's way too strong.

1418
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,010
Seok Jin is powerful.

1419
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,850
He's been working out lately.

1420
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,120
Gosh, this much is...
You know, don't you?

1421
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:55,150
We hold this bit? The rope?

1422
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,720
Try it. Ready, set, go.

1423
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,420
Let go, you punks!

1424
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,290
That's a nice workout.

1425
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:01,720
It is a nice workout.

1426
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,360
- Also, each of you...
- Let's go!

1427
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,300
- can only pass on one question.
- Okay.

1428
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,570
- Power, you have to overcome this.
- Okay, I'll overcome it.

1429
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,530
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1430
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,270
- Power
- Okay. Ready.

1431
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,810
(The one who farted gets angry.)

1432
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,140
- I can't speak?
- You can't make any sounds.

1433
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,340
Gosh, that is...

1434
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,410
(The one who farted gets angry.)

1435
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:22,540
You can't make any noise.

1436
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,010
- What is that?
- Gosh, you're good.

1437
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,780
Gosh, you're good.

1438
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,890
- What?
- You can't make sounds.

1439
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,150
What is this?

1440
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,290
- He's so good.
- What is this?

1441
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,360
(The sad Jee-rionette)

1442
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:39,530
(Chuckling)

1443
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:41,960
(The one who farted gets angry.)

1444
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,270
(Frustrated)

1445
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,330
What is this?

1446
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,670
- Don't make any sounds.
- Is it a rocket?

1447
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,670
Farting.

1448
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,210
Farting.

1449
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:51,670
(He figured out it was farting.)

1450
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:54,010
(I'm angry!)

1451
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,010
What? What is that?

1452
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,380
- You can't make sounds.
- Don't make sounds.

1453
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,650
You're not allowed to make sounds.

1454
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,250
(The one who farted gets angry.)

1455
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,850
- What is this?
- It's over for them.

1456
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,820
A silent fart? What is it?

1457
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,020
A skunk?

1458
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,960
A skunk? What is it?

1459
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,290
Everyone knows except you!

1460
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,930
(The one who farted gets angry.)

1461
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,730
I'm just as clueless.

1462
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,900
What is it?

1463
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,070
- Moving on.
- You guys know, right?

1464
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,270
They can see what it is.

1465
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,600
(Licking the outside
of a watermelon)

1466
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,070
You can't make any sounds.

1467
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:25,710
(He wants to draw a circle,)

1468
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,040
(but he can't bring
his hands together.)

1469
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,240
What... An egg.

1470
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,680
An egg.

1471
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,850
(Licking the outside
of a watermelon)

1472
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,580
- I feel bad for him.
- An egg.

1473
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,780
(Using his tongue
instead of his hand)

1474
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,350
A gobstopper.

1475
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,490
- That's disgusting.
- What is this?

1476
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,790
Your tongue has a white coating
on it.

1477
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:42,220
A gobstopper.

1478
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,490
Your tongue has a white coating
on it.

1479
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,690
(He shows the white coating
on his tongue to eat jjolmyeon.)

1480
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:49,400
(Cut in half!)

1481
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,730
(Gobbling up)

1482
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,400
(Licking the outside
of a watermelon)

1483
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,500
(An ASMR of eating watermelon)

1484
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,810
Hey, look.

1485
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,110
I think it's a fruit.

1486
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,480
A watermelon.

1487
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:01,710
A watermelon.

1488
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,950
(She managed to figure out
that it's a watermelon!)

1489
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:05,550
He's good at describing things.

1490
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,880
(The ASMR idea worked.)

1491
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,620
- It's tasty.
- Licking watermelon. An anteater?

1492
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,990
We got it.

1493
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,320
- Licking a watermelon.
- That's right.

1494
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,220
I bet she doesn't know this saying.

1495
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,530
- She doesn't know the saying.
- Sujeonggwa... No.

1496
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,660
- She doesn't know.
- We say it all the time.

1497
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,000
- A watermelon...
- It has "watermelon" in it.

1498
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,770
- Watermelon juice.
- Are you kidding me?

1499
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:24,870
Licking a watermelon.

1500
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,270
- Yes!
- Then...

1501
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,510
- Licking a watermelon.
- That's what you already said.

1502
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:32,940
(He's about to lose it.)

1503
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,380
(Licking the outside
of a watermelon)

1504
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,140
Licking the outside of a watermelon!

1505
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,180
- Okay.
- Licking the outside...

1506
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,510
- of a watermelon!
- Okay.

1507
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:39,950
Okay, next.

1508
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:41,820
- These are proverbs.
- Here you go.

1509
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,090
Is it a proverb?

1510
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,720
(Even monkeys fall from trees.)

1511
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,250
You can't make any sounds.

1512
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,090
Even monkeys fall from trees.

1513
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,130
- Okay.
- No way!

1514
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,660
- These are proverbs.
- Grab on to it tight.

1515
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,400
You're right. I should pull harder.

1516
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,630
(The next question)

1517
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:03,540
(What was he expressing
with that ridiculous sound?)

1518
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,210
Don't make any sounds.

1519
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:06,710
Mister!

1520
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,280
You can't make any sounds.

1521
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:11,210
- He's bouncing.
- Go for it.

1522
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:12,680
(Woodpecker)

1523
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,020
(The woodpecker keeps on chirping.)

1524
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,820
(Woodpecker)

1525
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,390
- A sloth.
- It's a proverb.

1526
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,630
- A woodpecker is pecking.
- Right.

1527
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:24,660
A woodpecker.

1528
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,290
- That's correct.
- She got it.

1529
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,230
- Team Ji Hyo...
- They were almost there.

1530
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,770
- You got 3.
- They got 3 though.

1531
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,430
- At the age of 60...
- A woodpecker.

1532
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,600
It made me so sad.

1533
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,900
- Daniel, you saw him, right?
- Yes.

1534
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,970
Do you think you can do it?

1535
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:38,740
What will it be?
Who should do the motions?

1536
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,740
It's our turn.

1537
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,540
From what I can tell,

1538
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,050
there are proverbs and also words.

1539
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,080
- Exactly.
- Right.

1540
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,820
Going second gives you an advantage.

1541
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,720
- They know what to expect.
- That's right.

1542
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:51,990
The first group that plays
should be given an advantage.

1543
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,460
They'll be thinking of proverbs now.

1544
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,560
Would you like to do the motions?

1545
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,630
- Would I be able to do it?
- You're quite expressive.

1546
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,330
You did a good job
at the pork cutlet place.

1547
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:00,660
- I'll give it a try.
- Would you like to try?

1548
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,760
- Go ahead, Ah Young.
- I don't mind.

1549
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:03,870
Ah Young will do it.

1550
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:05,270
- Okay.
- Ah Young?

1551
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,800
The ladies will pull on her arms.

1552
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,700
- The ladies will pull.
- Since Ah Young will be motioning.

1553
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,770
I'm going to pull hard.

1554
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:12,210
(Sounding serious)

1555
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:13,940
Ah Young, let's get four.

1556
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,480
I won't joke around.

1557
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:18,650
Let it be straightforward
and simple.

1558
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,880
- Yes, pull from there.
- Get ready.

1559
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,150
- Hold on.
- Ah Young.

1560
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,520
- Get dancing.
- Hey.

1561
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:26,150
A monkey.

1562
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:27,490
Is it a monkey? Is it a proverb?

1563
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,190
(Gorilla)

1564
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,090
Even a monkey can roll.

1565
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:33,760
- Isn't it a proverb?
- You're so smart.

1566
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,930
- A monkey.
- Is it a single word?

1567
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,100
Is it a monkey?

1568
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,230
King Kong.

1569
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,470
King Kong, monkey, gorilla.

1570
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:42,400
- Correct!
- Okay.

1571
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,440
So that's how it is.

1572
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,010
(Jjajangmyeon)

1573
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,980
Slurping... Ramyeon?

1574
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,950
Slurping... Ramyeon?

1575
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,610
(Jjajangmyeon)

1576
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,780
A tasty ramyeon.

1577
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,750
(Laughing)

1578
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,920
- A tasty ramyeon? He sucks.
- Check out Daniel.

1579
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,550
Eat first before enjoying
the view at Mt. Geumgang.

1580
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:00,890
- Ye Eun, why are you bad at this?
- Is it a proverb?

1581
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:02,660
(She's able to use her hands.)

1582
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,790
(Chuckling)

1583
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:08,100
(The inflatable doll
is already out of energy.)

1584
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,030
(Thanks to her,
Ah Young can move her hands.)

1585
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:14,040
- Ye Eun, what are you doing?
- Ye Eun, are you kidding me?

1586
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,270
I'm the only one pulling.

1587
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:18,470
- Ye Eun, pull.
- Pull, will you?

1588
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,540
Ye Eun, what are you doing?

1589
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,380
- Pork cutlet.
- Hold on.

1590
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,580
(She's being dragged instead.)

1591
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,850
- Ye Eun, come on.
- Ye Eun!

1592
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,520
- Take a step back.
- Are you kidding me?

1593
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,520
- Pull harder.
- You're eating. Is it a proverb?

1594
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,790
- Ye Eun!
- Is it a word?

1595
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:33,360
(1. A Chinese place)

1596
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,190
(2. Eating noodles)

1597
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:37,090
Buckwheat noodles. Naengmyeon.

1598
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,730
What was it again? Jjolmyeon!

1599
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:39,830
(He figured out
she's having noodles!)

1600
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:41,100
(3 syllables!)

1601
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,800
(A 3-syllable noodle dish?)

1602
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,800
- Cold buckwheat noodles.
- Ye Eun, seriously?

1603
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:46,500
Jjolnaengmyeon.

1604
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,170
- Cold jjolmyeon.
- What are you doing, Ye Eun?

1605
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:49,200
Jjolnaengmyeon.

1606
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,210
- What is it?
- He's terrible at games.

1607
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:53,380
- Look at him.
- Mul naengmyeon.

1608
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,810
Buckwheat noodles on a plate.
Cold buckwheat noodles.

1609
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:56,410
- He mentioned everything else.
- Pork cutlet.

1610
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,410
(He keeps saying the wrong dishes,)

1611
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:58,980
(and time helplessly flows.)

1612
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,420
- Be careful.
- Jelly buckwheat noodles.

1613
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,980
Look at Daniel.

1614
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,450
- What's the answer?
- Check it out.

1615
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,850
Has he still not gotten the answer?

1616
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,490
- I'm his fan.
- Come on.

1617
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,790
- Pass!
- What on earth are you doing?

1618
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,530
- Pass.
- What was it?

1619
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:11,890
- We're moving on.
- The game...

1620
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:14,330
(Not knowing giyeok even with
a sickle in front of you.)

1621
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,900
- An L.
- Ji Hyo, pull.

1622
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,070
She's good.

1623
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,800
- What's that?
- Here?

1624
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,100
I'm impressed with Ah Young.

1625
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,740
- Here?
- I'm impressed with Ah Young.

1626
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,740
- You're crying. A proverb.
- Ye Eun, come on!

1627
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,840
(Her eyes are already wide.)

1628
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,680
(Persistently trying
to make a giyeok)

1629
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,980
- Ye Eun.
- Hold on.

1630
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,310
Not knowing giyeok even with
a sickle in front of you.

1631
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,050
- That's it.
- Nice.

1632
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,820
Look at Ah Young's eyes.

1633
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,850
Look at Ah Young's eyes.

1634
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:39,850
Eating rice cakes while lying down.

1635
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,490
(Spit!)

1636
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,390
(Spitting)

1637
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,000
- They're dragging her.
- Lying down...

1638
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,300
(She fully devotes herself
to her acting.)

1639
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,630
(Flustered by her spitting)

1640
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:53,800
They're dragging her.

1641
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,500
Spitting while lying down.

1642
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,110
- Spitting on my own face.
- You got it right.

1643
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,210
(Correct!)

1644
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:00,740
I can't believe this.

1645
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,180
Running. Running Man.

1646
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,680
(When one runs, another flies.)

1647
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,110
When one runs, another flies!

1648
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:06,750
Nice!

1649
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,050
- Next...
- You're so good.

1650
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,490
You were able to get four.

1651
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:13,320
- Ye Eun made it possible for them.
- Ye Eun!

1652
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,820
What on earth was that?

1653
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:17,690
- Didn't we get four?
- We did.

1654
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:18,990
- We got four.
- Four?

1655
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,600
- What a relief.
- You were amazing.

1656
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,100
(They will at least
have the jjolmyeon.)

1657
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,000
We need to at least
come in second place.

1658
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,830
- No, first place.
- Let's win.

1659
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,400
What's the signal for proverbs?

1660
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,240
(Tapping his right foot)

1661
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,540
This is for foreigners
or foreign words.

1662
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,510
(A while ago)

1663
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,740
(The right foot for proverbs!)

1664
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:37,380
(The two came up
with a secret signal.)

1665
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,650
- This is for foreign words.
- The left foot?

1666
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:41,880
- Foreign words.
- Foreign words.

1667
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,390
- Right foot for proverbs.
- Proverbs.

1668
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,350
Daniel, we're currently
in first place.

1669
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:47,590
- Good.
- We'll at least be second,

1670
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:48,660
so we'll get the jjolmyeon.

1671
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,890
- Jong Kook's strong, so be careful.
- Hold it tight.

1672
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,400
It's not easy.
I bet we'll get tough words.

1673
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,700
Hold tight, guys.
The bands might snap.

1674
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:57,630
I bet we'll get tough words.

1675
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,970
- Jae Seok.
- Hold onto it tight.

1676
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,540
- He's working out.
- Wait.

1677
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,270
One and two.

1678
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,410
I can't believe him.

1679
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:06,040
Pull when he opens his arms.

1680
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,210
Got it. We need to rotate
between pulling and relaxing.

1681
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:10,350
(How many will they get
after all that preparation?)

1682
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,710
Get ready.

1683
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:12,780
(Team Ye Eun will play.)

1684
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,250
- Go.
- Is it a proverb?

1685
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,080
Is it a word?

1686
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,850
- Is it a word?
- Pull and relax.

1687
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:18,920
(Squeezing)

1688
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:22,020
His arms aren't moving at all.

1689
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:23,630
How is it that...

1690
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:24,890
How can you not know this?

1691
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:25,990
(Struggling)

1692
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,660
- He's so expressive too.
- Janggu.

1693
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,800
- He doesn't seem uncomfortable.
- What is this?

1694
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,800
Give me some more.
You're rolling your head.

1695
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,970
Check out his arms!

1696
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,540
How can you not know this?

1697
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,640
Janggu!

1698
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,670
- He can move his arms freely.
- Headbanging.

1699
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,840
(Motioning with his body
that isn't restricted)

1700
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,750
- How can you not know this?
- This...

1701
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,480
- What is this?
- You should know this.

1702
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,420
- Again.
- How can you not know this?

1703
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,750
Repeat it slowly.

1704
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,050
(Samulnori)

1705
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,420
You're spinning your head.

1706
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:53,890
Spinning.

1707
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:55,560
Headbanging.

1708
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,160
(Haha is clueless.)

1709
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,930
There's a good chance
they'll come in last.

1710
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,960
- Guys, pull!
- They'll come in last.

1711
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,230
- What is this?
- His arms aren't moving at all.

1712
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:04,300
He's spinning his head.

1713
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,530
(Trying to express it with motions)

1714
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,600
I have no clue.

1715
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,400
Okay, they're doomed!

1716
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,810
I'll pass for now.

1717
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,610
I'll pass for now.

1718
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:13,810
- How can you not know this?
- Seriously?

1719
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,010
You only get one chance to pass.

1720
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:16,010
I have no clue.

1721
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,750
(They're already exhausted
after the first word.)

1722
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,050
(Mr. Tong)

1723
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,420
(Groaning!)

1724
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,290
(Going wild over his team
not being able to get the word.)

1725
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:29,320
A monster.

1726
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,790
Kim Jong Kook.

1727
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,960
(Mr. Tong)

1728
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,830
(He collects himself
and starts describing the word.)

1729
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:37,030
Kim Jong Kook. Gym Jong Kook.

1730
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,240
Guys, stand strong. Endure.

1731
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,240
(Groaning!)

1732
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:45,970
(Doing the Mr. Tong Dance)

1733
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,180
Se Chan!

1734
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,380
Let's do this!

1735
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,810
- We can be in second place.
- How can you not know this?

1736
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:53,050
We can be in second place, Jae Seok.

1737
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,520
Do your best.
We can be in second place.

1738
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,890
(However,
Mr. Tong won't even flinch.)

1739
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:59,550
Ye Eun might not know this.

1740
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,020
- She might not know this.
- What is this?

1741
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,720
- We can be in second place.
- He's good.

1742
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,830
- How can you not know this?
- We've got this.

1743
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,300
- It's possible.
- I can't believe you two.

1744
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,400
What's the point
in being good at this...

1745
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,900
when they can't guess
the right answer?

1746
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,200
- Should I pass?
- Yes, pass.

1747
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,200
- Is it Mr. Tong?
- Yes!

1748
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,540
- It's Mr. Tong.
- I see.

1749
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,770
(They're currently at 0 points.)

1750
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:21,140
(Swimming while touching the ground)

1751
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,710
Se Chan, pull!

1752
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,480
- He's clueless.
- A triathlon.

1753
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:25,780
(A proverb!)

1754
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,850
Right, a proverb.

1755
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,720
- Darn it!
- Right, a proverb.

1756
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,620
(Kim Jong Kook is angry.)

1757
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,490
(Totally focused)

1758
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,390
- He doesn't know.
- He doesn't know it.

1759
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,630
- Twisting one's arm for a bow.
- Hey!

1760
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:42,600
They're done for!
Hey, just let him go.

1761
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,270
- It's a proverb, right?
- Please...

1762
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:46,870
- Hey, we're going to win.
- We won.

1763
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,970
- My gosh!
- Find your strength!

1764
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:51,210
(Swimming while touching the ground)

1765
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,210
(The ground!)

1766
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,510
- The ground.
- My goodness.

1767
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:56,310
- Okay.
- He kneeled on the ground. Swim.

1768
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:00,620
(If I don't get this right,
I'm dead.)

1769
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,280
Oh, swimming while touching
the ground!

1770
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,490
Okay.
Swimming while touching the ground!

1771
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:06,290
(They barely manage to
get one question right!)

1772
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:07,420
- Seriously...
- Gosh, he still got it right.

1773
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,620
He's really angry.

1774
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,530
- Is it a word?
- Hey, hold on.

1775
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,430
- Hey.
- Oh, I get it.

1776
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:13,430
- Superman!
- You know it, right?
- Oh, no.
- That's not it.

1777
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:15,960
- Spider Man. Iron Man.
- Batman.

1778
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,430
- Iron Man. That's it.
- It's Iron Man.

1779
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:19,470
- The Hulk.
- You can't...

1780
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:20,740
- Short track.
- give her hints.

1781
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,370
- It's the Hulk.
- What? What is that?

1782
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,440
- Oh, I think I know.
- "Take Off."

1783
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,570
- I think I know.
- If you do, you'll lose a point.

1784
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:25,570
What is this?

1785
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,580
(The answer to this question is...)

1786
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,680
(ski jump.)

1787
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,750
Gosh, we have...

1788
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,210
What is this?

1789
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,720
They fly.

1790
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,680
I know this. Ski.

1791
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,090
- Jet ski.
- There you go.

1792
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:39,420
Gosh, it's that ski. Something ski!

1793
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,190
- You darn ski!
- Hey, you husky!

1794
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:43,630
- It's something ski.
- Gosh, ski!

1795
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:45,890
Oh, this is... Hey, you husky!

1796
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:47,600
(Plopping down)

1797
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,100
- Gosh, ski!
- Oh, this is...

1798
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,900
- Jong Kook gave up.
- Gosh, you know that thing.

1799
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,230
Jong Kook gave up!

1800
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,330
Jong Kook...

1801
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,070
- Gosh, you know that thing.
- This is hard.

1802
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,610
(If someone is right or wrong,
he's there to tell them.)

1803
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:01,440
(He was always the coach
who yelled until his veins popped.)

1804
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,880
- He has given up.
- He did his best.

1805
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,250
It's over!

1806
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,710
- All right.
- It's over.

1807
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,520
- Ye Eun, you can do this.
- You have ten seconds left.

1808
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,580
- Ten seconds.
- What is it called?

1809
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,050
- Ye Eun.
- You can get this right!

1810
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:12,420
- Ye Eun!
- What kind of ski is it?

1811
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,420
- It's over.
- You have ten seconds left.

1812
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,620
- Hey, we're in 2nd place.
- We got 2nd place!

1813
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:17,190
- No way.
- Eight.

1814
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:18,430
- What kind of ski?
- Don't we get to pass?

1815
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,430
- It's over.
- Seven.

1816
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,700
- What kind of ski is it?
- Six.

1817
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,700
(Only shaking her legs)

1818
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:25,700
- Four.
- The ski keeps going back.

1819
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,370
- Two.
- Hey, you foolish punk-ski!

1820
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:28,900
- Water ski!
- No, that's not it.

1821
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,640
- It was jump ski.
- Ski jump.

1822
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,170
- Ski jump.
- Gosh, it was harder for us.

1823
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:33,470
- Hey, you got second place.
- Hey.

1824
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:36,410
- They're 2nd. We're in 1st place!
- Hey, we got 2nd place.

1825
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:37,480
Gosh, we...

1826
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,350
- Hey!
- We got second place!

1827
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:40,350
- We're the best!
- Yes!

1828
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,180
- We got second place!
- We just won against people...

1829
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,690
- who don't know ski jump.
- But you know...

1830
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:45,950
- Gosh, how could you not know...
- They were...

1831
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,290
- Haha, samulnori.
- What is samulnori?

1832
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:50,290
She may be too young to know
Mr. Tong, but samulnori... My gosh.

1833
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:53,590
I mean, the kkwaenggwari.
And I spun my head around.

1834
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,860
I even spun it around,
but you still don't know samulnori?

1835
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,370
- My gosh.
- I'm scared.

1836
00:59:58,370 --> 00:59:59,470
Ski jump went way too far.

1837
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,370
Hey, you went too far with ski jump.

1838
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,500
Gosh, but you guys really have
no excuses to give.

1839
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,910
- Right. Even if Jong Kook is mad,
- This is...

1840
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,910
you guys are in the wrong here.

1841
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:10,510
(Sighing)

1842
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:12,210
How could we
not even get three right?

1843
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:14,220
Here are the results of the mission.

1844
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,620
- Team Ji Hyo has three points.
- Okay.

1845
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,990
- Team Ye Eun has one point.
- One point.

1846
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,460
Team Ah Young has four points.

1847
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,690
(Team Ah Young: 4, Team Ji Hyo: 3,
Team Ye Eun: 1)

1848
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,560
First place, second place,
and third place.

1849
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,160
- No way.
- My gosh.

1850
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,260
- We won with four points.
- Gosh, no way.

1851
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:29,900
Get up.

1852
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,470
All right. Again.
I'm sure there's another game.

1853
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:34,900
Before you eat,
if you think you have a card...

1854
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,600
that Incheon wasn't first in,

1855
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,970
- you'll get a chance to switch.
- Yes.

1856
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:41,380
- I don't know about any of them.
- For real. I don't know.

1857
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:44,680
Also, since you said
we weren't giving you any hints,

1858
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,880
- only the first place team...
- Yes, you should.

1859
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,280
will get a chance to ask
whether you have...

1860
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,650
at least one card
that's really a first.

1861
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,360
Does the second place team
not get that chance?

1862
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,190
All of a sudden?

1863
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,060
- The devil's play.
- My gosh.

1864
01:00:58,390 --> 01:00:59,960
You can't do this.

1865
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,830
All of a sudden?

1866
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,500
My gosh.

1867
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:04,730
Gosh, this is funny.
- Hey.
- Yes?

1868
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,670
We can ask this question
as a team, right?

1869
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:08,900
Whether we have a real card?

1870
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,300
- Among the 3?
- Among the 3.

1871
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:13,170
Then, the bronze has
a higher probability.

1872
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,440
- Oh, right.
- Bronze has more real cards.

1873
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,980
You're right.
Shall we go with bronze?

1874
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:20,420
Then, from the bronze...
We'll have the bronze cards, right?

1875
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,350
Worst case scenario,
two of us will get the penalty.

1876
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,250
- If we're lucky, all of us won't.
- Right.

1877
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,690
Since there are more real cards
in the bronze.

1878
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,890
The winning team can go in first...

1879
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,490
Okay, let's go, Ah Young.

1880
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:36,230
Since we can switch two,
let's switch a couple of these.

1881
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,530
I think it's better
if none of us have a real card.

1882
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,700
- You know what I mean, right?
- Please.

1883
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,640
- We can all switch, then.
- Can we go?

1884
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,270
- Good.
- If we have a few,

1885
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:46,510
- it will be confusing.
- It could be.

1886
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:48,780
We'll have better odds
if we don't have any.

1887
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:51,410
(Will they be able to sort out
the real cards?)

1888
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:52,710
Show them the cards.

1889
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,620
(Team Ah Young: Shin Pil Ho OB-GYN Clinic,
Yanghwajeom, Pumbaa)

1890
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:58,350
- How many real cards do we have?
- Are actually firsts...

1891
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:00,720
- Can the second place team not ask?
- No, you can't.

1892
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,520
(Their calculations will get easier
if they're all fake.)

1893
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,960
(How many of
Team Ah Young's cards are real?)

1894
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,060
You don't have any real cards.

1895
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:11,270
(You don't have any real cards.)

1896
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,600
- We did it.
- Hang on.

1897
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:16,340
(All three are fake!)

1898
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,840
(They can switch all of them
to new cards now.)

1899
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,480
- Hang on.
- We can switch two, right?

1900
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,480
No way!

1901
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,440
Daniel, we can switch two.
First of all...

1902
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,250
Hey, I'll hold onto this for now.

1903
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,950
No, you should switch it.
Why would you hold onto it?

1904
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:28,250
- Yes, why...
- No, only two of us can switch.

1905
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,280
- Oh, only two of us can switch?
- Yes.

1906
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,590
So, here's the thing.
Among the bronze cards,

1907
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,790
they're all real
except for this one.

1908
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:37,790
(Among the remaining 4 cards,
3 including the Cider card are real.)

1909
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:39,160
(Pumbaa: fake, Cider: real)

1910
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:42,600
These are all real except for 1.
Out of these 4.

1911
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,970
- Right, among these four.
- So...

1912
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,100
I'll switch with Seok Jin's. Yes.

1913
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,700
(Team Ah Young, Team Ji Hyo)

1914
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:49,800
(Switched Pumbaa for Cider)

1915
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:53,240
Because it's 1 of these 3,

1916
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,980
- the odds are pretty much...
- Right.

1917
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:57,350
- Yes, that one.
- Let's switch with this.

1918
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:59,050
Should we switch mine
for a bronze too?

1919
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:00,450
Yes, switch to a bronze.

1920
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:02,880
Should we go with Jong Kook's card?
Let's switch.

1921
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,590
- Yes, sounds good.
- Jong Kook's card.

1922
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:05,920
- That one. Jong Kook's card.
- Right.

1923
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,490
We'll switch with Jong Kook.

1924
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,190
- Oh, we can't switch this, right?
- Not this one.

1925
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:10,390
- We've switched 2 already.
- Only 2.

1926
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:11,690
- Yes.
- Then, later on...

1927
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:12,960
- Yes, we can switch this later.
- Yes, later.

1928
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,800
We can switch this one too.

1929
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:17,370
(In 2nd place, Team Ji Hyo)

1930
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:18,870
Gosh, but since we have no clues,

1931
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:20,400
- Daebul Hotel is...
- my card could also...

1932
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,200
- Can we only switch 1 card?
- Yes, 1.

1933
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,140
But it's not Pumbaa, right?

1934
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,470
- Not Pumbaa.
- Since it's not Pumbaa,

1935
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:26,470
- let's switch this.
- For now,

1936
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:27,710
we'll switch with Yanghwajeom.

1937
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,280
I don't think Pumbaa is right.

1938
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,680
- It's not.
- Right.

1939
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,010
Let's give Pumbaa to Jong Kook.

1940
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,080
Hey, Pumbaa isn't right, is it?

1941
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,520
- It's not.
- Since it isn't,

1942
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,490
- let's switch that one.
- Then, we're done. It's over.

1943
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,090
- We're done.
- Right? Are we done?

1944
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,790
Pumbaa. It could be from Incheon,
to be honest.

1945
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,160
Do you think Pumbaa is from Incheon?

1946
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,230
But it could be right.

1947
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:50,430
- It could be.
- Honestly, we don't know.

1948
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,830
I don't think
Italy towels are right.

1949
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:54,900
Right? Doesn't this one
stand out to you more?

1950
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,070
Does it? I don't think so.

1951
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:58,210
- Well, the Italy towels...
- They're not right.

1952
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,610
I'll go with this one.

1953
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:00,710
Let's try it.
- Sure.
- Daebul Hotel...

1954
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:02,780
No one knows right now.

1955
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:04,510
We could be right.

1956
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:06,080
- It's fine.
- Let's go.

1957
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:08,520
Now, you'll enjoy your lunch.

1958
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,520
Please bring out
the winning team's meal first.

1959
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,850
- Okay.
- Yes!

1960
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:13,490
I'm jealous.

1961
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:15,090
- My goodness.
- Seriously, I'm so mad.

1962
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,320
I haven't eaten on Running Man...

1963
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,430
- in forever.
- Gosh, seriously.

1964
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:20,160
- I even had to... My gosh!
- Jjolmyeon was created in Incheon.

1965
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,600
- There's so much food.
- No way.

1966
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,900
- We get three bowls?
- That's a lot.

1967
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,330
- That looks amazing.
- We each get a bowl?

1968
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:25,730
- That makes no sense.
- Oh, like this? My gosh.

1969
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:27,800
- We each get one.
- There's a lot of food.

1970
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,570
Gosh, that's literally insane.

1971
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:32,570
Gosh, has jjolmyeon always been
this refreshing?

1972
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:34,440
That looks so good.

1973
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,080
- Hey, the pork cutlet looks good.
- It looks amazing.

1974
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,210
Gosh, it's really good
if you eat this with pork cutlet.

1975
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:40,680
- But second place also...
- Gosh, that looks good.

1976
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,850
Hey, this is no joke.

1977
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,150
- Look at that pork cutlet.
- I'll cut the noodles up.

1978
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,790
Gosh, it's really good
if you eat this with pork cutlet.

1979
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:47,720
Hey, this looks great too.
The jjolmyeon looks legit.

1980
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:50,160
I'm sorry, guys.

1981
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,890
- I'm sorry.
- I'm really sorry.

1982
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:54,800
- No, I was too foolish as well.
- I used up too much time.

1983
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,600
- We tried.
- But since we have...

1984
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,370
- Mr. and Ms. Free Meals here...
- Right.

1985
01:04:58,370 --> 01:04:59,700
(Staring intensely)

1986
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,900
(The redder the noodles get
as he mixes them up)

1987
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,970
Mr. and Ms. Free Meals
don't get to eat today.

1988
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:04,210
This is no joke!

1989
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:05,570
Gosh, this jjolmyeon.

1990
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,740
- This looks great.
- Is it good?

1991
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:09,880
This looks so good.

1992
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:13,480
Is this good or am I just hungry?
Gosh, this is so delicious.

1993
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,680
(Humming)

1994
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,050
Gosh, this is so good.

1995
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:20,320
(Jjolmyeon, born in Incheon
and raised in Korea)

1996
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,990
I haven't had jjolmyeon in a while.

1997
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:25,430
(Smacking her lips)

1998
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:31,800
(They slurp the flavors
of 50 years of history.)

1999
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,270
- My goodness.
- Daniel is enjoying it too.

2000
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:35,740
Ah Young, look at you.

2001
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,370
Food Fighter,
don't you like jjolmyeon?

2002
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:39,470
I totally love it.

2003
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:41,580
Food Fighter's facial expression
is so...

2004
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,410
- You can't not give it to her.
- It's so good.

2005
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:44,680
(Tearing up)

2006
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:46,210
(Mercilessly hitting her again
with the pork cutlet)

2007
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:47,320
Se Chan, I'll cut this all up.

2008
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,750
- Yes, thank you.
- Sounds good.

2009
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,550
That looks delicious.

2010
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:53,450
- I should try it.
- It's really good.

2011
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:55,720
- This is tasty.
- My gosh.

2012
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,330
Hey, this is no joke.

2013
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,860
Gosh, the jjolmyeon is so...

2014
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:02,030
My mom loves jjolmyeon too.

2015
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:07,740
- Gosh, you're eating so well.
- Hey.

2016
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,500
- It's like a commercial.
- Gosh, it's no joke.

2017
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,740
(The pork cutlet mixes up
the jjolmyeon.)

2018
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:11,770
Gosh, this is...

2019
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:13,610
- It's so refreshing.
- The pork cutlet completes this.

2020
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,040
- You need the pork cutlet.
- But the jjolmyeon is good too.

2021
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,080
Gosh, I seriously want some
so badly.

2022
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,380
- Hey, there.
- Haha.

2023
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:21,950
- Ye Eun, do you want some?
- What?

2024
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:22,980
Yes.

2025
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:26,050
- What will you give me?
- Come here.

2026
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,520
- Are you really giving me some?
- Yes, come. I'll give you some.

2027
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,260
Gosh, you said you wouldn't eat it.

2028
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:32,990
Hey, Mr. Tong. Get back here.

2029
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:34,330
Can I eat this?

2030
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:35,600
(The udon broth)

2031
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,200
- This.
- No, you can't.

2032
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:39,730
You can eat this with rice.
Oh, don't you want it?

2033
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:41,600
- Look at her.
- You must be crazy.

2034
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,600
(Turning around)

2035
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,840
You must be crazy.

2036
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,540
She came back.

2037
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:48,040
- You're really making me mad.
- Why would you go over there?

2038
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,380
- Ye Eun.
- Don't joke around with food.

2039
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,880
- Ye Eun, I'll really give you some.
- Hey, why would she give you some?

2040
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,680
- I saw her true facial expression.
- Ye Eun.

2041
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,880
- Her expression was...
- It was for real.

2042
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,580
She looked like she was going to
break up as friends.

2043
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:57,690
Hey, it was like...

2044
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:00,090
- Ye Eun, what did you...
- Hey, she crossed her arms.

2045
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:01,620
Ye Eun, I'll really give you some.

2046
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:03,790
- Really. Pork cutlet. How about it?
- Hey, don't.

2047
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:04,890
Ye Eun doesn't sulk
over other things,

2048
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,430
but she does with food.

2049
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,700
- Seriously.
- Ye Eun, go once more. All right.

2050
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,830
- Here she goes.
- Gosh, seriously.

2051
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:12,200
For real?

2052
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:14,100
Give this to Jong Kook.

2053
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,900
- Yes, you should.
- Then, I'll give you two.

2054
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,180
- It has to...
- You're lying.

2055
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:23,940
- No, really.
- She can't overcome the temptation.

2056
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:25,310
- She'll put it in her mouth.
- It has to go to Jong Kook...

2057
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:26,750
in its original form
for you to get two pieces.

2058
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:28,050
The whole piece.

2059
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:29,120
She isn't a puppy, okay?

2060
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:31,190
- She'll give you two pieces.
- Two pieces.

2061
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:33,090
Leave two pieces behind.

2062
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:35,660
(She makes sure
that there'll be food for her.)

2063
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,960
You have to keep your promise.
I'll cry otherwise.

2064
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:38,990
I'll keep my promise.

2065
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:41,200
(At that moment)

2066
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,560
Why?

2067
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,100
I don't know. Please eat this.

2068
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:45,400
- Really?
- Yes.

2069
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:47,100
Hey, she won't keep her promise.

2070
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,670
(It's time for Food Fighter
to reap the fruit of her patience.)

2071
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:50,300
- Come on!
- What?

2072
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:52,440
- Come on!
- What?

2073
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,480
- Where did they go?
- Look.

2074
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:56,210
- They turned into macaroni.
- Seok Jin.

2075
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,980
Seok Jin, did you take them?

2076
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:00,850
Seriously, Ah Young is annoying.

2077
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,820
- I'm so annoyed.
- Ye Eun, eat this. What?

2078
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,490
- I'm so annoyed.
- Ye Eun, eat this. What?

2079
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:09,420
(The single piece disappeared.)

2080
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,990
Hey. You gave it to me.

2081
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:14,030
She's crying.

2082
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:17,470
(Are you crying?)

2083
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:18,800
You gave it to me.

2084
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:19,970
Ye Eun, here!

2085
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,340
(Ye Eun, here!)

2086
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:22,870
- I'm serious.
- I won't eat it.

2087
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:23,900
(Low-pitched)

2088
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:25,340
I'm serious.

2089
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,780
(Due to shock,
her vocal cords transformed.)

2090
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:29,940
- "I won't eat it."
- She's upset.

2091
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,210
"I won't eat it."

2092
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,710
I really wanted to eat them.

2093
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:34,350
I'm crying for real.

2094
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,180
- Shall we sit with our teammates?
- What? It doesn't matter.

2095
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,390
Didn't you do that earlier?

2096
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,550
- This must be yours.
- Is this mine?

2097
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:40,550
- Is this it?
- Yes.

2098
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,120
- Thank you.
- Hold on.

2099
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:43,520
I have a question.

2100
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,060
You've met him many more times.
Why didn't you exchange numbers?

2101
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:47,190
Numbers?

2102
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,660
- You know,
- Do it now.

2103
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,370
Daniel and Ah Young
only exchanged numbers...

2104
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:53,330
- because we pushed them to do it.
- That's right.

2105
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:54,500
- Do it now.
- Do it now.

2106
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,270
- Do it.
- Do it now.

2107
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,210
(Chiming in)

2108
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,940
- What's wrong with her?
- Give me your phone.

2109
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:01,340
- Ah Young.
- Ye Eun is excited.

2110
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,980
(Give me your phone.)

2111
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:04,310
I'm sorry.

2112
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:06,710
Hey, Kim Ah Young.
I hope things work out.

2113
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:09,950
You never know.
She might become jealous.

2114
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,620
- That's right.
- Ye Eun might become jealous.

2115
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,560
- It wasn't like this with KAI.
- My goodness.

2116
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,020
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

2117
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:20,290
I think Ah Young is incredible.

2118
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:22,260
- She's incredible.
- Ah Young is something else.

2119
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:23,660
- She's something else.
- That isn't true.

2120
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:24,830
- That's right.
- Both of them will struggle...

2121
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:25,870
- once they fall for her charms.
- No.

2122
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,030
That's ridiculous.

2123
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,270
- Did you save her number?
- Yes.

2124
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:30,970
- Under which name?
- Ah Young.

2125
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:33,110
- Really? Just Ah Young?
- Yes.

2126
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:34,340
- Really?
- What else would it be? Ah Young.

2127
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,340
- Ah Young.
- How about you, Ah Young?

2128
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,810
- Senior Yang Se Chan.
- Senior Yang Se Chan.

2129
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:39,250
- That's too...
- Shall I drop the last name?

2130
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:40,410
- No. It's okay.
- She saved his number...

2131
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,250
- under "Senior Yang Se Chan."
- That's what you usually do.

2132
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,320
I saved her number under "Ah Young."

2133
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,520
What's my contact name?

2134
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,720
Senior Choi Daniel.

2135
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,020
Is that so?

2136
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,720
- It's "Senior Daniel."
- That's what you usually do.

2137
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,160
Since there isn't
a big age difference,

2138
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,590
- can't it be "Big brother" instead?
- Seriously.

2139
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:53,860
- But "Senior" is more romantic.
- That's right.

2140
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:54,900
- Really?
- Is it more heart-fluttering?

2141
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:55,960
It's more heart-fluttering.

2142
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,360
Mister, look to the front.

2143
01:09:58,230 --> 01:09:59,570
(Please don't be meddlesome.)

2144
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,540
- Seriously, mister.
- Mister.

2145
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:02,800
- Look to the front.
- Mister.

2146
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,670
- Mister.
- He's obsessed with love. Gosh.

2147
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:07,010
Mister, look to the front.
For goodness' sake.

2148
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,210
- Senior.
- You know, Na Kyung Eun...

2149
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,080
called Jae Seok "Senior" at first.

2150
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:13,850
(Senior Yu!)

2151
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:15,250
- Senior Yu!
- My goodness.

2152
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:16,750
(Senior Yu becomes speechless.)

2153
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,120
- No way.
- Senior Yu!

2154
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,550
- You're right.
- Seriously.

2155
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,720
- Senior Yu.
- I can't believe it.

2156
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,320
- From "Senior" to "Darling."
- Senior Yu!

2157
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,090
- Senior Jae Seok.
- Senior.

2158
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,030
He makes up too many stories.

2159
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:30,030
- I'm blushing.
- He makes up...

2160
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:32,030
- too many stories.
- I think she did that.

2161
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:33,570
- What's this place?
- It's a gallery.

2162
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:34,600
- It's a gallery cafe.
- A gallery.

2163
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,600
- I want cake.
- I want ice cream.

2164
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:38,640
- Gosh.
- What's this place?

2165
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,210
It looks like we'll solve problems.

2166
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:43,080
We need to place first this time.

2167
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,580
- Gosh.
- I'm ruined.

2168
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:47,110
When I see a sketchbook these days,

2169
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,650
- Okay!
- I get stressed out.

2170
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:49,920
It's a quiz. We're set.

2171
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,290
- The last mission is...
- We need to do this well.

2172
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:54,190
the Save Up to Survive,
Frugality Quiz.

2173
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:57,360
- That's my specialty.
- Each team will send out a player.

2174
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:59,260
You'll hear
the category of the quiz...

2175
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:00,730
and the number of syllables
for the question.

2176
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,800
- Will all of us get a turn then?
- Yes.

2177
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:06,570
Write down how many syllables
you want to see.

2178
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:09,270
(Write down how many syllables
you want to see.)

2179
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:11,810
The team that wrote down
the smallest number...

2180
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:13,210
will check the question first...

2181
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:15,080
- and write down the answer.
- Okay.

2182
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,510
Okay.

2183
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:17,810
(In the order of the numbers,)

2184
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:19,880
(the corresponding syllables
will be revealed for the quiz.)

2185
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,380
- I get it now.
- Reveal them from the beginning.

2186
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:23,820
- The syllables.
- We'll do that.

2187
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,450
If you answer correctly,

2188
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:29,560
the number of remaining syllables
will be added to your score.

2189
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,160
(The number of remaining syllables
will get added to your score.)

2190
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:34,260
Let's say
only "Frozen" was revealed.

2191
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:36,100
If you get "Elsa" right,

2192
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,400
- you'll receive six points.
- That's right.

2193
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,300
It's easy to get "Elsa"
from "Frozen."

2194
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,470
- But the question...
- If you aren't confident,

2195
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,670
- ask for more syllables...
- Okay.

2196
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:45,140
and receive fewer points.

2197
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:47,680
The benefit
of exchanging the cards...

2198
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:48,840
will be given
in the order of the scores.

2199
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,240
If we receive the full question
and still answer incorrectly,

2200
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,250
do we get zero points?

2201
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,220
- It happens, right?
- What?

2202
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:56,350
Despite having the full question,

2203
01:11:56,350 --> 01:11:57,520
- you answer incorrectly.
- That's right.

2204
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,220
- It happens.
- So I had to ask.

2205
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:01,190
This team has many brainy ones.

2206
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:03,590
- This team has many brainy ones.
- Jong Kook,

2207
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:05,660
their intelligence levels
are like this.

2208
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:06,830
So we have a chance.

2209
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:08,100
- There's a big difference.
- Seriously.

2210
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,330
(The godmother of Empty Heads
balances things out.)

2211
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:10,500
We're ruined.

2212
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,370
Don't say that. We can do it.

2213
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:14,440
- We're definitely better...
- The categories might be nice.

2214
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,870
- than Daniel and Se Chan.
- Ah Young is Empty Head too.

2215
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,770
Ah Young is an Empty Head too.

2216
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,710
Ah Young is more
of an Empty Head than me.

2217
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,210
Is she more of an Empty Head
than you?

2218
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,940
- I'm certain of it.
- Really?

2219
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,580
- But...
- I'm smarter than Ye Eun.

2220
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:26,850
- Then compete against Ye Eun.
- Okay.

2221
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:29,050
- Let's go in the same round.
- Okay. That sounds good.

2222
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:30,950
It'll be a women's round.

2223
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:32,620
- Ji Ye Eun.
- Kim Ah Young.

2224
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:33,990
Empty Head?

2225
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,490
- You?
- That's you. Empty Head.

2226
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,320
Then we'll send out Ji Hyo.

2227
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,030
- Ji Hyo, go.
- That's right. Ji Hyo, go.

2228
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:40,890
Ah Young, don't get intimidated.

2229
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:44,060
- Ah Young, you're the brain.
- A women's round.

2230
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,570
The category is...

2231
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:47,500
nations and regions.

2232
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,300
- That's what the quiz is about.
- Regions?

2233
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:50,600
- Regions?
- I'm bad with regions.

2234
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,940
The question has 29 syllables.

2235
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,740
- Twenty-nine.
- Regions.

2236
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:57,380
From number 24,
isn't it "What's the name?"

2237
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:59,710
(Nations and regions)

2238
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:01,180
- Check half of them.
- Seventeen.

2239
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:03,320
(Check 17 syllables.)

2240
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:05,190
Check half of them.

2241
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,820
- It'll be better.
- Seventeen.

2242
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,390
- Twenty.
- Twenty.

2243
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,790
It's more important
to answer correctly.

2244
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:14,430
- Twenty-nine.
- Ji Hyo.

2245
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:16,530
How about seven syllables?

2246
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:17,870
- Shall we take the risk?
- No.

2247
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,900
Ji Hyo, you should check
14 syllables at the very least.

2248
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:21,870
The question has 29 syllables.

2249
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:23,240
You should check 14 syllables.

2250
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:26,340
(Will she answer the question
with only 14 syllables?)

2251
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,140
- That's right.
- Now,

2252
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:31,980
Ah Young chose 20 syllables,

2253
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,710
Ji Hyo chose 14 syllables,

2254
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:35,820
- and Ye Eun chose 17 syllables.
- Ye Eun.

2255
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,520
- Thus, Ji Hyo will get...
- Ye Eun must be confident.

2256
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,920
- fourteen syllables first.
- Ji Hyo will get ahead.

2257
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:41,890
- Ji Hyo.
- "A pond where a white deer..."

2258
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:43,320
"drinks water."

2259
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:44,830
What's that?

2260
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:46,960
- It's a hard one.
- It's a hard one.

2261
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,500
- It's a hard one.
- It's an advanced question.

2262
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,970
- Five, four...
- Twenty syllables won't be enough.

2263
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,130
It's a hard one.

2264
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,740
- It's hard.
- What's this?

2265
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:56,700
Ye Eun, well done.

2266
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:58,070
A pond...

2267
01:13:58,870 --> 01:13:59,940
- Three,
- Regions.

2268
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,210
(Ji Hyo doesn't have a clue.)

2269
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:02,240
two...

2270
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,180
All right. I don't know the answer.

2271
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:06,950
Now, 17 syllables will be revealed.

2272
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:08,750
- "Is the meaning."
- "Is the meaning."

2273
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,550
- "Is the meaning."
- You have to take a wild guess.

2274
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:12,990
Ah Young has an advantage.

2275
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:14,720
- Ah Young, it's okay. Wait.
- Okay.

2276
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,860
Write down the answer slowly.

2277
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,290
It isn't easy.

2278
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:18,490
Write down your answer and cover it.

2279
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:19,960
I don't know what it is.

2280
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:21,090
I don't know.

2281
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,130
- Cover it.
- Ah Young has an advantage.

2282
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:25,400
Ah Young, you'll get 20 syllables.

2283
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:27,730
(She gets a crucial word,
"Mount Halla.")

2284
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:28,840
So that comes next.

2285
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,270
("A pond where a white deer drinks
water" is the meaning. Mount Halla)

2286
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:32,440
- Hold on.
- I know this one.

2287
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,670
- Is it in Korea?
- What?

2288
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,880
- I know this one.
- It's Jeju Island.

2289
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:36,940
- Jeju Island.
- Ah Young doesn't know.

2290
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:38,080
Jeju Island.

2291
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,110
The name of this place is
Baengnokdam, meaning...

2292
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,420
"A pond where
a white deer drinks water."

2293
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:45,520
(Baengnokdam: White deer pond)

2294
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:47,190
Hey, this one...

2295
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:48,590
Why don't you know the answer?

2296
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:49,820
- I know this one.
- Is it in Korea?

2297
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:50,960
You have five seconds.

2298
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,830
- I know this one.
- I know this one.

2299
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:55,260
- Hold on.
- This is...

2300
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,660
- Five,
- Hold on.

2301
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,230
- four,
- Hey, this one...

2302
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:59,830
- three,
- Why don't you know the answer?

2303
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:01,770
- two, one.
- My goodness.

2304
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:04,100
- We got the question.
- Reveal it on the count of three.

2305
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,610
One, two, three.

2306
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:07,470
(Answer: Baengnokdam)

2307
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:09,780
- Ah Young, Baengnokdam is correct.
- It's correct.

2308
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:11,880
(Only Ah Young who got
"Mount Halla" answered correctly!)

2309
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,410
- I thought it was Jeju Island.
- How did you know?

2310
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:16,450
- I thought it was Jeju Island.
- No way.

2311
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:18,050
A pond.

2312
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:20,420
- Earlier... Empty Head.
- Empty Head.

2313
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:22,020
- Ye Eun,
- My goodness.

2314
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,260
Ah Young isn't Empty Head.

2315
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,260
I would've known
had I gotten "Mount Halla."

2316
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:30,530
- Only Ah Young won nine points.
- She's the best.

2317
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,530
Play it safe, okay?

2318
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:33,830
Ye Eun, play it safe.

2319
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,240
- We'll switch the players.
- We'll switch the players.

2320
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,440
- All right.
- Let's switch the players.

2321
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,110
- Seok Jin, go next.
- I'll go next.

2322
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:40,340
- I'll go next.
- Okay.

2323
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:41,910
Okay. Let's go.

2324
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:43,640
- All right.
- This is... Okay. Let's go.

2325
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,450
Jong Kook.
The brainy one has entered.

2326
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:46,750
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook,
the two brainy ones have entered.)

2327
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,280
I'll do this properly.

2328
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,520
(Daniel decides to join.)

2329
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:51,750
Hey, I'll take the risk.

2330
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,950
As for the question,

2331
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:56,520
- the category is culture.
- Culture.

2332
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,230
- Culture.
- Culture isn't my strong suit.

2333
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,830
- And...
- Common knowledge is better.

2334
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:02,060
the question has 25 syllables.

2335
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:03,400
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-five.

2336
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,370
- It's a game of making bets.
- Seok Jin,

2337
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:07,900
it depends on the question.

2338
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,740
I don't know much about culture.

2339
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:11,000
Seok Jin is too...

2340
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:13,440
I came up with a strategy.

2341
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,340
(Jong Kook and Daniel
decide to play it safe.)

2342
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,480
- Is it too much?
- No. That's good.

2343
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,580
You saw how it was earlier.

2344
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:21,210
- To get Baengnokdam,
- The next word...

2345
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:22,920
you needed 20 syllables.

2346
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,150
How else?

2347
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:25,520
- So...
- Seok Jin.

2348
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,750
- Let's go.
- The number is too small.

2349
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:28,820
No. I'll challenge myself.

2350
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:30,860
- Seok Jin is too...
- Let's go.

2351
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:33,560
- What's up with Seok Jin?
- Let's go.

2352
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:35,400
Life is all about
challenging yourself.

2353
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,900
- Let's go.
- Seok Jin, it's impossible.

2354
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,770
- No. Just you watch.
- Seok Jin...

2355
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:40,600
- chose nine syllables.
- Yes.

2356
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,670
- We'll reveal 9 syllables.
- The 1st line.

2357
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:43,700
Nine syllables?

2358
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:47,110
(The shepherds'
communication signals)

2359
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:49,640
- How are you supposed to know?
- How are you supposed to know?

2360
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,940
Is this about culture?

2361
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:53,310
You have five seconds.

2362
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:55,120
- This one...
- I can't believe him.

2363
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,420
- Hold on.
- Four,

2364
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:58,920
- He needed 15 syllables.
- three...

2365
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,390
Write it down.

2366
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:03,920
No. Hold on.

2367
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,760
Hold on. Let me write it again.

2368
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:08,500
- Why did you write "Dog?"
- Dog.

2369
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:12,430
- Suddenly...
- I wrote "Dog."

2370
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,770
What is he doing?

2371
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,900
Is it correct? I'll give it a go.

2372
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,770
- Okay. I'll cover it.
- Please cover it.

2373
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:22,580
- Now, both chose 18 syllables.
- Really?

2374
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:24,540
We'll reveal 18 syllables.

2375
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:25,910
- Exactly.
- I know!

2376
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:27,010
(I know!)

2377
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:30,150
(A form of singing in the Alps?)

2378
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:32,150
You have five seconds.

2379
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:35,420
- Five, four,
- It's correct, right? I'm confused.

2380
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:38,960
- three, two, one.
- Write it.

2381
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,860
Raise your answer
on the count of three.

2382
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:42,260
One, two, three.

2383
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:44,100
(Did Seok Jin predict
the remainder of the question?)

2384
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,630
It's correct, right?

2385
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:46,930
Raise it.

2386
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:49,300
Seok Jin wrote, "Beacon."

2387
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:52,740
(Seok Jin's answer: Beacon)

2388
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:55,840
- All right. What's the answer?
- Communication signals.

2389
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,880
- It's yodeling.
- "Yodeling" is correct.

2390
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,650
(Daniel and Jong Kook
acquire 7 points each.)

2391
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:03,020
- Okay.
- Seok Jin, you need 15 syllables.

2392
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:05,390
You need half or more
at the very least.

2393
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:08,360
I want to turn the tables.
Let me give it another go.

2394
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:09,560
I want to turn the tables.

2395
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,490
- I'll take the risk.
- The category is...

2396
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:13,530
- history and historical figures.
- History.

2397
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:15,060
- History and what?
- History and historical figures.

2398
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:17,430
- You should take the risk.
- If it's about history...

2399
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:18,770
- History and historical figures.
- And...

2400
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:21,300
- the question has 26 syllables.
- It's pretty long.

2401
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:22,440
- History and historical figures.
- I think...

2402
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,800
- History.
- Seok Jin.

2403
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:24,870
I'll be frugal.

2404
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:26,440
(He saves paper
by choosing 18 syllables again.)

2405
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,440
I'll save paper.

2406
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,580
(History and historical figures)

2407
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:31,650
(Daniel plays it safe
by choosing 21 syllables.)

2408
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:35,020
- Choose 16 to play it safe.
- Choose 16.

2409
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:37,320
Seok Jin is nervous
because of the previous one.

2410
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,820
There he goes again.

2411
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:39,850
Seok Jin.

2412
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:42,060
- Six is too small.
- No!

2413
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,860
- Six is too small.
- No!

2414
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:45,860
(Turning)

2415
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:47,330
He keeps being like that.

2416
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:49,400
- No!
- You'll lose again.

2417
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,430
Here.

2418
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,100
- I want to go with six.
- Seok Jin.

2419
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,700
- It's too much.
- Don't do that.

2420
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:54,800
I'll go with this one.

2421
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,040
- That's the number, right?
- To make up for the past rounds...

2422
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:59,840
All right. Seok Jin chose
nine syllables,

2423
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,940
- Jong Kook chose 18 syllables,
- Really?

2424
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:04,740
- and Daniel chose 21 syllables.
- Let's go.

2425
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,850
- We'll reveal 9 syllables 1st.
- I'll make up for the past rounds.

2426
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:08,850
Okay.

2427
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:10,720
"A historical figure
Choi Soo Jong played..."

2428
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,950
(A historical figure
Choi Soo Jong played...)

2429
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:15,790
- There are many.
- It's a hard one.

2430
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:17,420
- There are many.
- Gosh, this one...

2431
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,360
- There are too many.
- There are too many.

2432
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,500
- There are too many.
- You know...

2433
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,960
- You need to pick one.
- But...

2434
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,760
- This one...
- There are many.

2435
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:25,870
I told you...

2436
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:29,000
- to choose 16 syllables.
- You could've chosen 22 syllables.

2437
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,600
- There are many.
- You don't know that.

2438
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,740
- There are too many.
- You know...

2439
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:32,740
- She had no idea,
- No.
but went, "There are many."

2440
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:34,740
He was on "Emperor of the Sea"

2441
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:37,140
- He was on "Emperor of the Sea"
- So who was the emperor of the sea?

2442
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:38,610
- Choi Soo Jong.
- No.

2443
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:40,210
Which historical figure was he?

2444
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,020
- Gwang...
- Gwang?

2445
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,280
Gwanggaeto the Great.

2446
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:46,050
- A historical figure.
- There are too many.

2447
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:47,520
- I don't know.
- Choi Soo Jong...

2448
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,620
- Jang Bo Go.
- There's a representative one.

2449
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:52,030
- Five,
- I haven't watched...

2450
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:54,390
- four...
- many historical dramas.

2451
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:56,600
He's totally ruined.

2452
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,570
I don't know
if he has played this figure.

2453
01:19:58,570 --> 01:20:00,230
(A historical figure
Choi Soo Jong played...)

2454
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:02,940
- All right.
- Choi Soo Jong's dramas...

2455
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,400
Seok Jin.

2456
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,510
After writing down the answer,
please cover it.

2457
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,010
I made a wild guess.

2458
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,510
- That's how it is in life.
- Up next is Jong Kook.

2459
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:10,810
- We'll reveal...
- I could've been an ace.

2460
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:12,080
- eighteen syllables.
- Am I next?

2461
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,850
- Yes, you chose 18 syllables.
- Okay.

2462
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:15,420
(Who took over the old territory
of Goguryeo)

2463
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:16,850
- What?
- That's it.

2464
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,050
(This historical figure came
after the Three Kingdoms Period.)

2465
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,720
It's obvious.

2466
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:23,320
(He must guess
the rest of the question.)

2467
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:24,930
- Don't say anything.
- Gosh.

2468
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:27,030
You have five seconds.

2469
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:30,460
Five, four, three...

2470
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,730
(Jong Kook's answer: Dae Jo Yeong)

2471
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:33,430
- All right.
- This one...

2472
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:34,670
- Please cover it.
- But...

2473
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:36,200
- Please cover it.
- But...

2474
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,000
- Life is all about taking risks.
- We'll now reveal...

2475
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,570
twenty-one syllables.

2476
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,080
"And founded Balhae."

2477
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:44,440
(Clapping)

2478
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:46,380
- Jong Kook became certain.
- Four...

2479
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,780
(As Jong Kook guessed,
the answer is Dae Jo Yeong!)

2480
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,720
Who is it? I don't know.

2481
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,890
(Answer: Dae Jo Yeong)

2482
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:55,320
- Daniel, just write it down.
- Hey.

2483
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,790
(He writes "Gwanggaeto the Great"
despite seeing "Balhae.")

2484
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:00,290
I wrote it down.
It might be wrong. I don't know.

2485
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,960
- We don't know either.
- One, two, three.

2486
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,000
Isn't it Dae Jo Yeong?

2487
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:05,530
- The answer is Dae Jo Yeong.
- Okay!

2488
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:06,800
(The quick-witted Jong Kook
earns 8 points alone!)

2489
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,170
- Okay!
- It isn't Gwanggaeto the Great.

2490
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:12,740
I didn't know
the rest of the question.

2491
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:13,810
(Only Team Ji Hyo has 0 points.)

2492
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:17,010
(Team Ye Eun comes close
to catching up thanks to Jong Kook.)

2493
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,410
The category is history
and historical figures again.

2494
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:21,880
- Seventeen.
- Jong Kook and Seok Jin chose...

2495
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,150
seventeen syllables.

2496
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:25,290
Daniel chose ten syllables.

2497
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:26,450
(A general of Goguryeo)

2498
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:27,490
Salsu?

2499
01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:29,020
(Seok Jin gets the first answer
after he stops being reckless.)

2500
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:30,620
- You got it.
- Three...

2501
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:31,660
(A general of Goguryeo
who led the Battle of Salsu)

2502
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:32,660
(Answer: Ulchi Mundok)

2503
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,030
- Two...
- The answer is clear.

2504
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:36,060
- I wrote down the answer.
- Of course.

2505
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,370
- The answer is Ulchi Mundok.
- Yes.

2506
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,400
Yi Sun Sin is incorrect.

2507
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,870
(Team Ah Young got 0 points
since he was reckless.)

2508
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:43,970
Let's switch places.

2509
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:45,740
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook
acquire 7 points each.)

2510
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:48,070
Jae Seok, you need to take risks.

2511
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:50,640
We can't afford
to hear the entire question.

2512
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,150
- We need at least half.
- Look around you.

2513
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:53,680
They're Empty Heads.

2514
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:55,720
I'm nervous.

2515
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:58,150
Will I be able to beat Jae Seok?

2516
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:59,820
- Next to be is number one.
- Let's go.

2517
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:00,920
Let's beat number one.

2518
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:01,960
You can do it.

2519
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,390
(It's time to take risks
to close the gap.)

2520
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:05,530
The category is history
and historical figures again.

2521
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:07,290
- Play it safe, Se Chan.
- Historical figures.

2522
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:09,660
- Yes. There are 29 syllables.
- It's okay.

2523
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:10,930
Twenty-nine?

2524
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:12,300
Play it safe.

2525
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,770
(Se Chan chose 18 syllables.)

2526
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:16,440
-Twenty-nine?
- Nineteen?

2527
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,510
- No.
- How about ten?

2528
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:19,870
- Just go.
- Then...

2529
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:21,010
Shall I go with this?

2530
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,640
No.

2531
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,580
- There are so many syllables.
- No.

2532
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:26,150
- Do it.
- There are so many syllables.

2533
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:27,550
- Do it.
- Give it a go.

2534
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:28,880
(Going through the cards)

2535
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,950
- How many syllables?
- Go with 21.

2536
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:31,790
- Shall I go with this one?
- Twenty-one.

2537
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:34,020
Go with 21.

2538
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,220
(Jong Kook calms him down
and makes him choose 21.)

2539
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:37,760
I think the last part
will be important.

2540
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,790
Twenty-one. Yes.

2541
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:41,800
Jae Seok, let's end it
with six syllables.

2542
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,860
No.

2543
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:43,960
Then you'll turn the tables.

2544
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,770
It's a way to turn the tables.
For us to win,

2545
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:47,900
you need to take a risk.

2546
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,670
- Okay.
- Shall I choose six syllables?

2547
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:50,940
- Choose six syllables.
- Jae Seok.

2548
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,240
(Because of Seok Jin,
Team Ji Hyo must take a risk!)

2549
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,670
- Let's go with six syllables.
- Six syllables.

2550
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:55,910
- Jae Seok, make it 9.
- Not 6. I think...

2551
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:57,240
- you should make it nine.
- Nine.

2552
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,480
- Flip it over.
- Nine.

2553
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,080
- Nine.
- Nine.

2554
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,510
(Team Ji Hyo chooses 9.)

2555
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:02,720
(Will he earn 20 points
by choosing 9 syllables?)

2556
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:03,720
All right. Nine.

2557
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,720
Se Chan chose 18 syllables.

2558
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:09,520
Jae Seok chose 9 syllables.
Haha chose 21 syllables.

2559
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

2560
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,360
Nine syllables will be revealed

2561
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,460
- Nine syllables?
- Yes.

2562
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:15,360
- "By erecting Cheokhwabi..."
- "By erecting Cheokhwabi..."

2563
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:16,900
- You know this.
- "This figure implemented..."

2564
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,000
(By erecting Cheokhwabi,
this figure implemented)

2565
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,700
Hey, it's too easy.

2566
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,100
What's Cheokhwabi?

2567
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:23,870
- Cheokhwabi?
- My goodness.

2568
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,270
Cheokhwabi?

2569
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:27,140
(By erecting Cheokhwabi,
this figure implemented)

2570
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,910
(The man who chose 9 syllables,
Jae Seok writes an answer!)

2571
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:31,280
Jae Seok has to know the answer.

2572
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:35,010
Now, we'll reveal 18 syllables.

2573
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,380
(The closed-door policy)

2574
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,320
- You'll get the country name.
- I'm in trouble.

2575
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,690
You'll get the country name.
You'll know then.

2576
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,920
(He writes down the answer
right away.)

2577
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,330
- We'll reveal 21 syllables.
- Goguryeo.

2578
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:48,090
- "Gojong..."
- Then...

2579
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:49,460
- Five,
- Write it.

2580
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:51,300
- What about Gojong?
- four...

2581
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:52,470
- Hey.
- Gojong.

2582
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:53,730
- The most representative figure.
- You can't give a hint.

2583
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:55,000
- The most representative figure.
- Three.

2584
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,040
The closed-door policy.

2585
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:58,240
- Okay. On the count of three,
- Coffee.

2586
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,370
raise it.

2587
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:01,270
- No.
- One, two, three. Raise it.

2588
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:03,040
That one. For goodness' sake.

2589
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,540
(Haha just wrote down
the name of the king he knew.)

2590
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,050
- Raise it.
- It's correct.

2591
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,180
- The answer is...
- It's correct.

2592
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:09,550
- Heungseon Daewongun.
- Yes.

2593
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:10,720
(Jae Seok guessed the answer
from 9 syllables.)

2594
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,350
You said it was
Gwanggaeto the Great.

2595
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:14,450
(He earns 20 points.)

2596
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:15,860
It's correct. Heungseon Daewongun.

2597
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,760
- What did you write down?
- Jeongjong. How about you?

2598
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:19,890
- I...
- Sukjong.

2599
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:21,330
(Empty Head Brothers
are neck and neck.)

2600
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:22,960
Our score went up a lot.

2601
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:25,270
- We'll announce the scores.
- Aren't we in first place?

2602
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:27,100
Currently, Team Ah Young has
16 points.

2603
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,500
Team Ji Hyo has 27 points.

2604
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,470
- Team Ye Eun has 22 points.
- We did it.

2605
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:32,010
(Thanks to Jae Seok,
Team Ji Hyo is in 1st place.)

2606
01:24:32,010 --> 01:24:33,410
- We...
- Jae Seok.

2607
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:34,810
- You're the best.
- This is...

2608
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:37,980
(Team Ye Eun is only 5 points behind
compared to the 1st place.)

2609
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:40,180
- There's a big gap.
- Eleven points?

2610
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:42,980
- Yes. There's a big gap.
- Here comes the last question.

2611
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:44,880
- I'm in the worst condition.
- This is...

2612
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,650
I'm in the worst condition.
I'm sorry.

2613
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:47,690
(Haha switches places
with Jong Kook.)

2614
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:48,920
- I mean...
- Go.

2615
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:52,160
- Se Chan.
- I'll use all of my knowledge.

2616
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:55,030
If I win, people will call me
a genius.

2617
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:56,960
- Hold on.
- I think he can do it.

2618
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:59,770
- Se Chan, if you win...
- You got this.

2619
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:01,500
- It's a real match.
- You'll be a total hero...

2620
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,340
- if you win.
- Jae Seok and Jong Kook.

2621
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:05,170
(Empty Head dreams of beating
the two brainy members.)

2622
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:07,370
This is my chance
to become the main character.

2623
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:08,780
You can be the main character.

2624
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:09,780
- It's a real match.
- A genius.

2625
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,140
The category is history
and historical figures again.

2626
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:12,310
- History?
- Okay.

2627
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:15,620
(The brainy members
have confidence in history.)

2628
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:18,550
(Oh, no.)

2629
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:20,950
There are 29 syllables.

2630
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,020
(History and historical figures)

2631
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,690
We'll place second no matter what.

2632
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:24,720
(It's all thanks to Se Chan.)

2633
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:27,460
(Careful)

2634
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:28,760
It'll be hard.

2635
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:32,130
(It's Jae Seok and Jong Kook's
game of wits for 1st place.)

2636
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:33,870
- One, two...
- Hold on.

2637
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:35,970
It'll be hard.

2638
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:38,540
Nice.

2639
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:44,140
(Laughing)

2640
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,550
- Se Chan.
- Ten.

2641
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:51,020
(Did Se Chan choose 2 syllables?)

2642
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:52,590
- Hey.
- What?

2643
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:53,690
- I'll turn the tables.
- Two?

2644
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,420
- Hey, choose 5 at the very least.
- Choose 5.

2645
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:57,690
- Choose 5.
- Hey, choose 5 at the very least.

2646
01:25:57,690 --> 01:25:59,690
- I need to win.
- Hey.

2647
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:02,230
- Choose five at the very least.
- No. I'll give it a go.

2648
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,430
Whatever. I'll take a guess.

2649
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:04,530
- Five.
- Okay.

2650
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,570
Se Chan chose two syllables.

2651
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:10,200
- Let's see.
- Jae Seok chose 14 syllables.

2652
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,070
- Really?
- Jong Kook chose ten syllables.

2653
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:15,140
- Firstly,
- Don't be rash.

2654
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,140
we'll reveal two syllables.

2655
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,150
(Yulgok)

2656
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:22,320
(The two syllables of fate
get revealed.)

2657
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,620
I know this.

2658
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,350
- This...
- I think I know.

2659
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:27,820
(He wrote confidently
after seeing Yulgok.)

2660
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:29,790
I wrote it too.

2661
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:32,290
- Please!
- Did you write it?

2662
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:33,660
- Please, Se Chan!
- Hye.

2663
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,400
He wrote
exactly what I was thinking.

2664
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,430
Really?

2665
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:38,670
(It would be an unbelievable
comeback if he gets it right!)

2666
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:41,500
- Okay.
- I'll reveal ten syllables.

2667
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:43,940
It would be amazing
if he gets it correct.

2668
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:46,110
- You never know.
- That's right.

2669
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:50,980
(The mother of Yulgok Yi I...)

2670
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:53,480
- That's not it?
- Did you get it correct?

2671
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:54,510
Let's wait and see.

2672
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:57,450
Next, I'll reveal the 14 syllables.

2673
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:59,290
Please write them.

2674
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:03,290
(Yulgok Yi I's mother...)

2675
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:04,890
(It's clear what the answer is!)

2676
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:07,690
Next, I'll reveal the 14 syllables.

2677
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:10,000
- But this...
- Okay!

2678
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,100
(Jae Seok wrote the answer too.)

2679
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:12,830
At first...

2680
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:14,800
Raise your answers
at the count of three.

2681
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:15,900
My heart is beating so fast.

2682
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,100
(What did Se Chan write
after just seeing Yulgok?)

2683
01:27:18,610 --> 01:27:20,370
One, two, three!

2684
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:23,510
One, two, three!

2685
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:24,810
Hey!

2686
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:27,050
(Se Chan got it correct.)

2687
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:28,110
(Who is the mother of Yulgok Yi I,
Joseon's leading female painter...)

2688
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:30,320
(painted on the 50,000 won bill?
Answer: Shin Saimdang)

2689
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:32,690
(He wrote the correct answer
after seeing only 2 syllables.)

2690
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:34,990
- I wanted to do it earlier.
- I should have done it earlier.

2691
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:36,190
I should have done it earlier.

2692
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:39,490
I was there at the historic moment!

2693
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:41,030
Come on!

2694
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:44,800
(Se Chan won the brains and rewrote
the history of the Empty Heads.)

2695
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,270
I had to be safe.

2696
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:50,200
I was going to go with nine.

2697
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,470
- At the end,
- What's this?

2698
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:54,570
you got the correct answer
with just two syllables.

2699
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:57,140
- Did they turn it around?
- Team Ah Young is the first.

2700
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,780
(Team Ah Young: 43;
Team Ji Hyo: 42; Team Ye Eun: 41)

2701
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:02,080
- Great.
- In second place...

2702
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,720
In second place
is Team Ji Hyo with Jae Seok.

2703
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,220
- Team Ye Eun came in last place.
- No way.

2704
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:09,190
- With just...
- How...

2705
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:10,990
- I was going to write it.
- Unbelievable.

2706
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:13,790
We thought Se Chan
was a throwaway card.

2707
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:15,290
- We didn't think he'd get it.
- Right.

2708
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:16,460
It was a game between you two.

2709
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,730
- You really did it!
- This is a historic moment!

2710
01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:20,800
- Unbelievable.
- This is really amazing.

2711
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,000
- You did it.
- You're the best.

2712
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:25,270
You're really the best.

2713
01:28:25,270 --> 01:28:26,340
The team in first place...

2714
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:27,410
- will move first.
- It is amazing.

2715
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:29,080
- Ah Young. Your boyfriend...
- It's amazing.

2716
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:30,480
Right.

2717
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,580
- That should've won you over.
- I'm very lucky here.

2718
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:34,480
- Let's go, Ah Young.
- Let's go, Ah Young.

2719
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,180
- Okay.
- It's a comeback.

2720
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:37,780
- It's really amazing.
- My heart is beating.

2721
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:41,250
We can earn a hint now.

2722
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:47,160
(Team Ah Young managed
to find the 3 fake cards.)

2723
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:51,630
(They exchanged them
for 2 bronze cards with a higher chance.)

2724
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:53,400
We have to figure out our cards now.

2725
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,400
- Yes.
- Right. These two.

2726
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,740
- That's not the one anyway.
- That's not the one.

2727
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:57,600
There are either 2, 1,
or none at all.

2728
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,970
Among these...

2729
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:00,710
- What's correct?
- Yes.

2730
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:02,540
- How many...
- There are.

2731
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:04,810
How many are there here?

2732
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,910
- There are two.
- We've got this.

2733
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:08,250
There are two.

2734
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,280
(Cider and Chemulpo Club
were real cards.)

2735
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,280
- We've got this.
- Goodness.

2736
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,090
- Then...
- This is really amazing.

2737
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:14,790
- These...
- Seriously.

2738
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:16,590
- We're done.
- It's a relief.

2739
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:18,620
- The remaining one...
- Just one.

2740
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:19,930
We should get it.

2741
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:21,490
- Here...
- Right.

2742
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:23,660
It's either of the two.

2743
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:26,800
In my understanding,
you can't build a salt farm...

2744
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,000
on the East Sea.

2745
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,270
This is the West Sea.

2746
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:30,600
It's possible
since it's the West Sea.

2747
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
That would work.

2748
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,440
- But this...
- Do you think it's this?

2749
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,610
It could be a fake.

2750
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:36,380
- Do you think it's this?
- Me?

2751
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,410
- We can't change ours.
- I...

2752
01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:39,680
I want "cider."

2753
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:41,180
You want "cider?"

2754
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:42,620
That's...

2755
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,380
He's really thirsty.

2756
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:45,990
- I'm joking.
- That's mine.

2757
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:48,590
- It's mine.
- It's either of the two.

2758
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:50,090
This is old.

2759
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:53,260
Incheon's nightclubs are famous.

2760
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:54,930
- They're famous.
- Really?

2761
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:58,600
Diana and Zeus in Yeomchang.

2762
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,900
- Let's go with this.
- Go with it.

2763
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,070
- Take what you want.
- I'll take this.

2764
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:03,070
But don't blame us.
It's your decision.

2765
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:04,800
- It's because...
- I think it's good.

2766
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,710
the harbor here developed well.

2767
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:07,940
- Yes.
- So people enjoy nightlife.

2768
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:09,640
- Okay.
- Harbors always have nightlife.

2769
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:12,150
Okay. Let's go with this.

2770
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:13,480
(Will all the members of
Team Ah Young avoid the penalty?)

2771
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,350
- Right.
- This...

2772
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:17,450
- This...
- Goodness.

2773
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,250
(They don't know
what the real card is.)

2774
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:21,790
Would it be among
the ones we have or here?

2775
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:24,190
This is a bit...

2776
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:25,730
Soccer?

2777
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:26,790
(The golden soccer card
would be great if it was real.)

2778
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:28,190
Should we exchange the soccer one?

2779
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:29,200
- Yes.
- Yes.

2780
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:31,200
Exchange it with Daebul Hotel.

2781
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,430
- You're going to exchange it?
- Yes.

2782
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,800
- The hotel...
- Give this to me.

2783
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,400
- This isn't the one.
- I don't think it's the one.

2784
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,270
- Good.
- Yanghwajeom...

2785
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:39,310
We don't know.

2786
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:41,510
- After knowing.
- I saw the bath towel somewhere.

2787
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:42,610
After knowing.

2788
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:44,680
Should I exchange this?

2789
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:46,380
- Now...
- It has nothing to do with this.

2790
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:48,680
I'll go with this.

2791
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,920
- I don't know. But it's so boring.
- But that's...

2792
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,290
- It's not fun.
- It's in Incheon. It's so far.

2793
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:53,590
- It's not fun.
- I don't know.

2794
01:30:53,890 --> 01:30:55,890
- Okay. Let's go.
- Okay.

2795
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:58,190
- Okay.
- We're totally unlucky today.

2796
01:30:58,190 --> 01:30:59,290
(The final cards)

2797
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,260
- So...
- Goodness.

2798
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:04,160
the last card exchanges were made.

2799
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,800
The First in the City race
that explored...

2800
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,600
Incheon's very firsts
has come to an end.

2801
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,840
First, let’s check
whether each person's card...

2802
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,210
really represents...

2803
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:14,340
- Incheon's firsts.
- Please.

2804
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,370
- Please.
- Please.

2805
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:18,480
Just so you know,
the older the year of the event,

2806
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,710
the better the prize.

2807
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:22,080
- What would it be?
- Let's see.

2808
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:23,550
- Do we start from here?
- Nora Noh.

2809
01:31:23,550 --> 01:31:25,450
- You can reveal...
- Nora Noh.

2810
01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:26,690
(They verify
Ji Hyo's fashion show first.)

2811
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:28,620
- Ji Hyo's first.
- Fashion show.

2812
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:30,420
(Seoul, 1956)

2813
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:31,790
- It was 1956.
- In Seoul.

2814
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:33,090
- Okay!
- Seoul.

2815
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:34,790
- It was in Seoul.
- Okay!

2816
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:36,300
Really?

2817
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:39,300
The first-ever
Nora Noh Fashion Show,

2818
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:41,170
held in 1956...

2819
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:44,000
- was actually held...
- You'll get the penalty.

2820
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,710
- at the Bando Hotel in Seoul.
- You'll get the penalty.

2821
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:47,110
- Ji Hyo's penalty...
- The penalty.

2822
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:48,110
is drinking a cup...

2823
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:49,140
- of sophora root tea.
- Sophora root tea.

2824
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:51,240
- It's not bad.
- Right.

2825
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:52,250
It's okay.

2826
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:53,710
- It's doable.
- It's okay.

2827
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:55,380
- It's healthy.
- It's actually nice.

2828
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:57,650
My team members
recommended this to me.

2829
01:31:57,650 --> 01:31:58,680
If this works...

2830
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,820
- I wanted to take the hotel.
- You had the hotel?

2831
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:03,360
(There is only one real card
among the gold cards.)

2832
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,090
- This is so hard.
- Let's look for it.

2833
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:06,130
It will be hard.

2834
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:09,160
(If Jae Seok's is real,
Ye Eun's is fake.)

2835
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:10,600
(Would the soccer card be real?)

2836
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,270
- In the year 18...
- It's Incheon.

2837
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:16,540
(The soccer card was real!)

2838
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:18,970
I said so, right?

2839
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:20,440
It seemed like soccer would be real.

2840
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:21,640
- Soccer was first...
- Incheon.

2841
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:22,780
- introduced in Korea...
- Really?

2842
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:25,010
- From Europe.
- in Incheon in 1882.

2843
01:32:25,010 --> 01:32:26,010
I told you so.

2844
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:28,710
British troops who entered...

2845
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:30,080
through Incheon’s Jemulpo Port...

2846
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,620
- introduced the sport.
- Really?

2847
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:34,250
(Prize: 300 dollars
Onnuri gift certificate)

2848
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:36,320
- Jae Seok!
- Isn't that the best one?

2849
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,090
It's the best one
since it's the oldest one.

2850
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:40,360
It's the best one?

2851
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:41,360
I'll share it with you.

2852
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,960
- Thank you.
- It's so nice.

2853
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,060
Seriously.

2854
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:45,900
- At the end...
- The lucky ones keep getting it.

2855
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:47,170
- Yanghwajeom.
- Okay, Yanghwajeom.

2856
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:48,200
Let's see.

2857
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,340
(Jee Seok Jin)

2858
01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:51,670
- It was in Jongno-gu, Seoul.
- Okay!

2859
01:32:52,910 --> 01:32:54,040
Right.

2860
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:55,880
Jump rope.

2861
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:59,050
- No.
- The penalty is jump rope...

2862
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:00,350
- It's good for you.
- while wearing acupressure shoes.

2863
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:01,980
- It's okay.
- It's nice.

2864
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:03,820
- It's healthy.
- Yes.

2865
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:04,880
Okay.

2866
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,020
Daegu.

2867
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:08,050
- Daegu.
- Goodness.

2868
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:09,160
Would she get it?

2869
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,920
- Ink.
- Goodness.

2870
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,260
Why do I always get
penalties with ink?

2871
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:14,330
She always gets that.

2872
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:16,100
- It's the worst.
- She...

2873
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:17,560
You can't help it.

2874
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,970
- In 1981.
- The Pumbaa card I liked.

2875
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:21,870
- Pumbaa.
- Muan, South Jeolla Province.

2876
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:23,800
What's the penalty?

2877
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,040
Shall we take a look?

2878
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,370
- Okay!
- Jump rope.

2879
01:33:26,370 --> 01:33:27,440
(His penalty is jumping rope
wearing acupressure shoes.)

2880
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,670
Nice.

2881
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:30,240
- It's a relief.
- We talked a lot...

2882
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,110
about this until the end.

2883
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:34,250
You know the Italy towel
didn't come from Italy, right?

2884
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:35,920
- Right.
- But...

2885
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,620
it could have been made in Incheon.

2886
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:38,780
- From what I know,
- I heard it from somewhere.

2887
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:40,220
it was made from somewhere else.

2888
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:41,420
(Italy Towel:
The World's first Italy Towel)

2889
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:44,360
(Jae Seok remembers it
to be from Busan.)

2890
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:45,830
- From what I know,
- I heard it from somewhere.

2891
01:33:45,830 --> 01:33:47,030
it was made from somewhere else.

2892
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:48,630
(Whose guess will be correct?)

2893
01:33:48,630 --> 01:33:50,200
I think it's correct.

2894
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:52,600
- It was from Busan.
- In 1967.

2895
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,230
(Haha failed.)

2896
01:33:54,230 --> 01:33:56,240
- It was from Busan.
- We guessed it to be Busan.

2897
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,240
The real silver cards
were Daebul Hotel...

2898
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,510
- No way.
- and Gyeongin Line.

2899
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:01,910
Incheon Station, the first
railway line in South Korea.

2900
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:02,940
That's a shame.

2901
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:04,580
- All three...
- This...

2902
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:06,080
members will get the penalty.

2903
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:07,580
- Everyone gets the penalty.
- They'll all get the penalty.

2904
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:08,980
Team Ah Young.

2905
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,420
- I wanted to take that.
- I think it's Busan.

2906
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:11,480
I think it's correct.

2907
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:12,990
(It was in Incheon,
as they all knew.)

2908
01:34:12,990 --> 01:34:14,320
It's correct.

2909
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,260
- Bamboo wife.
- Goodness.

2910
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:17,860
(Her prize is a bamboo wife.)

2911
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:18,960
Thank you.

2912
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:19,960
How nice. She was lonely.

2913
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,760
- Right.
- Summer is coming too.

2914
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:22,800
Cider was...

2915
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,100
- I knew it.
- It's correct!

2916
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:26,230
- Incheon.
- I knew it.

2917
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:28,030
- He took mine.
- We'll give you...

2918
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:29,440
- a bottle of cider.
- Goodness.

2919
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:30,940
Goodness.

2920
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:32,640
I'm happy.

2921
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,870
It's the last one.

2922
01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:36,340
- Royal Arcade?
- For this...

2923
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:39,080
We earned 2 hints,
and this is 1 of the 2.

2924
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,350
- I'm nervous.
- It was a 50 percent chance.

2925
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:41,410
(It would be correct
if he guessed well.)

2926
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:45,620
(Would Daniel
avoid getting the penalty too?)

2927
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:46,850
- In 1991.
- Where?

2928
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:48,820
- Busan.
- Right. The arcade...

2929
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:50,020
(He failed.)

2930
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:51,720
- The arcade was in Busan.
- They almost succeeded.

2931
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,130
The penalty?

2932
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:54,390
(Jump rope
wearing acupressure shoes)

2933
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:56,930
(Laughing)

2934
01:34:56,930 --> 01:35:00,070
Only Daniel will receive the penalty
on this team.

2935
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:02,800
- Okay.
- Then that place earlier...

2936
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,170
Was the salt farm correct?

2937
01:35:04,170 --> 01:35:06,110
- The salt farm was correct.
- Was the salt farm correct?

2938
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:07,810
The salt farm.

2939
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:09,710
The salt farm was correct?
What a shame.

2940
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:11,410
Daebul Hotel was correct too.

2941
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:13,410
- Bamboo wife.
- The bamboo wife will be cool.

2942
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:14,750
- It's a relief.
- It's a nice...

2943
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:17,820
I get 300 dollars worth
of Onnuri gift certificates.

2944
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:18,980
(Jae Seok, who is lucky,
gets gift certificates.)

2945
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:20,320
Seriously, he's lucky.

2946
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,220
This is amazing.

2947
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:23,720
I'll take someone else...

2948
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,460
instead of the bamboo wife
next time.

2949
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:27,190
My goodness.

2950
01:35:27,190 --> 01:35:29,830
(She sticks to her character
until the very end.)

2951
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:31,860
Hey, until the end...

2952
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:33,330
Who will you take?

2953
01:35:33,370 --> 01:35:35,000
- My goodness.
- Seriously,

2954
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,470
- Ah Young is impressive.
- She's unbelievable.

2955
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:39,840
- Ah Young is amazing.
- She's really...

2956
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:41,770
The bitter taste lasts all day.

2957
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:42,910
- Really?
- Does it?

2958
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:45,710
(Seok Jin, Jong Kook, Daniel)

2959
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:47,250
(Jumping rope 15 times
wearing acupressure shoes)

2960
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:48,550
You have to finish it.

2961
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:50,220
Why is this a penalty?

2962
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:52,620
(Ye Eun: Face rubbing,
only half of it, especially for her)

2963
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:55,420
(Her teeth are rubbed too.)

2964
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:57,420
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2965
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:58,960
Thank you.

2966
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2967
01:36:00,430 --> 01:36:02,390
- Thank you.
- Thank you for today.

2968
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,760
We let the Empty Heads
study before, right?

2969
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:07,530
(During the last shoot, a match
among Empty Heads was suggested.)

2970
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,840
Let us bet piece of caramels on them
in every game.

2971
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:12,070
It's not like we are racehorses.

2972
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:13,970
(That's how the match
between the Empty Heads began.)

2973
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:16,080
(They must keep the Ice Balls intact
in the hot summer.)

2974
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,040
(Invest in the knowledge racehorse
that will escape being Empty Head!)

2975
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:20,380
(They protect the Ice Balls,
which are the seed money for today.)

2976
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:21,750
I will break Jong Kook's balls.

2977
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:24,050
(Steal and break the others'
Ice Balls as if they are yours.)

2978
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:25,420
Gosh, it's cold.

2979
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:27,120
(With the seed money
they protected with difficulty,)

2980
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,420
(the showdown
among the Empty Heads begins!)

2981
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:31,220
I will make it 20. I can do this.

2982
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:32,220
Spill all of them.

2983
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:34,230
(Let's win!)

2984
01:36:34,290 --> 01:36:35,590
(The miracle of the Ice Balls
that multiplies in no time)

2985
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:37,060
(They even get a loan
up to the maximum limit.)

2986
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,000
This question is from the past exam!

2987
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,370
This is driving me crazy.

2988
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,640
(Who is the final winner
of the Empty Head Match?)

2989
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:45,000
(The Empty Head
Avengers Competition)
