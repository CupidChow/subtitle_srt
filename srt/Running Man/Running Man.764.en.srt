1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,840
(An unexpected combination of guests
on Running Man)

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,610
(Nam Woo Hyun, Kim Ha Neul,
Lee Jun Young)

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,580
(You belong to the same agency?)

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,520
(They are 3 close friends
from the same agency.)

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,160
(The main vocalist of INFINITE
is back with his solo, "Straight.")

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,320
(Sky knows the lyrics
of his new song.)

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,290
(And there's 1 person
who can't enjoy the song.)

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,630
(The extreme introvert,
who's anxious about his turn, Jun Young)

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,730
(However)

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,070
(He suddenly changes with the beat.)

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,040
(He commands the crowd
with his finger whip.)

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,610
(And...)

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,150
(Jun Young's first solo performance
of "Man Man Ha Ni")

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,510
(Shy)

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,680
(He showcased the most
gentle version of "Man Man Ha Ni.")

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,220
(When will Ha Neul get to perform?)

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,150
(Right now)

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,690
(I can't do this.)

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,330
(Changing suddenly)

20
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,530
(She shows the dog leg dance.)

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,070
(The unexpected charm of Kim Sky,
who's good at variety shows)

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,340
(Greatly satisfied)

23
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,270
(Do you know me?)

24
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,510
(Clapping in anger)

25
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,180
(Why did you do that
when you didn't know her?)

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,480
(I can't just ignore her.)

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,250
(Giggling)

28
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,180
(She said, "Do you know me?")

29
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,280
- "Do you know me?"
- She was furious.

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,490
"Do you know me?"

31
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,620
- Please give them a big hand.
- That was nice.

32
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,190
This is how we become close.

33
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,060
Today, with the guests
who boast unexpected friendships,

34
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,160
we will have
the Roulette Battle of Weak Loyalty Race.

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,260
- What's that?
- My gosh.

36
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,400
You will fill in your names
on a large roulette with 60 slots.

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,670
When it's done, you will spin it...

38
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,070
to decide on the members
to get the prize...

39
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,910
- or the penalty.
- Oh, dear.

40
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,610
The three members,
who are picked by the roulette,

41
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,180
- will share the prize or penalty.
- Together?

42
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,250
If the final roulette
stops on an empty slot,

43
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,150
all of you will get the penalty.

44
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,520
(If it stops on an empty slot,
all of them get the penalty.)

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,660
So you must fill in the slots wisely
between loyalty and betrayal.

46
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,860
- Fill in the slots?
- They are empty now.

47
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,060
Depending on the results
of team missions,

48
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,800
you will be given the opportunity
to put your name...

49
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,670
or that of a member of your choice
on the roulette.

50
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,100
We should be nice
to the others today.

51
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,670
- You're right.
- We should win favor with others.

52
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,770
The three guests
will be the captains of each team.

53
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,910
- Really?
- We divided you...

54
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,010
into three teams in advance,
considering balance.

55
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,810
Kim Ha Neul, Yu Jae Seok
and Yang Se Chan are a team.

56
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,410
- Okay.
- Ssaebssaeb and Ha Neul.

57
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,920
She will stand out a lot today.

58
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,750
- Me?
- Yes. With the best members.

59
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,950
- They are quite...
- We're the best.

60
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,620
- We will make you stand out.
- Don't worry, Ha Neul.

61
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,160
- You'll look pretty around them.
- Yes. It's a beautiful day.

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,960
- With them on both sides.
- That's true.

63
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,130
Lee Jun Young, Jee Seok Jin,
Haha, and Song Ji Hyo...

64
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,960
- are a team.
- Good.

65
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,470
Nam Woo Hyun,
Kim Jong Kook, Choi Daniel,

66
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,670
- and Ji Ye Eun are a team.
- Okay.

67
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,340
After getting changed,
we will start the first mission.

68
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,670
- Let's go.
- Okay.

69
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,180
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It was fun.

70
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,040
- Ha Neul, it's so good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,980
I can't believe
I did the dog leg dance.

72
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,920
Hello. What is this?

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,080
What is all this?

74
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,490
- Ha Neul, here.
- Okay.

75
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,650
Ha Neul,
you should sit in the middle.

76
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,860
- Here.
- Are we in the middle?

77
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,890
- Am I here?
- We are...

78
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,790
- Yes. Sit in the middle.
- Okay.

79
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,360
(Groaning)

80
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,490
(Chuckling)

81
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,360
My gosh. You groan a lot.

82
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,100
- It's because of my age.
- I see.

83
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,400
With every movement...

84
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,770
You groan a lot
when you make movements.

85
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,710
It's because of my age. I'm sorry.

86
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,370
- Have a seat. Sit here.
- Okay.

87
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,380
All right.

88
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,910
I... Do you want to sit here?

89
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,150
- I don't mind sitting here.
- This is where you draw attention.

90
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,480
- Then I'll sit here.
- No.

91
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,280
- No, not there.
- Jun Young, this is better.

92
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,120
- He's saying that...
- Hey.

93
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,550
because he wants
to be in the center.

94
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,620
I'm sorry, Jun Young.

95
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,760
- Slap him in the face.
- Slap him?

96
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,330
- Slap him.
- Jun Young, don't mind him.

97
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,330
- Slap him.
- Spit at him.

98
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,700
Seriously...

99
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,560
- Hey.
- Can I sit at the end?

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,970
- Tell him to get lost.
- Hey.

101
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,430
- Jun Young, stay here.
- Tell him to get lost.

102
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,770
Say, "Get lost, Pouty Mouth."

103
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,340
Don't listen to him.

104
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,910
(Sighing)

105
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,910
I'm feeling dizzy.

106
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,440
Can I sit there?

107
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,180
All right. Here's the first mission.

108
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,050
The first mission is
One Mind Romance,

109
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,520
where the team members should
understand each other well.

110
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,850
- One Mind Romance.
- We like it.

111
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,020
- One Mind Romance.
- Romance.

112
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,920
After hearing the given question,
all the team members should...

113
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,990
write the same answer
in order to earn points.

114
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,690
- I see.
- If you give the same answer,

115
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,760
you get five points.

116
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,900
- Really?
- We can do that.

117
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,900
If only 2 of you give the same answer,
you get 2 points.

118
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,330
Two points? Okay.

119
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,440
Hang on. Then this team
will be at an advantage.

120
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,470
For the teams of four,

121
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,270
if three of you
give the same answer,

122
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,340
- you get points.
- Okay.

123
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,180
For the team of three, all members
should give the same answer.

124
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,150
Before you write down your answer,

125
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,550
you can briefly talk
about the criteria for your answers,

126
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,120
such as time and gender.

127
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,290
Let's say the question is,

128
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,390
"What gift do you want to get
from your lover?"

129
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,160
You can say things like,
"Am I a man or a woman?"

130
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,760
- You can discuss things like that.
- Okay. We can do that.

131
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,530
- So...
- That's acceptable.

132
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,600
That's good.

133
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,230
Based on the accumulated points,
you will be given the slots...

134
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,140
- to put on the roulette.
- Okay.

135
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,400
I'll show you...

136
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,910
- the first question then.
- All right.

137
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,940
Show us.

138
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,270
- Can we discuss?
- Just briefly.

139
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,880
I see. This... What is this?

140
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,580
Can we talk about the age?

141
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,280
- Age.
- You can talk about it.

142
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,880
- Teens and 20s.
- Age. Teens and 20s.

143
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,650
- Teens and 20s.
- Teens and 20s?

144
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,120
(The most common first kiss location
for those in their teens and 20s?)

145
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,760
- What do I do?
- You know it, right?

146
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,160
What... Is it in the daytime
or at night?

147
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,130
- Let's say it's night.
- Teenagers...

148
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,030
- Those in their teens and 20s?
- Do you remember?

149
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,230
You should study when you are
in your teens and 20s!

150
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,870
- You...
- Why would you kiss at that age?

151
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,970
- This is...
- You should study.

152
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,240
This is...

153
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,670
(At this moment)

154
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,810
(Those in their teens and 20s,
at night)

155
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,310
- You should study.
- This is the place.

156
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,510
Let's go with teens.

157
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,650
(The first kiss place
that Ye Eun chose is a playground.)

158
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,780
You know where it is, right?

159
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,480
- Teens...
- Where is it?

160
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,820
- Teens...
- It's...

161
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,750
- Not those in their 20s?
- It's a place.

162
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,220
Where should I go?

163
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
(Unlike Ye Eun, who seems confident,
the guys have no idea.)

164
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,790
- Write down your answer.
- A fairytale-like place.

165
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,220
A fairytale-like place?

166
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,260
- Okay.
- As I count to three...

167
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,160
(Daniel writes down his answer
after hearing Ye Eun's hint.)

168
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,860
This is tricky.
There are a lot of places.

169
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,870
Okay.

170
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,270
Early 20s.

171
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,270
Early 20s?

172
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,240
Something with fond memories.

173
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,700
- Fond memories?
- Fond memories.

174
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,810
A college student.

175
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,970
- A college student in love.
- A college student.

176
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,410
- A college student in love.
- I see.

177
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,610
I think I know what it is.

178
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,410
(The epitome of heartbreaking
first love in one's 20s)

179
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,920
(Where is the first kiss place...)

180
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,060
(chosen by Yeong Beom from
"When Life Gives You Tangerines?")

181
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,890
Fond memories. A college student.

182
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,430
- A college student in love.
- A college student.

183
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,860
Jae Seok, what's important
is the age.

184
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,260
- The age is important.
- Those in their 20s.

185
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,460
Let's go with the love
of those in their 30s.

186
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,700
- Okay. In their 30s.
- In their 30s?

187
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,970
- Those in their 30s.
- Okay.

188
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,270
- Those in their 20s and 30s.
- In their 30s?

189
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,070
- If that's the case...
- I get it.

190
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,540
- In their 30s.
- In their 30s.

191
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,710
(A kiss of those in their 30s?)

192
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,340
It's at night, right?

193
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,640
A place with few people.

194
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,550
Okay. In their 30s.

195
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,650
They are relatively old.

196
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,250
- Grown-ups with jobs.
- Yes.

197
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,260
- Fond memories?
- As I count to three...

198
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,320
Please write down your answers...

199
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,890
- I think this is it.
- and put it down.

200
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,330
- Please.
- Team Pink.

201
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,900
- Show us your answers.
- I think it's too common.

202
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,970
(Those in their teens and 20s,
at night)

203
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,070
(Ye Eun's answer is playground.)

204
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,770
(Did the other members also write
the same answer?)

205
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,440
All right. One, two, three.

206
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,880
- Playground!
- Playground!

207
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
(If one of them wrote "playground,"
they would succeed.)

208
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,080
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Playground.

209
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
- What?
- Playground.
(Different)

210
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,390
- What?
- I wrote playground.

211
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,120
- Hey.
- Under the street light?

212
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,920
River? Why did he write that?

213
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,620
- Right.
- Why did you write "river?"

214
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,590
- Isn't it the Han River?
- Han River?

215
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,590
- Hey.
- It's a playground.

216
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,560
What about the people
who live in other cities?

217
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,330
Do they have to come
all the way to the Han River?

218
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,500
Han River?

219
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,970
We said it was
about those in their teens.

220
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,370
- Teens.
- It's about teenagers.

221
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,540
Only juvenile delinquents
go to a playground.

222
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,570
- Hey.
- No.

223
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,440
- You can kiss at a playground.
- That's where little kids play.

224
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,480
- Why would delinquents go there?
- That's...

225
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,550
- By the way...
- Playground.

226
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,520
I think all your answers are
based on your own experiences.

227
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,520
- This is...
- Right.

228
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,990
- It's a playground.
- Obviously, it's a playground.

229
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,790
You have your first kiss
when you walk your girlfriend home.

230
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,860
Under a street light,

231
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,860
you have your first kiss.

232
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,500
It's a playground.

233
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,730
- Playground?
- It's a playground.

234
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,670
- What about you?
- Okay.

235
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,800
(Those in their early 20s,
fond memories)

236
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,440
(Team Jun Young focused on those
in their 20s who are in love.)

237
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,640
One, two, three.

238
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,580
(What's the place that Jun Young,
who is in his 20s now, chose?)

239
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,810
Karaoke.

240
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,050
One, two, three.

241
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,650
(Ji Hyo's answer is playground.)

242
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,550
- Playground.
- Karaoke.

243
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,050
(They all have different answers.)

244
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,790
- He wrote "street trees."
- Haha.

245
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,890
Under the street trees?

246
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,930
- Under the street trees?
- Hey.

247
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,460
Where did you kiss?
Under the street trees?

248
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,400
We were like ninjas.

249
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,900
When people came from here,
we moved there.

250
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,230
We moved around between the trees.

251
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,170
What's up with the bus stop?

252
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,270
Sending her off,

253
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,340
I gave her a goodbye kiss.

254
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,710
Actually,

255
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,840
- A goodbye kiss, you know.
- we made a mistake.

256
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,510
We were teenagers
in different times.

257
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,840
For Seok Jin, it is the bus stop.

258
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,750
- It's not wrong.
- "Is nobody getting off?"

259
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,780
It used to be like that.

260
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,880
For Seok Jin, it is the bus stop.

261
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,050
(Doves used to deliver
love letters then.)

262
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,820
You shouldn't think
of the bus stop now.

263
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,450
- In his time...
- It was like a waiting room.

264
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,860
We were so innocent.

265
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,960
There's a huge generation gap.

266
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,330
- I know.
- Right.

267
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,760
- Karaoke is a good one.
- What did you write, Jun Young?

268
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,860
- Karaoke.
- Karaoke is a popular spot.

269
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,130
- Did you kiss at a karaoke?
- Was it at a karaoke?

270
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,430
- A karaoke.
- Was it at a karaoke?

271
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,170
- When there was a room...
- In your 20s...

272
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,330
that only played the instrumental,

273
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,040
you used to peek.

274
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,070
(Reminiscing about the old days)

275
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,010
- I thought of karaoke too.
- Did you kiss at a karaoke?

276
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,740
- Karaoke or video room.
- I...

277
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,780
When you're in your 20s...

278
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,810
Video room?

279
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,580
- Video room?
- What's wrong with that?

280
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,150
Karaoke or video room.

281
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,250
- Karaoke...
- Video room?

282
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,150
- Video room?
- Video room?

283
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,280
Video room!

284
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
(Ha Neul is happy to hear the word.)

285
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,790
What is the video room?

286
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,820
- Is it not there anymore?
- Hey.

287
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,850
- Is it gone now?
- There's no video room now.

288
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,390
- Is it not there anymore?
- It's a DVD room.

289
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,560
It's a DVD room now?

290
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,630
- DVD rooms are gone too.
- There are multi-rooms.

291
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,690
They are gone?

292
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,060
- Let's do a better job.
- You see,

293
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,500
- it's hilarious.
- You have to adjust to us.

294
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,930
- What's wrong with the bus stop?
- Before it began, Haha said...

295
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,470
to his team, "Teenage days."

296
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,940
- He was a teen too long ago.
- But in your 20s...

297
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,240
This is for people in their 20s.
College kids.

298
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,070
- That's ridiculous.
- Gosh.

299
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,710
At least he didn't say "tavern."

300
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,740
Now, let's check...

301
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,510
- the team of three.
- Okay.

302
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,510
- We said people in their 30s.
- Yes.

303
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,820
- In 3, 2, 1.
- But it's...

304
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,850
(What's the result?)

305
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,090
(Se Chan and Ha Neul's answers match!)

306
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,590
(If Jae Seok matches them,
they all match.)

307
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,460
(Inside a car)

308
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,990
No way.

309
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,830
(Everyone has the same answer.)

310
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,030
How did it happen?

311
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,730
- It's crazy.
- I don't believe it.

312
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,400
- They got the same answers.
- It's crazy.

313
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,670
(The three of them
precisely wrote "Inside a car.")

314
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,640
- Maybe they cheated?
- No.

315
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,410
How can you cheat?

316
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,280
- We didn't cheat.
- Never.

317
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,710
I can bet my entire fortune on it.

318
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,980
- Why would you cheat?
- I can bet my entire fortune.

319
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,220
(As soon as they decided that
it was about people in their 30s,)

320
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,490
(they all wrote "Inside a car.")

321
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,220
We came up with the answers.

322
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,260
- We didn't cheat, did we?
- We didn't.

323
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,460
It's crazy, isn't it?

324
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,160
We set the subjects to
office workers in their 30s.

325
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,530
- People in their 30s.
- People in their 30s.

326
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,560
Office workers in their 30s.

327
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,330
- We all wrote just two letters.
- I know.

328
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,070
It's crazy.

329
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,330
Well done.

330
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,740
- Why kiss inside a car?
- Why would you have...

331
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,440
- your first kiss inside a car?
- Why would you kiss in a car?

332
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,870
- That's not romantic.
- Right?

333
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,710
- It's not romantic.
- People kiss a lot in a car.

334
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,580
You lower the car seat
and just go for it.

335
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,710
Hey!

336
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,840
What are you doing?

337
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,810
- You lower the car seat and go.
- Hey!

338
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,150
- Hey!
- What?

339
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,220
- Why do you lie down to kiss?
- Hey.

340
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,920
- Don't question it.
- Like this.

341
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,650
- People in their 30s are active.
- Of course. They're active.

342
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,360
- There's nowhere to go.
- It's hard to kiss elsewhere.

343
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,420
There's nowhere to go.

344
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,090
- There's nowhere to go.
- There's nowhere to go?

345
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,990
- There's nowhere to go to kiss.
- There aren't many options.

346
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,530
- Let's stop there.
- Okay.

347
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,360
Like Ha Neul said,
there's nowhere else to go.

348
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,730
There's nowhere to go.

349
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,940
Ha Neul is...

350
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,500
a very popular celebrity,
so it's understandable.

351
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,870
But what about you two?

352
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,070
What about us?

353
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,070
Were you popular then?

354
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,010
The ladies refused...

355
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,280
- to kiss them outside.
- They were embarrassed.

356
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,380
They were embarrassed.

357
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,210
(The ladies refused to kiss them outside.
They were embarrassed.)

358
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,280
(Awkward laugh)

359
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,320
Why would you say that?

360
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,820
- That's ridiculous.
- They were afraid to be seen.

361
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,190
- Embarrassed of us?
- They were afraid to be seen...

362
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,320
by their friends.

363
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,460
Aren't you offended?

364
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,620
- You are unbelievable.
- Come on.

365
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,090
- They were afraid to be seen.
- Why would they kiss in the car...

366
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,360
- that's been tinted?
- Why did you kiss inside a car?

367
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,230
They were charming,
so the girls agreed to date.

368
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,330
They agreed to date.

369
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,700
- But they were embarrassed?
- They were embarrassed.

370
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,830
They were afraid to be caught.

371
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,170
Ha Neul, do you care
about men's appearances?

372
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,970
- I do.
- You do?

373
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,700
- She cares.
- It's the number one priority.

374
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,210
- It's the first requirement.
- She's honest.

375
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,740
- She is honest.
- It's a given.

376
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,680
I am sorry.
You care about men's appearances,

377
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,740
and yet we made
those two sit on your sides.

378
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,550
- We are very sorry.
- It's okay.

379
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,780
- It's okay.
- Right.

380
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,450
- What did you just do?
- What did you just do?

381
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,820
(She restricts her vision.)

382
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,520
- Hey.
- Ha Neul.

383
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,690
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

384
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,820
- What are you doing?
- Did she just block her vision?

385
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,060
You will feel better that way.

386
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,760
(Blocking her vision
ends up making her dizzy.)

387
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,560
By the way, we are the only team
that got the same answers.

388
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,930
(Team Ha Neul gets the right answers
and earns 5 points.)

389
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,470
We got two matching answers.

390
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,540
You get two points.

391
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,800
- Two points.
- Two points are good.

392
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,140
They are three after all.

393
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,640
- We have to get the answers.
- We have to now.

394
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,670
I will match my answer to yours.

395
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,880
- You have to match.
- Okay.

396
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,940
It all comes down to...

397
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,010
the setting.

398
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,010
- Yes.
- The age range matters.

399
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
Here's another question.

400
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
"What's the most
you'd spend on a blind date..."
"when you're not into the person?"

401
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,780
- This is tricky.
- "What's the most you'd spend..."

402
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,950
"on a blind date
when you're not into the person?"

403
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,290
- This is tricky.
- The maximum amount?

404
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,320
(It's a question that needs
more detailed parameters.)

405
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,090
- People in their 20s, perhaps?
- People in their 20s?

406
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,860
But they are poor.

407
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,030
They are broke.

408
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,600
Should we decide on a year?

409
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,830
(Team Ha Neul chooses
people in their 20s.)

410
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,130
What year is it?

411
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,370
We can't guess what they think now.

412
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,840
- Not the 20s now.
- That's hard.

413
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,540
How about 20 years ago?

414
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,310
- Or 15 years ago?
- Year 2000.

415
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,340
How about
when the 2002 World Cup was held?

416
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,980
During the 2002 World Cup.

417
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,240
Oh, dear.

418
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,450
That's 20 years ago. Year 2002.

419
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,320
- It's during the World Cup.
- Okay.

420
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,220
(Back when Jae Seok rose to fame
with Fearsome Kungkungtta)

421
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,190
This is when both were broke.

422
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,690
(Back when Ha Neul rose
to fame with her iconic line)

423
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,430
Se Chan, I was really broke
when I was in my early 20s.

424
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,960
In your 20s?

425
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,230
But the blind date part
is important too.

426
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,660
(How much would you spend
on your date when you're broke?)

427
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,100
Oh, dear.

428
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,400
Why is this so nerve-racking?

429
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,500
- It's when you're broke.
- Right.

430
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,900
Gosh.

431
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,570
I should pick the right price range.

432
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,370
- The 2002 World Cup.
- How much do you hate your date?

433
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,180
Should we say you don't want
to spend another minute together?

434
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,810
- Should we?
- Should we?

435
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,010
But you shouldn't
forget your manners.

436
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,110
- You have to be polite.
- You already met.

437
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,780
- You will only go for one round.
- Just one round.

438
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,250
- Coffee shop.
- Right.

439
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,350
That's it.

440
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,190
- So you're petty.
- Right.

441
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,920
- We're petty.
- Petty?

442
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,190
- Are we in 2025?
- We are in 2025.

443
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,690
- We are in 2025?
- We are in 2025.

444
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,590
The current price then.

445
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,660
Current price.

446
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,660
- Current price.
- Today's exchange rate.

447
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,760
Today's exchange rate.

448
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,830
- We are not that poor.
- We are in 2002.

449
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,830
- We are in 2002.
- We make enough money.

450
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,170
We make enough money.

451
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,710
A man who earns
more than 60,000 dollars annually.

452
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,170
- Did you say 60,000 dollars?
- Annual salary of 60,000 dollars?

453
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,110
(It's 2025, and it's a man who earns
more than 60,000 dollars a year.)

454
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,480
(They specified his annual salary
to raise the chance.)

455
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,910
A man who earns
more than 60,000 dollars annually.

456
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,020
Maybe this is too little
for a man like him.

457
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,580
How do you know it?

458
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,050
- Please put your answer down.
- Okay.

459
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,850
- Let's start with this team.
- They first?

460
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,590
- I just went with my intuition.
- Here we go.

461
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,290
- In 3, 2, 1.
- In 3, 2, 1.

462
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,260
- Go. Okay!
- Here. Okay!

463
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,630
(Daniel and Jong Kook
both wrote 30 dollars.)

464
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,600
(Ye Eun didn't get
a matching answer.)

465
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,570
(They would succeed
if Woo Hyun wrote 30 dollars!)

466
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,700
I wrote ten dollars.

467
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,940
They wrote 30 dollars. Gosh.

468
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,370
- I wrote 10 dollars. 30 dollars.
- Two people matched.

469
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,110
- Thirty dollars is a lot.
- How much?

470
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,940
By the way,
you are very tight-fisted.

471
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
What?

472
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,540
You said your annual salary
is 60,000 dollars.

473
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,850
What if you earn
60,000 dollars a year?

474
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,510
How can you only spend 30 dollars
when you earn 60,000 dollars?

475
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,550
Even if I earn 60,000 dollars,
I don't like my blind date.

476
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,650
And he's busy.

477
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,920
He earns 60,000 dollars a year.
He must be very busy.

478
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,190
- That's too little, isn't it?
- He must work a lot.

479
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,960
I wrote 30 dollars for this reason.

480
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,460
- You would eat, right?
- Right.

481
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,590
You have to order something
that's at least 15 dollars...

482
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,060
- to have a proper meal.
- Right.

483
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,230
We will have a meal,
but skip the coffee.

484
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,100
- The date ends after the meal?
- We will have the meal, water,

485
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,300
talk for a while, and leave.

486
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,170
(Daniel's blind date scenario)

487
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,500
- Is water the sign?
- Yes.

488
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,870
- Water.
- That means you don't like her.

489
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,010
That's that. But wait.

490
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,340
- Woo Hyun.
- You drink water and go.

491
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,310
Why did you write ten dollars?

492
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,480
He earns 60,000 dollars.
Why would you spend 10 dollars?

493
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,910
- What's up with 10 dollars?
- Just 10 dollars?

494
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,120
What would you eat with it?

495
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,150
- Explain to us.
- What would you have?

496
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,720
That's how much
two cups of coffee cost.

497
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,020
You would end it with coffee.

498
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,420
- Just 2 cups of coffee.
- You would order just 2 cups.

499
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,860
You will be paying for everything?

500
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,090
- You're great.
- It's a blind date.

501
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,230
Why would you say he's great
when he's only spending ten dollars?

502
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,430
I think it's great.

503
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,760
It's just ten dollars,
but he's paying for everything.

504
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,600
He's paying for all.

505
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,300
I'd have coffee too.

506
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,870
Coffee and cake.

507
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,140
- One cake.
- But just one spot, right?

508
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,170
- Yes.
- Right.

509
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,340
- Just one spot.
- No next time.

510
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,770
- One place.
- You need at least 30 dollars.

511
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,810
- Two people wrote 30 dollars.
- Right. Our answers matched.

512
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,410
- You're great.
- Nice one.

513
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,750
- Let's see.
- Let's look at theirs now.

514
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,850
- Team Jun Young.
- It's our turn.

515
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,950
In 3, 2, 1.

516
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,090
- He wrote 16 dollars?
- He wrote 16 dollars?

517
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,290
That's so little.

518
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,390
- He wrote 16 dollars?
- He wrote 16 dollars?

519
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,020
(Ha Neul was laughing
at Jun Young's amount.)

520
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,090
(What did she see?)

521
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,360
You wrote 8.40 dollars?

522
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,630
(He said they would go
with 2025 prices, but...)

523
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,200
- What is that?
- You wrote 8.40 dollars?

524
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,530
- You are unbelievable.
- He wrote 8.40 dollars.

525
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,670
(He's the only one
who went with the old price.)

526
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,100
- He wrote 8.40 dollars.
- Look.

527
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,440
- How did you come up with that?
- With 8.40 dollars, you can...

528
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,010
This is good for 2 cups
of coffee and 1 piece of cake.

529
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,440
- How can you have a cake?
- You can't have a cake.

530
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,780
- You can't afford a cake.
- You can.

531
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,220
What you had was yakgwa.
That's not cake.

532
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,480
A cup of coffee costs 1.80 dollars.

533
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,720
- That's a mini yakgwa too.
- Look.

534
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,290
- It was a mini yakgwa?
- It was a mini yakgwa.

535
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,160
- Honestly, in my time,
- Think carefully.

536
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,730
I only needed about 60 cents.

537
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,190
(Honestly, in my time,
I only needed about 60 cents.)

538
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,460
Two cups of coffee
from a vending machine.

539
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,930
If I like her...

540
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,800
You go straight to a stable.

541
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,240
A stable?

542
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,770
Why did you write 16 dollars,
Jun Young?

543
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,980
I thought we would get
two cups of coffee...

544
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,280
- and a piece of cake.
- It...

545
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,910
That's 16 dollars?

546
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,910
Team Ha Neul will go last.

547
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,580
This is how much I carried
when I had a blind date at the time.

548
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,390
I was broke,
but I still carried this much.

549
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,490
- When was it?
- I carried 50 dollars.

550
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,260
- What?
- It's 50 dollars.

551
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,090
(50 dollars back in the day?)

552
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,460
- When?
- In 2002?

553
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,460
In 2002.

554
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,770
- Did you usually pay to date?
- I carried at least 80...

555
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,670
I carried at least about 80 dollars.

556
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,000
You gave her 20 dollars first...

557
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,500
and begged her
to date you for an hour.

558
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,940
- Why else would he need 50 dollars?
- There's an entrance fee.

559
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,940
- The entrance fee.
- Right?

560
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,240
Ha Neul, why are you
covering your face to laugh?

561
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,350
- He had to...
- Why are you hiding your face?

562
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,410
pay to date a girl.

563
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,620
- He had to pay an entry fee.
- An entry fee?

564
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,480
Why else would he carry
that much money?

565
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,090
- I precisely carried 80 dollars.
- And 30 dollars...

566
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,590
I spent 50 dollars.

567
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,060
And 30 dollars...

568
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,490
And I used 30 dollars
for my transportation.

569
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,960
- He paid the entry fee.
- The entry fee.

570
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,160
"The entry fee."

571
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,800
How much did you write?

572
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,060
- There must be a entry fee.
- I wrote 30 dollars.

573
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,430
You wrote 30 dollars. Right.

574
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,130
- How much did you write?
- It has to be 30 dollars.

575
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,270
I wrote 3.50 dollars.

576
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,270
What?

577
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,500
Listen.

578
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,870
- You're unbelievable.
- Listen.

579
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,940
- You're crazy.
- You're not a human.

580
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,210
I am a human.

581
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,380
We were in 2002.

582
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,310
- We went with the 2002 prices.
- You were in 2002?

583
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,450
In 2002, I was
in the first year of high school.

584
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,010
- Right.
- You were a high school freshman.

585
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,220
I got less than ten dollars a month.

586
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,820
I said you were in your 20s.

587
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,020
- You're in 2002 and in your 20s?
- Yes.

588
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,450
I thought about how old I was then.

589
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,590
- I was a high school freshman.
- If you are a high school student,

590
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,320
you should carry five dollars.

591
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,960
I figured I should pay for a meal.

592
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,160
Why would you eat a meal
with that person?

593
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,060
Your date might not want
to have a meal with you.

594
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,200
We wouldn't eat a meal.

595
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,270
- Don't be selfish.
- Come on.

596
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,500
You should at least have a meal...

597
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,770
since you both
made the effort to come.

598
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,170
With someone you don't like?

599
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,010
I came all the way from Suyu-ri.

600
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,270
You should eat separately.

601
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,280
You should at least eat a meal
when you go into town.

602
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,780
- Why would you eat a meal?
- Your date...

603
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,280
already picked up her purse,

604
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,380
ready to leave.

605
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,520
You should
at least spend 50 dollars.

606
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,950
- We failed.
- Fifty dollars is too much.

607
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,080
I didn't hear you say "20s."

608
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,690
- Twenties.
- We got it right.

609
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,650
- Nicely done.
- Thirty dollars.

610
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,860
- Yes. Thirty dollars was perfect.
- Exactly.

611
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,030
Director, I have something to say.

612
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,230
- There's something off about them.
- That was unfair...

613
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,160
because coffee was 20 cents...

614
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,960
back when he was younger.

615
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,730
- I said the year was 2025.
- Please consider that.

616
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,740
He lived in a world that was
completely different from ours.

617
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,500
I said the year was 2025.

618
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,510
It's hard to get the number right...

619
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,240
because we're thinking
of different eras.

620
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,010
- How about this? Jun Young,
- Now,

621
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,980
- I'll give you the next question.
- let's match it to Seok Jin.

622
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,250
- Would you like to do that?
- We'll match it to Seok Jin.

623
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,980
- We can do this.
- Sure.

624
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,850
Here's your question.

625
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,950
- Your partner.
- Your partner.

626
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,520
- A friend of the opposite gender.
- Where can they meet?

627
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,660
- Your partner.
- Where would you be okay with...

628
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,890
(Where would you be okay
with your partner...)

629
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,020
(meeting a friend
of the opposite gender alone?)

630
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,290
Just the two of them?

631
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,630
- Just the two of them?
- With my romantic partner?

632
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,160
My girlfriend's meeting a man
that isn't me?

633
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,430
Where would you be okay
with your girlfriend going alone...

634
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,530
- With a male friend?
- with a male friend?

635
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,770
This shows how understanding
you can be.

636
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,330
The place you'll be okay
with them going.

637
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,840
- How much can I tolerate?
- Unbelievable.

638
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,100
Why would they be meeting alone?

639
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,140
I hate this situation.

640
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,310
Where is it acceptable...

641
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,340
for my girlfriend
to go with another man?

642
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,340
My partner and a friend
of the opposite gender?

643
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,610
- Let's say it's my wife.
- That's right.

644
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,350
- It's not your wife.
- Can she...

645
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,150
Who else could I think of it being,
since I don't have a girlfriend?

646
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,250
Think that you're in your 20s.

647
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,160
- My 20s?
- That's right.

648
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,060
- Should we go back to our 20s?
- Where can they meet?

649
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,790
- Let's go back to our 20s.
- Yes, to our 20s.

650
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,130
- Go back to our 20s.
- To our 20s?

651
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,500
If I were back in my 20s?

652
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,700
Are we going back
to when I was in my 20s?

653
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,370
Is it my 20s or yours?

654
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,840
(Just now, they agreed
to match it to Seok Jin.)

655
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,940
(Sighing)

656
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,370
(Team Jun Young:
Seok Jin's generation, 20s)

657
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,540
(Right then,
Jun Young writes down his answer.)

658
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,280
Where can I allow them
to be alone together?

659
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,110
- How much of this can I tolerate?
- Tell me about it.

660
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,180
(Will Team Jun Young be able
to overcome the generation gap...)

661
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,120
(among the members this time?)

662
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,690
- We should keep it tight.
- Let's be conservative.

663
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,920
Of course, we should be
conservative about this.

664
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,160
- Absolutely.
- Be conservative.

665
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,130
- Be conservative.
- Then it can be only one place.

666
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,260
Picture yourself in your 20s,
deeply in love.

667
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,260
Twenties... What?

668
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,960
Picture yourself in your 20s,
deeply in love.

669
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,300
You'd be head over heels for her.

670
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,700
This is the only option.

671
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,530
(Team Ha Neul:
Conservative, Early 20s)

672
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,570
I just hate it.

673
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,700
(They write down their answers
pretty quickly.)

674
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,270
I hate the situation, but...

675
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,840
(Team Ha Neul:
Conservative, Early 20s)

676
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,540
- I picked an adequate place.
- I'm done.

677
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,580
(Will Team Ha Neul get
another unanimous answer?)

678
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,240
- Did you write yours down, Ha Neul?
- I did.

679
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,750
- Go with a conventional answer.
- Think conventional.

680
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,920
- Think conventional.
- Think conventional.

681
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,820
You know what it should be.

682
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,620
- That place.
- It's a meeting spot.

683
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,950
- That's the place.
- Maybe later.

684
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,860
(Jong Kook also wrote down "cafe!")

685
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,660
(They will get it
if one more person writes cafe.)

686
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,100
- I think we'll get it this time.
- I'm sure of it too.

687
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,770
- This is harder than expected.
- Lower your sketchbooks.

688
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,970
- We'll start with the pink team.
- This was a tough one.

689
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,970
- All right.
- We can get this one.

690
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,410
- I'm sure of it.
- One, two, three.

691
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,770
- This is the place.
- A cafe.

692
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,080
- I'm sure of it.
- One, two, three.

693
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,240
This is the place.

694
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,050
- That's it, a cafe.
- A cafe?

695
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,410
Who meets at an arcade?

696
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,310
- You wrote that to be funny!
- Of course not.

697
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,480
Was "cafe" the correct answer?

698
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,050
(What did Woo Hyun write down?)

699
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,120
- This is the place.
- A cafe.

700
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,390
- That's it, a cafe.
- A cafe.

701
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,960
- The three of you wrote "cafe,"
- We did it.

702
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,490
- and will win five points
- We scored!

703
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,060
- Nicely done.
- Okay.

704
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,300
- The three of us got it.
- Come on.

705
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,800
Why would they go to an arcade?

706
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,000
- That's worse.
- You can make so many memories...

707
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,100
at an arcade!

708
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,570
- Really?
- You get closer playing games.

709
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,840
- While playing games,
- Really?

710
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,900
- they'll bump shoulders and stuff.
- Exactly.

711
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,070
(Laughing)

712
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,810
Bump shoulders and stuff?

713
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,840
Jong Kook,

714
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,880
hasn't it been a while
since you went on dates?

715
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,910
- What?
- What should it be?

716
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,580
- I mean...
- I've been on dates at an arcade.

717
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,680
It's been a while
since you went on a date.

718
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,120
I've been on dates at an arcade,
and there's a lot of touching...

719
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,820
and throwing hoops.

720
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,290
- Jong Kook, I have a lot to ask,
- I think he has a point.

721
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,490
but I'm choosing not to.

722
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,790
(He holds that expression upon
hearing about Jong Kook dating.)

723
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,330
- An arcade is a good dating spot.
- I'll let it slide.

724
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,230
- Whatever.
- We'll check your answers next.

725
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,400
- Our team?
- Yes.

726
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,800
- One, two, three.
- What did you write down?

727
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,070
- A park bench, a coffee shop.
- A coffee shop?

728
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,940
(Ji Hyo wrote coffee shop
but changed her answer.)

729
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,970
(What about Haha?)

730
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,710
- What did you write down?
- Outside my house.

731
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,840
- Seriously?
- Come on.

732
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,040
Outside my house?

733
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,810
Why would they meet
outside your house?

734
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,280
It's even worse if they meet there.

735
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,620
- That's weird.
- Ji Hyo.

736
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,620
- How can you let them go...
- Outside my house.
to a playground...

737
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,190
when that's where you kiss?

738
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,760
- What's with that?
- Ji Hyo, that's just wrong.

739
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,590
- What's that about?
- He has a point.

740
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,360
They'll talk and then kiss.

741
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,230
- Playgrounds are dangerous.
- True.

742
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,530
A park bench is just as weird.

743
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,230
- How is that weird?
- Why would they meet there?

744
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,670
What's so bad about a park bench?

745
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,400
- Back then...
- It's hard to even find one.

746
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,440
There weren't as many cafes
as we have these days.

747
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,510
- They had to go to Tapgol Park.
- As if.

748
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,970
- Actually...
- Tapgol Park.

749
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,980
- I'll designate a bench,
- They met a lot at benches.

750
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,040
and tell them to talk
at the bench and leave.

751
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,410
- At the park?
- They can feed the pigeons.

752
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,450
- Exactly.
- Right?

753
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,220
When I think of you,
I keep thinking of watermills.

754
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,190
Are you kidding me?

755
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,860
Our team decided to be conservative,

756
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,290
but a cafe...

757
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,460
- can be too broad a term.
- What? How so?

758
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,900
- Really?
- What kind of life...

759
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,960
- have you been living?
- I'm curious too.

760
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,900
- What did you write down?
- Show us.

761
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,630
- Briefly, on a main street...
- On a main street...

762
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,400
- bustling with people.
- bustling with people.

763
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,100
- On a main street.
- On a main street.

764
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,510
(Appalled)

765
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,280
- Seriously?
- He's the jealous type.

766
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,010
- Are you kidding me?
- You get too jealous.

767
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,250
They can meet briefly
to exchange things...

768
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,150
on a street bustling with people.

769
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,780
- He's really conservative.
- That's conservative.

770
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,180
- They can't go anywhere inside.
- He's really conservative.

771
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,250
- Wear hanbok, why don't you?
- I was being conservative.

772
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,990
- That's really conservative.
- Hanbok?

773
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,120
- Wear a gat for crying out loud.
- Hanbok?

774
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,290
How does that make sense?

775
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,830
- I want to know what Ha Neul wrote.
- A cafe.

776
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,960
- A cafe.
- What a relief.

777
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,660
- A coffee shop.
- Two of them matched.

778
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,100
- That's a relief.
- Good job.

779
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,900
- That's a relief.
- Right.

780
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,270
A coffee shop is the only choice.

781
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,840
Of course, it should be
a coffee shop.

782
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,200
- Ye Eun, are you sure?
- Are you sure about that?

783
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,500
- Yes.
- Ye Eun.

784
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,640
Let's say they went
to a franchise coffee shop.

785
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,040
- There's an empty table,
- Right.

786
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,940
so they sat next to each other.

787
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,550
- No way.
- That's a red flag.

788
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,080
- No way.
- Really?

789
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,020
That's a red flag.

790
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,290
- Really?
- She's on the conservative side.

791
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,490
- No way.
- What if it's a cafe...

792
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,560
- You can't allow that?
- They can't sit side by side.

793
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,290
Ha Neul's against it too.
Can't they sit side by side?

794
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,730
- Not side by side.
- What about on opposite sides?

795
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,260
- Not side by side.
- Sit on opposite sides.

796
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,230
What if there are no other seats?

797
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,630
- They should go somewhere else.
- They should go somewhere else.

798
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,970
- They should go somewhere else.
- Exactly.

799
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,600
- Should they have to move?
- Somewhere else?

800
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,970
- Of course.
- They should go somewhere else.

801
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,040
How can they sit next to each other?

802
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,070
- It makes no sense.
- Is that really necessary?

803
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,870
Jun Young, can you allow them
to be at a cafe?

804
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,440
Cafes are the limit
of what I can allow.

805
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,950
- Is it the cut line?
- Yes, it's the cut line.

806
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,020
What if they ordered one drink
and shared with two straws?

807
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,680
That's insane!

808
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,150
- That's absurd.
- I can't allow that.

809
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,190
Then you shouldn't have written cafe
as your answer.

810
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,690
- They should each order a drink.
- Come on.

811
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,360
They're broke...

812
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,860
and could only afford one drink.

813
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,500
- No way.
- What if they're broke?

814
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,600
Why can't you share a drink
with your friend?

815
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,070
- You have to be close to share.
- Why write down "cafe" then?

816
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,040
But they're friends.

817
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,200
- No way.
- Ha Neul, what about this?

818
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,210
Can they have drinks at 1 p.m.?

819
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,340
- No way.
- No day drinking?

820
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,380
- Absolutely not.
- Can't they drink during the day?

821
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,010
- No way.
- Never?

822
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,210
- Why not? It's during the day.
- They can't have drinks.

823
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,280
Why can't they have drinks?

824
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,750
Of course, they can't have drinks.

825
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,820
(She scolds him.)

826
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,320
That was scary.

827
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,790
Hold on. It's not like...

828
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,060
She sounded genuinely sour.

829
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,190
She almost said, "Do you know me?"

830
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,660
- "They can't have drinks."
- "They can't have drinks."

831
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,930
- That was terrifying.
- You're quite strict.

832
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,770
- She's strict.
- They can't have drinks.

833
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,370
Raise your hand
if you can allow that.

834
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,140
- Can the two friends drink?
- They can't have drinks.

835
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,710
They can have a glass of wine.

836
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,840
- Wine's fine.
- A glass of beer.

837
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,680
They can have a glass of wine
with a meal.

838
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,740
- But...
- Why are you pretending...

839
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,810
to be open-minded?

840
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,850
(Groaning)

841
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,550
(He was caught pretending
to be open-minded.)

842
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,550
- As if.
- He's very open-minded.

843
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,020
He's pretending to be open-minded.

844
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,190
Even if you try to prevent it,

845
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,090
those who want to cheat
will find a way.

846
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,190
- They shouldn't have wine.
- No way.

847
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,800
We managed to get one right.

848
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,230
Please give us the next question.

849
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,400
It's the last one.

850
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,800
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

851
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,930
- The last one.
- This is fun.

852
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,070
Let's get this one right.

853
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,040
- I think we're doomed.
- Separate straws.

854
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,870
- This is a tough one.
- What item would put you off...

855
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,210
- if you saw it...
- If you saw it...

856
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,510
at your partner's house?

857
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,910
Another man.

858
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,480
You know what it is.

859
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,680
Let's go with a teenager.

860
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
- I'm clueless.
- A teenager?

861
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,080
(Team Woo Hyun:
A teenage boy's house)

862
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,050
- I have no idea.
- The girlfriend...

863
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,150
- would be appalled.
- She'd be alarmed.

864
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,090
- Okay.
- Adult magazines.

865
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,520
- What's that?
- Saggy underwear.

866
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,860
- One, two, three.
- Think of a high school boy.

867
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,300
- Adult magazines.
- That's the one.

868
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,230
- That's it. We got it.
- Pornography.

869
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,830
- The three of us got it.
- What did he write?

870
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,270
- Okay, that's it.
- Adult videos.

871
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,630
Go with an item
that reminds you of your dad.

872
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,540
(Team Ha Neul went with something
that reminds you of your dad.)

873
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,540
- A razor.
- A razor?

874
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,170
- A dirty ashtray...
- What's that?

875
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,840
- Come on.
- with spit inside.

876
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,040
(Jae Seok wrote ashtray.)

877
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,380
- Because he smokes?
- That's from the old days.

878
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,650
Think of a dirty ashtray
that hasn't been cleaned in a while.

879
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,880
See? Jae Seok and I
had the same idea.

880
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,220
- An ashtray.
- An ashtray.

881
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,390
A glass ashtray.

882
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,690
- Who would think of an ashtray?
- A glass ashtray.

883
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,920
Wouldn't this put you off?
Athlete's foot ointment.

884
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,090
Come on.

885
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,390
Doesn't athlete's foot ointment
put you off?

886
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,760
- How so?
- Wouldn't that put you off?

887
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,300
- That wouldn't put me off.
- Athlete's foot ointment...

888
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,000
- that's for severe cases.
- You have a point.

889
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Wouldn't that put you off?

890
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,040
- Our teamwork is terrible.
- We don't click at all.

891
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
They don't click.

892
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,070
The game has ended,
and in first place is...

893
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,740
- I bet it's us.
- Sixteen.

894
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,370
- It's Team Woo Hyun.
- Really?

895
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,040
(14 points,
1st place, Team Woo Hyun)

896
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,140
- Nice.
- Isn't it us?

897
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,110
- Isn't it us?
- Isn't it us?

898
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,250
Team Ha Neul finished
in second place.

899
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,920
What a bummer.

900
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,890
Team Jun Young finished
in third place.

901
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,190
- They barely got any right.
- Park bench, playground...

902
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,420
There's too big a generation gap.

903
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,190
It was tough to get any right.

904
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,530
Your mind was stuck
at the watermill.

905
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,160
- Jun Young.
- Yes?

906
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,830
You don't have
to pull this forward anymore.

907
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,400
- Are you not fond of me?
- I am.

908
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:19,070
You'll now place your names
on the roulette.

909
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,240
Two from each team
will come forward...

910
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,740
one at a time,

911
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,770
and place any name of their choice
on a slot.

912
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,280
The first-place team
can fill five slots...

913
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,010
with their own names,

914
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,920
three with teammates' names,

915
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,050
and one with a name...

916
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,120
from another team.

917
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,420
If the roulette falls
on an empty slot,

918
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,790
everyone is penalized.

919
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,390
- We must fill every slot.
- Everyone is penalized.

920
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,030
- It's a serious penalty.
- We must fill the slots.

921
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,400
Whether you put your name,
the name of your teammate,

922
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,700
or the name of someone
on another team...

923
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,070
decides how many slots you can fill.

924
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,140
We don't know what it is.

925
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,440
It's hard because we don't know
if we'll get a prize or a penalty.

926
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,270
- Yes, someone on another team.
- Someone else.

927
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,110
- Who on another team?
- Who shall we go for?

928
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,210
(Team Woo Hyun
will pick someone on another team.)

929
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,240
- Yes.
- Who?

930
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,310
- Yes.
- Ha Neul.

931
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,650
Since they're a guest.

932
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,020
Woo Hyun's the captain,
so Woo Hyun and...

933
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,050
Ye Eun, you two go.

934
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,390
Sounds good.

935
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,020
- I'll go first.
- Go for it.

936
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,060
(How will each team fill the slots?)

937
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:17,590
(1st place: My name 5 slots,
Our team 3, Another team 1)

938
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,330
(Sighing)

939
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,530
This is tough.

940
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,070
(This is tough.)

941
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,530
It's really tough.

942
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,440
(He wanted to go for Ha Neul,
but now he's pondering?)

943
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,810
What's taking him so long?

944
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,840
- It's weird, isn't it?
- Yes.

945
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,740
- It's weird.
- Yes.

946
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,110
He should be back by now.

947
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,880
- I'll go, then.
- Check on him.

948
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,050
(1st place: My name 5 slots,
Our team 3, Another team 1)

949
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,290
Okay, I've decided.

950
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,790
(1st place: My name 5 slots,
Our team 3, Another team 1)

951
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,690
(He picked up his team's stickers.)

952
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,130
(Instead of going for Ha Neul,
he'll put his teammates' names.)

953
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,100
(Our team: 3 slots)

954
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,400
(One slot each for his teammates
excluding himself)

955
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,140
- You're done?
- Yes.

956
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,770
It's weird how you took so long.

957
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,110
- Yes.
- They asked me something.

958
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,110
- Putting up one sticker...
- One sticker took that long?

959
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,310
Ye Eun will check anyway.

960
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,650
(1st place: My name 5 slots,
Our team 3, Another team 1)

961
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,680
What's this?

962
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,580
He put these up?

963
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,250
(Woo Hyun's actions
are clearly visible.)

964
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,220
How many slots for my team?

965
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,220
Three.

966
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,320
I'll go with my team.

967
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,390
(Our team: 3 slots)

968
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,160
Woo Hyun, Jong Kook, Daniel.

969
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,960
Woo Hyun, Jong Kook, Daniel.

970
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,530
On number 59,

971
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
one, and three.

972
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,970
Let's play. Rock-paper-scissors.

973
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,270
(Se Chan's out.)

974
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,410
I'm done for.
Jae Seok, consider our team.

975
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,680
- This game...
- Once you're there,

976
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,540
- it becomes a war zone.
- If I put my name up there,

977
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,380
it becomes a disadvantage
if we end up with a penalty.

978
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,250
Right now, targeting another team...

979
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,280
That works.

980
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,590
We don't have to
put our names up there.

981
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,190
People on the other teams
will target us too.

982
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,220
- Yes. That would be best.
- Yes.

983
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,690
We target another team?

984
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,890
Yes, another team.

985
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,800
(2nd place: My name 4 slots,
Our team 2, Another team 1)

986
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,430
I can fill just one slot if I choose
someone from another team, right?

987
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,300
What do I do?

988
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,500
(2nd place: My name 4 slots,
Our team 2, Another team 1)

989
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,940
It's important to fill the board,
so I'll go with my team.

990
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,540
I'm too scared
to put my name up there.

991
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,110
(I'm too scared.)

992
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,540
I'll go with Se Chan.

993
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,050
- On 11 and 12.
- Slots 11 and 12.

994
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,210
(Her teammate Se Chan got 2 slots.)

995
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,210
(Cheerful betrayal complete)

996
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,320
Am I done?

997
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,180
(Cheerful betrayal complete)

998
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,390
(Se Chan)

999
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,690
(2nd place: My name 4 slots,
Our team 2, Another team 1)

1000
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:26,020
(He discovers Kim Sky's betrayal.)

1001
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,520
This is just...

1002
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,230
It's not at all what we discussed.

1003
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:35,060
(2nd place: My name 4 slots,
Our team 2, Another team 1)

1004
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,370
(Thoughtfully inhaling)

1005
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:41,170
(2nd place: My name 4 slots,
Our team 2, Another team 1)

1006
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,910
Two Ha Neuls, please.

1007
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,910
(2 Ha Neuls, please.)

1008
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,740
I'll put them on 22 and 23.

1009
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,240
(He punishes her immediately.)

1010
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,210
Hey, you go, Jun Young.

1011
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,720
I trust your decision.

1012
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,590
What do we do?
Do we put our names up?

1013
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,850
I'll put my name on it.

1014
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:57,890
(After Jun Young,
it's Seok Sam who volunteered!)

1015
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,220
This is a hard decision.

1016
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,590
(3rd place: My name 4 slots,
Our team 2 slots)

1017
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,660
I think...

1018
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,100
(Our team: 2 slots)

1019
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,960
we'll end up spinning for a penalty.

1020
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,300
So just in case...

1021
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,500
(Seok Jin gets 2 slots.)

1022
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,170
I think...

1023
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,510
he confused us a great deal.

1024
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,610
My 20s or your 20s?

1025
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,710
I feel bad,

1026
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,950
but I chose Seok Jin.

1027
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,650
I'm a fan. He's the eldest,
so slot number one.

1028
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,190
(He's still kind of polite.)

1029
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,590
(Hey!)

1030
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,800
I just realized that he's up next.

1031
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,130
(He failed to consider
the next person.)

1032
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,330
I'm sorry.

1033
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,440
(He failed to consider
the next person.)

1034
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,270
(Seok Jin)

1035
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,540
(3rd place: My name 4 slots,
Our team 2 slots)

1036
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,510
We don't know what the results...

1037
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,950
Yes, it could be a penalty...

1038
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,480
Someone put my name up there.

1039
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,050
(Someone put my name up there?)

1040
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,950
Jun Young was here first, right?

1041
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,250
We don't know if it'll be
for a prize or a penalty.

1042
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,520
(3rd place: My name 4 slots,
Our team 2 slots)

1043
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,230
I'll be honest.
Jun Young deserves it.

1044
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,500
Jun Young. He gets one slot.

1045
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,800
And Haha.

1046
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,370
Haha's annoying, and Jun Young...

1047
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,170
He must experience Running Man.

1048
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,170
(Jun Young's betrayal
made him forget the plan.)

1049
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,580
I'll reveal the current state
of the roulette...

1050
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,410
now that you've all
made your choices.

1051
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,150
Why would you announce that?

1052
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,120
- Why would you tell?
- You'll tell everyone?

1053
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,280
Shouldn't this be a secret?

1054
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,520
- They reveal it?
- Right away?

1055
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,620
- They reveal it.
- They show it?

1056
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,090
Whose team is it?

1057
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,460
- Hang on.
- Yes.

1058
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,660
- What's that?
- What is this?

1059
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,990
- How could you?
- What is this?

1060
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,760
- Okay.
- Who put two Seok Jins?

1061
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,600
(The betrayal is clear.)

1062
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,500
- Ha Neul. I get it.
- What?

1063
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,670
Don't blame me.

1064
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,540
You put two Se Chans.
Jae Seok, you betrayed us too.

1065
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,540
Don't...

1066
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:00,310
(Staring)

1067
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,010
Why do you keep staring?

1068
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,910
Stop staring at me.

1069
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,250
Hey, Jae Seok.

1070
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,180
My target is Ha Neul now.

1071
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,690
- Okay.
- It's her from now on.

1072
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,690
Did you put up my name twice?

1073
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,220
No. Well, I don't know.

1074
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,660
Did you put two Seok Jins?

1075
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,890
(He's being grilled too.)

1076
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,490
- Didn't you?
- They revealed it right away.

1077
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,900
Sorry.

1078
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,030
Why are there so many Daniels?

1079
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,600
Aren't we the pink team?

1080
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
- We're pink.
- We're pink.

1081
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,630
Who did all that?

1082
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,770
- Who put us up there?
- Was it another team?

1083
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,840
- What?
- Another team.

1084
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,770
- Who would...
- Who did that?

1085
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,510
- Why are there so many of us?
- Who put us up there?

1086
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,210
- What is this?
- What is this?

1087
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,380
- It's weird.
- Oh, dear.

1088
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,480
I put...

1089
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,650
Why isn't Ye Eun's name there?

1090
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,180
Jong Kook.
Woo Hyun's name isn't here,

1091
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,080
- and Ye Eun's isn't here.
- You're right.

1092
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,020
- There's no Ye Eun and no Woo Hyun.
- Seriously.

1093
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,020
Why did you do that?

1094
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,690
- That wasn't me.
- Come on.

1095
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,990
- Ye Eun.
- This is war.

1096
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,660
- How come...
- Point taken.

1097
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,790
I trusted her.

1098
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,400
It looks too obvious.

1099
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,270
- I trusted you.
- You're really something.

1100
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,770
- I really...
- Okay, then.

1101
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,300
We'll go elsewhere
for the next mission.

1102
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,540
- Come on.
- Okay!

1103
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,510
- Let's go!
- Okay!

1104
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,140
Grasshopper can sit over here.

1105
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,140
"Grasshopper?"

1106
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,010
- Where's Grasshopper?
- Welcome to Grasshopper's world

1107
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,350
- "Grasshopper."
- It's a great nickname.

1108
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,920
He looks like one.

1109
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,180
Seok Jin, what were you
before you got called "Big Nose?"

1110
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,220
Jee-worm.

1111
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,490
- What? Why?
- Jee-worm.

1112
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,690
Because of my family name.

1113
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,320
It was a sloppy nickname.

1114
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,360
I was Ji-worm.

1115
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,960
- And...
- People with our surnames get that.

1116
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,890
Another of his nicknames
was "feeble kid."

1117
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,230
"Feeble kid."

1118
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
"Feeble kid."

1119
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,600
It's time for the second mission.

1120
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,300
As a result of this mission,
the teams...

1121
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,440
to place 1st and 2nd can fill
3 slots on the roulette board,

1122
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,410
and the 3rd-place team
can fill in 2.

1123
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,240
- That's the basic rule.
- Sounds good.

1124
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,680
This mission is called
Who Is Weaker?

1125
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,950
One person from each team
will step up to play.

1126
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,390
All three of you
will be blindfolded,

1127
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,320
and you'll take turns
to hit someone...

1128
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,120
- on your left or right.
- What?

1129
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,090
The person who is attacked...

1130
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,590
can crouch or stay standing.

1131
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,760
If you get hit, you lose one point.

1132
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,630
If you crouch...

1133
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,070
- but you weren't hit,
- You weren't attacked.

1134
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,540
you lose three points.

1135
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,310
It's best to just get hit.

1136
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,980
Each round ends after five turns.

1137
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,510
We'll play a total of four rounds
and decide the ranking...

1138
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,210
by points accumulated.

1139
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,080
Select who will play first.

1140
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,720
- What do you think?
- It's Seok Jin.

1141
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,050
- Okay?
- Okay.

1142
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,850
(The feeble kid will play
for Team Jun Young!)

1143
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,320
If it's Seok Jin, it's you.

1144
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,260
- It's me.
- If it's Seok Jin, it's you.

1145
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,630
- Yes. If Seok Sam plays, I play.
- Yes.

1146
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,660
I want to play with Ha Neul.

1147
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,160
Yes, you go. Niel.

1148
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,600
- Let's play.
- It's you, Niel.

1149
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,630
I'll go...

1150
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,440
- This is like...
- Four Eyes.

1151
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,840
We're the glasses guys.

1152
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,870
It's the three fools.

1153
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,410
- The glasses guys.
- The Four Eyes gang.

1154
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,110
- Okay.
- Well...

1155
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,780
- It's confusing.
- You hit to the right...

1156
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,280
- or to the left.
- Or the left.

1157
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,520
You can't hit your right
and swing further on.

1158
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,180
- That's wrong.
- You can't do that.

1159
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,790
- Don't do that.
- It's this or this.

1160
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,790
Right.

1161
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,690
- Who goes first?
- Who goes first?

1162
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,020
- Daniel.
- I go first?

1163
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,660
- After Daniel, it's Seok Jin.
- Clockwise?

1164
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,100
- Oh, it's me?
- And then it's Jae Seok.

1165
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,500
- Okay.
- Daniel goes first.

1166
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
We must keep quiet.

1167
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,770
It's over after five turns.

1168
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,970
Ready, go.

1169
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,180
(Whack)

1170
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,240
(He's spinning?)

1171
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,480
Why did you spin, Seok Jin?

1172
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,750
- Why are you like this?
- What?

1173
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,780
- Wait. Take these off.
- What are you doing?

1174
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,850
Why did you...

1175
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,320
How dare you?

1176
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,790
Why? What's wrong?

1177
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,260
- You cheeky...
- What happened?

1178
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,430
I don't know. Why did he spin?

1179
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,660
Why did he spin?

1180
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,530
(No one knows what happened.)

1181
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,860
- What?
- Five turns.

1182
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,800
It's this kind of game.

1183
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,670
(What the director said)

1184
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,340
(Okay, turn five times.)

1185
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,880
- How dare he...
- No!

1186
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,640
- What did he do?
- Explain the reason.

1187
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,210
- He started to spin on the spot.
- Why did you spin?

1188
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,720
It's not that. You each take turns
five times this round.

1189
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,590
(In shock)

1190
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,250
He's so frustrating.

1191
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,290
- Hey. He proudly...
- He was like...

1192
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,020
Why would you spin on the spot?

1193
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,090
Why did you?

1194
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,830
- Why did you spin?
- You said five turns!

1195
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,130
- That turn...
- Five tries.

1196
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,260
- Excuse me?
- We take turns five times.

1197
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,530
Everyone else got it.

1198
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,000
- Mister!
- What are you thinking?

1199
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,440
You should've said we'd take turns.

1200
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,040
- We all got it.
- She did.

1201
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,970
We all got it. We understood.

1202
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,180
- She said five turns, so I went...
- Gosh. We all got it.

1203
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,980
And I got hit.

1204
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,450
What did I tell you?

1205
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,980
- Right?
- My gosh.

1206
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,520
- Explain kindly.
- You need tutoring.

1207
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,420
Teach him the rules the week before!

1208
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,190
It's annoying.

1209
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,320
Send him a video of how to play.

1210
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,960
Send a video?

1211
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,860
- Due to limited time,
- Gosh, but seriously...

1212
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,230
we'll only go around four times.

1213
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,100
Not around.

1214
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,130
- I mean, the rounds...
- That's not it.

1215
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,500
So, it's not turning around...

1216
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,030
- Mister!
- Goodness gracious.

1217
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,840
- Why can't he understand this?
- My goodness.

1218
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,770
Why don't you know this?

1219
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,240
- That was...
- I turned beautifully.

1220
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,340
One...

1221
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,280
- That was pretty funny.
- Gosh, what is he doing?

1222
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,710
- It was so cute.
- Okay, then.

1223
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,280
- Do you understand the rules now?
- Yes.

1224
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,210
- We'll start with Daniel.
- Then...

1225
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,350
- Daniel first?
- Yes.

1226
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,720
- You won't count to three?
- No, I won't.

1227
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,420
- You just have to use your senses.
- Okay.

1228
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,220
Ready, set, go.

1229
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,720
- Okay.
- Good. Nice.

1230
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,160
(Minus 1 for being hit)

1231
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,690
(Minus 3 for sitting
but not being attacked)

1232
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,130
(Your points will drop like crazy
if you keep sitting out of fear.)

1233
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,160
That looks like it hurts.

1234
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,200
Is it my turn now?

1235
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,400
- Yes.
- You're doing well.

1236
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,500
(Next, it's Seok Jin's turn
to attack.)

1237
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,270
(Biting his lip)

1238
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,810
(Proud of himself
after a successful attack)

1239
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,840
- It must really hurt.
- That was good.

1240
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,510
(Daniel sat down.)

1241
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,110
(What about Seok Sam?)

1242
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,290
(Hitting him
in the side of the head)

1243
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,450
- Hang on.
- Hey.

1244
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,620
Hang on a second.

1245
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,160
He sat down.

1246
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,330
- You hit him at an awkward height.
- Why?

1247
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,560
- You did well.
- Hey, man.

1248
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,560
- You can see, can't you?
- No, I can't.

1249
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:55,800
- Are you sure?
- For real.

1250
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,100
- I'm watching you.
- I thought I did fine.

1251
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,570
- You did well.
- I mean,

1252
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,170
- I sat. Did you hit me like this?
- You sat halfway.

1253
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,640
- You should sit down all the way.
- You were in an awkward position.

1254
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,640
- So, that counts as a hit, right?
- Yes.

1255
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,040
- He was hit, right?
- You have to sit lower. He was hit.

1256
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,340
- I hit him, right? That counts.
- Yes, you did.

1257
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,140
- Sit down all the way.
- Gosh, that's so funny.

1258
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,210
I did sit all the way.

1259
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,550
- I have minus three points, right?
- Yes.

1260
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,380
So, that was one round.

1261
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,050
- One round.
- It's so funny.

1262
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,120
Whose turn is it this time?

1263
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,290
- It's Daniel's turn.
- Mine.

1264
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,920
You'll have to swing with certainty.

1265
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,420
Yes, and sit down properly
if you're going to sit.

1266
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,560
Swing with certainty?

1267
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,560
(Scared)

1268
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,660
I heard someone breathing.

1269
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,700
(Seok Sam gets hit twice in a row.)

1270
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,270
I think you should hit lower.

1271
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,870
- Oh, no.
- Look at him.

1272
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,570
(Next, Seok Sam will attack.)

1273
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,970
(Jae Seok sits down again.)

1274
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,110
It's your turn, Seok Jin.

1275
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,210
Oh, wait. We lost more points.

1276
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,580
Mister, you're way too scared.

1277
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,850
- Hey.
- I didn't specify who it was.

1278
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,390
I didn't say who it was.

1279
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,690
- But someone is way too scared.
- You lost too many points.

1280
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,160
A certain someone is way too scared.

1281
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,660
All right. Focus.

1282
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,060
(A larva that's even more scared)

1283
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,870
Okay, let's go.

1284
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,070
(Smack)

1285
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,640
Hey.

1286
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,670
(Playing dumb)

1287
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,840
Hey, take this off.

1288
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,340
(The larva ends up getting mad.)

1289
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,980
- Gosh, but why...
- You.

1290
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,310
(Regardless of points, the jokester
just wanted to hit Seok Sam.)

1291
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,550
- I was...
- How can he go any lower than that?

1292
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,620
- I mean...
- You.

1293
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,990
- Were you looking?
- No.

1294
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,090
- Were you looking?
- Hey, Seok Jin.

1295
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,520
- You have to sit lower.
- I didn't see you.

1296
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,890
Seok Jin,
you have to get flat on the ground.

1297
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,360
How much lower can I go?

1298
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,360
- Should I dig a hole and go in it?
- Get flat on the ground.

1299
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,160
Ha Neul, he was looking, wasn't he?

1300
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,660
- No, I didn't look.
- I don't know. I didn't see.

1301
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,030
- You didn't see?
- I wasn't looking.

1302
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,470
Be sure to sit properly.

1303
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,700
Gosh, that's so funny.

1304
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,370
I mean, there is...

1305
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,900
no way for me to get down any lower.

1306
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Literally.

1307
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,810
You can do it if you try harder.

1308
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,310
I can't.

1309
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:49,480
- Is it my turn again?
- It's Daniel's turn.

1310
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,780
(Scaredy-cat Yu just lies
flat on his back.)

1311
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,880
(Smack)

1312
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,320
(Getting hit again)

1313
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,750
(Seok Sam is a beat late
this time as well.)

1314
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,320
What? Why?

1315
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,460
Gosh, seriously...

1316
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,390
Are you seriously
in your right minds?

1317
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,390
- Hey!
- What?

1318
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,630
(The attacker doesn't know
what's going on.)

1319
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,130
- What are you doing, punk?
- Why are you doing that?

1320
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,100
He was just playing the game
as he should. What's wrong?

1321
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,770
It's not that. I sat down, but...

1322
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:13,140
I kept sitting down,
so why would I get hit?

1323
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,140
You were standing up.

1324
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,370
Then, you should just stand.

1325
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,170
I kept sitting down,
so why would I get hit?

1326
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,340
- Then, you should just stand.
- Seok Jin.

1327
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,010
- You were standing just now.
- Weren't you standing?

1328
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,040
I was sitting.

1329
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,310
- You have to sit properly.
- What position was he in?

1330
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,280
- You should've sat lower.
- I couldn't see you.

1331
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,350
Chungju Ji, what happened?

1332
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,850
You should give a witness statement.
What happened?

1333
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:28,880
Poor you.

1334
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,890
Hey, what...

1335
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,250
(Poor you.)

1336
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,390
You punk. What happened?
He took off the blindfold, right?

1337
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,990
- No!
- Didn't he take it off?

1338
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,430
- No.
- I didn't take it off.

1339
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,360
- You sat down too late.
- You were too slow.

1340
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,530
- This time...
- Make up your mind quickly.

1341
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,560
- Be quick.
- Who is it this time?

1342
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,400
- It's me.
- It's Seok Jin's turn.

1343
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,700
Be sure to sit all the way.

1344
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,400
(This time,
Jae Seok stays standing up.)

1345
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,640
(He'll succeed if he hits Jae Seok
right now.)

1346
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,480
(But he swung at Daniel instead.)

1347
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,210
That was weak.

1348
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,450
Good job.

1349
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,150
- That was good.
- Nice job.

1350
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,620
Jae Seok.

1351
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,220
(Rustling)

1352
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,450
We can hear everything.

1353
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,060
We can hear everything.

1354
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,320
(Laughing)

1355
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,890
(Flat)

1356
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,260
(Instead of Daniel who's standing,
he aims right for the larva.)

1357
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,730
(Running away desperately)

1358
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,200
Go forward.

1359
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,200
You just have to hit him.

1360
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,440
(Intrigued)

1361
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,840
A bit more.

1362
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,370
Smack him right there.

1363
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,310
(I got you!)

1364
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:32,950
Hey, what is this?

1365
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,880
Do you know
what this game is supposed to be?

1366
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,750
Hey, what are you doing?

1367
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,250
Seok Jin, why would I...

1368
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,320
Why did you just put that back on?

1369
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,690
I saw you just putting it back on.

1370
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,090
- It's the Jee Seok Jin game.
- We could hear you.

1371
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,960
- You shouldn't let us hear you.
- We can hear you way too loudly.

1372
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,760
Is it the final round now?

1373
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,430
- All right.
- Yes, it's the final round.

1374
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,430
(Daniel begins.)

1375
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,900
(His attack fails.)

1376
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,140
(Quivering)

1377
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,040
- Yes, now...
- It's Seok Jin's turn.

1378
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,240
(Gritting his teeth)

1379
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,710
(Did he successfully attack Jae Seok?)

1380
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,750
(Smack)

1381
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,180
- What was that?
- Did he mean to hit me?

1382
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,750
- No.
- No.

1383
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,280
It's Jae Seok's final attack.

1384
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,460
(Hunting while lying down)

1385
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,560
(Darn you!)

1386
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,260
(Getting hit every time,
but not hitting anyone himself)

1387
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,230
(He doesn't think to take off
his blindfold.)

1388
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,370
Look at these old guys.

1389
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:26,640
(He beats up Seok Jin until the end
but gets last place.)

1390
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,500
- It's over.
- That was hilarious.

1391
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,040
Okay, now,
let's have the second players...

1392
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,440
- come up and switch.
- Okay.

1393
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,040
- Ha Neul, you should go.
- Okay, Ha Neul.

1394
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,240
Let's have the women's match.

1395
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,450
The women's match.

1396
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,610
The women's match.

1397
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,320
- Go.
- We'll have Woo Hyun go.

1398
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,520
Woo Hyun?

1399
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,680
Gosh, this is...

1400
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,250
- Woo Hyun is playing?
- Yes, Woo Hyun.

1401
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:45,590
Aren't you playing, Ye Eun?

1402
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,690
I'm going to play with you.

1403
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,860
- With you and Se Chan.
- It's for revenge.

1404
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,060
- I want to get revenge.
- Oh, revenge against me?

1405
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,190
That's more fun.

1406
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,200
- Woo Hyun is playing with Ha Neul?
- Woo Hyun is playing?

1407
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,360
- Starting with this round,
- Okay.

1408
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,230
each person will have three turns.

1409
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,700
We'll start with Woo Hyun,

1410
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,700
then Ji Hyo, and Ha Neul.

1411
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,000
We'll go in that order.

1412
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,110
- Okay.
- Okay.

1413
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,440
(Woo Hyun will begin attacking first.)

1414
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,510
Start.

1415
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,040
Ha Neul,
you're making way too much noise.

1416
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,780
I heard something crunching.

1417
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,550
(The dog leg dance has
quite a long-lasting effect.)

1418
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:13,880
Okay, again. Ready, go.

1419
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,720
(Kim Sky quietly stands up.)

1420
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,020
(Swinging)

1421
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,660
- Oh, he's done.
- It's over.

1422
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:23,860
It's over.

1423
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,160
Where did he swing at?

1424
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,430
Did you swing at me?

1425
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,460
- No.
- No.

1426
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,200
Where did he swing at?

1427
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,530
Did you swing at me?

1428
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,270
(What is this tone?)

1429
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,570
Why won't you listen to me?

1430
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,270
You're a student,
and I'm your teacher.

1431
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,310
That sounded like
a line from a drama.

1432
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:38,970
- Right.
- It was your drama tone.

1433
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,080
- "Did you swing at me?"
- It was.

1434
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,810
- "Did you swing at me?"
- "Did you swing at me?"

1435
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,650
- "You're younger than me."
- "Did you swing at me?"

1436
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,080
"You're a student."

1437
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,950
Now, it's Ji Hyo's turn.

1438
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,120
- Me?
- Yes, go for it.

1439
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,550
- It's my turn now, right?
- Okay.

1440
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,120
You have to take
a big swing at once,

1441
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,420
not little by little.

1442
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,620
(Both are standing.
What choice will Ji Hyo make?)

1443
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,760
(Smack)

1444
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,590
(Full swing)

1445
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:02,400
- I'll go.
- Hang on.

1446
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,430
This was a bit...

1447
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,070
- I'll go.
- Okay.

1448
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,340
- I'll go!
- Okay, go.

1449
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,540
- She's mad.
- Hey, what is this?

1450
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,110
- It's Ha Neul's turn.
- All right.

1451
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,310
(Kim Sky is furious
at being smacked in her back.)

1452
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:15,440
(She tries to get revenge
against Ji Hyo right away.)

1453
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,480
(Of course, she dodges it.)

1454
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:19,310
She's so bitter.

1455
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:20,450
(Hitting)

1456
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,890
How simple.

1457
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,550
- She's resentful.
- Nice.

1458
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:25,850
- Good job.
- Calm down.

1459
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:26,890
You're doing well, Ha Neul.

1460
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,290
- I like your spirit.
- Keep going.

1461
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,790
Woo Hyun, it's your turn.

1462
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,030
(It's Woo Hyun's turn again.)

1463
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,800
(Will he attack Ha Neul,
knowing no fear?)

1464
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,400
(Ha Neul gets beaten up consecutively.)

1465
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,770
- She keeps getting hit.
- Gosh, that's awesome.

1466
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,100
She keeps getting hit.

1467
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,040
Next, it's Ji Hyo's turn.

1468
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,340
(Next,
it's Ji Hyo's turn to attack.)

1469
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,740
(Smack)

1470
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,180
(Squawking)

1471
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,580
(Laughing)

1472
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,220
- She keeps getting hit.
- Good job.

1473
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,380
Hey, she's like the punching bag.

1474
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,620
- Good.
- A punching bag.

1475
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,990
- Ha Neul, don't be scared.
- A punching bag.

1476
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,650
- You're taking the hits like a pro!
- Ha Neul, it's okay.

1477
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,390
- Keep taking those hits.
- Calm yourself down.

1478
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:03,190
- Has she ever been hit like this?
- Nice.

1479
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,160
(She won't gain anything...)

1480
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,430
(if she attacks Ji Hyo again
who's sitting.)

1481
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,200
(She changes her mind
and attacks Woo Hyun.)

1482
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,870
Hey, you used your brain.

1483
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,170
Nice.

1484
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:15,970
I think she's too strong.

1485
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:17,340
(Laughing)

1486
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,940
(The final round,
Woo Hyun's turn to attack)

1487
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,450
(Unlike the Seok Sam Show before,
the atmosphere is tense.)

1488
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:24,680
Oh, this feels legit.

1489
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,950
They're good, aren't they?

1490
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,520
- The game of wits is...
- It's nerve-racking.

1491
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,050
Woo Hyun, it's your turn to hit.

1492
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,990
- Hey, Woo Hyun.
- No, it's your turn.

1493
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,860
- It's your turn to hit.
- You're up.

1494
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,290
Woo Hyun, it's your turn to hit.

1495
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,290
- You're up.
- Go on.

1496
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:38,360
- Woo Hyun, don't be intimidated.
- It's your turn to hit.

1497
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,700
- It's your turn.
- You're up.

1498
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,360
(The daunting guy is intimidated
by the scary older ladies.)

1499
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,100
- It can happen. Don't be scared.
- Of course.

1500
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,100
Is it my turn?

1501
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,570
He's intimidated by them.

1502
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:48,670
(The real game of wits begins.)

1503
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:53,480
(Ji Hyo sits down again.)

1504
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,540
Brace yourself.

1505
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,780
Okay.

1506
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,350
- Woo Hyun means business.
- I'll swing hard.

1507
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,250
(A successful hit)

1508
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,320
(Sighing loudly)

1509
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,120
- He swung hard.
- He hit her hard.

1510
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,120
Ha Neul took all the hits.

1511
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,020
She's like the classroom ball.

1512
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,490
(Ha Neul stays standing
and gets constantly hit.)

1513
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:11,630
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

1514
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:12,660
Here I go.

1515
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,060
- Here I go.
- Go ahead.

1516
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:19,070
(Both of them sit
at Ji Hyo's announcement.)

1517
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,040
(A failed attack)

1518
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:24,140
- Good job.
- I felt something.

1519
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,810
- That was a loud swoosh.
- That was close.

1520
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,710
- I know.
- I heard a swoosh.

1521
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:29,910
I'll go.

1522
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:31,910
I'll go.

1523
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:33,850
(This is her last chance
to get revenge.)

1524
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,020
- Go for it.
- Here I go.

1525
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,120
It's Ha Neul's turn.

1526
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,920
(Ji Hyo chose to sit again!)

1527
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:40,620
Ha Neul, you're in last place.

1528
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,830
(Thud)

1529
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,130
(She immediately runs away.)

1530
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,000
- Ha Neul.
- You can't hit someone...

1531
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,900
- who's sitting.
- She was trying to get her revenge.

1532
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,600
- Didn't she aim on purpose?
- What was that?

1533
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,130
- Ha Neul, that was like...
- Seriously?

1534
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,800
- swinging a rod.
- What was that?

1535
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,970
- Ha Neul...
- Can you believe it?

1536
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,200
You're good at swinging the rod.

1537
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,410
- Anyone would agree.
- Hold on.

1538
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:00,210
- Ji Hyo crouched down.
- How could you be so mean?

1539
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,410
- She was getting her revenge.
- Hold on.

1540
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,650
- Earlier, Jae Seok...
- Anger had been building up.

1541
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,150
- Jae Seok did that earlier.
- I know.

1542
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,380
- You picked up something bad.
- Also, Ha Neul...

1543
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,320
Also, Ha Neul's anger toward Ji Hyo
had been building up.

1544
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,790
She's good at swinging
and hitting someone with a rod.

1545
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:14,990
- It was funny.
- I wasn't expecting that.

1546
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:16,020
Next...

1547
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,130
- We took a lot of hits this time.
- It's my turn now.

1548
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,360
- That was hilarious.
- Unbelievable.

1549
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,430
Is Haha up?

1550
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,030
Of course. This is great.

1551
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,030
- Of course.
- Ye Eun's up.

1552
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,870
- She's off to get her revenge.
- I'm going to get my revenge.

1553
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,040
She's out to get those two.

1554
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,800
I'm going to get my revenge
on these two.

1555
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,440
(On and off the camera,
they've been teasing her.)

1556
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,740
- Ye Eun, you can do this.
- Haha.

1557
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,580
- I'm getting my revenge.
- Are you sure?

1558
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,780
Will we play another round?

1559
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,850
- Yes, there's a round four.
- Are you good?

1560
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,080
- Ye Eun, you can do this.
- Haha.

1561
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:41,020
Why must you get back at us?

1562
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,050
- What for?
- You'll find out.

1563
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,990
(You'll find out.)

1564
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,890
(The girl with a twang makes
a chilling announcement.)

1565
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:52,390
I love it. Nice.

1566
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,330
(Laughing so hard)

1567
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:55,760
- Show us.
- I love it.

1568
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,200
- You've got this.
- Give it all you've got.

1569
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,670
- Get your revenge.
- Get your revenge, Ye Eun.

1570
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,140
Those two have been the worst,
haven't they?

1571
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:03,740
- That's how you do it.
- Like this?

1572
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:06,910
(Out of nowhere,
the two demonstrate.)

1573
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:08,080
Like this?

1574
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,650
No, not like that, but like this.

1575
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,180
That's how you do it.

1576
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,820
(He's proud.)

1577
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,950
That's it.

1578
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,650
- Don't let him win.
- That's it.

1579
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:17,750
Don't let him win.

1580
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:18,850
Haha.

1581
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:21,820
- Hit it with the end.
- Precisely.

1582
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,890
- Here.
- Don't let him win.

1583
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:25,490
- No, not like that. Like this.
- Oh, no.

1584
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,400
- Like this.
- Oh, no.

1585
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,830
(The Dongducheon Pole Handler's
swift wrist snap)

1586
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:30,900
(It's another lesson for her.)

1587
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,170
- That's it.
- Why are you bad at this?

1588
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:33,640
(Dizzy)

1589
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,870
How are you hitting me like that?

1590
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:35,940
- Haha.
- How are you doing that?

1591
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,940
I was hitting you lightly
with the snap of my wrist.

1592
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,840
He hits really hard, doesn't he?

1593
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,410
- I don't get it.
- It's all in the wrist.

1594
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:42,480
- What do I do?
- What?

1595
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,380
- Get your revenge.
- You're to aim for the torso.

1596
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,310
- Right here.
- Yes, aim for the torso.

1597
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:47,650
- Like this?
- Let's play fair.

1598
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:48,950
Exactly. Please, no cheating.

1599
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,020
- We'll start with Haha.
- Haha will go first.

1600
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,620
- Me?
- Ye Eun will go next,

1601
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,860
and then Se Chan.

1602
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,890
Go!

1603
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,260
Se Chan?

1604
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,300
Ye Eun?

1605
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:04,300
I'm aiming for Se Chan.

1606
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,900
(He pretends to aim for Se Chan
but hits Ye Eun instead.)

1607
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,640
(The sandbag trusted him
and remained still, taking the hit.)

1608
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,070
She's pissed.

1609
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,510
- She's angry.
- I can tell just by her mouth.

1610
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,450
- She's angry.
- Yes, she's angry.

1611
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:18,480
What is she going to show us?

1612
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:19,710
I can't believe Ye Eun.

1613
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,280
- Weren't you getting your revenge?
- She's angry for sure.

1614
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,320
(It's finally time for Ye Eun
to get her revenge.)

1615
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,890
Ye Eun, get your revenge.

1616
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:28,820
(However...)

1617
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:32,230
(There's no one to hit!)

1618
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,200
(Take that!)

1619
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,040
(Her first attempt at revenge ends
with her looking foolish.)

1620
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:43,610
Who swung?

1621
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,040
- You did great.
- Who swung?

1622
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:48,940
(He lost 3 points,
but teasing Ye Eun was worth it.)

1623
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,450
(The path to revenge isn't easy.)

1624
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:52,210
Didn't Ye Eun say she'd show them?

1625
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,420
- "I'll show you."
- "I'll show you."

1626
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,280
- Se Chan will swing next.
- Se Chan's up.

1627
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,390
Good.

1628
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,520
(Ddochi gets a bad feeling
and sits this time.)

1629
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,060
(Of course, he targets Ye Eun.)

1630
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,500
(He aimed at Ye Eun
but ended up hitting Haha.)

1631
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,030
- Who was he aiming at?
- Hold on.

1632
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:14,470
- That was wrong.
- The angle was off.

1633
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:15,700
You should've swung from the right.

1634
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,970
That doesn't count.
It was a mistake.

1635
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,740
- Nice.
- Is it Haha's turn?

1636
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,940
- Haha's up.
- It's Haha's turn.

1637
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,510
(As it happens, Haha's up next.)

1638
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,610
- Ye Eun, you want revenge.
- This is your last chance.

1639
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:28,050
(Will he hit Se Chan for revenge
or hit Ye Eun for laughs?)

1640
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,520
I can't believe Ye Eun.

1641
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,320
Nice!

1642
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,190
(He hits Ye Eun again.)

1643
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,630
- Ye Eun, get him.
- No way.

1644
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,930
Ye Eun, you said
you were going to show them.

1645
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,100
Ye Eun, when will you get
your revenge?

1646
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,160
- Is the round over?
- No, you have one last chance.

1647
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,230
- You have another chance.
- Go ahead.

1648
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:45,270
(She gets another shot at revenge.)

1649
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,430
She should make them pay.

1650
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,400
(This time around...)

1651
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,710
(Groaning!)

1652
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,780
(Flat on the floor)

1653
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:58,650
(They got her once again...)

1654
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,120
(Groaning!)

1655
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,720
(Sighing...)

1656
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:06,590
(The two baby octopuses
outsmart Ye Eun.)

1657
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,420
(Forget about the points.)

1658
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,830
(All they want to do
is annoy Ye Eun.)

1659
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,290
Look at what they did.

1660
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,630
- Ye Eun, see for yourself.
- You wanted revenge.

1661
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,460
- You didn't hit them once.
- Come on.

1662
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,530
- You didn't hit them once.
- You didn't hit them once.

1663
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:19,600
- Yet, you got hit.
- Come on, Ye Eun.

1664
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,170
- That was sweet.
- Ye Eun,

1665
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,310
- you wanted revenge.
- What was that?

1666
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,540
Ye Eun, it's okay.

1667
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,180
You're doing a good job on points.

1668
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,450
- Se Chan, you're up.
- It's Se Chan's turn.

1669
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:32,480
Here I go.

1670
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,650
(Ye Eun crouched down once again.)

1671
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,120
(Chuckling)

1672
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:39,050
(Swish)

1673
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,820
(Because Ye Eun made a sound,
he aimed at Haha and scored.)

1674
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,530
- No way.
- Darn.

1675
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,230
Come on.

1676
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,460
(Even with another turn,
she couldn't take revenge.)

1677
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,430
- That was hilarious.
- How many points did we lose?

1678
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,000
I bet we're at minus 20.

1679
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,900
- It's now the final round.
- Go ahead, Jun Young.

1680
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,340
- It's the final round.
- Let's see.

1681
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,870
- All right.
- Jong Kook will win us points.

1682
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,210
This doesn't hurt.

1683
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:01,280
- Ha Neul should play.
- Sure.

1684
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,710
- I already played.
- You can play again.

1685
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:03,850
- Again?
- Of course.

1686
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:05,080
- Of course, you should play.
- It'll be more fun that way.

1687
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,550
- That was hilarious.
- But...

1688
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:07,920
- But he's playing too.
- What is it?

1689
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,080
- It's okay.
- Is Ha Neul playing?

1690
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,350
- Ha Neul will play.
- You should stand in the center.

1691
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:13,420
- Stand in the center.
- Take the center spot.

1692
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,920
- Ha Neul will stand in the center.
- Here?

1693
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,220
- Jun Young can stand here.
- That was hilarious.

1694
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,590
I'll hold this for you.

1695
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:21,230
(Standing tall)

1696
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,830
There you go.

1697
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:26,230
(Jun Young requires a lot of care.)

1698
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,300
Okay.

1699
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,540
Jong Kook will go first,
then Ha Neul, then Jun Young.

1700
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:34,180
- Go, Ha Neul!
- All right.

1701
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,580
- Ha Neul, you're stunning.
- Come on!

1702
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,950
(Growling)

1703
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:40,180
(Kim Muscles is out of control.)

1704
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,250
Can I not play?

1705
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,890
Jong Kook's excited.

1706
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:47,320
(An angry Kim Muscles
is the most exhausting.)

1707
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,760
He's out for blood.

1708
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,820
Nice!

1709
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,430
Let's do this, Jong Kook.

1710
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:52,490
All right.

1711
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,100
(Locating)

1712
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:57,630
(Locating)

1713
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,500
- He's sensing the space.
- How did you know that?

1714
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,370
- With how it echoes.
- Does it bounce off anything?

1715
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,410
Does he think
he's a bat or something?

1716
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:06,680
What on earth?

1717
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,910
- What?
- Is he using sound waves?

1718
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:09,940
What was that?

1719
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,210
(Making sounds)

1720
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,880
Is he a bat?

1721
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,150
(What miraculous skills
will he show us?)

1722
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,890
- Unbelievable.
- Okay, got it.

1723
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,090
Does he listen for the echoes?

1724
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:20,860
I see.

1725
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:22,620
He should've become a detective.

1726
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,890
I think she's crouching down.

1727
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:28,500
(Incorrect)

1728
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,300
(He attacks Jun Young.)

1729
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,140
(Ha Neul stayed safe
thanks to his nonsense.)

1730
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,140
Ha Neul's up.

1731
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:36,470
- Go on, Ha Neul.
- Ha Neul, you're up.

1732
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:37,640
(It's Ha Neul's turn.)

1733
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,580
(Crack)

1734
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,110
- I heard something.
- Hold on.

1735
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,350
What's the matter with you?

1736
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,410
Why did your knees just crack?

1737
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,580
- Your joints!
- Unbelievable.

1738
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,420
They cracked too loudly.

1739
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,120
- I...
- Are you okay?

1740
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,960
- They cracked too loudly.
- What's wrong with your joints?

1741
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:55,320
- Are you okay?
- Goodness.

1742
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:57,660
- He's a dance music singer.
- Are you all right?

1743
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:58,690
- A dance music singer.
- I'm all right.

1744
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,160
Shouldn't he oil them?

1745
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,030
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1746
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,000
- That was a loud crack.
- Shouldn't we get him something?

1747
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,570
What was that all about?

1748
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,170
- That's from years of dancing.
- It was so loud.

1749
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,300
- I'm fine.
- He needs to oil the joints.

1750
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,470
- He was too scared.
- Good job, Ha Neul.

1751
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:12,410
His joints made a cracking sound.

1752
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,910
(After hitting his knee,
he naturally sat down.)

1753
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:16,680
- Can I go?
- Sure.

1754
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,150
(She has to hit Jong Kook to score.)

1755
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,320
(The veteran walks up to her
to give her some advice.)

1756
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:24,520
(Ha Neul had already
made her choice.)

1757
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,950
Okay!

1758
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,460
(Embarrassed)

1759
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,420
Okay!

1760
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,030
(Ha Neul did great all on her own.)

1761
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,490
- Jun Young's next.
- He's intimidated for sure.

1762
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:34,730
- Your joints sounded frightened.
- Good job.

1763
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,670
(Yelling in pain)

1764
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,640
(He targets Ha Neul,
his good friend.)

1765
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,040
That was a clean hit.

1766
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,840
That one hurt the most.

1767
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:46,140
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

1768
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,180
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

1769
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,410
(Locating)

1770
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,550
Seriously?

1771
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:54,020
- He's playing detective again.
- Are you kidding me?

1772
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,720
- He's playing detective.
- Are you sitting down?

1773
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,650
(Using echolocation
and even conducting interrogations)

1774
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:58,890
He's getting somewhere.

1775
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:00,120
Are you sitting down?

1776
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,460
(Using echolocation
and even conducting interrogations)

1777
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,130
- Look at him.
- I hear ragged breathing.

1778
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,970
- Okay.
- He's wrong about everything.

1779
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,100
He's playing detective.

1780
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,300
It's Ha Neul's turn.

1781
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,540
He's only half right.

1782
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,210
- Nice!
- Yes!

1783
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:20,480
- I'm the one you always target.
- Nice shot.

1784
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,640
(Jun Young's next.)

1785
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,740
This is great.

1786
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,080
Jun Young got hit by Jong Kook,
didn't he?

1787
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,710
(Jun Young was hit by both of them.)

1788
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,120
- Show them who's the weak hero.
- It's Jun Young's turn.

1789
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:32,090
(Will the thug Geum Seong Je
get his revenge?)

1790
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:34,020
(Thud)

1791
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,860
Gosh, what was that?
It was too weak.

1792
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,660
- It was too...
- Let's do it over.

1793
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,760
- Again.
- That was too predictable.

1794
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:45,130
(For an introvert, hitting someone
he's not close to isn't easy.)

1795
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:47,270
- Jun Young!
- That was too predictable.

1796
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,770
- Gosh, Jun Young. That was weak.
- All right.

1797
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,170
Hey, stop trying to look good!

1798
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,670
- It was way too predictable.
- Hey, why are you trying...

1799
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,410
- What was that?
- People will hate that even more.

1800
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:55,210
Where did Geum Seong Je go?

1801
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,810
- People hate this even more.
- You can hit me harder.

1802
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,910
- Be serious. What was that?
- I was just checking.

1803
00:57:58,910 --> 00:57:59,950
Okay.

1804
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,350
- The final round.
- It's me, right?

1805
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,550
- Jong Kook, take a big swing.
- I should.

1806
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,890
He might not sit
thinking there was no way...

1807
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:06,960
I'd hit him three times.

1808
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,760
- What?
- He might not sit.

1809
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,860
(Vocalizing)

1810
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,490
Detective, stop popping up.

1811
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,560
I'm so tired of that investigation.

1812
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:17,830
Oh, okay.

1813
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:21,400
(Ha Neul successfully predicted
his move!)

1814
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,400
Nice.

1815
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,670
- Nice.
- You dodged it well, Ha Neul.

1816
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:26,770
(Kim Ha Neul, the cryopreserved human,
is good at new games too.)

1817
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,080
Nice, Ha Neul.

1818
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,980
(It's Ha Neul's turn again.)

1819
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,450
(Jun Young sits down again.)

1820
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,850
(Ha Neul's choice was Jong Kook.)

1821
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:39,750
- That was great.
- Nice.

1822
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,020
- Okay!
- Yes.

1823
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,260
- That was great.
- Nice.

1824
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,360
(A good play by Kim Ha Neul,
who has a good hunch)

1825
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,730
- That was awesome.
- Yes.

1826
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,830
- So good.
- Lastly, it's Jun Young.

1827
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,530
Harder!

1828
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,330
Let's go, Geum Seong Je.

1829
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,170
(Geum Seong Je's last chance)

1830
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,270
(Seong Je couldn't live up
to his name...)

1831
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:57,640
(and got hit almost every round.)

1832
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,980
(If things end just like this,
he will just be a whiny baby.)

1833
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:04,180
(The blade of revenge?)

1834
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:09,180
(Channeling Geum Seong Je)

1835
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,250
(Will he be able to
romantically take his revenge?)

1836
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,490
(He points his foam bat
towards Jong Kook first.)

1837
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:19,260
(He aims...)

1838
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,730
(and swings!)

1839
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,770
(Plop)

1840
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:25,930
Gosh, Jun Young.

1841
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,700
- Weak!
- Jun Young!

1842
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:31,210
You should've hit me harder.

1843
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:33,170
- My gosh.
- Weak!

1844
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,840
- Hey, don't be scared.
- Jun Young!

1845
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,610
- Why are you trying to look good?
- I mean...

1846
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,450
- Jun Young, why did you get scared?
- You could've hit me harder.

1847
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,550
- There's no romance in that.
- What was that?

1848
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:43,020
My left side is stronger.

1849
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,090
No, it's okay.

1850
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,050
- Good job, Ha Neul.
- Yes, good job.

1851
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,190
- You got lots of points.
- Oh, really?

1852
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,760
- Good job.
- That was great.

1853
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,060
Here are the final scores.

1854
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,230
In first place,

1855
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:56,430
it's Team Woo Hyun.
You have minus 18 points.

1856
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,570
- We're constantly in first place.
- Is this okay?

1857
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,400
- And in 2nd place,
- That's us. We're 2nd.

1858
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,440
- it's Team Ha Neul with minus 27.
- Okay!

1859
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:06,470
And in last place,
Team Jun Young has minus 34 points.

1860
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,240
You guys keep coming in last.

1861
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,240
(Team Jun Young gets last place
with minus 34 points.)

1862
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,450
It's fine
as long as it was entertaining.

1863
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:12,750
(Got it.)

1864
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:16,380
So, this time,
you can go with this number...

1865
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,390
of slots each.

1866
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:18,490
- Only two can go...
- You and I should go.

1867
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:19,550
from the team in last place.
Please decide who will go.

1868
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,960
This time, Ji Hyo and I will go.

1869
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,360
The 1st and 2nd place teams
can have 3 people go.

1870
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,090
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- No, we can have three people go.

1871
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:26,660
- Oh, us too? Okay.
- This time...

1872
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:29,100
(1st place: My name 5 slots,
Our team 2, Another team 2)

1873
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,260
- So, look.
- You can go first.

1874
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:31,830
- Ssaebssaeb, you can go 1st.
- I'll go 1st.

1875
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:33,630
- Jong Kook, I'll go this time.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1876
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,300
- This time,
- Those who haven't gone should go.

1877
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,870
- we should get to go too.
- Decide which of you will go.

1878
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:39,040
- Let's play to decide, then.
- Okay.

1879
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,880
- Yes, that's only fair.
- That's right.

1880
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,110
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1881
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:43,140
(Lose)

1882
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,550
- Sit down.
- Just stay seated.

1883
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:47,850
- Hey, just stay here.
- Ye Eun, sit.

1884
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:49,850
- Stay seated.
- Sit.

1885
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,920
- Stay here.
- Then, you and I...

1886
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,550
- The three of us.
- Jong Kook.

1887
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:55,860
(Daniel says they should give
everything to Ye Eun.)

1888
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,230
The three of us? Okay.

1889
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:59,290
Got it.

1890
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:00,960
(He lets Woo Hyun know too.)

1891
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:05,730
(She has no clue.)

1892
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,670
Who will go first? Woo Hyun?

1893
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:09,000
- Should I go first?
- Sure, go ahead.

1894
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,240
- Okay.
- That's crazy.

1895
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,570
(1st place: My name 5 slots,
Our team 2, Another team 2)

1896
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:16,710
(Which of the three
will Woo Hyun choose?)

1897
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:17,980
Two.

1898
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:19,810
(Woo Hyun, Ye Eun,
Jong Kook, Daniel)

1899
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,420
Two? Oh, we're the first place team.

1900
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,920
Oh, it's still two.

1901
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,020
(Our team, 2 slots)

1902
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,660
(He chooses Ji Ye Eun.)

1903
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,300
(Woo Hyun is contemplating.)

1904
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,370
(He puts it on in the end.)

1905
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,670
(He chooses Ye Eun
for the other slot too.)

1906
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,270
(Right next to each other)

1907
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:47,540
Okay.

1908
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,540
(Smiling)

1909
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,550
(Ye Eun, Ye Eun)

1910
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:52,710
He put Ye Eun's name up.

1911
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:53,750
(Ye Eun)

1912
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:54,920
You should become stronger.

1913
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,280
(Ye Eun)

1914
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:00,220
(Daniel fills 2 slots
with Ye Eun's name too.)

1915
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,260
Okay.

1916
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,030
Okay, let's take a look.
All right, Jong Kook.

1917
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:07,060
Ye Eun.

1918
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,460
(They are giving
all the slots to Ye Eun, but...)

1919
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,130
Gosh, these punks.

1920
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:13,870
It might not be too fun
to give everything to Ye Eun.

1921
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:16,670
Hang on. Woo Hyun...
Is his name not up there enough?

1922
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:19,840
Oh, Woo Hyun's name is
only up there once.

1923
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,180
(1st place: My name 5 slots,
Our team 2, Another team 2)

1924
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,210
Then...

1925
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,850
I should go with Woo Hyun
and Ye Eun.

1926
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,550
- There.
- You have to do that.

1927
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,050
(He chooses 1 slot for Woo Hyun
and 1 slot for Ye Eun.)

1928
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,050
You can have four slots
for your own name,

1929
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:33,820
two slots for your team,
and one for another team.

1930
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:34,920
Two slots?

1931
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:38,530
I'll put Ha Neul's name in one slot
and Jae Seok's name in another.

1932
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,800
I'll put Ha Neul in slot 20. Okay.

1933
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,460
Jae Seok will go in slot nine.

1934
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,100
- Slot nine?
- Yes.

1935
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,100
(She checks that
her sticker has been added.)

1936
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:49,100
(2nd place: My name 4 slots,
Our team 2, Another team 1)

1937
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:50,570
I should go with our team.

1938
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:51,670
(Our team, 2 slots)

1939
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:54,080
One for Se Chan, one for Jae Seok.

1940
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,340
- Slot 54.
- Slot 54? Okay.

1941
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,380
I'll be going.

1942
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,350
(Jae Seok's turn)

1943
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:04,550
Let's see here.
Shall I give more slots to Ha Neul?

1944
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:08,420
Gosh, we shouldn't keep doing this
within our own team.

1945
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,390
One for Ha Neul,
one for Se Chan. Yes.

1946
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:12,860
Ha Neul in slot 26.

1947
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:14,460
(They don't think to add their own
names and share their chances.)

1948
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,470
Slot eight.
Gosh, then this will be...

1949
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:19,970
This is good luck. Later on,

1950
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:21,500
they'll get to win prizes.

1951
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:24,570
(Meanwhile,
Haha from the 3rd place team)

1952
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:28,080
(Haha's name is
only on the roulette once.)

1953
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,810
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

1954
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:34,480
We don't know, right?
We don't know if it's good or bad?

1955
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,720
(3rd place: My name 3 slots,
Our team 1)

1956
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,120
I'll consider this a good thing.

1957
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,390
I'll put up three for Haha.

1958
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:41,460
(My name, 3 slots)

1959
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,460
I'll take slots 45, 46, and 47.

1960
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,760
(He predicts it's a good thing
and invests in himself.)

1961
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,530
Okay.
This is nothing to think about.

1962
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:50,460
Gosh,
since we don't know what this is...

1963
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:52,830
I have no idea what this is.

1964
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:55,040
(3rd place: My name 3 slots,
Our team 1)

1965
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,770
Then, I'll put my name up for now.

1966
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:59,070
If it's a bad thing,
I hope I don't get chosen.

1967
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:00,740
But if it's a good thing,
then I hope I get chosen.

1968
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,440
(Gut Feeling Ji Hyo also thinks
it's good and invests in herself.)

1969
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,350
- What is it?
- Did someone put my name up?

1970
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:06,350
What is that?

1971
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:07,550
- Why is Ye Eun up there so much?
- Okay, this is the status...

1972
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:09,050
- of the second roulette.
- Ye Eun, you're up there so much.

1973
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,650
- Gosh, I'm so disappointed.
- Look at Haha.

1974
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:12,850
- Gosh, what is this?
- Ji Hyo.

1975
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:14,720
- What's up with Ye Eun and Haha?
- Haha, did you...

1976
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,360
You added your own name.

1977
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,190
(Roulette status: Ye Eun 6,
Haha, Se Chan, Ha Neul 4)

1978
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:20,130
- Ha Neul and Jae Seok has two.
- What?

1979
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:21,230
(Ji Hyo 3, Jae Seok, Seok Jin,
Jong Kook, Daniel, Woo Hyun 2)

1980
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:23,700
That's not fair.
Jae Seok only has two.

1981
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,100
- But you know, Ha Neul, this is...
- Yes?

1982
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,270
- This could be for a prize.
- He must've added my name twice.

1983
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:30,200
- It could be for a prize.
- Oh, yes.

1984
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,470
That's Ha Neul's zone over there.

1985
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:33,470
You're right.

1986
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:34,610
- Oh, Sky has several too.
- You have four.

1987
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:36,240
- It's the Sky zone.
- Yes.

1988
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,450
- How many times did you add me?
- Sky zone.

1989
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,620
Se Chan has many...
Se Chan's name is up there a lot.

1990
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,980
Right, we did it ourselves.

1991
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,990
You know,
this could become a blessing.

1992
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:44,990
- Right, you never know...
- Yes.

1993
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:48,020
- if it'll be a blessing or a curse.
- We only have the last mission now.

1994
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,560
- What?
- Already?

1995
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,690
- Yes, but as I mentioned before,
- Already?

1996
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:52,690
- if it lands on an empty slot,
- All of us.
all of you will get the penalty.

1997
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,130
- That's why we have to fill it.
- We should fill it up.

1998
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,400
- We have to fill it up.
- We should.

1999
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,400
- Let's fill it up this time.
- We should fill it up.

2000
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,000
- We should put a lot of names up.
- Yes, lots of them.

2001
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,670
We should put our own names up,
then.

2002
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:03,140
- Okay, let's go!
- Okay!

2003
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,370
- Are we singing?
- What is this?

2004
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,080
- Oh, my.
- Is this perhaps...

2005
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,610
- We're singing.
- What? "Running Man Singer?"

2006
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:11,910
I'm confident in this area.

2007
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:14,350
- Are you sure?
- I'm confident!

2008
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,620
- Are you really sure?
- Totally.

2009
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:17,620
(Humming)

2010
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:19,850
- I don't know any songs anymore.
- You don't seem to care

2011
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:22,560
- We have a singer on our team.
- That's right.

2012
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,830
There's no turning back

2013
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:26,090
He's showing off his charm.

2014
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,190
Goodness, man.

2015
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,860
(Which mission will play out
on the karaoke set?)

2016
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:32,500
The final mission with
the roulette stickers on the line...

2017
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,570
is The Romantic Singer.

2018
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:37,370
One representative will come up
and listen to the song...

2019
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:40,410
for 30 seconds
from the beginning of the song.

2020
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:46,150
If you know the singer
and the title of the song,

2021
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,720
you can raise
the "Let me answer" sign...

2022
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,220
and answer the question.

2023
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:52,450
If it's correct,
you get as many points...

2024
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,190
as there are remaining seconds
in the song.

2025
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:56,390
For example, if you get
a question correct in three seconds,

2026
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:58,730
you can win 27 points.

2027
01:05:58,730 --> 01:05:59,760
- Nice.
- Sweet.

2028
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,800
- That's awesome.
- The faster you get it right,

2029
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,860
the better it is.

2030
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:05,170
To the team
that enjoys the game the most,

2031
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:07,770
- you'll get extra points.
- Nice.

2032
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:10,000
You will be given benefits...

2033
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,310
according to the points
you accumulate.

2034
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:13,770
I'm good at
guessing songs correctly.

2035
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:15,040
- I'll get it right. Trust me.
- Put your faith in me.

2036
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,750
- Just trust me.
- Okay, you must know lots of songs.

2037
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:19,650
When I saw this on TV,
I got every song correct.

2038
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,880
- I'm really bad at this.
- Do you know lots of songs?

2039
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,050
I think you'll do well.

2040
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:23,820
These guys are going to be good.

2041
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,220
- What about us?
- We're the strong team.

2042
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:26,550
- On either side...
- Oh, really?

2043
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,490
Yes, Jae Seok knows
a lot of songs...

2044
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:29,860
- in a certain era.
- Oh, really?

2045
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,030
- Right.
- I can cover another era too.

2046
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,060
Of course.

2047
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:33,660
Wait, Ha Neul,
do you know lots of songs?

2048
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,000
- What?
- Do you know new songs?

2049
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,830
Of course.

2050
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,030
- Really?
- Yes.

2051
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:39,170
New songs? Like what?

2052
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,430
Do you perhaps know this song?

2053
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:41,670
Queencard
Whose song is that?

2054
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:44,040
- I don't know.
- What?

2055
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,210
What was that?

2056
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,240
It's i-dle's song.

2057
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,040
- I don't know. No.
- Oh, you don't?

2058
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,050
Then,
what's the latest song you know?

2059
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:52,050
Well...

2060
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:54,750
- Is it Fin.K.L? Or SES?
- Ha Neul.

2061
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,550
- Oh, Turbo.
- Turbo.

2062
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:59,290
- Turbo.
- You're stuck way in the past.

2063
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:01,260
- I think you'll be similar to me.
- I don't know much.

2064
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:02,390
- Turd-bo.
- With Turbo...

2065
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,620
"Turd-bo."

2066
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:04,960
(It seems like the two teams will be
neck and neck.)

2067
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,090
Jun Young, you're all we have.

2068
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:08,330
I'll do my best.

2069
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,770
The first players from each team.

2070
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,230
Let's have the three of you come up.

2071
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:14,300
- I don't know.
- Three?

2072
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,000
- One person from each team.
- I don't know.

2073
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,770
- Okay, your worst player...
- Should I go?

2074
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:19,370
- No, wait.
- Wait.

2075
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:21,340
- We should see who else is playing.
- See who the other teams send.

2076
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:25,310
From that team, I can handle
Seok Jin, Haha, and Ji Hyo.

2077
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:29,450
- I'll go.
- What?

2078
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:30,890
- Wait a minute.
- Ha Neul?

2079
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:32,220
Then I'll go.

2080
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,790
- I'll go.
- You're too much.

2081
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,290
- Ha Neul! Then I'll go.
- Okay.

2082
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,960
- I'll go.
- You're too much.

2083
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,230
I'll go.

2084
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,830
- I can take them on.
- Good.

2085
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:40,860
- I can do it.
- Okay.

2086
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,330
- You can't lose this round.
- Jong Kook,

2087
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:43,830
- wipe them out.
- I can take them on.

2088
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:45,400
- I don't know many songs.
- I'll do my best.

2089
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,770
- Me neither.
- I'll do my best.

2090
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,500
Play the song.

2091
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,470
- You have to know this song!
- I know it!

2092
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:53,470
Let me answer!

2093
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:55,580
(Ha Neul shouted, "Let me answer"
in 2 seconds.)

2094
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:57,240
- No way.
- Ha Neul.

2095
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:58,480
- No way.
- I know this one.

2096
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,480
Ha Neul.

2097
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:00,920
- Three...
- No way.

2098
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,250
- I know this one.
- Ha Neul.

2099
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,550
- Stay calm.
- Three,

2100
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,120
- two,
- Go.

2101
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:06,450
one.

2102
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:09,520
- Hold on. I know the song.
- It's...

2103
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:11,190
- I know it.
- It's that song.

2104
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:12,530
I know it.

2105
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,330
- Ha Neul.
- Isn't it "Happy?"

2106
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,030
- It's "Happy" by DAY6.
- "Happy."

2107
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,570
Isn't it a song by DAY6?

2108
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:18,870
(Everyone figured out the answer.)

2109
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:20,800
("Happy" by DAY6)

2110
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,900
- I know it. If I say the title,
- She's married to a dentist.

2111
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,170
- someone else will get it right.
- No. That isn't it.

2112
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:25,740
- Someone else will get it right.
- What was the name of the group?

2113
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:27,270
It was a four-member group.

2114
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:31,010
(The cryopreserved human
is getting thawed.)

2115
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:32,210
I know the title.

2116
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,550
- Do you know the title?
- Let me answer!

2117
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,680
(Does the one man who lives young
know the answer?)

2118
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,150
- It's Jaurim's...
- No.

2119
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:39,550
- "Why Why Why."
- No.

2120
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:40,620
(Incorrect)

2121
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:41,620
"Why Why Why."

2122
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,460
- He makes me go, "Why?"
- Well...

2123
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:44,760
- It's Jaurim's song.
- In that case,

2124
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,860
- will you listen to it a bit more?
- Hold on. No.

2125
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:47,960
- Let's listen to it a bit more.
- I don't think she knows.

2126
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,530
- The title is in the lyrics.
- I know.

2127
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:50,760
The artist.

2128
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:53,470
(My goodness)

2129
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:55,840
- Let me answer! "Happy!"
- The answer.

2130
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,040
- Who is the artist?
- All right.

2131
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:58,570
- All right.
- The artist.

2132
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:00,440
- The artist isn't Young K.
- All right.

2133
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,580
- Three...
- All right.

2134
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,980
Hold on. What am I going to do?

2135
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,980
- You really like this group.
- Oh, no.

2136
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,750
What's wrong with me?
What am I going to do?

2137
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,720
You listen to their songs a lot.

2138
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,950
I absolutely love this group.

2139
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,250
Why can't I remember their name?

2140
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:13,250
- Is it a group?
- I really like this group.

2141
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,460
- I forgot due to the nerves.
- It's a group. Do you like them?

2142
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:17,090
- I really like this group.
- Then it must be an old group.

2143
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:18,260
No? Is it a current group?

2144
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:20,190
Let me answer.
It's UP's "Ppuyo Ppuyo."

2145
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:21,760
Come on!

2146
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,430
- It's correct.
- CNBLUE's "Happy?"

2147
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:25,970
Young K.

2148
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,840
Can you give us the first letter?

2149
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,740
- I suddenly forgot.
- I have no idea.

2150
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:31,110
The first letter.

2151
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:32,140
- The first letter.
- All right.

2152
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:33,970
The group name starts with D.

2153
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:35,580
- She gave you everything.
- Go.

2154
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:37,310
- The group name starts with D.
- D?

2155
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,050
How could you not know it?

2156
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,310
- I'm starting to think...
- Seriously.

2157
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,720
The group Young K is in.

2158
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,880
- That's right.
- Does it start with D?

2159
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,320
- The group Young K is in?
- D?

2160
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:46,720
Ha Neul, now is the time to answer.

2161
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,720
You have all the information.

2162
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,690
(Se Chan, I don't remember.)

2163
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:50,930
Jong Kook, come on.

2164
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:52,930
Jong Kook, we even sang the song.

2165
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:54,860
- I know it.
- I know it.

2166
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,460
Na, na, na, happy
The song goes like that.

2167
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,870
- You know everything.
- "Happy."

2168
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:00,170
- You know it.
- So the name...

2169
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,400
- starts with D.
- Am I stupid or something?

2170
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:03,640
What was the name?

2171
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,040
- All right.
- This one is easy.

2172
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,140
What was the name?

2173
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,440
(Like a heroine with a memory loss)

2174
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,840
Now, the three of you...

2175
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,310
- should stand straight.
- Okay.

2176
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:12,410
- I'll give you the first syllable.
- Okay.

2177
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:14,450
- Shout "Let me answer" first...
- Okay.

2178
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:15,550
- to answer.
- I'm so upset.

2179
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:16,620
- Ha Neul, it's okay.
- Let's go.

2180
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,350
The first syllable is Day.

2181
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:21,260
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

2182
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,320
I know it!

2183
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,420
(Jong Kook gets a chance to answer.)

2184
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,790
It's DAY6's "Happy."

2185
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:27,160
(Correct)

2186
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,300
Well done.

2187
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,130
Ha Neul, it's "Happy."

2188
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:32,000
- I must be stupid.
- You had the answer.

2189
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,070
- I like the group so much.
- Hey.

2190
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:35,570
(She takes the stage right away.)

2191
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,970
She knows the song.

2192
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:40,310
- I like this song so much.
- Go ahead.

2193
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,910
(It's obvious
that it's Ha Neul's go-to song.)

2194
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:45,950
Go ahead.

2195
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:47,680
You should've gotten it right.

2196
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:48,920
You know the song.

2197
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:50,920
She's good.

2198
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,520
- Hey!
- One, two, three, four.

2199
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:57,460
Will such a day come?

2200
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:00,590
(What?)

2201
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,060
My goodness.

2202
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,730
(The day I'm so happy
that I shout to the sky)

2203
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:05,630
(She messes up the lyrics.)

2204
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:09,940
(She jumps between octaves
in a drastic manner.)

2205
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:11,770
(Her singing style
makes you want to hear more!)

2206
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:19,250
(Ha Neul can't hit high notes.)

2207
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:21,120
(Next to her is the perfect singer!)

2208
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,950
Anybody, please give me the answer

2209
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:34,560
(At a corner,)

2210
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,000
(the shy boy is grooving.)

2211
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,270
(The shy mode is on.)

2212
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,740
(He's about to dance.)

2213
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:47,880
It was great.

2214
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:48,880
I must be stupid.

2215
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,980
Seriously.

2216
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:52,450
- I must be stupid.
- Team Woo Hyun...

2217
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:53,610
- answered correctly.
- Gosh.

2218
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:54,820
- I must be stupid.
- The additional points...

2219
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,820
- will go to Team Ha Neul.
- Good. Well done, Ha Neul.

2220
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,690
- It's so upsetting.
- It's so upsetting.

2221
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,390
- It's so upsetting.
- I did it.

2222
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:01,520
- Ha Neul.
- You had the answer.

2223
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,220
- You knew the song.
- It's my absolute favorite.

2224
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:05,860
I must be stupid.

2225
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:07,760
Jong Kook and Ha Neul, come on out.

2226
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,700
- Come on out.
- Me?

2227
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,960
The old school members should go.

2228
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,230
- The old school members.
- Do I look like an easy target?

2229
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:13,870
I have a chance.

2230
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:15,500
- We're easy targets.
- What?

2231
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:16,670
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2232
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:18,370
(The kings of old school music
come out again.)

2233
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,140
- You can do it.
- Hey, you need to win this round.

2234
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:22,940
- Let's do it.
- Everyone, come on out.

2235
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,010
- I'll answer correctly.
- Let's go.

2236
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:26,880
- Now, the song.
- I want to answer correctly.

2237
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,050
Give us the song.

2238
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:33,590
- Let me answer!
- What?

2239
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:35,320
Cool's...

2240
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,460
- "Woman on the Beach."
- Seriously.

2241
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:38,290
- What was it?
- No.

2242
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,430
How frustrating.

2243
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:40,430
Let me answer!

2244
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:42,360
- Do you have an answer?
- Cool's "Before a Breakup Comes."

2245
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,200
- What?
- Let me answer.

2246
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:46,330
Cool's "Before Comes Sadness."

2247
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:47,800
- Seok Jin.
- Let me answer!

2248
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:49,200
"Before Sadness Comes."

2249
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,400
Okay. It's correct.

2250
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,510
- Cool.
- Okay.

2251
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:52,940
It isn't a song by Cool!

2252
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,140
All right.

2253
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,340
- Okay.
- My goodness.

2254
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:56,380
(The cryopreserved girl is good
with songs from the 90s.)

2255
01:12:58,010 --> 01:12:59,750
Come on out. Let's dance.

2256
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:00,850
Let's go this way.

2257
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:02,320
- This way.
- Let's go.

2258
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,750
- This way.
- "Before Sadness Comes."

2259
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,990
- This way.
- Let's go.

2260
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:06,020
- Ha Neul, come here.
- The right.

2261
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,150
- Jae Seok, go to the right.
- The right.

2262
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:08,390
- What are we doing?
- The right.

2263
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:10,020
- Let's go.
- The right.

2264
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:11,360
- One, two,
- One, two.

2265
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,460
- three, go.
- The right.

2266
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:15,360
(Bumping)

2267
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:21,740
(They begin to dance in sync.)

2268
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:22,900
Go to the right.

2269
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,300
One, two, three. Hey.

2270
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,970
- Go to the left.
- One, two, three.

2271
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,510
What's this?

2272
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:33,680
(Haha is Lee Je Hoon.
He just has a similar hairstyle.)

2273
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:39,620
(Ha Neul is Yuri.
She just goes to team dinners.)

2274
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:42,090
This is the karaoke.

2275
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:43,320
- This is a team dinner.
- You're good.

2276
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:45,690
(When you turn around)

2277
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:46,730
Good.

2278
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:49,060
(A higher-up's dance
that stays true to the lyrics)

2279
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,430
Let's go!

2280
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:55,440
(They need to work hard
to get the bonus points.)

2281
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,540
(Me, you)

2282
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,140
(The climax is approaching.)

2283
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,280
"Oh, I see the way..."

2284
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:04,110
Hey!

2285
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,880
(At that moment)

2286
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,820
(The shy mode is on.)

2287
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,790
(The shy mode is off.)

2288
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:15,490
(The shy boy enters
with a flushed face.)

2289
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:19,330
(The introverted man gets pushed off
despite plucking up his courage.)

2290
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:20,630
- Jun Young.
- Okay.

2291
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:26,000
(Stealing)

2292
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:28,170
(Stealing)

2293
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:31,410
(Stealing)

2294
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:36,240
(They have a fierce competition
for the microphone.)

2295
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,410
- Okay.
- Stop.

2296
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,550
Seriously,

2297
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:41,010
this song is a masterpiece.

2298
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,020
It was fun.

2299
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,650
Ha Neul, you did well.

2300
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,490
- Team Ha Neul answered correctly.
- This song is a masterpiece.

2301
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:47,990
- Team Jun Young...
- Well done.

2302
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:49,520
- will get the bonus points.
- Okay.

2303
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,690
(Team Jun Young got 10 points
for the introverted man's tears.)

2304
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:51,790
- Okay.
- Okay.

2305
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:52,860
Jae Seok, you should go next.

2306
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:55,860
(Then came the match
against Top 100 Songs Fairy.)

2307
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,930
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

2308
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:00,500
Songolmae's "A Chance Encounter."

2309
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,100
Let's go.

2310
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,440
(Team Ha Neul got 29 points.)

2311
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,440
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three, four.

2312
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,370
(I met you)

2313
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,310
(By chance)

2314
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:13,210
- One, two, three, four.
- Jun Young.

2315
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:16,050
(Woo Hyun shows
a musical performance.)

2316
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:17,950
(The shy mode is on.)

2317
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:19,150
(The shy mode is off.
A popping dancer enters.)

2318
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:20,890
- Jun Young.
- That's good, Jun Young.

2319
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:22,360
Just dance.

2320
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:24,530
- Just dance.
- Just do it.

2321
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:26,960
- Just do it.
- Here comes the sound effect.

2322
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,660
(Wrapping up)

2323
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,070
He's good.

2324
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,670
(He goes back to being a shy boy.)

2325
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:38,010
(They sang together
until their voices went hoarse.)

2326
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:41,110
This time, the bonus points
will go to Team Woo Hyun.

2327
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,480
- Yes.
- Woo Hyun.

2328
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,510
We got some points.

2329
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:44,510
What?

2330
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:45,610
(Then came the next song.)

2331
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:46,650
Let me answer.

2332
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:48,580
- BLACKPINK's "Whistle."
- No.

2333
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,620
- There you go.
- BLACKPINK.

2334
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,650
- Ha Neul.
- Let me answer!

2335
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:51,690
BLACKPINK's "Playing with Fire."

2336
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:52,990
- Okay.
- "Playing with Fire."

2337
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:54,820
- I can't believe it. Really?
- "Playing with Fire."

2338
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:56,620
It was "Playing with Fire."
Why did I say "Whistle?"

2339
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:59,290
- "Playing with Fire."
- I know so many songs.

2340
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:03,330
(He sings "Playing with Fire"
in the original key.)

2341
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,770
He's good. Woo Hyun is good.

2342
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:09,140
What? Ye Eun.

2343
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:13,410
(She sings passionately
without a microphone.)

2344
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:18,650
(The result of the performance
is like playing with fire)

2345
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:20,380
- I knew it.
- The bonus points go...

2346
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:22,080
- to Team Woo Hyun.
- Okay.

2347
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,580
(Team Woo Hyun got 10 points
since he sang in the original key.)

2348
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:24,620
(Team Jun Young: 10,
Team Ha Neul: 96, Team Woo Hyun: 42)

2349
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:25,790
You're different.

2350
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,760
- Next players, come on out.
- What should we do?

2351
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:29,790
What should we do?

2352
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:31,090
You need to go.

2353
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:32,730
- Ye Eun?
- I'll go.

2354
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:34,930
- Ye Eun, let's get our revenge.
- Ye Eun, let's do this.

2355
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:36,860
- Ye Eun, let's get our revenge.
- The old songs...

2356
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,630
You should go.

2357
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:40,370
- Okay. I'll go.
- Let's win one more time.

2358
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:42,100
You know more old songs, right?

2359
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,240
(Will Jun Young and Ye Eun catch up
with the 1st place team?)

2360
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:45,140
- I can recognize the old songs.
- Really?

2361
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:46,970
- It shouldn't be an old song.
- Play the song.

2362
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:49,740
- It shouldn't be an old song.
- Let's go, Jun Young.

2363
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:50,840
- Let me answer.
- Let's go.

2364
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,150
- KOYOTE's "Pure Love."
- Okay.

2365
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,380
- What?
- Okay.

2366
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:55,620
(KOYOTE's "Pure Love!")

2367
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:56,780
(Se Chan got it right
after listening for 1 second.)

2368
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:57,780
- No way.
- Let's go.

2369
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,620
- Let's go.
- KOYOTE.

2370
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:00,820
(Handing over the microphone
to the main vocalist)

2371
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,120
Let's get the bonus points.

2372
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,220
Let's dance.

2373
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:04,260
(Let's do it for the bonus points.)

2374
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,660
("Pure Love" by KOYOTE)

2375
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:07,360
Let's go.

2376
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:09,900
- Run!
- Hee-haw!

2377
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,160
(The pure horse is ready.)

2378
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:13,330
- Let's go!
- Good.

2379
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:14,600
(Cheering)

2380
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,040
Run!

2381
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,370
- Come on.
- Shinji.

2382
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,240
(They do the Horse Dance
as a group.)

2383
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:21,910
Okay. Let's go.

2384
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:23,510
Two, three, four.

2385
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:26,450
(Run!)

2386
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:30,080
(They go wild
like a group of horses.)

2387
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,890
(Going wild in a timid way)

2388
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:34,890
(Spotting)

2389
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:35,960
Let's go.

2390
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,190
You're good.

2391
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:41,430
(Stretching)

2392
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:43,900
(He returns with a flushed face.)

2393
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,600
(If you leave me
in search of your happiness)

2394
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:50,170
(The main vocalist begins.)

2395
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,240
- This is great.
- Hey!

2396
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,670
- Think it over again
- This is great.

2397
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:55,840
- You shouldn't do this to me
- You're good.

2398
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,110
- Okay.
- Hey!

2399
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:00,580
(She's surprised by her high notes.)

2400
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:05,050
(Hitting high notes like a dolphin)

2401
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,460
(I want to ask you to stay)

2402
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:09,460
Let's go.

2403
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:11,490
- One, two, three, four!
- One, two, three, four!

2404
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,560
(Let's party.)

2405
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:19,900
(They forget about the points
and focus on the party.)

2406
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:27,910
(They finally calm down.)

2407
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:31,180
- You came to me when I was sad
- It was exciting.

2408
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:32,780
- Nice.
- You're so good at singing.

2409
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:35,850
- Me?
- You totally relieved your stress.

2410
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:39,490
This time, Team Ha Neul
answered correctly.

2411
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:41,050
The bonus points also go
to Team Ha Neul.

2412
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,120
Okay.

2413
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,390
(Team Ha Neul got 29 and 10 points
since Ha Neul hit high notes.)

2414
01:18:44,490 --> 01:18:45,630
(Thanks to Se Chan,
Team Ha Neul secured 1st place.)

2415
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:46,660
I'm out of breath.

2416
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:47,760
Your high notes are great.

2417
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,530
- Really?
- Ji Hyo, let's go.

2418
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:50,830
- You sang so well.
- This is hard.

2419
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,500
This team hasn't answered
one question right.

2420
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,700
- Not one question?
- No.

2421
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:58,040
I'll answer correctly
if I get a similar song.

2422
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,070
- Go ahead.
- May I choose?

2423
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:01,340
- Choose what?
- May I choose the players?

2424
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:02,640
- That's a good idea.
- Sure.

2425
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,940
Jong Kook.

2426
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:06,650
Jong Kook. Ha Neul.

2427
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:08,720
- Okay. Ha Neul, go.
- I know a lot of songs.

2428
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,250
- Ha Neul is good.
- Are you looking down on me?

2429
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,750
- Seok Jin.
- Seok Jin.

2430
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:13,050
Ha Neul got three songs right.

2431
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:14,420
It depends on the time period.

2432
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:16,720
- I kept answering correctly.
- No way.

2433
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,690
- Ha Neul is good.
- Jun Young will go.

2434
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:21,560
- You know many songs, right?
- I'm sure he knows more than I do.

2435
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,600
- Go.
- He knows more than I do.

2436
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,630
- Haven't you answered correctly?
- I don't know any songs.

2437
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:24,930
- I haven't answered correctly.
- Really?

2438
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:26,800
(Will Team Jun Young escape
last place?)

2439
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,570
- Is the song ready?
- I'm terrible at it.

2440
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:30,100
Play the song.

2441
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:31,940
Let's go.

2442
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:33,570
- Go.
- I know this one.

2443
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:34,570
- All right.
- Let's go.

2444
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:38,250
(Did Jun Young figure it out
right away?)

2445
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:40,280
- But whose song is it?
- Three,

2446
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:41,950
- What are you talking about?
- two...

2447
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:43,020
- You're strange.
- Don't you know?

2448
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,050
- Why did you decide to go then?
- One.

2449
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,490
I just know the title.

2450
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:47,590
Don't say it. Don't say the title.

2451
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:49,820
- I know the song.
- What should I do?

2452
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,960
I can't think of the artist.

2453
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:54,160
- You know the song, right?
- The artist is hard.

2454
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,230
The artist is hard.

2455
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,000
It's "Gangster."
Kang Sung's "Gangster."

2456
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,130
- This one is too hard.
- It's hard.

2457
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,540
(It's a difficult question.
It's Kang Sung's "Gangster.")

2458
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,640
Jae Seok, spin.

2459
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,740
It's this scene.

2460
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:08,480
(They can think of the scene.
They know the song.)

2461
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,640
- Let's go.
- Hey.

2462
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:12,150
I don't remember the artist.

2463
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:13,710
- Don't you know?
- Whose song is it?

2464
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:14,820
Give us a hint.

2465
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:17,820
If the artist is hard, I'll tell you
that the name has two syllables.

2466
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,350
The first syllable is Kang.

2467
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:21,660
- She gave away everything.
- Is the artist's name...

2468
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:22,990
- Kang?
- She gave away everything.

2469
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:24,390
Just add any syllable.

2470
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:26,390
- Try any syllable.
- Try any syllable.

2471
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:27,460
(They just need to guess
one syllable!)

2472
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:28,460
Kang Sung.

2473
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:29,560
(At that moment,)

2474
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,230
(Jong Kook got "Kang Sung"
from his distant memories.)

2475
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:32,600
- Kang Sung?
- Kang Sung's...

2476
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,700
- Ha Neul, answer instead.
- Three...

2477
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,240
- "Rustic Period."
- No!

2478
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,470
(Laughing)

2479
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:38,640
(He got the song title wrong!)

2480
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,270
- No!
- Kang... Let me answer.

2481
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:41,910
- Kang Sung's "Gangster."
- I mean...

2482
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:44,010
(Correct)

2483
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:45,750
- It's "Gangster."
- Is it "Gangster?"

2484
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:47,510
- Well done.
- It's "Gangster."

2485
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:48,880
(Team Jun Young got 28 points
for the 1st correct answer.)

2486
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,220
- Do you know this song?
- Of course.

2487
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:52,750
Is it "Gangster?"

2488
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,460
- Mom and Dad, are you watching?
- "Rustic Period" is a drama.

2489
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,860
A drama title.

2490
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,330
I know this song.

2491
01:20:58,330 --> 01:21:00,160
Gosh, "Rustic Period."

2492
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,560
(It was the song of the men
who dreamed of being strong!)

2493
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:07,370
(Like a wind)

2494
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:10,070
(A tasteful start)

2495
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:12,310
(Passion and romance pass)

2496
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:16,510
(A lousy voice gets added.)

2497
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:26,990
(Listening to Jee-rasoni's
lethargic singing...)

2498
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,590
(kills the energy.)

2499
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:32,930
You should sing outside, Seok Jin.

2500
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,830
- I don't know the song.
- Sing.

2501
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,930
Sing. I don't know the song.

2502
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,000
(It looks like he won't be
a successful soloist.)

2503
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,670
- I don't know the song.
- This time, the bonus points...

2504
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:42,470
will go to Team Jun Young as well.

2505
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,470
- They didn't disappoint.
- It has been a while.

2506
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:46,310
Send out a member
to represent the team.

2507
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:47,670
- Se Chan, go.
- Shall I go next?

2508
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:49,710
- Jong Kook, I'll go. This won't do.
- Go ahead.

2509
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,580
- Shall I go?
- You're enjoying this the most.

2510
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:53,080
This is so much fun.

2511
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,650
- Every day...
- Okay. Stand in the middle.

2512
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,650
Play the song.

2513
01:21:56,650 --> 01:22:00,020
- It's hot.
- Why... Get some supplements.

2514
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:01,690
- You know this song.
- I know it.

2515
01:22:01,690 --> 01:22:03,790
(Is it the sound
of a car's exhaust?)

2516
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:05,760
- Hey.
- Let me answer!

2517
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:07,530
- Seok Jin.
- Let me answer.

2518
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:08,560
- It's me.
- Se Chan said it first.

2519
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,930
(Se Chan seizes a chance again.)

2520
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:11,500
Young Turks Club's "Affection."

2521
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:12,530
- There you go.
- Okay.

2522
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:13,970
(Team Ha Neul got 23 points.)

2523
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:15,040
(Team Ha Neul solidifies
its 1st place.)

2524
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,300
It's a great song.

2525
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:18,570
- Gosh, how does he know the song?
- Gosh.

2526
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:20,610
- How much did he party?
- The exhaust sound is a cue.

2527
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,110
That's right.

2528
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:25,110
- You said that you loved me
- You said that you loved me

2529
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:27,810
(Why doesn't Se Chan know the song?)

2530
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:31,820
(Ha Neul comes to rescue.)

2531
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:33,690
(Se Chan answers correctly
and Ha Neul sings.)

2532
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:34,920
- Your word
- She's good.

2533
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,420
She sings with her throat.

2534
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:41,960
- Here comes the last song.
- Ji Ye Eun.

2535
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,330
(It's the last chance
for the 2nd and 3rd places.)

2536
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:44,830
- You can do it.
- Come on.

2537
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:47,200
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

2538
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:50,670
- Davichi's "Love and War."
- Gosh.

2539
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:53,270
- "Love and War?"
- For goodness' sake.

2540
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:55,310
- It's my song.
- It's his song.

2541
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:57,110
He did the narration in the intro.

2542
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:58,880
- Come on.
- Do it properly.

2543
01:22:58,950 --> 01:22:59,950
- Listen.
- "Love and War."
Oh, my gosh.

2544
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:02,120
- I think I'll die without you.
- It's the original.

2545
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:04,320
I have two eyes...

2546
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:05,490
What's that?

2547
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:07,390
I have two eyes,

2548
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:09,220
so why can I see only you?

2549
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:11,790
Stop with your nonsense!
Who were you with yesterday?

2550
01:23:11,790 --> 01:23:13,590
You said that you liked me!

2551
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:16,430
- Well...
- Who were you with?

2552
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,430
It isn't like that!

2553
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,400
I was home!

2554
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:21,970
Mom cooked me a meal!

2555
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:26,210
(They begin the song
with a live narration.)

2556
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:31,910
(They add the Hand Edge Dance
from the past.)

2557
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:37,750
(Director Kim does his own dance.)

2558
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:40,150
(Dancing)

2559
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,160
That's insane. His dance is insane.

2560
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:45,690
(Winking)

2561
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:46,960
Step forward.

2562
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,400
(They even do the Bullet of Love
that became extinct in 2010.)

2563
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,630
Do the Bullet Dance.

2564
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,970
(Moving to the center)

2565
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:54,770
(She dances without hesitation.)

2566
01:23:54,770 --> 01:23:57,600
That's insane. My goodness.

2567
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:01,670
Hey, I saw this dance.

2568
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:02,840
(Shooting bullets
at men and women of all ages)

2569
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:04,840
Ha Neul, keep going.

2570
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:07,150
- You know, Ha Neul...
- Gosh.

2571
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,380
Ha Neul dances like a higher-up
in the company.

2572
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,320
- Dance!
- Seriously.

2573
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,490
- All of her dances are like that.
- I saw the Double Pistol of Love.

2574
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:14,490
It was so...

2575
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:18,190
- Thus, the final score is out.
- It was great.

2576
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:19,560
- It was fun.
- Let's see.

2577
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,790
(They enjoyed crazy performances.)

2578
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:22,300
- In first place is...
- It's us.

2579
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:24,200
- It's us.
- Team Ha Neul...

2580
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,970
- with 158 points.
- Okay.

2581
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,930
- It's okay.
- This is incredible.

2582
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:29,370
- We brought all the points.
- In second place is...

2583
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:31,000
Let's take the second place.

2584
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,240
- In second place is...
- Please.

2585
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,970
We kept winning points.

2586
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:36,510
- Team Jun Young with 77 points.
- Okay.

2587
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,040
- We turned the tables.
- We turned the tables.

2588
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,450
(Team Jun Young turned the tables
with bonus points.)

2589
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,650
- They got bonus points.
- I guess they did that.

2590
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,580
- I guess so.
- In third place is...

2591
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,950
- Team Woo Hyun with 62 points.
- Okay.

2592
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:48,960
- It's time to put stickers...
- Okay.

2593
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,020
on the wheel one last time.

2594
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:52,790
So only two members
from each team can go.

2595
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,530
We need to fill the spots.

2596
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:56,660
- It's for everyone.
- Let's hurry up and fill them.

2597
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:58,330
- I'll put my name in there.
- Okay.

2598
01:24:58,330 --> 01:24:59,530
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2599
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:01,970
(Woo Hyun and Ye Eun get chosen
from Team Woo Hyun.)

2600
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:04,100
In any case,
we need to fill the spots.

2601
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,910
- I'll do that.
- We need to fill all of them.

2602
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,510
If you put someone else's name...
If we get chosen,

2603
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:10,080
- it'll be useless.
- It'll be useless.

2604
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,850
- That's right.
- You need to put your own name.

2605
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:13,980
- I can't trust her.
- Hey.

2606
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:16,120
- Hey, Ye Eun.
- I can't trust Ye Eun.

2607
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,580
- What was that look in your eyes?
- No.

2608
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:19,850
There are many empty slots.

2609
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:21,090
(Woo Hyun enters first.)

2610
01:25:21,090 --> 01:25:22,660
- Can I put two for our team?
- One.

2611
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,120
One? For our team?

2612
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:25,990
That won't do.

2613
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:28,330
(3rd place: My name 3 slots,
Our team 1)

2614
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:29,660
I'll add three.

2615
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:32,070
(My name 3 slots)

2616
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:34,870
(He keeps his promise
and puts his name in 3 slots.)

2617
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:36,240
Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.

2618
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,970
(Were other slots filled
the same way?)

2619
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:41,310
This is intense. Three.

2620
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:42,480
(They enter the ending location.)

2621
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:45,250
- No way.
- Oh, my goodness.

2622
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,680
- My name is in many slots.
- What should I do?

2623
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,180
- Seriously.
- What?

2624
01:25:49,550 --> 01:25:51,250
This is intense.

2625
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,820
- What should I do?
- My name is in many slots.

2626
01:25:53,890 --> 01:25:55,690
- Gosh.
- No way.

2627
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:58,090
- This is the wheel...
- My name is in many slots.

2628
01:25:58,090 --> 01:25:59,260
you completed on your own.

2629
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:00,860
- Gosh.
- There are...

2630
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:02,430
- six empty slots.
- I see more with my name.

2631
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:03,900
Why do so many slots have my name?

2632
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:06,500
- Why are there so many empty slots?
- So many.

2633
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,600
If an empty slot gets chosen,

2634
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,470
- everyone will get the penalty.
- Everyone.

2635
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:11,740
- No way.
- Many members put...

2636
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:13,810
someone else's name
instead of their own.

2637
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:15,510
So six slots remain empty.

2638
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:18,280
One slot for Jae Seok.

2639
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:21,110
Slot 19 for Ha Neul.

2640
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:22,150
(Se Chan chose 2 slots for his team
instead of his name.)

2641
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:24,120
I'll give Se Chan and Ha Neul
one each.

2642
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,320
(Jae Seok did the same.)

2643
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,120
Daniel doesn't have many slots.

2644
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:29,890
I'll give Daniel one slot.

2645
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:32,230
Number 30.

2646
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:35,190
I should give Seok Jin some.

2647
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,160
I should stick it in the empty ones.
We shouldn't have empty slots.

2648
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,830
(2nd place: My name 3 slots,
Our team 2, Another team 1)

2649
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:43,000
(Our team: 2 slots)

2650
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,610
He didn't get many answers today.
I didn't either, but...

2651
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,470
I'm a fan.

2652
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:51,780
(Jun Young chose only Seok Sam
from beginning to end.)

2653
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,950
Seriously.

2654
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:55,780
- Come on.
- Why are you so selfish?

2655
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:56,880
What is this?

2656
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,220
There's a chance
it may not be a penalty.

2657
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:59,590
- It might not be a penalty.
- It's really...

2658
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:01,920
We told you there were chance slots.

2659
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,020
- Yes.
- Yes.

2660
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,790
You can remove the chance slots.

2661
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:06,790
- Can we remove it?
- Remove the gray stickers.

2662
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:08,600
- Gray?
- This one.

2663
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:11,300
- Left ten. Goodness.
- Goodness.

2664
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:13,130
Goodness.

2665
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:16,070
(There's an instruction.)

2666
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:18,440
- Like that?
- This is amazing.

2667
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:20,640
- Right three.
- Right one.

2668
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:22,510
Right one, Jun Young.

2669
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:24,410
- Gosh, this...
- One, two...

2670
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:25,880
Seriously.

2671
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:28,580
This is scary. Goodness.

2672
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:29,580
(They add the chances
of someone getting picked.)

2673
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:31,120
(It will be Jun Young
if it stops at Jun Young.)

2674
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,590
(It will be Jun Young
if it stops at the one before.)

2675
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:35,120
Before the recording,

2676
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,290
we asked you which members
would receive the prize...

2677
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:40,160
and which would receive the penalty.

2678
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,960
- Do you remember?
- That was the one?

2679
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:44,860
The number of responses determines
whether you get...

2680
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:47,070
- The question you asked first?
- a prize or penalty.

2681
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:50,200
Between the prize and the penalty,

2682
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,310
which do you want Woo Hyun to get?

2683
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:53,940
(What do you want Nam Woo Hyun
to get? Prize or penalty?)

2684
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:57,110
I'm close to Woo Hyun, so a prize.

2685
01:27:57,510 --> 01:28:01,650
What do you want Haha to get?
Prize or penalty?

2686
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:03,450
Prize.

2687
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:05,520
- Seok Sam?
- Yes.

2688
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,950
(Prize or penalty for Seok Sam?)

2689
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:09,660
Hold on. Penalty...

2690
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:11,420
- He got penalties once in a while.
- Yes.

2691
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,260
But I don't remember him
getting a prize.

2692
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:14,490
(Prize: 2, Penalty: 0)

2693
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:18,200
- He really didn't.
- So, will you be kind today?

2694
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,300
(Thinking)

2695
01:28:19,770 --> 01:28:22,140
Yes. I'll be kind and say penalty.

2696
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:23,870
(Penalty!)

2697
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:25,200
- Daniel?
- Yes.

2698
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:28,140
It would be fun if he got a penalty.

2699
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:30,880
A penalty, of course.
Why are you asking?

2700
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,310
Wouldn't it be funnier
if he got a penalty?

2701
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:35,210
I want him to get a penalty.

2702
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,080
Se Chan should get a penalty.

2703
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,220
Penalty, of course.

2704
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:39,490
(Prize or penalty for Ye Eun?)

2705
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:41,390
It's time you got a penalty,
Jong Kook.

2706
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:43,590
A penalty, of course.

2707
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:46,560
My friends should all get
the penalty.

2708
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:48,290
That would make it fun.

2709
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:51,260
- What?
- Only Ye Eun and Jun Young...

2710
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,770
Ye Eun wanted Haha
and Jun Young wanted Woo Hyun...

2711
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:57,940
- to receive prizes.
- Goodness. Ye Eun.

2712
01:28:57,940 --> 01:28:59,940
- Jun Young.
- The rest said...

2713
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:01,940
they wanted the members
to receive the penalty.

2714
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:03,840
- That's mean.
- That's really mean.

2715
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,940
The rest said
they wanted the members...

2716
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:06,410
(Well...)

2717
01:29:06,410 --> 01:29:07,480
- That's really mean.
- Seriously.

2718
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:08,850
We did that for fun.

2719
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:11,750
- So, according to your responses,
- I wanted to say prize.

2720
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:15,860
we put in 9 penalty balls
and 2 prize balls.

2721
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:17,260
What?

2722
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:20,490
We'll select from these balls
and decide whether you'll get...

2723
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:22,530
- a prize or penalty.
- If it was going to be like this...

2724
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:26,100
Today's prize is 500-dollar-worth
of Onnuri gift certificates.

2725
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,530
- That's a lot.
- Five hundred dollars?

2726
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:29,200
- That's really nice.
- We could get the prize.

2727
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,200
It's really nice.
You can use it at the markets.
He really likes it.

2728
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,470
The penalty is at the back.

2729
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:33,740
We can get that one too.

2730
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:35,640
- No way.
- It could be refreshing.

2731
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:38,080
One of you can pick the ball.

2732
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,080
- Kim Ha Neul.
- There are only two prize balls.

2733
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,650
- Ha Neul.
- Sky.

2734
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:43,580
- Pick the prize.
- You never know.

2735
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:44,880
You never know.
You might pick the prize ball.

2736
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,050
Right. There are two prize balls.

2737
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:47,520
- You can pick it.
- There's a chance.

2738
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,060
- I'm not good at this.
- Let's go.

2739
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:50,690
(There are 9 penalty balls
and only 2 prize balls.)

2740
01:29:50,690 --> 01:29:51,790
I don't think I can do it.

2741
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:53,590
- You never know!
- Please!

2742
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:54,890
- Let's go!
- I'm not good at this.

2743
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:55,930
Let's get the prize!

2744
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,130
Let's get the prize!

2745
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,500
Prize! Please!

2746
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:02,170
- You never know!
- Please!

2747
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:03,540
I'm not good at this.

2748
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,370
- It's a penalty ball.
- It's a penalty ball.

2749
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:08,240
- It's a penalty ball.
- It's a penalty ball.

2750
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:10,580
(She picked a penalty ball.)

2751
01:30:10,610 --> 01:30:12,780
- She didn't say, "Here I go."
- You'll get a penalty.

2752
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,580
- She didn't say, "Here I go."
- She didn't say, "Here I go."

2753
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:16,650
- I didn't say, "Here I go."
- No. That's it for today.

2754
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:18,250
- You'll get a penalty.
- She didn't say, "Here I go."

2755
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:20,220
- She didn't say, "Here I go."
- Shouldn't you say that?

2756
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:21,520
This is crazy.

2757
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,020
Since you picked a penalty ball,

2758
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:24,520
- you will spin the roulette...
- Goodness.

2759
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,660
and three people
will receive the penalty.

2760
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:29,400
(Ye Eun: 6 slots)

2761
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:31,060
I think you and I will get it.

2762
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:33,630
- Right. We will get it.
- It's for sure.

2763
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:35,840
Goodness.

2764
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:38,170
(Haha: 4 slots, Jun Young: 2 slots)

2765
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:41,070
When it stops at an empty slot,
everyone will get the penalty.

2766
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:43,880
Jong Kook.
You only have two slots, right?

2767
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,380
- You only have two slots.
- Still,

2768
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:47,680
if it stops at the empty slot,
we will all receive the penalty.

2769
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,280
Please don't stop at the empty one.

2770
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,350
Who will spin the roulette?

2771
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,080
- Should I spin it?
- Just spin it.

2772
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,090
- Just spin it with force.
- You can spin it.

2773
01:30:53,090 --> 01:30:54,790
- Should I spin it this way?
- You can spin it, Ha Neul.

2774
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:56,760
- Why?
- You can spin it, Ha Neul.

2775
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,160
- You can spin it.
- I think...

2776
01:30:58,160 --> 01:30:59,690
I'd blame you if you spun it.

2777
01:30:59,690 --> 01:31:01,590
Right. You should spin it
so he doesn't blame anyone.

2778
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:03,030
- Right.
- Let's not blame anyone.

2779
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:05,000
- I won't blame you.
- You will blame me.

2780
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,030
- Of course, we'd blame you.
- Just spin it once.

2781
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,800
- With force?
- Just spin it.

2782
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,870
(The first person to receive
the penalty will be chosen.)

2783
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:12,210
- Very strongly.
- Please.

2784
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:13,240
It's done.

2785
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:15,540
Good. This much is good.

2786
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,940
- Please.
- It's coming.

2787
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:19,480
(Who will be splashed with water
on a rainy day?)

2788
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,980
But the remaining...

2789
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:22,280
Please!

2790
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,650
Please!

2791
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:26,320
No!

2792
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,190
(It slows down near Ha Neul!)

2793
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:30,390
- Ha Neul.
- Right here.

2794
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:31,890
- Ha Neul! Ji Hyo!
- Here!

2795
01:31:31,890 --> 01:31:33,760
- Seok Jin.
- Haha.

2796
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,060
- Ye Eun.
- No.

2797
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:36,800
- It should move on.
- Please. No.

2798
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,030
- No!
- No!

2799
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:41,530
(Seok Jin with 5 slots?)

2800
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:43,500
(Jong Kook with only 2 slots?)

2801
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,170
(Or Daniel with 3 slots?)

2802
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:46,710
(Empty: 6 slots,
Ha Neul and Ye Eun: 6 slots)

2803
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:48,240
(Woo Hyun, Seok Jin,
Se Chan: 5 slots)

2804
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,140
(Haha: 4 slots,
Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, Daniel: 3 slots)

2805
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:52,010
(Jun Young, Jong Kook: 2 slots)

2806
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:54,850
(It's Kim Jong Kook.)

2807
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:56,850
He only had two slots.

2808
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:57,880
(His small eyes
are about to pop out.)

2809
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:59,320
He only had two slots.

2810
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,490
He had two.

2811
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:01,750
- He had two.
- Is it me?

2812
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:02,860
(His name was only in 2 slots,
but it stopped there.)

2813
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:04,290
- Ha Neul?
- He had two.

2814
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:05,890
Woo Hyun, Jong Kook, and Daniel...

2815
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:07,490
- How could you...
- Seok Sam...

2816
01:32:07,490 --> 01:32:09,530
- She's a fan of Turbo.
- How could you...

2817
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:11,200
- It's so...
- Nice.

2818
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,430
- It went well.
- But...

2819
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:13,600
You only had two slots.

2820
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,670
- Will Jong Kook spin it now?
- Should I?

2821
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:16,000
- Yes.
- Okay!

2822
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,040
Spin it.

2823
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:19,570
Since he will get it,
he might want all of us to get it.

2824
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:21,170
- Should I do it?
- I'm really nervous.

2825
01:32:21,170 --> 01:32:22,740
- This really makes you nervous.
- The next...

2826
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:24,010
Okay.

2827
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:26,110
- The worst is if we all get it.
- I only had two...

2828
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:27,580
- Of course.
- Let's go.

2829
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:29,120
It would be the worst,
but it would become a memory.

2830
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,150
Goodness. Okay.

2831
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,290
(The umbrella got in the way,)

2832
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:36,390
(so it's moving slowly!)

2833
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:37,560
It's slowing down!

2834
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:39,190
It's slowing down.

2835
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:42,090
It's moving.

2836
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:43,660
It should keep going.

2837
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:45,670
(It's slowing down
near Ha Neul's slots.)

2838
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:47,270
- It should keep going.
- It should keep going.

2839
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:48,470
- Ha Neul.
- Ha Neul.

2840
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:50,300
(Will Ha Neul with 6 slots
get chosen this time?)

2841
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:54,610
(Will it be Ha Neul with 6 slots?)

2842
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:57,010
(Or will it be Woo Hyun,
whose slots come after Ha Neul's?)

2843
01:32:57,010 --> 01:32:58,080
- No!
- Woo Hyun.

2844
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,950
- Woo Hyun.
- Woo Hyun!

2845
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:03,980
(Woo Hyun was chosen.)

2846
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:06,450
(Sighing)

2847
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:10,820
(The arrow stopped at the name
he put himself.)

2848
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:12,860
- Woo Hyun!
- Nice!

2849
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:14,930
- Go and spin it, Woo Hyun.
- I had a feeling I would get it.

2850
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:16,760
- You can spin it.
- Spin it, Woo Hyun.

2851
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,400
It would be the worst if it stops
at the slot for everyone.

2852
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,000
- Everyone has to go then.
- It would be the worst.

2853
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,970
I'm sorry. I think it will stop
at the slot for everyone.

2854
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:24,140
- Let's go!
- I had a feeling I'd get it.

2855
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:25,540
Let's go, Woo Hyun!

2856
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:27,540
Be careful with the umbrella.

2857
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:30,140
(The last roulette spins.)

2858
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:31,810
Good!

2859
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:33,010
Seok Jin.

2860
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:34,480
- I'm sorry.
- Jae Seok.

2861
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,550
I apologize in advance.

2862
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:36,920
Let's stop at the grasshopper!

2863
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:38,180
(Will it stop at the empty slot
for everyone to get the penalty?)

2864
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:41,090
(Will there be one unlucky person?)

2865
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:42,460
I'm really nervous.

2866
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:43,720
It's fun.

2867
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,690
Ha Neul's name is gathered there.

2868
01:33:45,690 --> 01:33:48,360
It's so fun!

2869
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,730
(Empty: 6 slots
Ha Neul, Ye Eun: 6 slots)

2870
01:33:49,730 --> 01:33:51,630
- This...
- This is so fun!

2871
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:53,570
(Woo Hyun, Seok Jin,
Se Chan: 5 slots)

2872
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:55,170
- It has to keep going.
- It passed the number.

2873
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:56,740
- It has to keep going.
- It passed them. No!

2874
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:58,140
No!

2875
01:33:58,140 --> 01:33:59,840
- Keep going!
- Keep going!

2876
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,240
- No!
- Okay!

2877
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:02,240
(It goes past the empty slots.)

2878
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,040
(It goes past Jae Seok's slot.)

2879
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:06,110
- Keep going!
- It's Se Chan.

2880
01:34:06,110 --> 01:34:07,450
- It's Jong Kook!
- No, stop!

2881
01:34:07,450 --> 01:34:08,450
(It goes past Se Chan's slot
and stops at the pink names.)

2882
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:09,580
No, stop!

2883
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:11,720
- More!
- No, stop!

2884
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,820
- Daniel!
- Daniel!

2885
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:15,120
- No, stop!
- It's Jong Kook!

2886
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,660
(It stops at Daniel's slot.)

2887
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:21,360
(It stops at Daniel's slot
that Woo Hyun stuck.)

2888
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:23,130
Why is our team...

2889
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:25,060
- What's happening to us?
- What is this?

2890
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:26,370
Only Ye Eun survived from this team.

2891
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:28,730
- Only Ye Eun survived.
- That's not how it is...

2892
01:34:28,730 --> 01:34:30,140
- for me, normally.
- She gets selected well.

2893
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:31,570
- That's right.
- How many did you have?

2894
01:34:31,570 --> 01:34:33,870
- Today...
- Daniel only had three slots.

2895
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:37,040
- Too bad.
- It wasn't bad for us today.

2896
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,140
Is this right?

2897
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:40,510
- Is this right?
- Amazing.

2898
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:41,880
Did our team do something wrong?

2899
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,850
- This is amazing.
- It's really amazing.

2900
01:34:43,850 --> 01:34:45,150
- We won...
- Why did you...

2901
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:46,990
He chose my name.

2902
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:48,890
- What happened to us?
- What is this?

2903
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:50,720
- Right.
- So the final penalty receivers...

2904
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:54,260
are Kim Jong Kook, Nam Woo Hyun,
and Choi Daniel.

2905
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:56,260
We will proceed with the penalty.

2906
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:58,630
One, two, three!

2907
01:34:59,130 --> 01:35:01,470
(The water cannon fires.)

2908
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:04,200
(A powerful stream of water
falls on their head.)

2909
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:08,340
(The straightforward man
boldly receives the penalty!)

2910
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:09,380
- Okay!
- Goodness.

2911
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:11,280
(The straightforward man
boldly receives the penalty!)

2912
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,580
Thank you for today.

2913
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:14,210
Thank you.

2914
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,320
It was my first time doing
the dog leg dance on a TV show.

2915
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,750
(We thank Kim Ha Neul,
Nam Woo Hyun, and Lee Jun Young,)

2916
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:19,290
(who gave us big laughter
with their great chemistry.)

2917
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,350
(What? Someone's here.)

2918
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:25,320
(They are invited by someone.)

2919
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:26,460
(Who are you?)

2920
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,660
(A mysterious trip
of unknown nationality)

2921
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:30,400
(They pay
a questionable entrance fee.)

2922
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:33,300
(They enter
through a mysterious door.)

2923
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:35,270
(A secret space opens.)

2924
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,100
(The place welcomes
the tired travelers.)

2925
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:38,540
(Please enjoy your time here.)

2926
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:40,740
(A paradise where nothing lacks)

2927
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,710
(A deluge of coins)

2928
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:43,810
(I'll give you the coins.)

2929
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:45,810
(Greedy)

2930
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:47,850
(A blazing flame of desire)

2931
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:49,620
(Enticing the travelers
who have lost their minds)

2932
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:51,620
(Please go to the left.)

2933
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,620
(The secret of the trip is hidden.)

2934
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:54,950
(Sensing something suspicious)

2935
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:57,020
(Why is there so much pink stuff?)

2936
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,920
(The swamp of the mysterious trip
is getting deeper.)

2937
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:02,260
(Will they be able
to unravel the mystery?)

2938
