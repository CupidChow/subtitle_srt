1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,810
Hello.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,540
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,240
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,250
(The relaxed opening commences.)

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,679
- Today is Seok Jin's birthday.
- What?

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,849
- You're right.
- Seriously, don't do that.

7
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:12,880
- Why not?
- We won't.

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,919
You know me. I'm shy.

9
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:14,919
I only brought it up.

10
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:16,149
- Don't talk about it.
- You will be upset if we don't.

11
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,390
- Seriously, I'm fine.
- Actually,

12
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,190
I don't know why we become like that
as we grow old.

13
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,760
- I don't like it.
- You don't want to celebrate it.

14
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,089
- I know.
- But if people don't celebrate it,

15
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,899
you will bring it up
like six months later.

16
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,929
- "To be honest, I was..."
- I'm nothing like that.

17
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:29,170
- After six months?
- I won't be like that.

18
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,969
- I'll give you a gift.
- Don't do that.

19
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:33,439
Yesterday, my wife asked me
if there was anything I wanted.

20
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,670
It made me really sad.

21
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,770
- Why?
- I don't want anything.

22
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,609
- You should've said something.
- I want only expensive things.

23
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:39,710
When she asked,
you should've said this.

24
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,049
- What?
- "You."

25
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,780
(You)

26
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,280
- Do you still...
- Then you should've kissed her.

27
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,320
- Do you still not have her?
- Anyway...

28
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,020
(He's at an age
where he finds flirtation exciting.)

29
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,460
- "I still want you."
- Why did you not say that?

30
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,859
That's really intense.

31
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,859
- I can't believe I missed that.
- I know.

32
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,259
- It was a good chance.
- He's such a fool. My gosh.

33
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,770
You're Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong.
Come on!

34
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,469
- It could've been really cool.
- You should be ready.

35
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:06,170
He missed the chance.

36
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,370
- It was a chance.
- I get the chance only once a year.

37
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,340
- It's a once-in-a-year chance.
- Not just once a year.

38
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,939
- It's once in a long while.
- He missed...

39
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,379
- a really good chance.
- She wanted to buy me shoes.

40
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,849
He is so frustrating.

41
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,819
- My goodness.
- Today,

42
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:21,650
you probably know why we are
gathered without Jong Kook.

43
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,120
- We know.
- Of course.

44
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,359
Last week,
some of the members said...

45
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:29,730
they wanted to help Jong Kook
clean up his messy house.

46
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,230
So we will have
the SOS Heavy Cleaning Zone Race.

47
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:36,939
(A tip came in last week.)

48
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,870
(Jong Kook is
now living among trash.)

49
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,469
- SOS. Jong Kook...
- That's not it.

50
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:42,069
He needs our help.

51
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,140
- How can this be?
- His house should be filmed.

52
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,640
My house is in its current state...

53
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,150
because I'm getting ready
for a move.

54
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,549
(Jong Kook's place became messy
before the move?)

55
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,750
I'm looking into it.

56
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,849
Seriously, it's a tip-off from us.

57
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,459
- I was really shocked.
- It's serious.

58
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:00,859
There's a room for plastic bags.

59
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,659
- I'm not lying.
- It's true.

60
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:04,799
It's true.

61
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,260
- So...
- I'm serious.

62
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,569
- And his fridge...
- The vinegar gochujang.

63
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:11,900
The side dishes
that come with delivery food.

64
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,300
The small containers
that have side dishes in them.

65
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,270
He keeps them all.

66
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,139
- The fridge is full.
- What do we do then?

67
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,879
- At the front door, a vacuum...
- There's a vacuum cleaner.

68
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,550
- No, it's an air purifier.
- It's an air purifier.

69
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,819
There's an unopened air purifier
that is this big at the front door.

70
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:27,849
- It blocks the entrance.
- Yes.

71
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:29,889
There's a space only this big...

72
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,259
- at the entrance.
- The space.

73
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:32,689
So you have to walk in sideways.

74
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,259
We have to get rid of it for him.
We should take it.

75
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:37,759
The worst part is you can see Gamst
as soon as you get in.

76
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,430
- Right.
- There's a photo of Gamst...

77
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,930
- that was used on a TV show.
- Right.

78
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,000
And it's still there.

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,340
- I feel bad for Gamst.
- Yes, but...

80
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,500
- I'm sorry, Gamst.
- But...

81
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,840
- The whole interior design is...
- It's horrible.

82
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,810
That's not it. There's...

83
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,879
- nothing to clean up.
- You think so?

84
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,080
(There's nothing to clean up.)

85
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,210
Things are perfect now.

86
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,150
- What is there to clean up?
- Is this perfect?

87
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,550
- When I move later,
- When you move?

88
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,849
I'll tidy things up.

89
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,319
(Could it be that the members are
exaggerating what they saw?)

90
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,520
He thinks he's saving things.

91
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,060
- Does he think he's saving things?
- Yes.

92
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,430
He did organize things
in his own way.

93
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,860
- By the way, Ye Eun,
- Yes.

94
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,330
have you been to a house...

95
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,669
where a single man lives alone?

96
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:14,870
Of course not.

97
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,969
- Not at all?
- I'm sure she has.

98
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:17,370
- No. Never.
- Come on.

99
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,599
- I've never done that.
- Really?

100
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,870
- You...
- You went to Kian84's place.

101
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,909
- Kian84.
- No, that's...

102
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,370
You've done it as a group.

103
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,080
- No.
- Are you serious?

104
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,180
You've never been
to a man's house alone?

105
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,909
- Not at all!
- No?

106
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,110
No.

107
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,909
Then why don't you
go in first today?

108
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,520
No. I'm shy.

109
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:33,379
(All her illusions about
a man's house will be shattered.)

110
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,120
- You've never done it before?
- No.

111
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,259
You can visit Se Chan's place later.

112
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,360
All right. We will soon be visiting
the house of Kim Jong Kook,

113
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,090
the man who can't throw things away.

114
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,400
- He can't throw things away.
- And you will clean up the place.

115
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,069
- It's really bad.
- It's terrible.

116
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:50,539
As you clean it up,
you will pick out items...

117
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:52,240
- you want to have.
- He has a lot of stuff.

118
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,639
- Can we keep them for real?
- How nice.

119
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,069
Once you're done with cleaning,

120
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,669
we will give you a chance
to obtain the items...

121
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,310
- with Jong Kook's permission.
- A chance...

122
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,139
- A chance to obtain the items.
- I bet there will be games.

123
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,979
- Jong Kook...
- He has a lot of stuff at home.

124
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,449
He has a lot of new
and expensive items.

125
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:04,620
He has a lot of luxury items.

126
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,120
- Seriously, we should take it home.
- The air purifier...

127
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,250
- is worth 1,000 dollars.
- It's like "Incredible Moment."

128
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,419
Seriously?

129
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,090
That's really nice.

130
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:14,590
Now we will go to Jong Kook's house.

131
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,360
Without having a birthday party
for Seok Jin?

132
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
- He will be upset.
- Don't do that.

133
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
- We will have it there.
- Let's go!

134
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,660
- He'll be disappointed.
- Let's go.

135
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,199
- Seriously, don't do that.
- Let us at least toss you...

136
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,600
- into the air.
- Otherwise, he will be upset.

137
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,069
Seriously, I'm not upset.

138
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,740
(They go to have a cleaning party
instead of a birthday party.)

139
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,509
This is shocking. How did it change
like that only in a year?

140
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:29,970
- It's been two years.
- It wasn't like that before.

141
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,980
- In the past...
- He must not have a girlfriend.

142
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,079
Did you hear what she just said?

143
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,079
"He must not have a girlfriend."

144
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,250
(The doorbell of the dungeon
announces their arrival.)

145
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,819
- He's not seeing anyone.
- I think so.

146
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,589
(And the end boss of the dungeon)

147
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:43,620
What?

148
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,319
(Front door)

149
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,529
My gosh.

150
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:51,399
(What does Jong Kook's house
really look like?)

151
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,060
It's open.

152
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,769
This is interesting.

153
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:57,300
This is the air purifier.

154
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,170
- See? It's here.
- This is mine.

155
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,439
He didn't even open the box.
It's this big.

156
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,709
(The air purifier
at the entrance: True)

157
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:04,240
- Can I take this?
- This is 1,000 dollars.

158
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,209
- Hey, you know what?
- I moved.

159
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:07,709
He cleaned.

160
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:10,009
- He cleaned.
- He cleaned.

161
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,649
He cleaned up...

162
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:12,920
- No. It's the same.
- He didn't clean up.

163
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,050
- Look.
- I cleaned up.

164
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:15,649
- I cleaned it up!
- Hey.

165
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,660
- Look at that.
- I cleaned.

166
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,689
- Look.
- Mister.

167
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,089
- I cleaned.
- Gamst.

168
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:23,029
- There's Gamst.
- I cleaned.

169
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,100
- There's Gamst. Look.
- What about it?

170
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,629
Get rid of Gamst's face.

171
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,699
Why?

172
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:31,800
(Gamst's greeting: True)

173
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,240
- What is all this?
- Jong Kook.

174
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:34,670
What is this?

175
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,910
- What...
- "What is this?"

176
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,639
How could you say that
at someone's house?

177
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,680
This is a sock.

178
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,180
(This is a sock!)

179
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,779
There's a hole in this sock. Why...

180
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,680
The clothes are all black.

181
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,350
Did you take off your socks
and leave them here?

182
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,519
No. I'm throwing them away.

183
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,389
- I need to throw them away.
- Throw them away.

184
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:55,660
Then you should throw them away.

185
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,199
I know you have a lot to say,
but you should wait.

186
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,170
When we came here in summer
two years ago...

187
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,500
- Right.
- It was fine back then.

188
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,939
- This was...
- It wasn't there.

189
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,399
It was about this much, right?

190
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,970
- Yes.
- That's right.

191
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:10,069
(The clothes wall was
about half the width of the wall.)

192
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,810
- But...
- And it got a lot bigger.

193
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,980
Let me tell you about it.

194
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,810
It will get bigger and bigger
and reach here.

195
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,949
It's not like that.

196
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,149
It should be on "My Little Old Boy."

197
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,050
- And...
- I'm sorry, but...

198
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,050
why are we doing Running Man
when it should be...

199
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,420
on "My Little Old Boy?"

200
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,689
Look at this. This is serious.

201
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:27,089
- It's not like that.
- What is all this?

202
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:30,259
I tell people not to give me stuff,
but they keep giving things to me.

203
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,430
- So...
- You can't throw them away.

204
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,029
- I have no place to keep them.
- Right.

205
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,370
As you live, you're bound...

206
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,930
- to have more stuff.
- That's true.

207
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,740
- You should move.
- When are you moving?

208
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,899
I'll move before June.

209
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,339
- In June?
- That's when the contract expires.

210
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,569
All right then.

211
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,980
This is the most serious issue
in Jong Kook's place.

212
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,040
Let me show you.

213
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,810
Most serious?

214
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,850
- That's...
- What's that?

215
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,449
- What's so serious?
- This is unbelievable.

216
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,550
- Gosh, what's all that?
- Do you see the balcony here?

217
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,649
It's unbelievable.

218
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,550
Now... This is...

219
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,560
(The most serious problem
is the balcony?)

220
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
- I was really surprised.
- This is...

221
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,329
(The balcony is
full of plastic bags.)

222
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:03,730
- It's really...
- How...

223
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,959
- How am I supposed to go in there?
- This is...

224
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,000
How would you go in there?

225
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,569
I don't go in there.

226
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,329
I don't need to go in.

227
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm not going in there.

228
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,910
- That's...
- And second.

229
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,069
- Is this it?
- Don't be so shocked, guys.

230
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,209
I'm curious.

231
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:21,449
(The fridge is open.)

232
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:24,449
- What's all this?
- We already saw that.

233
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,319
- The side dishes...
- We saw that.

234
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,589
- Seriously...
- My goodness.

235
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,589
- This is crazy.
- "This is crazy?"

236
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,819
- Did you eat sashimi a lot?
- What's all this?

237
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,319
- I eat sashimi a lot.
- It's really...

238
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,490
- So...
- Why does he keep the coffee?

239
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,589
Tell me about it.

240
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,589
(Curious)

241
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:38,930
(Shocked)

242
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,970
- Trash...
- Look at this. Hey.

243
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,329
- How many coffees are there?
- The coffee...

244
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,569
- Why...
- Ye Eun...

245
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:47,740
- was surprised to see that.
- That's from yesterday.

246
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,709
- Will you drink it again?
- Of course.

247
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,639
- Hey.
- You drink it again?

248
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,810
- Do you boil it?
- Hey.

249
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,350
Do you throw away
the leftover coffee then?

250
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,949
We usually throw it away.

251
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:57,279
- I do.
- I do.

252
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,350
When I buy coffee,
I drink just a little...

253
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,649
and keep what I don't drink
in the fridge.

254
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,620
Then I don't need to buy
another cup the next day.

255
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,220
Do you put ice in it?

256
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,389
- You drink it again?
- I just drink it.

257
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:10,189
It's already cold. I don't need ice.

258
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,800
- That's...
- It will go moldy.

259
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,660
You were born in a very good time.

260
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,170
You were born in a very good time.

261
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,370
Right?

262
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,240
Ye Eun. You're lucky.

263
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,509
You live in a country
that doesn't produce coffee beans.

264
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:23,569
Ji Hyo.

265
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,839
"A country that doesn't produce
coffee beans."

266
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,680
And I cleaned up the whole place.

267
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,250
- You did?
- What did you clean?

268
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,810
- No way.
- Is this after you cleaned?

269
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,919
Ask one at a time.
I'll tell you how it's organized.

270
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,490
Let's take a seat then.

271
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,919
We should let some fresh air in.

272
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,460
It's a little...

273
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,259
Let's open the windows.

274
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:43,629
Gosh, why is this so dark?

275
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,830
I didn't know this place
had a view like this.

276
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,230
It's bright.

277
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,299
(He always kept the windows closed
to keep the room warm.)

278
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:50,840
- My goodness.
- I didn't know about the view.

279
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:53,240
Jong Kook, do you not have a dryer?

280
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
We should ventilate the room.

281
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,509
I have one, but I don't use it.

282
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:56,710
- It's really...
- You have one?

283
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,340
It consumes a lot of electricity.

284
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:00,240
Seriously, the dryer...

285
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,580
- It's not like that.
- No.

286
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,120
If you hang the laundry
in the room in winter,

287
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,820
- you can humidify the room.
- You pull the pockets out.

288
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,950
Of course. They dry up fast.

289
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,590
He pulls the pockets out on purpose.

290
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,620
People don't use this now.
You can use the dryer.

291
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,659
It will be too dry in winter.

292
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:15,789
Hey, Jong Kook will be mad
if you open the windows.

293
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,860
- It's not like that.
- The heater is off. It's okay.

294
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,460
- It can generate carcinogens.
- The heater is off?

295
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,460
Carcinogens?

296
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,970
If you don't ventilate the room,
there will be carcinogens.

297
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,769
- That's ridiculous.
- She's right.

298
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,899
But you heated
the floor a little today.

299
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,340
- He didn't.
- Actually,

300
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,039
I turned it off after a while.
It was too hot.

301
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,279
Last time... I'm telling you.

302
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,009
You remember the last time
you visited my place.

303
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:35,009
- Yes.
- You said it was really cold,

304
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,509
so I turned on the heater.

305
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,950
- It was hot that day.
- And...

306
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,950
- you opened the window.
- He did.

307
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,049
- He was really upset.
- But you need ventilation.

308
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,090
I kept staring at the windows
sitting right here.

309
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,659
- "When would he close them?"
- You need ventilation.

310
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:49,129
- You need to ventilate the room.
- Right.

311
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,000
Carcinogens are emitted.

312
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,159
- Why do you keep saying that?
- I'm serious.

313
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,169
Carcinogens build up...

314
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:55,629
- Really?
- if you don't ventilate the room.

315
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,129
Still, it's cold.

316
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,340
It's better to be cold.

317
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,100
(The owner of the house
is drinking the moldy coffee.)

318
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,610
- This is upsetting.
- Jong Kook.

319
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,240
Why do you keep things
like the balloons here?

320
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,279
(Why did he add the balloons
to the couch collection?)

321
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,250
- That's...
- What is this?

322
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,450
- Last year was...
- Last year?

323
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,649
- the Year of the Dragon.
- Yes.

324
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:13,320
- So we did "Dragon Club."
- Right.

325
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,620
Tae Hyun and the guys
put dragon balloons up here.

326
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,049
- I see.
- You should throw them away now.

327
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,289
- It's the New Year now.
- This is...

328
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:19,320
- It was last year.
- It's the Year of the Snake.

329
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,690
But I couldn't throw them away.

330
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,730
- I might use them again.
- The balloons?

331
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,799
(Jong Kook keeps the balloons
to use them 12 years later.)

332
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,230
- This is...
- That's why...

333
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,429
- mothers can't throw things away.
- Right.

334
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,500
- Why do you keep them?
- Look.

335
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,440
- They are all deflated.
- No.

336
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,570
Why won't you get rid of them?

337
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,110
- Just keep them.
- Jong Kook.

338
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,269
- Jong Kook.
- Gosh.

339
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:38,980
What is the withered flower for?

340
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,580
They brought it too.

341
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,309
- What is this?
- Just leave it there.

342
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:44,779
What is this?

343
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,120
Don't touch them.

344
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,750
- It's so dusty.
- Look. Jong Kook.

345
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,549
This is a ball signed by Kobe.

346
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:50,919
- But he leaves it here.
- Is it Kobe Bryant?

347
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:53,059
- I told you not to use it!
- He just keeps it here.

348
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:54,830
- This is...
- He should keep it in a box.

349
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,629
- This is Kobe Bryant.
- Why do you use it?

350
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,700
You should keep this in a box.

351
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,070
- Don't touch the autograph.
- Seriously...

352
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,070
I'll take care of it myself.

353
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,899
- This is...
- I got it from Kobe. Why...

354
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,000
Can I keep this?

355
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,470
- It's deflated.
- Why would you keep it?

356
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,470
- Don't touch it.
- He can inflate it again.

357
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,940
Don't touch the autograph.

358
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,909
- You should wrap it.
- Don't touch the autograph.

359
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:16,649
Is it really Kobe's autograph?

360
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,549
I met him and got his autograph.

361
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:20,419
- Seriously?
- Yes.

362
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:22,120
By the way,
I've been wondering about this.

363
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,320
Why do you keep Gamst's face here?

364
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,019
Did you get this?

365
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:27,460
- Gamst is...
- I got this...

366
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,889
- from Gamst.
- Okay.

367
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,830
But I can't throw this away.

368
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,159
You can't throw it away.

369
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,299
You shouldn't throw it away.

370
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,730
- Let's hide his eyes.
- What?

371
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,669
- As if it's not Gamst.
- Why would you do that?

372
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:38,799
This is stranger.

373
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,700
He looks like a criminal now.

374
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,139
It's not like
Gamst did something wrong.

375
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:45,610
- Gamst...
- Yes.

376
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,250
I got it from Gamst,
so I kept it here.

377
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,450
- There's no trace of women at all.
- Right.

378
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,919
- Why are you two standing?
- What?

379
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,149
- The two old members are standing.
- I don't want to sit here.

380
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,519
- I don't want to sit.
- This is...

381
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,820
- I'll just...
- You can sit here.

382
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,190
- There's a chair here.
- I sat here before.

383
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,590
- This is 20 years old.
- You should sit there.

384
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,299
- You can sit there.
- Also, when you move out,

385
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,629
I'll get you a new chair.

386
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:08,230
Why change what's still good?

387
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,100
- He's worried.
- I'm like this too.

388
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,870
- Same here.
- I can't throw things out either.

389
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,870
Me neither.

390
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,570
- You have to, though.
- You're way worse.

391
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:17,440
Why don't we talk about
what about this is bad?

392
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,639
Jong Kook, the worst of all
is the room...

393
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,210
- with plastic bags.
- It's the worst.

394
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,549
- Why are they there?
- Here's why.

395
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:26,820
(Question 1: Why does he collect
plastic bags in his balcony?)

396
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
Here's why. When you order in,

397
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,190
- food comes in plastic bags.
- Right.

398
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,519
When I take out the recyclables,

399
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,860
- I put everything in there.
- I see.

400
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,700
Essentially, I carry
everything out in plastic bags...

401
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,299
and then throw
the plastic bags out too.

402
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:42,470
Sometimes, I bring back
the bigger plastic bags.

403
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,470
- You bring them back?
- Why?

404
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,500
- Why?
- To reuse them?

405
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:46,840
- But...
- Just so you know,

406
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,169
they're quite useful.

407
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:51,309
He collects them because he thinks
they'll be of use someday.

408
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:54,009
The keyword though
is that you "collected" them.

409
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:55,980
I'm not collecting them.
It's only because...

410
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
- I don't take out the trash often.
- You collected them...

411
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,019
- to reuse them.
- Exactly.

412
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,350
That means you collected them
on purpose.

413
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,220
That's not the case.
I'll use them someday.

414
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,289
You can buy this.

415
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:04,289
- A trash can for recyclables.
- Yes, a container.

416
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,360
- A trash can for recyclables?
- That's not the case.

417
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
- I should use them.
- He thinks he'll use them.

418
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,590
I should use those plastic bags.

419
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,259
- Why though?
- So he collected them.

420
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:12,399
That's what I've been saying.

421
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,370
- For now...
- Place smaller bags...

422
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,370
- in a bigger bag to throw out.
- That'll be a waste.

423
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,539
- Jong Kook...
- I can't throw them out at once.

424
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:21,110
Jong Kook is annoyed
with this situation as is.

425
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,840
No. I'm just
explaining my situation.

426
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,139
What's with the side dishes then?

427
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:25,409
I'll explain the side dishes.

428
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:26,940
- Go ahead.
- With side dishes,

429
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,809
- I write "please."
- Please?

430
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,679
"Please don't give me
any containers for side dishes."

431
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,980
I write that too,
but they still send food in those.

432
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,049
Hear me out. Anyway, since...

433
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:39,220
they're fresh and untouched,
I reckon I'll eat them someday.

434
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,230
- Right.
- It'll be a waste to throw them,

435
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,659
- Sure.
- so I place them in the fridge.

436
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,299
However, I never eat them.

437
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:45,559
- Exactly.
- We never eat them.

438
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,299
- So throw them out.
- But the next day...

439
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,330
The next day, I write
not to give me side dishes,

440
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,740
but they still do.

441
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,370
That goes in the fridge too.

442
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,610
What's the oldest side dish
you have in your fridge?

443
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,769
I'm guessing it's from
two months ago.

444
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,179
- A few months.
- About a year.

445
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,539
- A year?
- A year?

446
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,409
- I think so.
- That won't be edible.

447
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,080
What's the point
in being that frugal?

448
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,220
This isn't me being frugal.

449
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,620
I know I should throw them out.

450
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,720
It's a nuisance, isn't it?

451
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,120
- To throw them out,
- It's a hassle.

452
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,620
I need to wash the containers...

453
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,490
- Exactly.
- which means using water.

454
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,389
- Using water?
- You have to use water.

455
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,330
That's the end of that discussion.

456
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,460
It's over
now that he mentioned water.

457
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,559
Why not live
in the countryside then...

458
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,200
- with a kerosene lamp?
- That's like...

459
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,830
I'd love to see it.

460
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,799
His utility bills.

461
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,840
- Jong Kook, we...
- Then I forget.

462
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,669
On the way up here,
our Director Mission said...

463
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,480
he almost threw up.

464
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,110
That's true.

465
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,149
Didn't you say you were inspired?

466
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,379
- Hey!
- Really?

467
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,820
You said you were inspired.

468
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,649
Why do you have so many packets
of vinegar gochujang?

469
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,360
- Are you curious?
- You never eat it, so why?

470
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,460
It'll be a waste to throw out.

471
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,090
- It'd be wrong to throw them out.
- This is hilarious.

472
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,100
I'm inspired.

473
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,370
(She didn't know what to say
and lied about being inspired.)

474
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,100
- Right now...
- Unbelievable.

475
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,100
- Come on, Jong Kook.
- Yes?

476
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,039
It's always good to be frugal.

477
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,169
We should take notes
when it comes to that.

478
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:06,110
However, this has gone too far,

479
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,909
and this is the same
as being unmanageable.

480
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,350
- Jong Kook, I have a question.
- Sure.

481
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,879
In the other room...

482
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,049
- When Se Chan and I first visited,
- Yes?

483
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:16,919
- it was a walk-in closet.
- Right.

484
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,620
- It's still a walk-in closet.
- It was organized.

485
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,860
- Now, it's more like storage.
- Right.

486
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,629
- But in there...
- Yes?

487
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,460
- are a lot of gifts.
- That's right.

488
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,059
- A lot.
- Clothes from luxury brands.

489
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,399
- There are a lot.
- Why don't you wear them?

490
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,330
Items from luxury brands?
This may sound weird,

491
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,769
but wearing them
seems like a penalty to me.

492
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:34,169
- Does it embarrass you?
- A little.

493
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,370
I gave you a cap, remember?

494
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,240
- Yes, you did.
- Exactly.

495
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,340
The cap.

496
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,210
Do you want to take home
the shoes from Dior?

497
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,509
- Yes, bring them here.
- Yes!

498
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,049
- What's the size?
- They won't fit you.

499
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:46,649
- They will.
- They'll fit me.

500
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:47,990
- The size is 275mm.
- Me!

501
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,519
- Me.
- They're exactly my size.

502
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,019
I wear shoes
from size 230mm to 290mm.

503
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,460
- From size 230mm to 290mm.
- Nice.

504
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,759
The top of my feet comes up high,
but 275mm is my size.

505
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,830
- Jong Kook, wait.
- It's Seok Jin's birthday today.

506
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,559
- It's his birthday.
- It's Seok Jin's birthday.

507
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,200
- It's Seok Jin's birthday.
- Let him have it.

508
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,340
- It's fine.
- Sure. What's your shoe size?

509
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,100
- I wear 275mm.
- Show us the shoes.

510
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,299
- They're perfect.
- Show us.

511
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,370
- I also wear 275mm.
- It's his birthday.

512
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,639
It's not just the shoes he has.

513
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,480
- He has a lot more.
- I wear 275mm.

514
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,909
What size shoes do you really wear?

515
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:14,909
I wear 270mm.

516
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,220
- It's not a big difference.
- I can easily wear 275mm.

517
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,919
- Even I...
- Let's get clothes from here.

518
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:21,750
He has items from Dior
and even Balenciaga.

519
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,750
- We'll rock-paper-scissors for it.
- Let me have one.

520
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:29,059
(The walk-in closet filled
with items from luxury brands)

521
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:30,789
(It's Dongmyo Market in there.)

522
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,899
(Is it more chaotic
than his fridge?)

523
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:34,970
For you?

524
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,700
(A walk-in closet filled
with a variety of items...)

525
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,000
(that are in achromatic colors)

526
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:42,940
(Among the pile of clothes,)

527
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,710
(there are items
that haven't even been opened.)

528
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:49,480
(Will he be able
to find the Dior shoes?)

529
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,350
Hold on.

530
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,649
(He moves one paper bag.)

531
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:55,690
What's this?

532
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,950
Here, it's the Dior shoes.

533
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:58,460
These are the ones.

534
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,519
(There must be an order
since he found it with ease.)

535
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,659
I can't believe...

536
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:01,830
- I remembered the brand.
- Are these Dior?

537
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,929
- These are really expensive.
- They were a gift.

538
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,400
Happy birthday, Seok Jin.

539
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,660
Who gave you these?

540
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,069
They're clothes.

541
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,630
- No, they're shoes.
- You're right.

542
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,470
- Wear them, then.
- They're brand new!

543
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:16,309
"Jong Kook, I only have
gratitude toward you."

544
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:17,809
"Jong Kook, I only have..."

545
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,079
(A letter?)

546
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,849
I kept it for five years...

547
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,410
and am allowed to give it
to someone else.

548
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,519
Who wrote this?

549
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,519
(Keep gifts for 5 years
before repurposing them!)

550
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,819
He just asked, "Who wrote this?"

551
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,220
- These are pretty.
- No way.

552
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,589
Wait, they were from Bo Pil!

553
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:32,720
- Who?
- Bo Pil.

554
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,589
- What...
- Bo Pil?

555
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,960
- Bo Pil...
- Bo Pil, you.

556
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,259
What about me?

557
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,000
- Bo Pil, what about me?
- Hold on.

558
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,299
- Bo Pil, I can't believe you.
- I sang at his wedding.

559
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,369
- Oh, of course.
- These are the shoes.

560
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:45,640
- They're perfect.
- They're pretty.

561
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:48,170
- Bo Pil, I kept them long enough.
- It fits perfectly!

562
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,569
- It's for Seok Jin.
- It's a perfect fit.

563
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,039
- It fits like a glove.
- Goodness.

564
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,609
Say something to Bo Pil.

565
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:54,650
- Say something to Bo Pil.
- Bo Pil...

566
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,650
- Say something to Bo Pil.
- Bo Pil, thanks.

567
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,220
- They're pretty.
- Jong Kook sang at your wedding,

568
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,349
but I'll be wearing the shoes.

569
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:01,950
Jong Kook, I mean, Bo pil,

570
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,589
- They're pretty.
- they found a home in five years.

571
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:04,990
- Exactly.
- They're pretty.

572
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,259
- They fit Seok Jin perfectly.
- Tell me about it.

573
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,359
- They're a perfect fit.
- I know.

574
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,630
- These are your type too.
- Exactly.

575
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,130
Seok Jin, do you have
any use for this?

576
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,529
- What? I don't.
- Do you need this?

577
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:14,130
- Do you need the box?
- I don't.

578
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,430
Go ahead. Take it.

579
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,869
- I'm sorry but...
- They're pretty.

580
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:18,440
- This is Dior.
- There you go.

581
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,640
How about this? Who wants it?

582
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,710
Me!

583
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,339
- Me.
- I want it.

584
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:24,940
Jong Kook, don't you
have anything for us?

585
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,279
Jong Kook, what about us?

586
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,680
- I'm afraid...
- Is that good?

587
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,309
you can't keep them at this moment.

588
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,920
- Sure.
- We'll collect them...

589
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,549
and hand them out
after the missions.

590
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:35,819
- These too?
- Just take them.

591
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:36,950
No, we should play games first.

592
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,359
- Yes, the missions.
- As of this moment,

593
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,720
you'll get an hour...

594
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,059
- to sort out his house.
- Don't!

595
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,730
Just don't leave.

596
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,059
- Should we clean the house?
- Yes.

597
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,660
- Sit down.
- Throw out food that has expired...

598
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,799
- Take a seat.
- and any other trash.

599
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,470
I agree with what's in the fridge.

600
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,200
- Those can be thrown out.
- Right.

601
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:55,240
- What about the plastic bags?
- Those need to go.

602
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,410
Please don't.

603
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,279
- Why?
- You need to throw them out.

604
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:00,009
I'll let you store them
in one single place.

605
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:01,279
Is it because you want to use them?

606
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,410
- I should.
- Some need to go.

607
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,980
- When?
- Jong Kook, wait.

608
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,480
- Jong Kook, please.
- This is hilarious.

609
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,890
- Jong Kook, please.
- What a joke.

610
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,950
- Jong Kook, you can't.
- I don't get him at all.

611
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,690
You can't leave them that way.

612
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,960
- This is hilarious.
- Throw out half of them.

613
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,230
- You can get cancer from them.
- You already have enough.

614
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,660
- Guys.
- She keeps mentioning cancer.

615
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,660
- They're toxic.
- That's not it.

616
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,829
- Also...
- Just so you know, Ye Eun...

617
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,200
- has lost her appetite.
- Really?

618
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:24,539
She should be snacking
right about now,

619
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,599
- but she isn't picking anything up.
- Here you go.

620
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,599
(No way.)

621
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,539
Jong Kook, you tell us then.

622
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,240
- Tell us what you can live with.
- You must throw them out.

623
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,710
- Not the plastic bags.
- Okay, we get it.

624
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,910
- I need them for recyclables.
- We'll let you have that.

625
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,009
Leave ten plastic bags.

626
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,779
He'll be on "Incredible Moment"
as the plastic bag man.

627
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:39,880
- Right.
- Addicted to plastic bags.

628
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,789
- Keep ten of them.
- Plastic bags.

629
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,789
Jong Kook, you'll keep on
getting new plastic bags.

630
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:46,420
- Because you...
- You'll keep getting more.

631
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,930
But I use them too.

632
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,359
You keep ordering in,

633
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,029
so you'll only get
more plastic bags.

634
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:52,630
- Throw out what you have...
- Let's not touch what he loves.

635
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,359
- That's not it.
- We'll let him have this one.

636
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,170
Gather them all
in one plastic bag, then.

637
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,339
This is the award you won in 2024.

638
00:19:58,339 --> 00:19:59,839
Is there a place
to put this on display?

639
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,710
I just got this, Seok Jin.

640
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,339
- They brought it today.
- Is that so?

641
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:05,039
- Throw out the box.
- What?

642
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,839
- All you need is the trophy.
- That's all you need.

643
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,950
- It's recyclable.
- Can I throw this out?

644
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,579
- Yes, throw out the box.
- You should throw it out.

645
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:11,720
Why give it to me
in the first place?

646
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,619
When I received
my award this time around,

647
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,049
I only took the trophy
and not the box.

648
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:17,089
Have them save this
for next year, then.

649
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:19,220
- How is that even possible?
- I mean...

650
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:21,119
- The trophy might not fit.
- Jong Kook...

651
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,490
They'll use it someday.

652
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,289
- Take this back with you.
- They'll use it someday.

653
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,829
- Yes, take it back.
- Store your underwear in it.

654
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:28,130
It's a waste
to throw out such boxes.

655
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,599
I agree with you on that.

656
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,539
- Jong Kook...
- Once you see a cleaner house,

657
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,910
- You'll love it.
- you'll like how tidy it is.

658
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,440
People will buy this
if you put it on the Karrot app.

659
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,539
- Really?
- Yes.

660
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,279
- That only takes up space.
- An indoor...

661
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:42,410
He doesn't know how...

662
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,480
- to use the Karrot app.
- Really?

663
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,880
He still can't shop
from Coupang either.

664
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,920
- Right.
- Of course.

665
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,849
You could make so much
if you sold everything on Karrot.

666
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,049
It's funny
how he can't order from Coupang.

667
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,190
How are you unable to even do that?

668
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,089
Jong Kook goes to
the actual restaurant himself...

669
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:56,089
(He does most things himself.)

670
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,829
He still orders over the phone.

671
00:20:57,829 --> 00:20:59,359
"Hello, this is Jong Kook."

672
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,000
I buy my own bottled water.

673
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,970
Carrying it back,
I thought it could be annoying...

674
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,099
- for people who must deliver it.
- Okay, so...

675
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,240
- You can fan out and...
- Clean up?

676
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,380
- Pick a room to...
- Who gets the closet?

677
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,079
- Instead of fanning out...
- I'll tackle the fridge.

678
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,880
Don't you need permission?

679
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,079
Shall I take the storage room?

680
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,180
Shall we go through the clothes?

681
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,849
At last, he made
the grand decision to clean up.

682
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,890
Once he sees how much cleaner it is,

683
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:26,490
- he'll feel refreshed.
- Yes.

684
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,089
- My gosh.
- It's hard to cook for just one.

685
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:30,990
All this is just trash.

686
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,099
Bags the food was brought in.

687
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,930
These can't be reused.

688
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,000
I take out recyclables...

689
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,670
Don't come here. Stay over there.

690
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,099
- But...
- Go away.

691
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:40,769
I can't go away.
We must separate the recyclables.

692
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:43,069
Does banana peel
go in the general waste?

693
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:44,210
Yes.

694
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,980
- All this needs to be...
- What's this?

695
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,410
Can we throw this out?

696
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,480
You can, but that's food.

697
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,250
Give me one. Get a plastic bag
to put the food waste in!

698
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,789
- There's a food waste trash bag.
- Food waste...

699
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:59,890
- goes in a separate bag.
- No, we have a food waste lot.

700
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,259
- The plastic bags...
- Keep them separate.

701
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,289
Put them in here.

702
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,299
- Do we throw the bags out here?
- Collect them for now.

703
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:07,500
- These go in the trash.
- No, let go!

704
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,569
Jong Kook, this is torn.
There's nothing you can do with it.

705
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:12,500
- Throw it away!
- Wait.

706
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,809
Don't throw these out.
Gather them like this.

707
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:17,069
- Why would you keep these?
- You have to throw them out.

708
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,079
- Look at this.
- These...

709
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,180
- What do you need them for?
- Give them to me!

710
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,779
- Why keep them?
- Wait!

711
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,680
- These...
- Why won't you throw them away?

712
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,549
- Why not?
- Will you reuse them?

713
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:27,880
- There are so many out there.
- Please throw them away.

714
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,589
- Please throw them away.
- Listen.

715
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:31,859
Throw stuff like this away.
This, I'll put in here.

716
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:33,190
- Please throw them away.
- Give me that.

717
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,089
- What I'll throw away can go in.
- These...

718
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:37,630
- These are too thin.
- Not these bags!

719
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,460
- I'll buy you better bags.
- Get out of the way, Ye Eun.

720
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,400
- These aren't...
- I'll reuse these.

721
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,670
A dried persimmon gift set
from the holidays.

722
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,539
That was from Si Won.
Thanks, Si Won.

723
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,339
You must pay a fee
to throw this out.

724
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:49,809
This can be recycled, Jong Kook.

725
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:51,380
My gosh. This room...

726
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
(A stack of paper bags)

727
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,940
- What on earth...
- Wait.

728
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,750
- How old is this?
- Don't throw out the paper bags.

729
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,180
Why... My gosh.

730
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,250
- Hey. This is...
- Don't throw them out!

731
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,089
- We're gathering them.
- Okay.

732
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:06,859
- We're gathering them.
- That's it, right?

733
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:09,789
- So they're pretty and clean.
- Okay, pretty and clean.

734
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,700
- This is insane.
- Don't ever throw them away.

735
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,900
- Okay.
- Why do you collect plastic bags...

736
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,700
when you don't throw out any trash?

737
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,140
- All this...
- No.

738
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,799
- Where will you use these...
- You can put food in here.

739
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,670
- This is waste.
- But...

740
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,710
- To me...
- But...

741
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,809
(Drooling)

742
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,279
This is waste.

743
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,880
When I need to
give someone something,

744
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,180
- I can use them.
- You're Mr. Plastic.

745
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,819
- "Mr. Plastic?"
- What should we do?

746
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:34,150
All these...

747
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,990
- When will you use them?
- You can't.

748
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,890
You can't use all these
in a lifetime.

749
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:41,220
- You'll never use them.
- In this bag...

750
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,990
In your lifetime...

751
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,190
When will you use...

752
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,799
- So...
- Jong Kook. Please throw them out.

753
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,299
- Kept in one place...
- Sushi restaurant.

754
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:49,670
- Plastic bags go in here.
- Gather what's unusable.

755
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,970
Where are the plastic bags?
There they are.

756
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,240
(Resuming plastic bag collection)

757
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,369
- This is no joke.
- The plastic bags.

758
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:56,970
- Put them down.
- Throw them away.

759
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,210
- This is trash.
- This can't be reused.

760
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,579
- Throw this away.
- Seok Jin.

761
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,809
Throw this away.

762
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,609
Listen to me.

763
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,119
- Why would you...
- Hear me out.

764
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,380
- We're...
- I'm not trying to be funny.

765
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,289
I use these bags
to take out the recyclables.

766
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:11,859
- You can still...
- When I have to take today's batch,

767
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:13,190
where will I put them in?

768
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,490
- Okay, then.
- Where will I put them?

769
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,890
- Hey.
- There are other bags.

770
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,130
- Later on...
- I need at least three per trip!

771
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,569
Throw away what's in here...

772
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:23,799
- I'm not kidding.
- That's just one bag!

773
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:26,539
- The show featuring odd people...
- It's just like that.

774
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:29,769
This is my logic. I want to use it
once again for something else.

775
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,069
- Isn't that nice?
- Haha, come with me.

776
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,440
- But these...
- They were used enough.

777
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,779
- Here's a big one.
- There are many.

778
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:35,779
No.

779
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,980
- The big one...
- Give me that. I have a use for it.

780
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,019
What will you use it for?

781
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:43,549
- Later on...
- What could it be for?

782
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:47,259
If I want to give someone clothes,
I could put them in here.

783
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:49,289
Why are you stressing me out?

784
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:52,099
- You won't use these, will you?
- I was keeping these aside!

785
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:55,230
- You won't use these, will you?
- I was keeping these aside!

786
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,539
- I use them to take out the trash!
- Why do you need that?

787
00:24:58,569 --> 00:25:00,400
Throw them away.

788
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,809
We came here to throw that out!

789
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:05,079
Jong Kook, you put aside
some of them already.

790
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,109
- Yes, I did, but...
- Yes.

791
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,779
Just throw out
what you collected so far.

792
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:11,210
These can't be consumed.

793
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,880
- Throw out the first batch.
- Okay.

794
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,789
- But...
- Come on, Jong Kook.

795
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:18,150
- Look.
- He's a different species from us.

796
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,490
Look at all those plastic bags.
He won't throw them away?

797
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,789
You won't throw these away
when there are so many?

798
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:25,700
Set aside the general waste bags.

799
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,460
- Those are necessary.
- Keep those.

800
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,400
- These are expensive, so use them.
- My gosh. This is...

801
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,769
You won't throw these out?

802
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:33,000
- My goodness.
- My gosh...

803
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,609
You should be on that TV show
featuring strange people.

804
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,009
- These are...
- Ye Eun.

805
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,339
I'm doing this because I'm moving.

806
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:40,339
Jong Kook.

807
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,180
- This was from a sushi restaurant.
- Yes.

808
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,180
- It can't be reused.
- Look.

809
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,519
Leave it. It might be...

810
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,450
Hey. I found your...

811
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,089
- What's that?
- Were you hired?

812
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:52,089
- What's this?
- It's what you drink.

813
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,359
- When are those from?
- How old are they?

814
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,759
- Where were these?
- It's a protein shake.

815
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:56,859
Have one each.

816
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,759
- I'd been wanting some.
- Check them.

817
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,500
- Check the expiry date.
- Protein shakes...

818
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,569
- They're still good.
- Let the crew have them.

819
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:04,000
- Please drink them up.
- Hand them out.

820
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,400
- They're still good.
- Take them.

821
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,440
- If you don't drink them up,
- The expiry date...

822
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,269
- Jong Kook said he'd keep them.
- No, wait!

823
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:11,710
Excuse me. Why drink that
when you didn't work out?

824
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,009
I'll have them.

825
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:15,279
- I don't think you will.
- They're good until 2028.

826
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,480
- Hand them out.
- Take one only if you want one.

827
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,380
Where did the trash bag go?

828
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,079
Here's the trash bag.

829
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,089
Hey, this cloth is general waste.

830
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:24,490
(Something appeared
from behind the protein?)

831
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,619
Did you know you had bottled water?

832
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,460
- There's water?
- There's bottled water?

833
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,990
Are you serious?

834
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,630
- Hey.
- Water's great.

835
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,869
Jong Kook had no idea
he had bottled water.

836
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:37,130
He's been buying more.

837
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,000
Bottled water, two...
Hey! There's a lot!

838
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,869
- I can't believe...
- Bottled water?

839
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:44,440
- There's almost...
- What on earth?

840
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,009
- Hey!
- We're unearthing treasure.

841
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:47,809
You kept the bottled water...

842
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,009
I had bottled water right there.

843
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:52,650
You'd never have known
if we hadn't looked.

844
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,880
I can drink that later.

845
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,220
This is like discovering relics.

846
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,890
- Lucky you.
- Yes.

847
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:02,059
Soju shot glasses.

848
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:03,990
They're new.

849
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,299
The soju glasses are new.

850
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:06,299
They're new.

851
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,859
- These...
- I don't drink soju.

852
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,369
Someone who likes soju...

853
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:10,799
Does Ji Hyo want them?

854
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,299
I don't need shot glasses.

855
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,339
You don't?

856
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:14,599
Take the soju, then.

857
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,069
- I'll take the soju.
- Good.

858
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:18,940
- Check them first, Ji Hyo.
- Put that in here.

859
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,250
Soju doesn't expire.

860
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,380
Soju's expiry date...

861
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,079
Give me that.
Fill it up before taking it out.

862
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,019
- We will.
- This is trash.

863
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,650
This garlic juice...

864
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,250
(He found brand new garlic juice.)

865
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,660
- He found a relic.
- It's new, right?

866
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,089
Check the expiry date.

867
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,490
Let's see how old it is.

868
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,730
- It was good until 2024.
- There are more paper bags?

869
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,359
This expired in 2024
and can't be consumed.

870
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,269
- Jong Kook.
- November 27.

871
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,970
It's a house of plastic bags.

872
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,369
These juices are nice and cold.

873
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:49,210
We can't drink these either.

874
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:50,869
Put them here or here.

875
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:54,109
There's microwavable rice
and ramyeon too.

876
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:56,579
- Goodness. What's this?
- There's still a lot.

877
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:57,710
What's this? Clothes?

878
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,279
Hey. Some Manchester United merch.

879
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,450
- Manchester United.
- It's a scarf.

880
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,750
- Manchester United?
- The scarf.

881
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,589
- You found it again.
- Are you reliving memories?

882
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:09,829
- My word.
- This team's not doing well now.

883
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:13,099
Jong Kook. Aren't you pleased
to find stuff like rice...

884
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,000
- and water?
- That's nice.

885
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,029
- Hey, Ye Eun. Here.
- What? My gosh.

886
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,369
- What should we do?
- There's an endless supply.

887
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:22,940
- This is so stressful.
- A day isn't enough.

888
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:24,440
- Right now...
- A day won't cut it.

889
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,440
I'm so stressed out
I need a gongjindan.

890
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,339
We need experts to take over.

891
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:29,809
- Actual experts...
- A gongjindan.

892
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,019
- are required.
- This is just...

893
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:33,349
- My gosh.
- Look.

894
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:35,920
- How about...
- Why won't he throw these away?

895
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,349
Let's keep a fifth of what you find.

896
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,359
(A dramatic agreement)

897
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,789
- Okay.
- We'll leave a fifth.

898
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:43,259
- Let's compromise.
- Okay. Let's do that.

899
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,299
This is madness.

900
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:48,059
- Take the soju.
- Later on...

901
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,369
Do you need gloves, Ji Hyo?

902
00:28:49,369 --> 00:28:50,630
Yes, give me gloves.

903
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,869
Wait.

904
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,609
Why are you wasting the gloves?

905
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:57,069
- Jong Kook.
- You can wash your hands later.

906
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,779
- Jong Kook.
- The thing is...

907
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:02,210
- All this is environmental...
- We're hurting the environment.

908
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,309
Let's stop talking about it.

909
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,450
Go wait elsewhere.

910
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,019
We import all the oil we need
and you lot...

911
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:10,220
Jong Kook.
If you were to sell this stuff,

912
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,859
you could make 20,000 dollars easy.

913
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,460
- Honestly.
- He keeps everything.

914
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,789
You could make 20,000 dollars.

915
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:16,930
With great feedback.

916
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,700
- This requires teamwork.
- If things are bad, they must go.

917
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,099
We must throw everything out.

918
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,470
Stuff like this, Haha. The boxes.

919
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,970
Throw them outside.

920
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,779
- What's this?
- It's Burberry.

921
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:34,109
(They found a luxury label.)

922
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:35,250
See what it is.

923
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,180
When I was last here,
I saw something from Balenciaga.

924
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,289
This looks like
it's actual Burberry.

925
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:43,289
(This market
also sells designer goods.)

926
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:44,289
It's new.

927
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,619
It looks like a tee. It's clothing.

928
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:49,660
It's puffy. It's a tee.

929
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:52,000
- It's a hoodie.
- I want this.

930
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:54,400
This would suit me well.

931
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
(Wary)

932
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,740
This is insane, isn't it?

933
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:00,170
Haha, there's more...

934
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,009
I don't know where to start.

935
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,740
Let's leave this for now.

936
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,240
These are new. Look.

937
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,279
Yes. Everything here is...

938
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,180
Let's do this.
I'll bring some empty boxes.

939
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,779
Let's put the new items
we find in there.

940
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,349
These boxing shoes. They're pretty.

941
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,119
Hang on. Is that new?
Give it to me if it's new.

942
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,289
(They put aside the new items.)

943
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,630
Give me whatever's new.

944
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,269
There's a mountain over here.

945
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:30,299
Give me that.

946
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,970
- What should we do?
- These are all new.

947
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,109
The bottom of this stack
is where the good stuff are.

948
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:38,369
Get everything out.
What isn't new...

949
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,980
Let's put them in here for now.

950
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,750
This is new.

951
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:46,779
Haha!

952
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,480
- Haha.
- Yes?

953
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,690
Hey, look...

954
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:52,019
(Se Chan started to laugh
after seeing something.)

955
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,690
- Seriously, this is crazy.
- This...

956
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,690
- Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook.

957
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,599
Why didn't you throw out
this Paris shirt?

958
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,829
(This T-shirt is...)

959
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:01,329
- Hey.
- What will you use this for?

960
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:05,240
(A handmade shirt they made
last November in Myeong-dong)

961
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:08,609
(The "I Love Paris" T-shirt
with memories of his nipple bell)

962
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:09,740
This was what we...

963
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,569
Hey, it has good memories.

964
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,609
I'm going to give it out
as a gift at my next fan meet.

965
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:15,650
Oh, okay.

966
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,710
- Doesn't that sound good?
- It does.

967
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,150
- They'll like that, right?
- They will like it.

968
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,650
This is just too much.

969
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Next...

970
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,250
- But this room is really serious.
- Where?

971
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,750
What...

972
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,990
- It's a diffuser.
- It's a diffuser.

973
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,420
- Let's put it out.
- Let's do that.

974
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,690
- Jong Kook, I'll set up a diffuser.
- Yes, throw it out.

975
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,130
- What is that?
- A diffuser.

976
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,029
Just give that to someone.
Don't put it out in my house.

977
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:34,900
Even if you put it here...
I have lots of diffusers.

978
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,369
- No, let's put it in the bathroom.
- Yes, let's do that.

979
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,970
Someone should take that diffuser.

980
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:42,640
Hey, but it's nice to have
the diffuser out.

981
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,809
It has a nice scent.

982
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:46,410
That got rid of
the smell in the house.

983
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,279
- Hey.
- You have to throw it out.

984
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,609
- You should give that to someone.
- What? Why?

985
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:51,910
- Why waste that on my house?
- But Jong Kook.

986
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,250
Why is it a waste?
Can't this house get some love?

987
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,819
(For Jong Kook's house
that deserves some love,)

988
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:03,660
(he planted some fragrance
in the corner behind the toilet.)

989
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,299
- Here you go.
- Let's clean... Okay.

990
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:06,960
Is it new?

991
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:08,900
- This is new...
- What are you guys doing?

992
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,329
We'll put all the shoes together.

993
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:11,599
And all the soccer uniforms
with each other.

994
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,339
That's a national team uniform
from Kim Min Jae.

995
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:15,839
I'm putting all the soccer uniforms
with each other.

996
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,309
- You are, right?
- Yes.

997
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:18,740
We won't steal anything.

998
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:21,279
Because I remember
where things were in my mind.

999
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,509
If I go to look for it,

1000
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:23,710
- it's not there. You know?
- That's why...

1001
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,849
- That's why, the soccer uniforms...
- That's why...

1002
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:27,250
- we'll keep them together.
- Uniforms and new ones, separated.

1003
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,250
- You'll thank us when you see it.
- Right.

1004
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:31,789
- There's no problem here.
- Okay.

1005
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,160
Haha, all the new ones
are over there.

1006
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,789
- Here's a new one.
- A new one?

1007
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:41,529
- My gosh, this is...
- Gosh, this is a serious problem.

1008
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:44,529
Haha, let's put all the sweatshirts
and hoodies in here.

1009
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:47,799
I folded all the sweatshirts
and hoodies over here.

1010
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,240
You can just take them
and put them in there.

1011
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,009
Oh, okay. I'll put these away.

1012
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:53,109
- Wait, no. Okay...
- The soccer uniforms.

1013
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:54,509
(The little boys work hard
at folding black clothes.)

1014
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:55,910
They're all black.

1015
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:58,980
Hang on. What...

1016
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,019
- What is it?
- Haha...

1017
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:02,150
Receipts.

1018
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,720
(Receipts)

1019
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,150
Jong Kook, I'll throw out
all these receipts.

1020
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,589
You won't be getting refunds.

1021
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,089
- Receipts...
- All right.

1022
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,690
Hey, can't you get refunds
if it's been ten years?

1023
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,599
- No, you can't.
- Hey.

1024
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,359
You never know. Just keep them.

1025
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,470
(While they're digging up all kinds
of memories from the dressing room)

1026
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,869
You never know.

1027
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,740
(While they're digging up all kinds
of memories from the dressing room)

1028
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,769
The bags...

1029
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:21,599
- What...
- What is that?

1030
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,009
(He finds a bunch of waste bags
in the veranda.)

1031
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:24,170
- What do I do? Throw it out?
- Jong Kook.

1032
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,940
These are all money.

1033
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,039
- Who put all those there?
- You kept those in there...

1034
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,650
- These are all money.
- Who put all those there?

1035
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,849
- These are two dollars each.
- We have a lot of them here.

1036
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,019
Oh, waste bags?

1037
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:34,380
My gosh. This is incredible.

1038
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,619
(He keeps finding more waste bags.)

1039
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:38,250
He has so many waste bags.
He's a rich man.

1040
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,259
Jae Seok, I'll take those.
I'm organizing them here.

1041
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,089
- I didn't buy those, Jae Seok.
- Then what?

1042
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:44,829
You know, if I go someplace...

1043
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:47,230
If I buy something, and they ask
what kind of bag I want...

1044
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,460
Would I take a regular plastic bag?

1045
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,730
It would be better to take
a waste bag instead.

1046
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,839
- That's why I took them.
- Hey, you...

1047
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,400
Your nickname is now Bag Man
from now on.

1048
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:57,170
Kim Bag Man.

1049
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,809
- Hey, Kim Bag.
- Bag Man.

1050
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,980
- You're a bag maniac.
- No, it's not like that.

1051
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,380
- It's a waste.
- He really likes plastic bags.

1052
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,950
These are all made of oil.
My goodness.

1053
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,950
Jong Kook,
I gathered all the waste bags here.

1054
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,550
- Take them out and use them.
- Okay.

1055
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,920
Okay, Ji Hyo. Thank you.

1056
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,389
That's nice, though.

1057
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,659
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1058
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,989
You asked if you needed to buy
recycling bins, right?

1059
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,360
- You had them in there.
- They were in there.

1060
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,329
Yes, I know I have them.

1061
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:21,730
- Look at this.
- You had recycling bins.

1062
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:23,530
- Gosh, this is unbelievable.
- You had them all along.

1063
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm sure I did. Yes.

1064
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,500
After collecting them for a while...

1065
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,500
There are more here too.

1066
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,309
I had so many plastic bags.

1067
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:33,380
- Jong Kook, you can throw them out.
- You can throw them out.

1068
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,809
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1069
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,480
You even collected them here.

1070
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,650
- Yes, I collected them.
- My gosh.

1071
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,280
When did you collect all those?

1072
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,679
- Jong Kook is now...
- I collected them.

1073
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,190
Until earlier, he was saying,
"I'm going to use everything!"

1074
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,420
But now, he's like, "Sure."

1075
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,159
- He has chilled out.
- I didn't know I had so many.

1076
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,090
Hey, this is
the infamous vinyl greenhouse.

1077
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:51,760
It totally is.

1078
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,800
This is definitely enough to
call it a vinyl greenhouse.

1079
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,099
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1080
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,369
- This looks so neat.
- I feel so proud.

1081
00:34:57,969 --> 00:35:00,000
- Just this much should be...
- Give me the ones to use.

1082
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,969
- It's so beautiful.
- The ones to put in there.

1083
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,809
- So beautiful.
- The chair. Take it if you need it.

1084
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:04,809
But...

1085
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:06,309
people might think
Jong Kook is moving today.

1086
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,780
- Jong Kook will still live here...
- But you guys aren't going to...

1087
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,409
- just leave it like this, right?
- No.

1088
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,550
Plastic bags.

1089
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,679
- I'll go and get revenge.
- A bag of plastic bags.

1090
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,880
This... Hang on.

1091
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:17,389
Hey, this is like his cuddle toy.

1092
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:20,460
- What do you mean?
- We have to give him a few bags.

1093
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,460
- For him to feel at ease...
- Which ones?

1094
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,889
I'm going to put
some plastic bags back.

1095
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:25,429
- Of course, I should have some.
- I know.

1096
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:26,929
For you to feel at ease,

1097
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:28,460
you need some of these
like cuddle toys.

1098
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,199
- I do need some.
- I'll throw these out, Jong Kook.

1099
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,170
No, I put some in there.

1100
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,300
I put them in there.

1101
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,239
We need to leave some plastic bags
for him too.

1102
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,369
- We need to leave some bags.
- But that's too much...

1103
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,909
- Is it this one? It is.
- Oh, that one.

1104
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:42,349
- It's this. The ones he collected.
- Yes, it is.

1105
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,650
The ones Jong Kook collected.
His cuddle toys.

1106
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,519
- What? Which ones?
- Give me the plastic bags.

1107
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,849
- Jong Kook will feel anxious.
- What do you mean?

1108
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:48,949
- That much...
- We should leave some bags for you.

1109
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:50,289
- Oh, you should leave a few.
- Yes.

1110
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:51,349
This much is good, right?

1111
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,389
- To take out recycling. Good.
- You need them.

1112
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:56,030
I use about three bags
to take out the recycling once.

1113
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,059
- I know.
- Right.

1114
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:59,400
But I don't produce
a lot of waste, so...

1115
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,730
(But I don't produce
a lot of waste, so...)

1116
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,300
- What did you say?
- What?

1117
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,800
You don't produce a lot of what?

1118
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,139
I don't produce a lot of stuff
to recycle.

1119
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,769
That's because
they're all still in here.

1120
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:10,340
But I'm curious.

1121
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,809
- Did these all come out of there?
- Yes.

1122
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,179
- My house has great storage.
- Take a look now.

1123
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:18,179
That was how Jong Kook's house was
when we first got here.

1124
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:19,780
- Let's take a look.
- Right here.

1125
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,119
Gosh, it's so clean.

1126
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,250
It became clean.

1127
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,719
It makes me feel so relaxed.

1128
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:28,190
(The result of digging things up
for 1 hour without resting)

1129
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,730
(The balcony
finally found the light.)

1130
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,960
(The dressing room was tangled with
treasures and old clothes.)

1131
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,969
(The room that looked like
a general store is now cleaned out.)

1132
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,670
Haha, I feel so proud.

1133
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,869
Jong Kook.

1134
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:41,699
- Hey, Jong Kook. Take a look.
- Take a look.

1135
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,340
Please get Jong Kook's reaction
on camera.

1136
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,170
- He'll be so surprised.
- Go inside and get his reaction.

1137
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,780
- Let's see what you did.
- Seriously, Jong Kook.

1138
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,340
- My gosh. It's all here.
- Isn't it neat?

1139
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,679
(Impressed)

1140
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,280
- My gosh. It's all here.
- Isn't it neat?

1141
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,920
Hey, you did a great job.

1142
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,190
All of these in the plastic bags
are new ones.

1143
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:58,820
These are hoodies and sweatshirts.

1144
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:02,860
And these in plastic bags
are your workout clothes.

1145
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,960
- All right.
- Yes.

1146
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,900
- Gosh, this is...
- And this one too.

1147
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,630
I don't think
I'll be able to wear these.

1148
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,969
No, take them out one by one.

1149
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:11,070
You can work out your back
as you take them out.

1150
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,230
- I should do that.
- Yes.

1151
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,940
Anyway,
it's nice to organize things.

1152
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,710
This space. This is all money.

1153
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,510
- This space. Yes.
- It's nice now that it's done.

1154
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:18,769
- It's nice and neat.
- Gosh, now...

1155
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,579
Let's tackle the refrigerator.

1156
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,809
- No, forget cleaning the fridge.
- I don't think we can do that.

1157
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,210
- But we have to throw these out.
- Right, I'll clean out the fridge.

1158
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,519
I'll do the fridge.

1159
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,480
Jong Kook,
let's just throw these out.

1160
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,389
Just that one.

1161
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:32,820
- But I could do that myself.
- Come on. We'll do it.

1162
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,190
But you're leaving the fridge door
open for too long.

1163
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,329
Jong Kook, Manchester United.

1164
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:38,289
- Throw me that.
- This is...

1165
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:41,130
- You're leaving it open too long.
- Seok Jin.

1166
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,900
- Take them out and close the door.
- Come on.

1167
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,829
- We'll work fast.
- Take it out and close the door.

1168
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,369
Close it.

1169
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:49,210
- Right. Work and take more out.
- Keep the cold...

1170
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,539
- contained, then... Right.
- That's right.

1171
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,440
All right. Hurry up.

1172
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,039
We have to clean out the fridge now,
so hurry.

1173
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,809
- Hey, look at this.
- Should we call a cleaning company?

1174
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:59,280
- This is...
- Gosh, it has gotten so clean.

1175
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,880
Seok Jin, the door!

1176
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,150
The fridge door!

1177
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,150
- But Jong Kook...
- All right.

1178
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,320
- It costs more to open and close.
- All right.

1179
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,619
- The food will go bad.
- Oh, it'll go bad.

1180
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,760
The temperature will change.

1181
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,090
Hey, but you need to throw this out.

1182
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,000
- Throw it out.
- Is it soy sauce?

1183
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,329
No, it's coffee.

1184
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:15,670
- Coffee.
- Soy sauce?

1185
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:18,030
- She asked if it was soy sauce.
- Dutch coffee.

1186
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,300
Hey, why would I have
so much soy sauce...

1187
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,570
It's soy sauce!

1188
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,639
- No, it's Dutch coffee.
- Let me see.

1189
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:26,539
- It's soy sauce.
- Gosh, this is so funny.

1190
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:28,940
It smells like coffee.
How can this be soy sauce?

1191
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:32,280
Hey, spending time in my house
must've done something to your nose.

1192
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,880
It smells like soy sauce.

1193
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,019
(The food fighter's sense of smell
is broken.)

1194
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:37,150
- We should go throw this out.
- Let's go.

1195
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,219
- Then, let's take these out once.
- Right, these. Let's do that.

1196
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:43,460
- No, I'll take those. I'm good.
- Give me those.

1197
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,929
- By the way, Seok Jin...
- What?

1198
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,130
Aren't you carrying things
that are too light?

1199
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,500
- We have to recycle things well.
- Of course.

1200
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,869
- We should do a good job.
- Plastics with plastics.

1201
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:54,170
The plastic bags...

1202
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,440
Gosh, I can't even see.

1203
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,739
(They take out the plastic bags
that have piled up for 1 year!)

1204
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:57,869
Hey.

1205
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,309
(They take out the plastic bags
that have piled up for 1 year!)

1206
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:03,579
(The recycling bin is full
from throwing them all out at once.)

1207
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,320
Gosh, there's no more room for them.
This is bad.

1208
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,320
This is insane, isn't it?

1209
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,719
The trash keeps piling out
with no end in sight.

1210
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:12,889
(As they put their efforts together
and do a big clean...)

1211
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:15,190
Jong Kook, this room used to be
full up to here earlier.

1212
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,960
Gosh, it has gotten so neat.

1213
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,530
It's hard to believe
that this is the same house.

1214
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:22,159
Gosh, this place looks amazing.

1215
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,329
- Seriously. That place is awesome.
- Take a look.

1216
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,440
I swear.
We found 3,000 plastic bags.

1217
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:28,900
- Oh, nice.
- No, there were more.

1218
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,340
There were 7,000.

1219
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,239
- I'm mopping. No, I'll do it.
- Should I do it, Jae Seok?

1220
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,579
Jong Kook, I feel so much better
now that we've cleaned things out.

1221
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,079
- I know. I feel good too.
- It has gotten so neat.

1222
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:42,280
I hope you will be happy for a long time
in your newly clean house.

1223
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:44,219
- That's for sure.
- Look at the prizes.

1224
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:46,960
- Gosh, that's funny.
- No way. That's funny.

1225
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:49,690
But why did you make this a prize
without even asking me?

1226
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,559
This is pretty.

1227
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,030
Where is this from?
Los Angeles? Oh, my.

1228
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,170
- It's pretty.
- It's a Stussy.

1229
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,300
Oh, this is from L.A.

1230
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,840
Haha, I want this later on.

1231
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,900
(The prize that Se Chan chose)

1232
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,369
- What do you think?
- Not bad.

1233
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:05,809
I'll choose this later.

1234
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,909
- Do you like this coffee machine?
- Yes.

1235
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,409
Then, take it.

1236
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,780
- It's new. Hey, here it is.
- Oh, really?

1237
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,449
- Hey, you can take it.
- Do you use this?

1238
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:14,780
- Yes, I'll give it to you. No.
- It's brand new.

1239
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,519
- We have to make it a prize.
- It's a prize.

1240
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:17,519
Put it in the box.

1241
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:19,559
Hey, does anyone want to wear
these Nike socks?

1242
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,289
- Oh, me. I like tall socks.
- These are great. Take them.

1243
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:23,190
Then, let's make these prizes too.

1244
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,559
It hasn't been too long
since I got this.

1245
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,300
- No.
- Not this one.

1246
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:28,829
Let's include this one.

1247
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:29,929
- Yes.
- That's nice.

1248
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:31,329
- These hats are nice.
- Yes, they are.

1249
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:33,099
- I want everything.
- Take the items...

1250
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:35,599
that have been in my house
for at least five years.

1251
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,340
- Hey, this looks really nice.
- Oh, okay.

1252
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,739
- These are popular.
- They're just right.

1253
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:40,079
They fit me just right.

1254
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:42,309
- I like them too.
- They fit me perfectly.

1255
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:44,179
- Let me see.
- They're perfect for me.

1256
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:45,710
- Would they only fit you perfectly?
- What...

1257
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,949
- There are other slippers. Here.
- These fit me perfectly.

1258
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,050
I want these.

1259
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,750
Those fit me perfectly too.

1260
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,750
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1261
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,690
- We have all the gifts we need.
- We have enough.

1262
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,059
- Hold on.
- Don't hand out too much.

1263
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:56,090
No, take more.

1264
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,159
No, we're good.

1265
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,260
First, I must say...

1266
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:01,500
You know that sweatshirt
has my name on it.

1267
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,199
- I want the sweatshirt.
- Me too.

1268
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,769
- I want it as well.
- It's too big for you.

1269
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:07,440
- I like oversized sweaters.
- I dig clothes that are big.

1270
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,070
- I'm a size heavy, remember?
- It's even big on me.

1271
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,110
- She called herself heavy for this.
- I'm a size heavy.

1272
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,110
- It's heavy and oversized for her.
- I like wearing big clothes.

1273
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,449
- It's too big for you two.
- These are the items I want.

1274
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:17,880
- Which are?
- I have two.

1275
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,519
- The socks and slippers.
- Slippers?

1276
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,219
- I'd like those shoes.
- Now,

1277
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:23,719
while the prizes are
being sorted out,

1278
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:26,119
- you'll have your lunch.
- I'm hungry.

1279
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:28,920
Seok Jin, who is an elder
of the Jee family...

1280
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,659
- is celebrating his birthday today.
- That's right.

1281
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:32,900
- Happy birthday!
- So,

1282
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,760
Ye Eun, the youngest member
of the Ji family,

1283
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:38,300
- will cook seaweed soup.
- Really?

1284
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,739
- Do you know how to make it?
- Of course.

1285
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:41,900
Pizza, which you love,
will also be served...

1286
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,570
- for his birthday meal,
- Really?

1287
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:46,909
so you'll eat
once the seaweed soup is done.

1288
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:48,809
Ye Eun's a terrible cook.

1289
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:50,349
Actually, I've gotten better.

1290
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,949
Jong Kook, where's the pot?

1291
00:41:52,949 --> 00:41:54,150
- What?
- The pot.

1292
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,719
Try the bottom cupboard on the left.

1293
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,519
- A pot and...
- The bottom cupboard on the left.

1294
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,860
- The bottom cupboard on the left.
- Bottom and on the left.

1295
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,659
- That's it.
- I understood you.

1296
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:03,260
Good. There you go.

1297
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,690
- A pot and...
- Yes?

1298
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,199
Do you have sesame oil?

1299
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,429
I'm guessing
it's around here somewhere.

1300
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:10,869
- There's the sesame oil.
- Hasn't it gone bad?

1301
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:13,400
What are you talking about?
How can sesame oil go bad?

1302
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:15,969
Where's the Korean-style soy sauce?

1303
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:17,670
- The Korean-style soy sauce?
- Yes.

1304
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,440
Check in draws like this.

1305
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,210
- I have various condiments.
- You have it.

1306
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,380
(Opening the condiment draw)

1307
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:24,179
You actually have everything.

1308
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:25,780
- What?
- Did you cook your own food?

1309
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:28,420
Yes, for "My Little Old Boy" and stuff.

1310
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,849
- Ye Eun.
- Even that...

1311
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:31,820
We'll cook the soup.

1312
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,360
I'll just cook a single portion.

1313
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,329
(She begins to cook
with confidence.)

1314
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,760
The seaweed
should be soaked in water.

1315
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,369
(20g, 8 portions)

1316
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:46,699
(It's enough seaweed for 8 people.)

1317
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:48,099
(Pouring)

1318
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,139
About that much.

1319
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:50,909
I'll only add this much.

1320
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:52,469
(She pours a lot in even though
she'll only cook 1 portion.)

1321
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,639
- Can we trust Ye Eun with this?
- Yes.

1322
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,280
Ye Eun's a terrible cook.

1323
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,380
- I've had her food before.
- Come on.

1324
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,980
Her aglio e olio was so spicy
that it made me sneeze.

1325
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,349
Ye Eun, it's hard...

1326
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:03,019
- for seaweed soup to taste bad.
- Got it.

1327
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:05,750
- Have you cooked this before?
- No.

1328
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,789
- Is it your first time?
- Yes.

1329
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,219
- What?
- It's her first time?

1330
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,690
It's her first time
cooking seaweed soup?

1331
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,260
She must know the recipe though.

1332
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,800
Ye Eun, let us cook it instead then.

1333
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,800
No, I'm good.

1334
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,070
We probably won't eat it,
so just make it for Seok Jin.

1335
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,940
- Sure.
- We'll have the pizza.

1336
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,599
(Will Ye Eun's first-time
seaweed soup taste good?)

1337
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:23,940
The seaweed must be soaked in water.

1338
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,079
(Thankfully, she manages
to soak the seaweed in water.)

1339
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,340
Where's the sesame oil?

1340
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,340
Here it is.

1341
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:36,289
- I probably shouldn't use this...
- It was sent from afar.

1342
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:39,150
since it expired on March 30, 2024.

1343
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,789
(It expired 1 year ago.)

1344
00:43:40,789 --> 00:43:42,489
How can sesame oil go bad?

1345
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,760
(This time, she checks
the anchovy sauce.)

1346
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,900
(Startled, she calls
the cameraman over.)

1347
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,699
This expired in 2020.

1348
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:52,000
This is too much.

1349
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,340
(She reports them quietly...)

1350
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,639
(since he might not let her
throw them out.)

1351
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:57,710
(What about
the Korean-style soy sauce?)

1352
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:03,980
(It's not too bad
with it only expiring 3 months ago.)

1353
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,780
I don't think
I should use any of these.

1354
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,880
(Whispering)

1355
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,320
I bet there's sesame oil somewhere.

1356
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,820
(Will she be able
to cook the seaweed soup?)

1357
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:13,590
No way.

1358
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,760
Bo Mi wished me a happy birthday.

1359
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,190
Who? Kim Bong?

1360
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,659
- No, Bo Mi.
- Oh, her.

1361
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:23,500
Seok Jin, happy birthday.

1362
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:25,630
I didn't deserve this from her.

1363
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:28,099
He said he didn't like people
wishing him a happy birthday,

1364
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:29,769
- He loves it.
- but he does.

1365
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:31,469
- Wasn't that him bragging?
- It was.

1366
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:32,710
He was thrilled.

1367
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,940
- He's definitely bragging.
- He can't contain his joy...

1368
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,940
- and is moving around.
- Right.

1369
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,349
It's upsetting though, Seok Jin.

1370
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:38,650
- When we said it,
- When we said it...

1371
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,920
he was like this.

1372
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,320
"Don't you dare
wish me a happy birthday."

1373
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,219
- But with Bo Mi...
- Well, that's...

1374
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:44,420
What about us?

1375
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,360
It's embarrassing
since you're right there.

1376
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,159
This was sent from afar.

1377
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,760
Does that make it okay?

1378
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,489
Of course.
I don't find it embarrassing...

1379
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:52,929
- Really?
- when it was sent from afar.

1380
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:55,929
(The strong and mighty Seok Sam)

1381
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:57,769
(A sudden video call?)

1382
00:44:58,329 --> 00:44:59,400
What now?

1383
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,239
Darn it.

1384
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:05,809
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1385
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:07,909
(He put distance between them!)

1386
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:09,510
He moved far away.

1387
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,449
(He wishes Seok Sam a happy birthday
via phone.)

1388
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:13,880
- Who is it?
- What now?

1389
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,250
<i>- Happy birthday, dear Seok Sam</i>
- It's Jae Seok.

1390
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,619
I can't believe you. Stop it.

1391
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:23,730
(The teasing doesn't stop
even on Seok Sam's birthday.)

1392
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:27,599
- Is he teasing me?
- You should love it...

1393
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,260
- since he sent it from far away.
- Make a heart with your hands.

1394
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,829
- It was sent from far away.
- Aren't you teasing me?

1395
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:32,940
- It's nice to send it from afar.
- This is you teasing me.

1396
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:34,170
Don't.

1397
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,769
(Seok Sam is getting
another phone call?)

1398
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:39,039
What now? Hey.

1399
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:41,780
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>

1400
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,909
Seok Jin!

1401
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:45,250
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>

1402
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,250
Seok Jin, we're in Nepal.

1403
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,250
We're greeting you from Nepal.

1404
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,550
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

1405
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,920
We're in Kathmandu.

1406
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,219
- Always be healthy.
- Even from afar...

1407
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,230
- Happy birthday, Seok Jin.
- Happy birthday, Seok Jin.

1408
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:00,699
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
- They called you from afar.

1409
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:01,860
I love you, Seok Jin.

1410
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,130
Seok Jin, happy birthday!

1411
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,599
Right. I know it's not easy
being far from home.

1412
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:09,440
- Right.
- Get home safely from Nepal.

1413
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,769
- Sure.
- We're in Kathmandu.

1414
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:12,340
- This is Kathmandu.
- This is Kathmandu.

1415
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,579
(Being internationally famous,)

1416
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:15,579
(Seok Sam only lets people wish him
a happy birthday from afar.)

1417
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:17,750
I can't believe
they called from Kathmandu.

1418
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,250
Unbelievable.

1419
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:22,679
- This is hilarious.
- Anyone who wants...

1420
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,320
- to send him a message,
- Don't.

1421
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,090
- should do so via voicemail.
- Stop it.

1422
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:27,360
- I get it now.
- Don't.

1423
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,820
- It's embarrassing.
- Now I know.

1424
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,760
- That's what you accept.
- Those sent from afar.

1425
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,829
Yes, afar.

1426
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:33,760
Hey, how about this?

1427
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,269
Hold on. What do you think of this?

1428
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,170
- It's a size large.
- I'll take it.

1429
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,199
Let me have it.

1430
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:41,039
- Have it be one of the prizes.
- Let it be a prize.

1431
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:42,699
- I want it.
- What about this?

1432
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,039
I doubt any of you use headphones.

1433
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,409
- I do!
- I'll take it!

1434
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:46,739
This is a Bose headphone.

1435
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:48,139
- Me!
- I want it.

1436
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,150
- These caps are always nice.
- She made aglio e olio once.

1437
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:51,780
- This is nice.
- These are useful.

1438
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,050
These are easy to wear.

1439
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,949
- I love that cap.
- Caps like this...

1440
00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:56,050
That's great.

1441
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,619
- This...
- It has your name on it.

1442
00:46:57,619 --> 00:46:58,920
It looks good on you.

1443
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,619
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

1444
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:03,429
I have too many Yeezy boosts.
Do you wear them?

1445
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:04,789
I love them.

1446
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,800
- They're of different designs.
- These are different.

1447
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,360
- Check this out.
- That's the one.

1448
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,269
- Yeezy boosts.
- I gave a pair to Se Ho...

1449
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:12,099
- The zebra print.
- No way.

1450
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:14,670
I have a dozen of them. Take a pair.

1451
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,539
The others will be upset
if I take a pair too easily.

1452
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:18,710
- No, have them be a prize.
- Yes, let them be a prize.

1453
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,780
There are too many things to take.

1454
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,079
- Seok Jin.
- This is a treasure house.

1455
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,280
- Yes, these.
- For Seok Jin...

1456
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,750
It's his birthday, remember?

1457
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,380
I don't have a pair of Yeezy boosts.

1458
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,550
That suits you well.

1459
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,150
- Try them on.
- Should I?

1460
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,789
Zebra is your nickname.

1461
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:34,590
- Right, zebra.
- What's wrong?

1462
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,090
It was the chair.

1463
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:37,559
Come on.

1464
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,800
These seem to be a bit big.

1465
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,400
This fits me perfectly.

1466
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,300
- No, it fits perfectly.
- It's perfect on me too.

1467
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,000
- This is a perfect fit.
- It is.

1468
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,539
This is a bit big for me, right?

1469
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,570
(Se Chan tries on the other pair.)

1470
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,070
This fits me perfectly.

1471
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,139
(It fits Se Chan perfectly too.)

1472
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:54,909
- This is a perfect fit.
- It is.

1473
00:47:54,909 --> 00:47:56,380
- It fits perfectly.
- It's a perfect fit.

1474
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,750
- It fits me perfectly too.
- Really?

1475
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,820
- Why you...
- It fits me like a glove.

1476
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,219
It's a perfect fit.

1477
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:02,449
I can't believe
how perfectly this fits me.

1478
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:03,550
- How can it be this perfect?
- This is insane.

1479
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,949
- It's a perfect fit.
- If it was one size smaller...

1480
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,420
The same goes for me as well.

1481
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,590
- I mean it.
- You...

1482
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,030
- Are we twins or something?
- It's true.

1483
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,260
Why are you copying what I'm saying?

1484
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,289
Win it as a prize.

1485
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,760
- Got it.
- There are too many prizes to win.

1486
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,500
It goes perfectly
with his outfit today.

1487
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,670
It suits what I'm wearing.

1488
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:17,730
- It's pretty.
- Those look good on you.

1489
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:18,800
There's no doubt about it.

1490
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,239
This is what you look good in.

1491
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,639
These are pretty.

1492
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,909
Size nine. That's me.

1493
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:25,309
- Same here.
- Size nine.

1494
00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:26,340
I wear a size nine too.

1495
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:27,710
It's true.

1496
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,380
I doubt these fit you.

1497
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,150
- They came out smaller.
- I know, but...

1498
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,349
These fit my feet perfectly.

1499
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:33,420
The same goes for me.

1500
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,619
- My toes come right here.
- As do mine.

1501
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:39,760
- I mean it. It's...
- Stop getting in the way.

1502
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,760
Let it be a prize we can win.

1503
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,820
- Seok Jin...
- Hold on.

1504
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,260
- Do you know what he said?
- What did I say?

1505
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,059
"It's sad these days
since there's nothing I want."

1506
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,300
- That's right.
- Exactly!

1507
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:53,739
(3 hours ago)

1508
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:56,909
(He was sad because
there was nothing he wanted.)

1509
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,639
- That's what I said.
- That was a few hours ago.

1510
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:00,980
He's hungry for those shoes.

1511
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,039
He really wants those.

1512
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,150
I didn't know
I liked shoes like this.

1513
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,480
Take one you want.

1514
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,119
- You can have it.
- The zebra is the best.

1515
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,920
- Sure.
- Zebra, Jeebra.

1516
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,190
- The zebra is for him.
- I like how the print...

1517
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,920
- makes a statement.
- I like those best as well.

1518
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:14,719
It already smells good.

1519
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:16,159
(Ye Eun is busy cooking.)

1520
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:18,630
(The staff gave her condiments
that haven't expired.)

1521
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:21,460
Seaweed soup is easy to make.

1522
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,500
(After stir-frying the seaweed,
she heads to the fridge.)

1523
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,639
(She takes a while
looking for something.)

1524
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,070
(Chicken breast?)

1525
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:35,480
(Why does she suddenly need
chicken breast?)

1526
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,079
Cooking is all about the touch.

1527
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,019
Shouldn't I go help Ye Eun?

1528
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,320
Ji Hyo, seaweed soup
is the easiest to cook.

1529
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,619
You haven't made it before though.

1530
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:46,989
She's confident about everything,
but the taste...

1531
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:48,260
Maybe that's enough.

1532
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,420
(She shows off her double chin
and adds her touch to the soup.)

1533
00:49:50,389 --> 00:49:52,059
I didn't have to rinse this, right?

1534
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,440
(After adding shredded chicken,
she pours water.)

1535
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,909
(Roughly seasoning it
with soy sauce)

1536
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:07,079
- I didn't add garlic.
- Because you're of the Jee family.

1537
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:08,739
Is it too late to add it?

1538
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:11,079
It's always best
to have a garlicky flavor.

1539
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:15,579
(She doesn't add much
and then stirs it.)

1540
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,989
(And then she tastes it?)

1541
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,889
It's quite good.

1542
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:24,860
I mean it.

1543
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:26,929
(It tastes good?)

1544
00:50:26,929 --> 00:50:27,929
It's good.

1545
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:30,000
How is it good?

1546
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:31,730
Why is it good?

1547
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,369
(Is she being a skilled actress?
Or does it actually taste good?)

1548
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:34,469
It's done.

1549
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:36,199
(Is she being a skilled actress?
Or does it actually taste good?)

1550
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:38,539
I swear it tastes great.

1551
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:40,340
(How will the seaweed soup taste...)

1552
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,809
(when it was completed
without having been boiled?)

1553
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:44,710
By the way, where's Jong Kook?

1554
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,320
- Where did Jong Kook go?
- The master bedroom.

1555
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:49,889
He's crying because
his plastic bags disappeared.

1556
00:50:49,889 --> 00:50:50,949
"My plastic bags."

1557
00:50:50,989 --> 00:50:52,619
- "My plastic bags."
- "Mine..."

1558
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:54,920
- Bag Man, are you okay?
- "Goodbye, my babies."

1559
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,460
- Hey, Bag.
- "I'll go down and find you later."

1560
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,730
- Hey, Kim Bag.
- Kim Bag!

1561
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,099
"Daddy will find you."

1562
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,500
Hey, Bag. Are you...

1563
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,070
- What is he doing?
- Are you crying?

1564
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,969
- Is he crying?
- Go and see if he's crying.

1565
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:08,300
- Is he really crying?
- He might be crying...

1566
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,500
with his head in his hands.

1567
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,670
I mean, Kim Bag...

1568
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:14,380
Hey, Bag.

1569
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,809
- Yes?
- What are you doing?

1570
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,820
- I'm washing my hands, Jae Seok.
- Really?

1571
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,079
(Worried he might be crying
with the water on)

1572
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:22,349
You're not crying, are you?

1573
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:24,190
(Worried he might be crying
with the water on)

1574
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,789
Bag, I thought you were crying.

1575
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:29,090
No, I was looking to see
if there was anything to bring.

1576
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,630
Oh, because of the plastic bags...

1577
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,829
- Bag, come here.
- Jae Seok. My gosh.

1578
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:35,300
This tastes so good.

1579
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,099
- Is it a special edition?
- Yes.

1580
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:38,800
- Really?
- Jong Kook, add rice to it...

1581
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,500
and eat it as gukbap
if we have leftovers.

1582
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:42,099
- Is it finished?
- It's done.

1583
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:43,139
Then, let's eat.

1584
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:44,369
(It hasn't boiled yet,
but the cook says it's done.)

1585
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:46,039
- My goodness.
- Here are three bowls first.

1586
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:47,280
- Really?
- Yes.

1587
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,079
- Are these really...
- Yes, I couldn't bring them all.

1588
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:51,510
- But is it really okay?
- I'm serious.

1589
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,179
- Really? It looks all right.
- It really is.

1590
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:55,480
- It looks pretty legit.
- It smells pretty good too.

1591
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,789
- Yes.
- Let's try it once.

1592
00:51:56,789 --> 00:51:59,320
- It smells okay.
- It's tasty.

1593
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,690
- There's one for everyone. Really.
- Why is she so out of breath?

1594
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,559
You made seaweed soup for
the first time in your life...

1595
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:04,889
- for me?
- Take one.

1596
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:06,190
- Yes.
- That's amazing.

1597
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,260
My first seaweed soup.
Take the silverware too.

1598
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,170
- All right.
- But aren't you eating, Ye Eun?

1599
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,269
No, I had a lot to eat.

1600
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:12,300
(She didn't bring
a bowl for herself.)

1601
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,969
- No, I had a lot to eat.
- Is that right?

1602
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:15,269
- That's odd.
- Why aren't you eating?

1603
00:52:15,269 --> 00:52:16,570
I tasted it a lot.

1604
00:52:17,139 --> 00:52:18,369
Do you need another spoon?

1605
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:20,840
- It's fine.
- I'll taste the soup, then.

1606
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:22,579
Can we really be honest?

1607
00:52:22,579 --> 00:52:24,380
- Totally honest.
- I'll enjoy the soup, Ye Eun.

1608
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,380
Jae Seok, you should try it first.
How is it?

1609
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,519
How is it?

1610
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:30,750
Oh, dear.

1611
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:32,250
- Right?
- Do we just need one?

1612
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,260
Be honest.

1613
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:35,690
But that's...

1614
00:52:36,389 --> 00:52:38,960
Right? I knew it.
I've had her food before.

1615
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,699
(Still,
the birthday guy takes a sip.)

1616
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:44,800
Oh, hey. It's...

1617
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:47,900
(Everyone tries a spoonful,)

1618
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,969
(but the taste just leaves
question marks in their heads.)

1619
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,639
Yes, right.
Well, it's not a deep flavor.

1620
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:55,880
- The sesame oil tastes...
- Yes, the sesame oil.

1621
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,880
- I like my food salty.
- You haven't made it before.

1622
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,780
(She added the sesame oil
that she got in a hurry.)

1623
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,150
(And she added some more.)

1624
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:04,949
It smells so good.

1625
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:07,389
It tastes so good.

1626
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:09,690
- Are you sure?
- Seriously.

1627
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,159
(Before the flavor even seeps out,)

1628
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:14,099
(she turns off the stove.)

1629
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:17,800
(She serves it just like that.)

1630
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,300
It's salty but bland, right?

1631
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,269
- Does it taste bad?
- The flavor has no depth.

1632
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:23,869
- What does this feel like?
- It's like seaweed soup.

1633
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:26,539
It's like when you go to retreats
or something...

1634
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,610
- Kind of like... You know?
- Right, cafeteria food.

1635
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:30,010
- It's like eating cafeteria food.
- It's healthy food.

1636
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,179
I didn't add anything.

1637
00:53:31,179 --> 00:53:33,280
- It tastes neat.
- Yes, I wanted it to taste neat.

1638
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,920
(Everyone is making a fuss, but...)

1639
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,789
- It tastes like sesame oil.
- It isn't seasoned properly.

1640
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:41,920
(Jihyo84 is the only one
who's enjoying it.)

1641
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,190
- The flavor has no depth.
- I keep eating it...

1642
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:45,059
(She even drinks all the broth
in one go.)

1643
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,599
- It tastes better as I keep going.
- It tastes healthy.

1644
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:50,269
- Seaweed is good for your health.
- Of course.

1645
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:51,530
<i>Happy birthday</i>

1646
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:52,670
That's it.

1647
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,769
(The youngest even prepared a cake
with her goat-like voice.)

1648
00:53:55,769 --> 00:53:58,610
- I told you not to do this.
<i>- Happy birthday</i>

1649
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,610
(Embarrassed)

1650
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:00,610
Come on.

1651
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,010
Are you Seok Jin's daughter?

1652
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:04,550
- Well, sure...
- Yes?

1653
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,780
- On the back here. Like this.
- So, what...

1654
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,980
- You want me to do this?
- It's bland, but it's all right.

1655
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,349
Seok Jin, are you 60...
How many candles should I put?

1656
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:12,750
Sixty...

1657
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:15,460
- That's not right. I'm 58.
- But Seok Jin.

1658
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,460
- Seok Jin.
- No.

1659
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,090
If it's your birthday, you're 59.

1660
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,289
Then, let's put 59.

1661
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:22,360
- Gosh, 59 or 60.
- He's 59.

1662
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,730
Gosh, Seok Jin is 59.

1663
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:27,469
Hey, you shouldn't do all that.
Just put one candle in there.

1664
00:54:27,469 --> 00:54:30,469
- But...
- You insensible fools.

1665
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:32,369
- Hey, come on.
- Why are you getting angry?

1666
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:33,780
- Why are you getting mad?
- Don't be angry.

1667
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,539
- Why are you getting mad?
- Be grateful we're doing this.

1668
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:37,909
Why are you getting mad
on your birthday?

1669
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:40,280
- What is this? Why be so obvious...
- We should put 59.

1670
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,920
- This is what we all do these days.
- Oh, really?

1671
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,690
(It would be a shame
not to sing the birthday song.)

1672
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:46,690
I hate this so much.

1673
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:49,059
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>

1674
00:54:49,059 --> 00:54:50,389
Just deal with it.

1675
00:54:50,389 --> 00:54:54,730
(They sincerely congratulate
the eldest on his birthday.)

1676
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:57,699
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>

1677
00:54:57,699 --> 00:54:59,469
- Yes!
- Thank you.

1678
00:54:59,469 --> 00:55:00,469
Blow them out.

1679
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:02,269
My gosh. This is...

1680
00:55:02,269 --> 00:55:04,710
- Since it's Seok Sam's birthday,
- Yes.

1681
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:07,340
- you should give us a speech.
- Why should I do that?

1682
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,780
- Give us a speech.
- I just...

1683
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,179
Thank you for being born.

1684
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:12,380
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

1685
00:55:12,449 --> 00:55:14,880
Let's be healthy.
Health is the best.

1686
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,579
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1687
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,650
- Happy birthday.
- No, but really...

1688
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,190
- We used to say this before.
- Yes?

1689
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:23,159
- When you become 60 or 59...
- I'm not there yet.

1690
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:24,159
- Should we do it?
- I'm not there yet.

1691
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,659
- We wondered if the day would come.
- I'm not there yet. But really...

1692
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:29,000
- That day has come.
- We said, "No way."

1693
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,269
- It's because...
- We wondered if the day would come.

1694
00:55:30,269 --> 00:55:32,900
- It's huge in the variety world.
- But it happened. Seriously.

1695
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:33,940
- Of course.
- Yes, it's a huge celebration.

1696
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,599
- Being on a variety show until 60?
- Really, it's amazing.

1697
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:40,110
- I feel like I'm setting a record.
- Of course.

1698
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,639
- That's for sure.
- Right, for real.

1699
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,010
I'm so proud of you.

1700
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,980
- All right, then.
- Gosh, this is crazy.

1701
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,880
This is all the rage these days.
You know that, right?

1702
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,289
- Pizza is the best on birthdays.
- Oh, pizza.

1703
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:52,389
- I'm so curious about the basil.
- The basil tastes good.

1704
00:55:52,389 --> 00:55:53,920
- This is insane.
- Can I try some?

1705
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,190
- Then, I'll try the basil too.
- Gosh, this is...

1706
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:57,760
Should I try the basil too?

1707
00:55:57,889 --> 00:55:59,230
Eating basil pizza...

1708
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,730
Eating basil pizza in my shorts.

1709
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:03,159
This is insane!

1710
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,429
Really, in your shorts.

1711
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:06,670
(It tastes even better
as he eats while telling dad jokes.)

1712
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:08,199
- Gosh, it's tasty.
- Yes.

1713
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,610
- I love basil so much.
- In your shorts.

1714
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,369
(The food fighter, who didn't eat
seaweed soup, starts eating too.)

1715
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:16,280
It goes so well with basil...

1716
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,280
(Their tastebuds that were ruined by
the seaweed soup come back to life.)

1717
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,679
- Gosh, this is tasty.
- It is.

1718
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:23,079
It's good.
The basil smells so nice and fresh.

1719
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,190
(Totally immersed)

1720
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,960
- My gosh.
- They add bulgogi and stuff.

1721
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,659
The basil tastes so strong.

1722
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,159
- The basil is so good.
- Is this the Toowoomba sauce?

1723
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:34,429
- The Toowoomba sauce.
- Gosh, Toowoomba on pizza?

1724
00:56:34,429 --> 00:56:35,829
(They even get a little spice
with Toowoomba sauce pizza.)

1725
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,400
The scent is so important.

1726
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:41,139
Hey, try the Toowoomba pizza.

1727
00:56:41,139 --> 00:56:42,400
(Chef Yang recommends
the unique flavor.)

1728
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,670
- It's tasty.
- In the morning...

1729
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,780
- Is this the Toowoomba? Let me try.
- Yes, it's Toowoomba sauce.

1730
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,980
- Toowoomba is the best.
- It's nice that it's not greasy.

1731
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,409
It's nice and spicy.

1732
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,579
By the way, this is really tasty.

1733
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,019
It's so good.

1734
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:58,750
They make food so well these days.

1735
00:56:58,889 --> 00:57:00,360
Such great ideas, you know?

1736
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,789
Ye Eun, you know
how to enjoy your sauces, don't you?

1737
00:57:03,789 --> 00:57:06,059
(The food fighter
even dips a bunch of sauce.)

1738
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:07,760
This is good.

1739
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,900
- Hey, but it's really good.
- So delicious.

1740
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:14,139
I mean,
food just keeps tasting better.

1741
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,239
(The birthday party has gotten better,
thanks to the food.)

1742
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,969
- I can't stop eating.
- It's really tasty.

1743
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:18,539
- I'm going to be so full.
- I'm on my third slice.

1744
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:21,139
- It's delicious.
- Pizza is so good.

1745
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,780
- People who work really hard...
- Right.

1746
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:28,949
Because this is really...

1747
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,920
- It's real for you.
- Hey, tell us.

1748
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,420
- It's been a while since I ate it.
- Hey.

1749
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,260
But this pizza is delicious.
Pizza is so good these days.

1750
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,489
Which slice are you on, Ye Eun?

1751
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:37,659
Her 3rd. No, her 4th slice.

1752
00:57:37,659 --> 00:57:40,059
- This is my third.
- Gosh, you're unbelievable.

1753
00:57:40,059 --> 00:57:42,199
- I had small slices.
- Are you a food fighter or what?

1754
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:44,570
Gosh, but Ye Eun,
you sure do eat well.

1755
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:47,070
Hey, when you were cooking
seaweed soup earlier, I thought...

1756
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,440
- That won't go down the toilet.
- Right.

1757
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,670
- No, it's not. Do you save up?
- Oh, you save up?

1758
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,809
- I'm sure he doesn't.
- I doubt it.

1759
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:55,780
- You can use this a lot.
- That's right.

1760
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,150
- In many ways. It's close.
- Yes, plastic takes a while.

1761
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,079
But it feels nice
when you have them sorted by color.

1762
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,449
Anyway, the uses...

1763
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:03,280
At least, since it has been made...

1764
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,590
- Just the fact that it's there?
- The fact that it exists?

1765
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:06,590
(She mixes it all up and starts
eating with it in front of her.)

1766
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:08,960
That was just so touching.

1767
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:11,590
There were four.

1768
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,230
There was instant rice too.

1769
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:15,199
- There was instant rice.
- Yes, there was.

1770
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:16,360
- Really?
- Okay.

1771
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,869
- I should do that.
- Sorry.

1772
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:21,139
But I told them to put down
the camera...

1773
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:23,170
- Everything we did...
- It was for evidence...

1774
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,610
- It was almost...
- Ye Eun, I'm sorry,

1775
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:27,940
but I wanted to eat
some of that too.

1776
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,179
But you stabbed at it
so much that...

1777
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:33,550
- At first, I didn't...
- You don't like sharing food...

1778
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,880
- He's like that too. Everyone is.
- Yes, I'm like that too.

1779
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,650
- Yes, but...
- You poked at it so much.

1780
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,920
- No, the thing is...
- Actually, how should I put this?

1781
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,460
I feel a little weird to eat it now.

1782
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,460
No, you may get the wrong idea.

1783
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:48,159
But I only touched this part...
I didn't slurp my entire fork.

1784
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:51,199
- What are you talking about?
- It's fine. Good job. Just eat it.

1785
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,639
- Ye Eun, can I have the wet wipes?
- Why didn't you share?

1786
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:56,039
- The wet wipes?
- Oh, this is good.

1787
00:58:56,039 --> 00:58:57,269
(The wet wipes appear.)

1788
00:58:57,269 --> 00:58:58,739
The basil is so strong.

1789
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,179
You brought a really big packet
of wet wipes.

1790
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:05,849
Jong Kook had a really hard time
with the plastic bags...

1791
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:07,750
- He barely just calmed down.
- He had to bid them farewell.

1792
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,079
He finally calmed down
about the plastic bags.

1793
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,190
Don't send over things
that are too thick.

1794
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:14,090
- But this is kind of therapeutic.
- I know, right?

1795
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:16,159
- Yes, it's therapeutic to let go.
- Right?

1796
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:17,659
(Kim Bag has learned
how to let things go.)

1797
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:18,989
- The plastic bags...
- Do you feel good...

1798
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:20,059
when you gather them by color?

1799
00:59:20,059 --> 00:59:21,300
No, it's not like that.

1800
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,260
- No, I don't feel that way.
- Jong Kook is...

1801
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:25,469
- It's like that sometimes.
- But you know...

1802
00:59:25,469 --> 00:59:27,400
- You totally do that.
- But back then,

1803
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,769
- I didn't understand that stuff.
- Oh, really?

1804
00:59:29,769 --> 00:59:32,309
- But you know, Ji Hyo...
- Hey.

1805
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:35,610
- This is too little.
- I don't say this normally.

1806
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,380
- Right, this stuff is...
- Ji Hyo.

1807
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,449
It's not just me.
Haha and Jong Kook have that too.

1808
00:59:40,449 --> 00:59:42,820
- We all do.
- Jong Kook. And Jae Seok too.

1809
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,590
- Jae Seok does too.
- Jong Kook.

1810
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:45,590
- Even without the camera...
- I'm drinking from the bottle,

1811
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:46,619
not a cup.

1812
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:47,920
- Good job, Jae Seok.
- Right?

1813
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,590
Actually,
using cups is frivolous too.

1814
00:59:50,929 --> 00:59:53,190
- Why is that being frivolous?
- It is.

1815
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,599
- It's just a basic part of life.
- Because of doing dishes. Water.

1816
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:57,900
- Because if you pour this,
- Right.

1817
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,400
- you have to wash them all.
- I understand.

1818
01:00:00,469 --> 01:00:02,500
Then, you use dish soap...

1819
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,510
- That's right.
- That's why I'm drinking from this.

1820
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:07,139
- You have to use water too.
- I'm saving one for the Earth.

1821
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,309
Jong Kook, then...

1822
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,980
Go do it at Yangjaecheon.

1823
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,980
- Go do it at Yangjaecheon.
- Hey.

1824
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,719
That's dirty, punk.
That's not even clean...

1825
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:18,050
- Hey.
- Just put it in a basket...

1826
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:19,690
- and wash it.
- You're being ridiculous.

1827
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:21,059
Wash it in a basket
if you think you're wasting water.

1828
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:23,090
- Gosh, you're going overboard.
- What is this? Are you mocking me?

1829
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:24,690
Gosh, no!

1830
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:26,960
- Hey.
- Yangjaecheon.

1831
01:00:27,699 --> 01:00:28,900
- You should leave!
- Are you insane?

1832
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:32,099
- "Are you insane?"
- "Are you insane?"

1833
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:33,329
To get to Yangjaecheon from here,

1834
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:36,440
I'd have to spend so much on gas.

1835
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:38,710
I'd have to spend so much on gas.

1836
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:42,280
(Kim Bag's frugal mindset is
hard to catch up with.)

1837
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,309
Yangjaecheon...

1838
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:46,010
- That's utter nonsense.
- That's so funny.

1839
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:50,590
- Since it's Seok Jin's birthday...
- Right.

1840
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:52,449
Stop talking about my birthday.

1841
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:54,090
You brought it up so many times.

1842
01:00:54,519 --> 01:00:56,289
- Stop it. Seriously.
- Jae Seok,

1843
01:00:56,289 --> 01:00:58,389
why did you take another wet wipe
when you had one out already?

1844
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:01,230
For goodness' sake.
You were wrong to do that.

1845
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,400
- Why did you do that?
- I don't understand.

1846
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,570
He was using this wet wipe.
It's clean.

1847
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:07,000
There's nothing on it.

1848
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:09,039
Why did he get another one?
For goodness' sake.

1849
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:11,139
- Jae Seok.
- Why did he get another one?

1850
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:13,909
If you want to wash your hands,
run over to Yangjaecheon.

1851
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,280
You know,

1852
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,110
the old one is a bit dark
since I used it.

1853
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:20,280
- It isn't dark.
- It depends on the taste, but...

1854
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,519
- You can wash it.
- Look at me.

1855
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:22,780
Ji Hyo and I...

1856
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:25,289
- are sharing a wet wipe.
- We're sharing it.

1857
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:29,289
After wiping your hands lightly,
you added it to the other one.

1858
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:31,630
The fact that he was watching
everything...

1859
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:33,489
- gave me goosebumps.
- I don't understand.

1860
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:36,829
- He was watching.
- Think about the flow of things.

1861
01:01:36,829 --> 01:01:38,369
One chapter has ended.

1862
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:40,469
Don't be ridiculous, Jae Seok.

1863
01:01:41,769 --> 01:01:43,170
Jae Seok.

1864
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:45,539
Now, we'll have a mission...

1865
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:48,539
- for the items you talked about.
- Let's do that.

1866
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:50,510
- All right.
- Let's go.

1867
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:51,710
I'm so full.

1868
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:57,550
There are prizes
Jong Kook handpicked.

1869
01:01:57,619 --> 01:01:58,619
There are a lot of items.

1870
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:00,889
- The original plan was seven.
- There are a lot of items.

1871
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:04,690
(Dior shoes from Bo Pil)

1872
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:07,500
(The prize that's number 1
for Seok Jin)

1873
01:02:07,929 --> 01:02:11,230
(Yeezy slippers)

1874
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:14,340
They're perfect.
They're perfect for me.

1875
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:16,599
(Stussy sweatshirt)

1876
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,309
- I like big sizes.
- It's big for me too.

1877
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:19,809
- I like big sizes.
- She wants it.

1878
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:25,610
(A new coffee machine
that hasn't been used)

1879
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:30,179
(A pile of socks
Jae Seok went crazy about)

1880
01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:33,320
(Stussy T-shirt
for people who love black)

1881
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:35,889
(Bose headset, Beats Solo headset)

1882
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:39,159
(Polo hat)

1883
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:45,769
(Yeezy Boost sneakers)

1884
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:48,099
Seok Jin, you look
ten years younger.

1885
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:49,539
Let's keep them there.

1886
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:52,940
We'll proceed with the mission,
Unite Before the Prizes.

1887
01:02:53,309 --> 01:02:54,980
You'll attempt a group mission.

1888
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,780
Every time you fail,
an item will be taken out.

1889
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:00,579
(Every time they fail,
an item will be taken out.)

1890
01:03:00,579 --> 01:03:03,119
- Oh, no.
- After the last round,

1891
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:05,250
you'll pick the members
by lottery...

1892
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,989
for the remaining prizes.

1893
01:03:08,019 --> 01:03:10,260
- Seriously.
- I'll cry. I want all the prizes.

1894
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:11,489
First come, first served?

1895
01:03:11,489 --> 01:03:14,829
For Jong Kook
who opened his house for filming,

1896
01:03:14,829 --> 01:03:18,099
- we prepared a separate prize.
- For me?

1897
01:03:18,099 --> 01:03:21,500
Yes. We'll give you a chance
to win it at the end.

1898
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,940
That sounds nice.

1899
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:24,869
- Jong Kook should get something.
- Yes.

1900
01:03:24,909 --> 01:03:26,469
You'll get the mission right away.

1901
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,880
For this mission, you'll take turns
to look at a photo on the screen...

1902
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,980
- and say the answer.
- It'll be hard.

1903
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:34,880
If it's a photo, say the name.

1904
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,119
- If it's an idiom,
- I'm good with names.

1905
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:38,349
- fill in the blank.
- It'll be hard.

1906
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:39,989
If it's a four-character idiom,

1907
01:03:39,989 --> 01:03:42,190
- say the first two syllables.
- It'll be hard.

1908
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,260
It'll be hard.

1909
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,389
Previously, your attempt failed...

1910
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:47,500
as soon as a member
answered incorrectly.

1911
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,730
Now, you can try...

1912
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:52,530
until your answer is correct.

1913
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,539
However, each member...

1914
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,940
must answer seven questions
to move on to the next one.

1915
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:00,139
(Each member must answer 7 questions
to move on to the next one.)

1916
01:04:00,139 --> 01:04:01,679
- Seven per person?
- That's a lot.

1917
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:02,739
- It makes no sense.
- In...

1918
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:05,650
In 3 minutes, every member
must answer 7 questions each.

1919
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:08,280
- So you must answer 49 questions.
- That's insane.

1920
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,280
That's a lot.

1921
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,920
- Isn't that CSAT?
- That's a lot.

1922
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:14,590
(There will be 6 rounds in total.
Each failure will cost a present.)

1923
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,789
- People who are good should go 1st.
- They should go 1st.

1924
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:19,059
- What if we get stuck later?
- They won't do.

1925
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:21,030
Empty Heads should be in between.

1926
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:22,300
- They should be mixed in.
- Yes.

1927
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,800
- Come between these two.
- You should do that.

1928
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,130
- Should I go last?
- Yes.

1929
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,440
Jae Seok, go last.

1930
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,099
We shouldn't sit side by side.

1931
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,139
- We shouldn't sit side by side.
- There are four Empty Heads.

1932
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:33,239
- Per person?
- Yes.

1933
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:35,510
- Let's do a cheer. One, two, three.
- Let's go.

1934
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,210
- Let's do it with seriousness.
- In three minutes.

1935
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:38,710
Get ready.

1936
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,179
- There are no failures.
- What should I do?

1937
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:41,480
- There are no failures.
- You keep going until you get...

1938
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,420
- the correct answer.
- Then it won't be hard.

1939
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:45,420
- Let's go.
- Set, go.

1940
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:47,289
Go.

1941
01:04:47,789 --> 01:04:50,019
- You know her.
- Eun Young. No. Who is she?

1942
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:51,130
Hey.

1943
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:52,659
- Choi Hyun Young.
- Incorrect.

1944
01:04:52,659 --> 01:04:53,730
- Choi Hyun...
- For goodness' sake.

1945
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,199
- Choi Hyun Young.
- Incorrect.

1946
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:56,260
- Lee Hyun Young.
- Incorrect.

1947
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,630
- For goodness' sake.
- Cha...

1948
01:04:57,630 --> 01:04:59,070
- She was on the show!
- Joo Hyun Young!

1949
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,570
- That's right.
- Correct.

1950
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,769
This actor is on "Mickey 17."

1951
01:05:02,769 --> 01:05:04,340
Robert Peterson.

1952
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:06,170
(Peterson?)

1953
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,880
- Pattinson
- Correct.

1954
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:10,179
Pyeongchang Winter Games.

1955
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:11,909
- Hodori.
- Incorrect.

1956
01:05:12,849 --> 01:05:14,619
(He summoned Hodori,
a mascot from 1988.)

1957
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:17,150
Hodori was
from the 1988 Summer Games.

1958
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:18,289
Who's that?

1959
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,590
I don't know. Isn't it a tiger?

1960
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:22,019
- Who's this? Who are you?
- The 1988 Summer Games.

1961
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:23,590
- Who's that?
- He's asking, "Who's this?"

1962
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:25,760
- Hold on. White tiger.
- He's asking, "Who's this?"

1963
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,760
- Incorrect.
- Jong Kook.

1964
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,860
Pyeongchangi.

1965
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,630
- Pyeongchang Baekdoli.
- Incorrect.

1966
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:30,699
Pyeongchang...

1967
01:05:30,699 --> 01:05:32,130
Pyeongchang Baekdoli...

1968
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,369
- sounds like a pool player's name.
- What was the name?

1969
01:05:34,369 --> 01:05:35,969
- Who are you, punk?
- What was the name?

1970
01:05:35,969 --> 01:05:37,199
- What was the name?
- Not Hodori.

1971
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:38,210
- What was the name?
- A mascot.

1972
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:39,739
I only know about Hodori.
Who's this?

1973
01:05:39,739 --> 01:05:40,980
- Is this...
- Hold on.

1974
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,210
- I don't know this character.
- It has a name.

1975
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:45,110
(The mascots of the 2018
Pyeongchang Winter Games)

1976
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:47,719
(Soohorang and Bandabi)

1977
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,780
- It's so hard.
- Pyeongchangi.

1978
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:50,949
- Pyeongchangi.
- Pyeongchangi.

1979
01:05:50,949 --> 01:05:53,289
I'll give you a hint.
It ends with "Rang."

1980
01:05:53,289 --> 01:05:54,760
- Horangi.
- One minute has passed.

1981
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:55,860
Haerangi.

1982
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,260
Homulang? No, that's...

1983
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,590
Homulang?

1984
01:05:58,929 --> 01:06:00,929
- That's a restaurant.
- Pyeong...

1985
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:02,699
Pyeongchang Winter Games.
Pyeongchangrang.

1986
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:04,369
It ends with "Rang?"

1987
01:06:04,369 --> 01:06:05,900

01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:42,939
- Don't you know her?
- One minute passed.

2155
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:43,979
The tall one.

2156
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:45,380
- It's her, right?
- Yes. She's an actress.

2157
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,479
- She was here.
- She was here.

2158
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:48,319
- I don't know her name.
- She visited a few times.

2159
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,550
(He called Sae Rok's name
many times.)

2160
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:51,890
What was her name?

2161
01:10:51,949 --> 01:10:52,949
You just need her last name.

2162
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:54,890
You'll get it
as long as you get her last name.

2163
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,060
Her last name is unique.

2164
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,060
- Right?
- Yes.

2165
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,930
(Did he finally remember?)

2166
01:10:58,989 --> 01:11:00,159
- All right.
- Isn't her last name Maeng?

2167
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:01,800
No, her last name isn't Maeng.

2168
01:11:01,899 --> 01:11:03,960
(She isn't Maeng Sae Rok.)

2169
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,970
Her last name is unique.

2170
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,100
- Is her last name unique?
- Yes.

2171
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:09,039
- So... Su...
- You're nearly Thee.

2172
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:11,340
- Please.
- Sang... Son...

2173
01:11:11,369 --> 01:11:13,439
- Geun? Gu?
- All right.

2174
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:15,579
- it's similar.
- Is it Geun?

2175
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:16,739
No, keep going.

2176
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:17,810
Gul... Gum...

2177
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:19,109
- No.
- Keum Sae Rok!

2178
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:20,350
- That's right.
- Yes.

2179
01:11:20,649 --> 01:11:22,920
(He spent 40 seconds
on recognizing Sae Rok.)

2180
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,050
Who's that? Hani's dad.

2181
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:25,449
- Don't you know the character?
- The name.

2182
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:27,989
- Hani's dad. Mr. Something.
- Don't you know the character? Hey.

2183
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:29,819
- Hey.
- He's Mr. Something.

2184
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:32,529
- Come on.
- Choi Cheol Gu.

2185
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:34,630
- Be quiet.
- Come on.

2186
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:36,000
What's this?

2187
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,430
- Hani's dad.
- No.

2188
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,970
The character with thick lips
always calls him.

2189
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:41,670
- Hong Du Kke!
- Correct.

2190
01:11:42,069 --> 01:11:43,970
A life's dream is unification.

2191
01:11:45,609 --> 01:11:47,369
- It's a three-syllable word.
- Is that so?

2192
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:49,880
- "A life's dream is my dream?"
- A life's dream is... What?

2193
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,479
- A life's dream is... What?
- What is it?

2194
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:53,949
We had this question on Running Man.

2195
01:11:53,949 --> 01:11:55,449
- A life's dream is...
- "My dream."

2196
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,720
(A life's dream is "Blank.")

2197
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:59,489
(They had the exact same question!)

2198
01:11:59,489 --> 01:12:02,020
(Jong Kook's answer was...)

2199
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:04,890
("White rice.")

2200
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:07,390
(It's a kind of rice.
But it isn't "Such-and-such rice.")

2201
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:08,859
(Let me answer! Nurungji!)

2202
01:12:08,899 --> 01:12:11,470
(Se Chan got the answer,
"Nurungji.")

2203
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,529
What is it? A life's dream is...

2204
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:14,569
(Will he be able to remember?)

2205
01:12:14,569 --> 01:12:15,600
What? A life's dream is...

2206
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,270
We gave you the same hint back then.

2207
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:18,640
- Really?
- It's a kind of rice.

2208
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,670
- What?
- Rice?

2209
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,810
(A life's wish is nurungji.)

2210
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:22,880
White rice?

2211
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,649
- No.
- A life's dream is...

2212
01:12:24,649 --> 01:12:25,779
- Barley rice?
- Incorrect.

2213
01:12:25,779 --> 01:12:27,380
- Brown rice?
- Rice.

2214
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:28,880
- No.
- Meat soup.

2215
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,449
- Did we have this question?
- Yes, we did.

2216
01:12:30,449 --> 01:12:32,649
- A life's dream is...
- Is it a four-character idiom?

2217
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:34,390
What is it? Nurungji?

2218
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,619
- Correct.
- Really?

2219
01:12:35,619 --> 01:12:36,789
Don't give him hints, Haha.

2220
01:12:36,789 --> 01:12:38,060
Ohtani Shohei.

2221
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:39,590
- Correct.
- He answered all questions.

2222
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:41,159
- All right.
- Next.

2223
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:43,600
That one. Kang Han Na.

2224
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,970
- It's my first time seeing her.
- Really? Is that Han Na?

2225
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:47,170
- Good.
- Really? Is that Han Na?

2226
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:49,439
That one. You spin it
to the jajinmori rhythm.

2227
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,470
You spin it.

2228
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:52,510
(3 minutes are up.)

2229
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:54,140
- For goodness' sake.
- Three minutes are up.

2230
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:55,880
- What's that?
- Sangmo.

2231
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,539
- Three minutes for all of us?
- Yes.

2232
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,279
- Gosh, this is...
- People who are good...

2233
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:00,409
- need to go first.
- This won't do.

2234
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:01,680
- T-shirt.
- Take out the T-shirt.

2235
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,220
- Take out the coffee machine.
- We chose the T-shirt.

2236
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:04,819
- The T-shirt.
- Next time.

2237
01:13:04,819 --> 01:13:05,890
- Take it out.
- Here.

2238
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:06,890
- Jae Seok.
- Do you want to go?

2239
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:08,520
People who are good should go first.

2240
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,060
People who are good should go first.
This won't do.

2241
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:11,529
Let's work fast at first.

2242
01:13:11,529 --> 01:13:12,529
I'll give it a go.

2243
01:13:12,529 --> 01:13:14,229
- We need to save time first.
- This won't do.

2244
01:13:14,229 --> 01:13:15,699
- Have Ji Hyo go second.
- Okay.

2245
01:13:15,699 --> 01:13:17,430
- Ji Hyo, go second.
- Ji Hyo, come here.

2246
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:19,569
- What will you do?
- Sit here.

2247
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:20,899
We can't lose all the items.

2248
01:13:20,899 --> 01:13:23,039
- I don't know.
- Three minutes is too much.

2249
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:24,369
- Let's do this.
- Let's do a cheer.

2250
01:13:24,369 --> 01:13:26,239
- One, two, three. Let's go.
- One, two, three. Let's go.

2251
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:28,109
- Get ready.
- Three sets.

2252
01:13:28,109 --> 01:13:30,310
Set, go.

2253
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:33,449
- You know him.
- Of course, I do.

2254
01:13:33,479 --> 01:13:34,979
- You know him.
- Wait. I suddenly don't remember.

2255
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:36,750
- Of course, I do.
- You know him.

2256
01:13:36,819 --> 01:13:38,149
Wait. I suddenly don't remember.

2257
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:39,890
- I mean...
- I saw him.

2258
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:41,119
That's right.
He was on "You Quiz on the Block."

2259
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,619
- Hold on. We're very close.
- Do you really not know him?

2260
01:13:43,689 --> 01:13:45,659
- I do. I just don't remember.
- The king of "League of Legends."

2261
01:13:45,729 --> 01:13:47,899
- Hold on.
- How do you not know him?

2262
01:13:47,899 --> 01:13:49,199
I know him very well.

2263
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,960
Hold on.

2264
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:52,800
- Jae Seok.
- How do you not know him?

2265
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,770
- I know him very well.
- You're in trouble now.

2266
01:13:54,899 --> 01:13:57,239
- Let's leave him be.
- Leave him be.

2267
01:13:57,239 --> 01:13:58,640
- Let him get into trouble.
- Leave him be.

2268
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,939
Leave him be. Don't tell him.

2269
01:13:59,939 --> 01:14:01,510
(Jae Seok faces the biggest crisis.)

2270
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:03,609
- We're very close. Faker.
- Jae Seok.

2271
01:14:03,609 --> 01:14:04,949
- That's right.
- For goodness' sake.

2272
01:14:04,979 --> 01:14:06,579
(It took him 30 seconds
to get Fake right!)

2273
01:14:06,579 --> 01:14:08,819
- All spin and no substance.
- Correct.

2274
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:10,319
- Taoist Lettuce.
- Correct.

2275
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,350
- My honey.
- "My honey?"

2276
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:14,119
"My honey?"

2277
01:14:14,619 --> 01:14:16,760
- Haengnam jagi.
- Haengnam jagi.

2278
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:18,359
What goes in the blank?

2279
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:20,329
- Japojagi.
- Correct.

2280
01:14:20,329 --> 01:14:21,460
- Good.
- Agijagi.

2281
01:14:21,899 --> 01:14:23,130
Hold on. He's...

2282
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,930
- Steven.
- It's easy.

2283
01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:26,470
- Jobs.
- There you go.

2284
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:27,470
There you go.

2285
01:14:27,699 --> 01:14:29,539
- Steven Yeun.
- Correct.

2286
01:14:30,039 --> 01:14:31,609
- Hold on. You Jung.
- Who is she?

2287
01:14:31,609 --> 01:14:32,909
- Correct.
- Who's You Jung?

2288
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:35,140
Not blueberries.
What were they called?

2289
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:36,380
- Say it in Korean.
- Say it in Korean.

2290
01:14:36,409 --> 01:14:37,579
- Raspberries.
- Correct.

2291
01:14:37,579 --> 01:14:38,850
- That's right.
- Next.

2292
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:41,319
(Jae Seok used 1 minute by himself.)

2293
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:43,380
- You know her.
- Song...

2294
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,149
That's right.

2295
01:14:45,149 --> 01:14:46,289
- Song...
- Song Ji Hyo.

2296
01:14:46,289 --> 01:14:47,920
Song... Song Ga Yeon.

2297
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:49,260
- No.
- Incorrect.

2298
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,789
- The last syllable.
- No.

2299
01:14:50,789 --> 01:14:53,659
- Song Ga... Song Ga Young?
- Come on.

2300
01:14:53,659 --> 01:14:55,560
- Leave her be.
- You can't help her.

2301
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,260
- What comes after "Song Ga?"
- Song Ga In.

2302
01:14:57,729 --> 01:14:58,729
Correct.

2303
01:14:58,729 --> 01:15:00,729
- A stethoscope.
- That's good.

2304
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,539
(Another mascot appears.)

2305
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:05,210
My goodness. A bear. A brown bear.

2306
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,510
- No.
- A black bear.

2307
01:15:06,569 --> 01:15:07,880
- What should we do?
- Gomdori.

2308
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,979
- It's a character.
- It's over.

2309
01:15:08,979 --> 01:15:10,739
- Pyeongchang bear.
- Come on.

2310
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:11,850
(She'll say all sorts of bears.)

2311
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:13,750
- It's on its chest.
- What's that?

2312
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:15,149
- On its chest...
- A star bear.

2313
01:15:15,149 --> 01:15:16,649
Look above the star.

2314
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:17,750
- Asian black bear.
- Yes.

2315
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,590
- Pyeongchang bear. Bangomi.
- No.

2316
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:20,750
- Gombami.
- Come on.

2317
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:22,289
- Gomdori. Bangomi.
- You're nearly there.

2318
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,159
- An Asian black bear.
- Black...

2319
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,789
What kind of a bear is it?

2320
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:27,789
- What kind of a bear is it?
- A black bear.

2321
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:29,460
You said it earlier.
What kind of a bear is it?

2322
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:31,000
An Asian black bear.

2323
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,470
Give it a human name.

2324
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:33,800
- Jae Seok.
- Bandali.

2325
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,270
- Incorrect.
- Is it incorrect?

2326
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:36,470
- Is it incorrect?
- Isn't it Bandali?

2327
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:37,600
What is it then?

2328
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,970
Ban... Bandabi?

2329
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:41,739
- Correct.
- It was too hard.

2330
01:15:41,779 --> 01:15:42,880
- All right.
- "Blank" budong"

2331
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,680
- It's easy.
- What budong?

2332
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,279
(Think of a toothpick.)

2333
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:49,579
- Tooth budong?
- Incorrect.

2334
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,689
Three minutes have passed.

2335
01:15:51,689 --> 01:15:52,949
Isn't it "Yojibudong?"

2336
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:54,890
- Ji Hyo struggled so much.
- Yoji.

2337
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,789
- This won't do. Let me try it.
- Ji Hyo struggled so much.

2338
01:15:56,789 --> 01:15:58,260
- Go.
- No.

2339
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,260
- Those who haven't gone.
- No, Seok Jin.

2340
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,060
The ones who know should go first.

2341
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:04,260
- The questions...
- The possibility fell.

2342
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:05,470
Let's go to the back.

2343
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:07,399
- People who go first...
- Take out an item.

2344
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:09,470
Let's do that.

2345
01:16:09,869 --> 01:16:11,069
- Shoes.
- Ye Eun needs to go.

2346
01:16:11,069 --> 01:16:12,609
- Ye Eun, go 2nd.
- Yes, go 2nd.

2347
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:14,210
One of the two.
Shall we take out this one?

2348
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:16,539
- Take it out.
- Not many items remain.

2349
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:18,779
- There's nothing for me.
- This time,

2350
01:16:18,779 --> 01:16:20,550
we'll give you four minutes.

2351
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:22,149
- It's hard.
- We need four minutes.

2352
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:24,479
- Two people finished in a minute.
- That's right.

2353
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:28,689
(The knowledgeable man,
Seok Jin is the first one!)

2354
01:16:28,689 --> 01:16:30,720
- All right.
- Four minutes.

2355
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,359
(Will they succeed in it this time?)

2356
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:33,930
Set, go.

2357
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,060
- A single-log bridge.
- Correct.

2358
01:16:37,329 --> 01:16:38,699
- You know him.
- You know him.

2359
01:16:39,229 --> 01:16:40,500
He uses headers.

2360
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,500
- He's abroad.
- His name contains "Gue."

2361
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,539
I'm in trouble. What should I do?

2362
01:16:42,539 --> 01:16:43,699
Seok Jin.

2363
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:46,739
His name contains "Gue."
I'm in trouble. What should I do?

2364
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:48,739
- I'm done for.
- Sae Ho's father.

2365
01:16:48,739 --> 01:16:50,340
He has the name of Sae Ho's dad.

2366
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,510
I don't know his dad's name.

2367
01:16:52,579 --> 01:16:54,250
- It gives you the last name.
- The last name.

2368
01:16:54,449 --> 01:16:57,079
(He now has "Cho" and "Gue.")

2369
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:58,250
Cho Gue Taek?

2370
01:16:58,250 --> 01:16:59,250
No.

2371
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:01,659
- Cho Gue Chan.
- No.

2372
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,960
- Are you serious?
- Cho.

2373
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,220
I don't remember.

2374
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,890
- Cho Min Gue.
- No.

2375
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:07,689
- Cho Chan Gue.
- No.

2376
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,029
Cho...

2377
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:11,699
- You're nearly there.
- Don't give him the answer.

2378
01:17:11,699 --> 01:17:13,029
- It's over.
- Cho Chan Gue.

2379
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:15,239
- All right.
- How do you not know?

2380
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:16,470
- Cho...
- I'll end you...

2381
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:19,170
- if you use up all four minutes.
- Cho Taek Gue.

2382
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:21,170
- We're ruined.
- Taek Gue?

2383
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:23,239
- Cho Sang Gue.
- We're ruined.

2384
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,449
Isn't it Cho Sang Gue? Cho Seon Gue.

2385
01:17:25,449 --> 01:17:26,609
- We're ruined.
- We're done.

2386
01:17:26,609 --> 01:17:28,720
- I'm so sorry.
- We're ruined.

2387
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,880
Cho Yeon Gyu.

2388
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,590
- Why don't you know?
- Gue...

2389
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:33,449
- Change the position of Gue.
- What?

2390
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:34,890
- Cho Gue Sang?
- I mean...

2391
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:36,520
- Soccer.
- Cho Gue Sung.

2392
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,689
- Correct.
- Is it correct?

2393
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:39,890
(He has only solved two questions.)

2394
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:40,890
What's wrong with him?

2395
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:43,829
- Gyeoljahaeji.
- Correct.

2396
01:17:43,829 --> 01:17:45,069
- It was so funny.
- Correct.

2397
01:17:46,069 --> 01:17:47,430
- It's easy.
- Flamingo.

2398
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:48,699
- Correct.
- Is it correct?

2399
01:17:48,699 --> 01:17:50,100
- Robot Taekwon V.
- Correct.

2400
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,300
- It's so funny.
- I don't know that one.

2401
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:53,140
Who is this one?

2402
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:55,579
(Who is she?)

2403
01:17:55,579 --> 01:17:57,640
- It's a profile photo.
- She visited many times.

2404
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,079
- She visited the show many times.
- It's a profile photo.

2405
01:17:59,079 --> 01:18:00,449
Kang Han Na.

2406
01:18:00,449 --> 01:18:01,520
- Incorrect.
- Really?

2407
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,149
- It's Han Na's face.
- No.

2408
01:18:03,149 --> 01:18:04,989
- Kang Han Na.
- Don't you recognize her?

2409
01:18:04,989 --> 01:18:06,189
- I don't know her.
- You met her.

2410
01:18:06,189 --> 01:18:07,789
- I haven't seen her before.
- Seok Jin.

2411
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,289
I haven't seen her before.

2412
01:18:09,289 --> 01:18:11,289
You're supposed to know this.

2413
01:18:11,659 --> 01:18:13,260
Choose someone
who was on Running Man.

2414
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:14,289
It's a pretty photo.

2415
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:15,529
She visited Running Man often
in the beginning.

2416
01:18:15,529 --> 01:18:17,300
Lee Mi Seon?

2417
01:18:18,229 --> 01:18:20,300
- Cho...
- Please.

2418
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,340
"Lee Mi Seon?"

2419
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,270
- Please.
- She's close to Kwang Soo.

2420
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:26,010
An Su Yeong?

2421
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,279
Hwang Hui Seon.

2422
01:18:28,279 --> 01:18:29,939
(Hwang Hui Seon!)

2423
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:31,779
(Laughing)

2424
01:18:31,779 --> 01:18:33,310
- Give him the last name.
- Give him the last name.

2425
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:34,609
- Park.
- That's right.

2426
01:18:34,649 --> 01:18:35,750
- What?
- Park.

2427
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:37,279
- But...
- Park Sun Young?

2428
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:39,649
Seok Jin, that sounds similar.

2429
01:18:39,689 --> 01:18:41,149
- Park?
- Do you see anything?

2430
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:42,319
- Seok Jin.
- Park Ka Hi.

2431
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:43,659
You're making many mistakes.

2432
01:18:43,659 --> 01:18:44,659
But...

2433
01:18:44,789 --> 01:18:46,329
- Park Bo Young.
- Correct.

2434
01:18:46,329 --> 01:18:47,489
- Yes.
- Why does she look like that?

2435
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,100
(He answers correctly
with 1 minute remaining.)

2436
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,300
- Yes.
- Why does she look like that?

2437
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,770
You should recognize Bo Young.

2438
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:52,869
Who's this man?

2439
01:18:52,869 --> 01:18:54,029
"La La Land."

2440
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:56,100
"La La Land." Chris Park.

2441
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,439
I don't know.

2442
01:18:57,439 --> 01:18:58,939
I don't know either.
I don't know the foreigners.

2443
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:00,510
How am I supposed to know him?

2444
01:19:00,510 --> 01:19:02,579
He doesn't know me, right?

2445
01:19:02,579 --> 01:19:03,640
- Of course not.
- I don't know either.

2446
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:06,079
- Jason...
- His name is Ryan.

2447
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:07,250
Lion King.

2448
01:19:09,279 --> 01:19:10,680
He's saying whatever he wants.

2449
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:12,649
- I'm sorry.
- Seriously.

2450
01:19:12,649 --> 01:19:13,850
- Ryan.
- Ryan.

2451
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:15,659
- The rice is very...
- Ryan.

2452
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,260
- Ryan.
- The rice is very...

2453
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:19,630
Rice... Ryan Charles?

2454
01:19:20,329 --> 01:19:22,500
- Ryan Charles? Like "Sticky?"
- Is it sticky rice?

2455
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,729
Is it sticky rice.

2456
01:19:23,729 --> 01:19:25,130
We won't succeed in it
even if we have ten minutes.

2457
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:26,130
(Time's up when they talk
about sticky rice.)

2458
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:27,970
- Move, Seok Jin. Move.
- I'm sorry.

2459
01:19:28,069 --> 01:19:29,199
- I'll leave.
- Come out.

2460
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:30,300
"I'll leave."

2461
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,710
We have to take Seok Jin's out.

2462
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:32,840
- Take Seok Jin's out.
- Remove one of the gifts.

2463
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:33,840
- Seok Jin, you...
- Remove Seok Jin's.

2464
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,210
- Let's remove that.
- You used all the four minutes.

2465
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:38,449
- All right.
- Will we go like this?

2466
01:19:38,449 --> 01:19:39,810
- Let's go.
- Did Se Chan go?

2467
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:41,920
- Are we starting?
- Let's quickly end this.

2468
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,149
Haha will start.

2469
01:19:43,149 --> 01:19:44,890
- The man with a lot of money.
- That's right.

2470
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:46,220
- That's right. It's him.
- The rich man.

2471
01:19:46,289 --> 01:19:48,189
- Name all the rich men.
- Name them all.

2472
01:19:48,189 --> 01:19:49,390
Name all the rich people you know.

2473
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:51,930
- Yu Jae Seok.
- No.

2474
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:52,960
He looks like you.

2475
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:54,390
Michael Jackson.

2476
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:56,960
- That's...
- He's El...

2477
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:57,960
Elizabeth.

2478
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,130
- No.
- No.

2479
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:00,430
Who is he? He's an astronaut.

2480
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:02,939
- Right. Who would it be?
- He went to the moon.

2481
01:20:02,939 --> 01:20:04,500
Darling... William?

2482
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,069
There are a few people
with similar names.

2483
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,479
- He's not William Darling.
- He's...

2484
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:10,579
All the gifts are gone.

2485
01:20:10,579 --> 01:20:12,109
We won't be able to take
anything at this rate.

2486
01:20:12,109 --> 01:20:13,250
(There are only 5 items left.)

2487
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:15,850
They'll all be gone.
We won't get any prize.

2488
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:17,680
We won't be able to take anything.

2489
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,220
We really won't be able
to take anything.

2490
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:21,689
Then we'll change it
so you answer three questions.

2491
01:20:21,689 --> 01:20:23,359
- Okay.
- That's good.

2492
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:24,930
- We can do that.
- Let's do this.

2493
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:26,130
I'll just sit here.

2494
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:28,329
I just hope there are no mascots
or idols.

2495
01:20:28,329 --> 01:20:29,329
Come out.

2496
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:31,770
We have to win this round
and take these.

2497
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:33,000
- It's not easy.
- It drives you crazy...

2498
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,229
when you get stuck.

2499
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:35,270
It drives me crazy.

2500
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:36,270
- Let's do this.
- Okay!

2501
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:37,640
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2502
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:38,640
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2503
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,569
- Three each.
- Ready,

2504
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:42,109
go!

2505
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:44,739
- Hai Jin. Yoo Hai Jin.
- Correct.

2506
01:20:45,579 --> 01:20:46,609
- A slide.
- Correct.

2507
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:47,680
This is an easy one. Nervousness.

2508
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,180
- It's easy.
- Let's go.

2509
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:51,079
(Jae Seok is done in 6 seconds.)

2510
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:52,819
You get slapped in Jongno...

2511
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,750
Where?

2512
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,920
- You get slapped in Jongno...
- Where? Name any place.

2513
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,689
- Eulji-ro...
- No.

2514
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:00,989
You glare at someone in Gangnam.

2515
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:02,029
- Gangnam?
- Incorrect.

2516
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:03,560
- It's closer.
- You get slapped in Jongno...

2517
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,130
- And...
- And...

2518
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:07,670
- then glare at someone in Seongsu.
- Wait.

2519
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:09,670
Seongsu is popular.

2520
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:10,840
Are you going to name all the towns?

2521
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:11,970
- Seongsu is popular.
- You get slapped in Jongno...

2522
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:12,970
- So...
- The place with good ramyeon.

2523
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:15,109
It's not Yangjaecheon.

2524
01:21:15,109 --> 01:21:16,380
The place with good ramyeon.

2525
01:21:17,079 --> 01:21:18,279
Wait.

2526
01:21:18,279 --> 01:21:20,409
- In Gangseo.
- No.

2527
01:21:20,449 --> 01:21:21,979
She's naming all the places.

2528
01:21:21,979 --> 01:21:23,850
- Are you going to name them all?
- It has "river."

2529
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:25,220
- It has "river."
- And you glare at someone...

2530
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:26,819
- by the Han River.
- Correct.

2531
01:21:27,619 --> 01:21:28,789
We did him before.

2532
01:21:28,789 --> 01:21:30,090
- You know him.
- Ji Hyo.

2533
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:31,829
- He's...
- Me.

2534
01:21:31,829 --> 01:21:33,829
- Right. You know him.
- Ji Hyo.

2535
01:21:33,829 --> 01:21:34,859
He's...

2536
01:21:34,859 --> 01:21:35,960
- Me.
- Right.

2537
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,100
Give me the first syllable.

2538
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,159
Don't doze.

2539
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,470
Giorgio Armani?

2540
01:21:40,869 --> 01:21:43,069
(Giorgio Armani?)

2541
01:21:43,069 --> 01:21:44,239
- Incorrect.
- Three syllables.

2542
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:45,439
Seriously.

2543
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:47,609
Are you sleeping? Are you dozing?

2544
01:21:47,609 --> 01:21:49,180
- Dozing...
- Johnny Depp.

2545
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:50,409
- Good job.
- Correct.

2546
01:21:50,409 --> 01:21:51,880
- Next.
- Jang Na Ra.

2547
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:52,909
- What a relief.
- Yes.

2548
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:54,550
- That was Jang Na Ra?
- Yes. It was Na Ra.

2549
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:56,350
- Michol.
- Correct.

2550
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:58,180
The bear does the tricks and...

2551
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,850
- What?
- Who takes the money?

2552
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:02,720
- The owner takes the money?
- Correct.

2553
01:22:02,859 --> 01:22:04,460
- What? Who is it?
- He came here.

2554
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:05,659
- He came here.
- Who is it?

2555
01:22:05,659 --> 01:22:06,829
Seventeen.

2556
01:22:06,829 --> 01:22:08,600
Who is it from Seventeen? Hoshi?

2557
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,729
- Right.
- Hoshi?

2558
01:22:09,729 --> 01:22:10,859
- Correct.
- Right. That's correct.

2559
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:12,670
- Next. Jee Seok Jin.
- Who is that?

2560
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:14,829
- I'm in trouble.
- Who is that?

2561
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:18,170
I'm in trouble. Who is she?
Why are her lips so thick?

2562
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:20,609
Hold on. Who is she? She's...

2563
01:22:20,609 --> 01:22:24,279
Who is she?
I've never seen her before.

2564
01:22:24,279 --> 01:22:27,279
Where did I see her?
Did she do something to her lips?

2565
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:28,520
Is there a piercing?

2566
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,479
- I'm Haha.
- Haha.

2567
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:32,750
(Haha's mate, Skull)

2568
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,850
- Be quiet.
- Huhhuh?

2569
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:35,989
(Huhhuh?)

2570
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,390
Hustler? Who is she?

2571
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:39,989
I'm Haha, and she's Huhhuh.

2572
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:42,630
- I'm Haha, and she's Huhhuh.
- I've never seen her before.

2573
01:22:42,829 --> 01:22:44,659
- I'm...
- The first letter is an "S."

2574
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:45,970
- Right.
- Scarlett Johansson.

2575
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:47,829
- Right.
- Her face...

2576
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:49,199
- A fly swatter.
- Correct.

2577
01:22:49,699 --> 01:22:51,069
- A pear drops as a crow flies.
- Good.

2578
01:22:51,069 --> 01:22:52,970
- Next.
- Why am I last?

2579
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:54,239
(They have enough time.)

2580
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:55,680
- Ssaebssaeb.
- It's out.

2581
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,180
That's her boyfriend.

2582
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,609
- Yoo Hee Kwan.
- No.

2583
01:22:58,609 --> 01:22:59,649
Who's her boyfriend?

2584
01:22:59,649 --> 01:23:00,649
- Like father, like son.
- Right.

2585
01:23:00,649 --> 01:23:01,680
- Good.
- Correct.

2586
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:04,020
- Chess.
- Good.

2587
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,119
Hehe...

2588
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:06,449
- Who...
- You know him, right?

2589
01:23:06,449 --> 01:23:08,760
- He was my regular.
- Hey.

2590
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:09,890
- You don't know him?
- Hold on.

2591
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:11,060
Yoo Kyoung Pyo.

2592
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:12,489
- What?
- Lee Kyoung Pyo.

2593
01:23:12,489 --> 01:23:14,029
- No.
- Keep answering.

2594
01:23:14,029 --> 01:23:15,760
- Eun Kyoung Pyo.
- "Eun Kyoung Pyo."

2595
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,829
- Ko Kyoung Pyo.
- Correct.

2596
01:23:17,829 --> 01:23:19,529
- Ignorance is bliss.
- Correct.

2597
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:21,600
- Zolaman.
- Good.

2598
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,470
(It's Ye Eun's turn
and she has 30 seconds left!)

2599
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:27,270
- Good.
- What is that?

2600
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:29,939
- A dog.
- Dog of Flanders.

2601
01:23:30,279 --> 01:23:31,710
- That's difficult.
- Correct.

2602
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:32,949
- Did she get it correct?
- Jang Yoon Ju.

2603
01:23:32,949 --> 01:23:34,180
- Yes.
- Correct.

2604
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:37,920
(They succeed
if she gets the last one correct!)

2605
01:23:38,119 --> 01:23:39,720
- Correct.
- What?

2606
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,720
You pick your teeth
after eating meat?

2607
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:41,720
- Incorrect.
- No.

2608
01:23:41,989 --> 01:23:43,659
- After eating gukbap?
- How many seconds are left?

2609
01:23:43,659 --> 01:23:45,189
You're picking your teeth
when you don't need to.

2610
01:23:45,189 --> 01:23:46,289
- Right.
- Water...

2611
01:23:46,289 --> 01:23:47,359
- It's similar to that.
- You drink water...

2612
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:49,300
- Water in two syllables.
- Incorrect.

2613
01:23:49,329 --> 01:23:50,699
- You have five seconds.
- Oriental medicine.

2614
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:51,869
- No.
- Mineral water.

2615
01:23:51,869 --> 01:23:53,470
- Incorrect. Three, two,
- It's cold.

2616
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:54,569
- Hey!
- one.

2617
01:23:54,699 --> 01:23:56,000
(Cold water)

2618
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,270
- Three,
- We heard it earlier.

2619
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:58,670
- two, one.
- What is it?

2620
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:00,170
- Beef intestines.
- Goodness!

2621
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:02,079
- Beef intestines.
- Goodness!

2622
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:03,279
It's cold water!

2623
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:04,510
Cold water.

2624
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:05,810
Goodness.

2625
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:07,649
She even said beef intestines.
We can do it.

2626
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:09,779
You failed the last question too.

2627
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:12,090
- This is so annoying.
- Please remove...

2628
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:14,090
- one prize.
- That was close. Cold water.

2629
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:16,460
- Cold water...
- I had too little time.

2630
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:18,930
You used a lot of time. Right?

2631
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:20,960
(They almost made it,
but it ended with beef intestines.)

2632
01:24:21,159 --> 01:24:22,899
We still have the slippers?

2633
01:24:22,899 --> 01:24:25,430
- The slippers...
- The slippers. Right.

2634
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:29,270
- We have the final four prizes.
- Is it over?

2635
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:30,699
Kim Jong Kook will pick a person,

2636
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:34,170
and that person
will choose the gift first.

2637
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:35,640
- First?
- Yes.

2638
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,380
- I can choose if he picks my name?
- Yes.

2639
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,380
- Please.
- The picked running ball...

2640
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:42,680
will be added back
to the pouch again.

2641
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,119
(The member who was chosen
can be picked again.)

2642
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:46,750
- So one person...
- They're tears.

2643
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:48,489
- We can be picked again?
- can get picked four times.

2644
01:24:48,819 --> 01:24:51,460
(Yeezy Boost slippers
that Jae Seok liked)

2645
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:53,760
First, I must say...

2646
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,600
You know that sweatshirt
has my name on it.

2647
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,670
(The Stussy sweatshirt is popular.)

2648
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:01,170
I'm heavy-sized.

2649
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:07,069
(Bo Pil's gift, Dior shoes)

2650
01:25:07,609 --> 01:25:13,479
(The luxury Bose headset
that Jong Kook donated)

2651
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,619
Please pick the member
who'll get the first gift.

2652
01:25:16,619 --> 01:25:18,449
- Please.
- Please, Jong Kook.

2653
01:25:18,449 --> 01:25:19,850
- Yes?
- Please pick my name.

2654
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:21,289
- Okay.
- Please pick me.

2655
01:25:21,289 --> 01:25:22,859
- Seriously.
- But your socks are gone.

2656
01:25:22,859 --> 01:25:24,560
- The slippers.
- The slippers are there.

2657
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,659
I want the headset.

2658
01:25:25,659 --> 01:25:27,829
- The slippers.
- I'll take the Bose headset.

2659
01:25:27,829 --> 01:25:29,159
- I want the Bose headset.
- Me too.

2660
01:25:29,899 --> 01:25:31,630
- I need it.
- I really need it too.

2661
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,199
- I really need it.
- I really mean it.

2662
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,869
- What...
- I caught one.

2663
01:25:37,239 --> 01:25:39,239
Give it to me just once.

2664
01:25:39,239 --> 01:25:40,970
I won't give it to you
if mine gets picked.

2665
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:41,979
I won't either.

2666
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:43,810
Would it be me?

2667
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:46,250
(They're all serious about it.
Whose name was picked?)

2668
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:47,979
I'll wear it home.

2669
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:50,020
- Is the person here or there?
- It's Yang Se Chan.

2670
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:52,850
(Yang Se Chan was picked.)

2671
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:55,390
- Se Chan.
- He'll take the headset.

2672
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:56,689
- No. He'll take this.
- Here.

2673
01:25:56,859 --> 01:25:59,090
Is it Stussy or the headset?

2674
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:02,229
But Haha said he wanted the headset.
My name will enter again, right?

2675
01:26:02,229 --> 01:26:05,060
- Right.
- Then I'll take the headset.

2676
01:26:05,569 --> 01:26:06,869
That's nice.

2677
01:26:06,869 --> 01:26:08,569
He kept saying he wanted it.

2678
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:10,170
Se Chan.

2679
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:12,810
Then since you wanted the Stussy...

2680
01:26:12,909 --> 01:26:14,069
- I'll pick.
- I'll take the Stussy.

2681
01:26:14,069 --> 01:26:15,840
Let it be Jee Seok Jin.

2682
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:17,680
- I'm so happy.
- Let it be Jee Seok Jin.

2683
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:20,479
It's a relief my slippers
are still there.

2684
01:26:20,979 --> 01:26:22,380
- I'll go.
- It's amazing.

2685
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:24,479
- I really wanted this.
- Jong Kook. Let me...

2686
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:26,420
Let me wear the slippers home.

2687
01:26:26,489 --> 01:26:29,090
- I had a desperate heart.
- Let me wear the slippers home.

2688
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:30,920
- Please.
- You need to be desperate.

2689
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:33,189
- A desperate heart.
- The slippers. Please.

2690
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:35,800
Jee Seok Jin.
Let it be Jee Seok Jin.

2691
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,960
- Let it be Jee Seok Jin.
- I got it.

2692
01:26:38,229 --> 01:26:39,600
- Ji Ye Eun.
- Please.

2693
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,140
Will it be Yang Se Chan again?
That's possible.

2694
01:26:42,369 --> 01:26:44,670
Me. Is it me?

2695
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:47,069
(I want to get it one more time!)

2696
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:50,640
- Is it me?
- It's not clear.

2697
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:51,840
It's Jee Seok Jin.

2698
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,609
(It's Jee Seok Jin.)

2699
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:58,079
(He surprisingly won a prize.)

2700
01:26:58,079 --> 01:26:59,649
It's your birthday.

2701
01:26:59,819 --> 01:27:00,890
- A desperate heart.
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>

2702
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:05,829
(The birthday present for Seok Sam
the unlucky picker!)

2703
01:27:05,829 --> 01:27:07,859
(He teases Jae Seok.)

2704
01:27:07,859 --> 01:27:09,329
Right.

2705
01:27:09,329 --> 01:27:11,060
- Okay.
- That went well.

2706
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,630
- That went well.
- Really.

2707
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:14,100
- It suited you well.
- It was so pretty.

2708
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:16,340
It suits you well.

2709
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:18,670
- Please, Kook Jong.
- I'm really unlucky with these.

2710
01:27:18,670 --> 01:27:20,770
- Pick me.
- I just want the slippers.

2711
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,680
I don't ask much from you.

2712
01:27:24,039 --> 01:27:26,449
(Please, pick me!)

2713
01:27:26,579 --> 01:27:28,449
- Just pick my name.
- Right. I got one.

2714
01:27:28,449 --> 01:27:30,579
- The slippers are there.
- Ji Ye Eun.

2715
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:34,050
It's winter,
but I'll wear those bare feet.

2716
01:27:34,819 --> 01:27:36,189
Ji Seok Jin?

2717
01:27:36,189 --> 01:27:38,359
- Ji Ye Eun.
- I really don't win these things.

2718
01:27:38,359 --> 01:27:39,390
You wanted Stussy.

2719
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:41,890
(She escaped the penalty last week,
and she gets a prize this week.)

2720
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:44,100
I really don't win these things.

2721
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:45,100
I'll take this.

2722
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,100
(She quickly chooses
the Stussy sweatshirt.)

2723
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,829
- It looks good on you.
- It suits you.

2724
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:49,470
- It's huge.
- I'll wear it now.

2725
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:51,439
- It's pretty.
- It suits you.

2726
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:53,869
- It would look cute.
- You wanted the Stussy sweatshirt.

2727
01:27:53,869 --> 01:27:55,680
Please. Let it be me.

2728
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:57,880
- It's the last one.
- Jong Kook.

2729
01:27:58,109 --> 01:27:59,579
- Pick mine.
- Will it be Yu Jae Seok?

2730
01:27:59,579 --> 01:28:00,750
You should pick mine.

2731
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,550
- Just once.
- I want to give it to you too.

2732
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:03,850
- Just once.
- Another one.

2733
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:05,750
- It's my birthday.
- I want to give it to you.

2734
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,090
- What?
- Why is it your birthday?

2735
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:09,119
It's in August.

2736
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:10,789
- It is my birthday.
- It's everyone's birthday...

2737
01:28:10,789 --> 01:28:13,029
- It will come soon.
- if you say it like that.

2738
01:28:13,029 --> 01:28:14,529
I'll pick the one that I grab.

2739
01:28:14,529 --> 01:28:16,260
- Get mine.
- I got one.

2740
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:17,260
It's there. It's mine.

2741
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:19,729
- It's mine.
- It's not his.

2742
01:28:19,729 --> 01:28:21,130
It's obviously not his.

2743
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:22,270
- He's too jumpy.
- I don't think it's him.

2744
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:23,300
It's me.

2745
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,340
(Will it be Jae Seok
who kept mumbling the slippers?)

2746
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,869
- That one.
- It's me.

2747
01:28:25,869 --> 01:28:28,609
- Be me...
- Show us. Who is it?

2748
01:28:28,739 --> 01:28:30,109
Show us. Who is it?

2749
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:31,539
Song Ji Hyo.

2750
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:33,350
(Song Ji Hyo is picked.)

2751
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:34,649
Song Ji Hyo.

2752
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:38,180
I can't believe Ji Hyo is picked.

2753
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:39,890
- Hey...
- I'm going to wear them.

2754
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:41,489
- You distributed them evenly.
- Yes.

2755
01:28:41,489 --> 01:28:42,590
I'm going to wear them.

2756
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:44,520
- They all get one each.
- They look good on you.

2757
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,090
- They suit you.
- They look good.

2758
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:47,159
(Clenching his teeth)

2759
01:28:47,159 --> 01:28:49,760
- So we are done...
- They fit her.

2760
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,029
- distributing all the items.
- I really wanted this. Thanks.

2761
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:55,569
- I'll use it well.
- Thank you.

2762
01:28:55,569 --> 01:28:57,800
- I'm so jealous.
- Thank you, Jong Kook.

2763
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,310
I know. Thanks to you,
the place looks clean.

2764
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:04,210
As I told you, we have a gift
for Jong Kook too.

2765
01:29:04,279 --> 01:29:08,750
Jong Kook, you should choose
between the two boxes.

2766
01:29:09,149 --> 01:29:13,590
One box has a gift certificate
that is worth 2,000 dollars.

2767
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:14,689
My goodness.

2768
01:29:14,689 --> 01:29:16,619
And the other is a dud.

2769
01:29:17,159 --> 01:29:18,319
No way.

2770
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:19,789
- Is there a dud?
- But...

2771
01:29:19,789 --> 01:29:21,829
- He has to get the gift.
- We should give him.

2772
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:23,029
I'm sure it's the black one.

2773
01:29:23,029 --> 01:29:24,100
I think the colors show it.

2774
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:26,100
- I'll go with the black one.
- This one does look good.

2775
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:27,270
- Right.
- Jong Kook, since you like black,

2776
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:28,300
they must've put it
in the black box.

2777
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,239
- Black?
- It must be the black one.

2778
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:32,710
- Maybe they put it in here.
- You think so?

2779
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:35,109
- The production crew is spiteful.
- That's why.

2780
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:36,609
- That's why it's in the black one.
- That's why...

2781
01:29:36,609 --> 01:29:38,039
- it's in here?
- Until the end.

2782
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,609
- It's confusing.
- Until the very end.

2783
01:29:40,609 --> 01:29:42,380
Is it the production crew's
heartfelt gift?

2784
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:44,680
- Exactly.
- Or is it their trick?

2785
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:47,319
- They knew I'd want to pick this.
- It's black.

2786
01:29:47,319 --> 01:29:49,289
Anyone can tell I'm drawn to this.

2787
01:29:49,289 --> 01:29:50,819
- Of course.
- Right?

2788
01:29:50,859 --> 01:29:51,920
You should change your choice.

2789
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,560
- I think it's in the black box.
- Me too.

2790
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:54,960
- Still.
- They twisted it twice.

2791
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,800
- This doesn't feel right.
- Because Jae Seok...

2792
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,670
It's supposed to be a gift.
Black doesn't seem right.

2793
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:01,970
- I know, right?
- Why do you think they got this?

2794
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:03,869
- Should I pick this?
- They want you to have it.

2795
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,210
- They're grateful.
- This is really hard.

2796
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:07,869
Once you open a box, it's over.

2797
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:09,310
Once you open it, it's over.

2798
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:10,810
- The color doesn't feel right.
- Jong Kook.

2799
01:30:10,909 --> 01:30:12,149
Do you not know Hyung In?

2800
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:14,409
She's quite straightforward.

2801
01:30:14,979 --> 01:30:16,880
- She doesn't twist things.
- That's true.

2802
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:19,090
- I don't know.
- This is how they'd feel.

2803
01:30:19,149 --> 01:30:20,550
Think about how they would feel.

2804
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,819
"I'm grateful to Jong Kook today."

2805
01:30:22,819 --> 01:30:23,960
(They are grateful,
so they put it in the black box.)

2806
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,729
- I think that's what they did.
- But let's say...

2807
01:30:25,729 --> 01:30:28,090
I pick the blue and it's in there.
It will make her look bad.

2808
01:30:29,029 --> 01:30:30,159
It can't be helped.

2809
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:31,500
(It can't be helped.)

2810
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,500
- She doesn't want me to have it.
- That's it.

2811
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:34,630
(Should he pick his favorite color
and change his choice?)

2812
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:37,100
- Why did you make it so confusing?
- He's right.

2813
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:38,670
But you like black.

2814
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:41,109
- Let go. Hang on a second.
- This looks like a gift.

2815
01:30:41,109 --> 01:30:42,680
- It does look like a gift.
- Look.

2816
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,109
(He shed tears throwing away
his beloved plastic bags.)

2817
01:30:44,109 --> 01:30:45,409
- This must be it.
- Why would they use a black one?

2818
01:30:45,409 --> 01:30:47,380
- I really don't know.
- The color...

2819
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:49,149
- I think this is a little...
- This doesn't feel right.

2820
01:30:49,149 --> 01:30:50,579
- Okay.
- Good. Okay.

2821
01:30:50,579 --> 01:30:52,789
Once you open it, it's over.

2822
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:54,189
- She sounds cheerful.
- This doesn't feel right.

2823
01:30:54,189 --> 01:30:55,520
- Her voice sounds bright.
- I'm nervous.

2824
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:56,760
Okay.

2825
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:57,960
- This must be it.
- I'm nervous.

2826
01:30:58,359 --> 01:30:59,590
Please.

2827
01:30:59,689 --> 01:31:00,760
Once you open it, it's over.

2828
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:01,930
Open it.

2829
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:03,500
- Go ahead and open it.
- Why is it so nerve-racking?

2830
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:04,960
(Is it a gift certificate
worth 2,000 dollars or a dud?)

2831
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,029
(Shouting)

2832
01:31:06,899 --> 01:31:09,699
(Gift certificate
worth 2,000 dollars)

2833
01:31:09,699 --> 01:31:11,600
(He got the gift certificate.)

2834
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,979
(Kim Bag picked the gift certificate
despite the trick.)

2835
01:31:15,979 --> 01:31:18,039
- You got it.
- This is amazing.

2836
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:19,909
- Okay.
- You did it.

2837
01:31:19,909 --> 01:31:21,609
- Okay.
- This was too dark.

2838
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,420
- This was too dark.
- It was.

2839
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:24,579
It was too dark.

2840
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:27,020
- It was dark.
- It was dark.

2841
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:28,489
- I'm glad Seok Jin is wrong.
- I had a feeling.

2842
01:31:28,489 --> 01:31:29,489
You're right.

2843
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:30,819
I'm glad
I didn't listen to Seok Jin.

2844
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:32,189
- Right.
- I had a feeling.

2845
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:36,899
(These were the sad days
when they were always angry...)

2846
01:31:36,899 --> 01:31:39,529
(and had to steal from each other
because they had no money.)

2847
01:31:39,529 --> 01:31:40,770
Do you think we are real slaves?

2848
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:43,069
(Spend as much as you want today!)

2849
01:31:43,069 --> 01:31:47,010
(The allowance is 3,000 dollars.)

2850
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:50,239
(Kwang Soo is here
on such a precious day?)

2851
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:51,939
(Choi Daniel, Kim Ah Young)

2852
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:54,449
(A fling that starts again
after four months?)

2853
01:31:54,449 --> 01:31:56,750
(The man who's obsessed
with the height is back.)

2854
01:31:56,819 --> 01:31:59,949
(Today is a day
where they all just spend money.)

2855
01:31:59,949 --> 01:32:01,649
The street with luxury shops
is near here.

2856
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:02,890
- There's Hermes.
- You can spend money...

2857
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:06,189
(But there's a condition
for spending money.)

2858
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:07,630
- Arcade.
- Arcade?

2859
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:09,529
- You said you'd go shopping.
- You're going shopping!

2860
01:32:09,699 --> 01:32:12,159
(They have to spend money
as the citizens instructed.)

2861
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:13,770
Why are we doing so well?

2862
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:15,100
We're not dying.

2863
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:17,970
(They all try hard to spend money.)

2864
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:21,210
(The fling finally begins?)

2865
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:22,880
(The love triangle finally begins!)

2866
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,939
My ideal type is Daniel.

2867
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:29,020
(It turns into a love square
with the appearance of the catfish?)

2868
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:33,920
(Forget about the fling
and let's just use up the money!)

2869
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:38,060
(Will the members be able
to spend 3,000 dollars?)

2870
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:39,329
(My Perfect Spending)
