1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,010
One fall day in Joseon.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,210
Ahead of Chuseok,
the nation's biggest holiday,

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,350
Lord Yu and Lord Ha...

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,620
gather to harvest their crops.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,750
And they bring...

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,620
a few slaves together.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,620
Hello.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,230
- Seok Sam, come here.
- Let go of it for this skit.

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,860
We don't have Muscle today.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,070
- You know...
- You're not wearing a topknot.

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,700
one of our slaves got married,
so he's on his honeymoon now.

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,570
- That's right.
- He's on a honeymoon?

13
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,610
- He has worked a lot.
- It's shocking in Joseon.

14
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,570
If the King finds out,
I'll be in trouble.

15
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,810
- He will be furious.
- I'll be severely punished.

16
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,310
- I...
- Why are you wearing a topnot?

17
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,950
Because it's pretty.

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,080
She has never done
a historical drama before.

19
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,580
- What's with her?
- I think it's pretty.

20
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,590
Did you do that yourself?

21
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,950
- She's only done modern dramas,
- Right.

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,420
and she has no experience
in historical dramas.

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,760
She lacks understanding
of the Joseon Dynasty.

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,030
- She's only been in offices.
- Right.

25
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,430
She doesn't know much.

26
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,660
- What's the relationship here?
- All right.

27
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,660
- I'm Lord Yu.
- You...

28
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,570
- Lord Yu.
- He's Lord Ha.

29
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,070
How could a low-class guy
like him...

30
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,400
- How dare you?
- How...

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,210
How could someone born
a commoner become a nobleman?

32
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,670
- Listen.
- Hey, twist his legs.

33
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,840
He was born into the lowest class.

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,880
- Se Chan.
- Castrate him.

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,980
- Se Chan.
- You lowly commoner.

36
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,280
He was born into the lower class,
not the lowest class.

37
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,710
I see. I'm sorry.

38
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,280
- What you said was a curse word.
- Okay.

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,720
- The lower class.
- I'm sorry.

40
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,590
Let's hear the explanation.
Why am I a nobleman?

41
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,460
I feel uncomfortable.

42
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,920
As you can see here,

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,860
Yu Jae Seok and Haha are the lords,

44
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,030
and the rest of the members
are the slaves.

45
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,960
- I hate this.
- But why?

46
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,470
To fill in for Slave Kim Jong Kook,

47
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,170
who is away on his honeymoon...

48
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,440
It's just...

49
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,470
- This is crazy.
- Now that he's married,

50
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,470
he's being reckless.

51
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,470
- He must be carried away.
- I guess we have other slaves.

52
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,680
- What?
- So we have other slaves...

53
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,210
- to fill up the vacancy.
- Really?

54
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,950
- Come on out.
- Slaves?

55
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,580
- Who are the slaves?
- Come here, slaves.

56
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,080
How dare you come late
when everyone is waiting?

57
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,120
Who are the slaves?

58
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,450
- Come here.
- Who are they?

59
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,150
Hello, there.

60
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,390
- What?
- Who are the slaves?

61
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,490
- Who are they?
- Come here.

62
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,020
- I bet they are noblemen.
- What?

63
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,090
Are they noblemen?

64
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,990
- That's Hyun Moo.
- Hyun Moo.

65
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,660
- What is he doing here?
- Hello, there.

66
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,300
What is Seung Hwan doing here?

67
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,600
- Hello.
- Aren't you going to wear this?

68
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
(Singing slave, Jung Seung Hwan)

69
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,070
(The indoor MC who has hosted
countless shows in studios)

70
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,910
(The man under fluorescent lights
is on an outdoor variety show!)

71
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,110
(A house plant, Jun Hyun Moo)

72
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,580
(From a K-pop star
to the prince of ballads)

73
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,480
(The crown prince of ballads
tops the music charts.)

74
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,250
(An emotional ballad singer,
Jung Seung Hwan)

75
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,220
- Hey.
- It's Hyun Moo.

76
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,220
Nice to meet you.

77
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,260
What are you doing here?

78
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,860
- All of a sudden?
- What brings you here?

79
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,060
It's been a while, Seok Jin.

80
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,060
- Hello.
- Hello.

81
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,230
- Hyun Moo.
- Hey.

82
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,730
It's good to see you here.

83
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,900
What are you doing here?

84
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,700
- Why did he get his hair done?
- Hey.

85
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,040
- That's not acceptable here.
- He got his hair done.

86
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,770
What's with your hair?

87
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,370
- He should get...
- You need to put something on.

88
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,740
- No.
- Get him a headband.

89
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,680
- I got this done in Cheongdam-dong.
- Come on!

90
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,150
- Come here.
- This is the Cheongdam-dong hair.

91
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,680
- Don't be ridiculous.
- The Cheongdam-dong hair?

92
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,050
- Come here.
- Cheongdam-dong, my foot.

93
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,920
- Seriously. Stop him.
- Hold him.

94
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,990
- Hey, hold him.
- Put this on.

95
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,090
- I got this done in the morning.
- You fool.

96
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,160
- It's okay. Draw it on his face.
- You brat.

97
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,190
- You can't be doing this.
- What are you doing?

98
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,760
- You can't look like that here.
- Come here.

99
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,090
- Come here.
- Go ahead and draw it.

100
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,430
- How dare you?
- Draw it.

101
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,730
You arrogant fool.

102
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,600
- Draw it.
- How dare you?

103
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,970
- You wait and see.
- Draw a lot on his face.

104
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,140
I'll see you on another show.

105
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,700
(A grueling variety show debut)

106
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,710
- I'll see him on another show.
- On "Special Reporter 25hr."

107
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,170
- On "Special Reporter 25hr."
- How dare you?

108
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,310
- You went to Cheongdam-dong?
- Now he looks better.

109
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,480
- I had to get up early.
- It's done.

110
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,550
Why did you get your hair done
in Cheongdam-dong?

111
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,680
I shouldn't have woken up early.

112
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,020
Draw something on him too.

113
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,520
- Why not him?
- Leave Seung Hwan be.

114
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,820
- Not Seung Hwan.
- Draw something on my face.

115
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,490
- He's a ballad singer.
- He sings ballads.

116
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,890
Why does it even matter?

117
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,020
- I sing ballads too.
- He's a ballad singer.

118
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,990
What do you mean you sing ballads?

119
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,130
If it were you

120
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,660
(If it were you)

121
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,730
I sing ballads.

122
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,330
- Why do you sound like that?
- How funny.

123
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,700
You sound weird.

124
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,600
- You don't sing it right.
- Gosh, seriously...

125
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,400
Hyun Moo, you should draw...

126
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,670
He's a betrayer.

127
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,210
- Don't call me like that.
- Why is he a betrayer?

128
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,170
- Why do you call him a betrayer?
- Him?

129
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,480
- Yes.
- He's an ungrateful brat.

130
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,480
He needs some flogging.

131
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,950
- Why?
- What happened?

132
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,950
- My gosh.
- He...

133
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,680
It's me who made him
come back to variety shows.

134
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,350
- Really?
- But on another TV show,

135
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,990
someone asked him
if he was Moo People or Yu People.

136
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,390
And he answered Yu People
without even thinking about it.

137
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,090
Do you call yourself a human being?

138
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,860
- No.
- He...

139
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,060
It's understandable
that Hyun Moo is disappointed.

140
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,530
- I was really disappointed.
- Right.

141
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,560
You should take care of him today.

142
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,730
Do you call yourself a human being?

143
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,100
Hyun Moo, I'll be sure
to help you a lot today.

144
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,740
- Help him with what?
- I'll help you make money.

145
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,500
- Mind your own business.
- I will...

146
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,440
I'll give you some of my winnings.

147
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,640
Are you saying...

148
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,870
- you'll help Hyun Moo today?
- Yes.

149
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,010
- I'll help you.
- You're unbelievable.

150
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,840
- I'm serious.
- He needs some flogging.

151
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,410
- All right.
- Cheongdam-dong...

152
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,710
Hyun Moo and Seung Hwan
are here for a reason.

153
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,680
They're doing "The Ballad of Us"
with Tae Hyun.

154
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,780
For two weeks...

155
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,850
("The Ballad of Us" ranked 1st
in viewership ratings for 2 weeks.)

156
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,220
It's a make-or-break project.

157
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,390
Are they here
to promote "The Ballad of Us?"

158
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,020
After Tae Hyun?

159
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,090
They're promoting it for two weeks?

160
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,730
- Promoting for two weeks?
- Just help us.

161
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,500
- It's not even a movie.
- It's not easy.

162
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,060
As far as I know,

163
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,370
the title was on the screen
throughout our show.

164
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,570
You should have it
on the screen even now.

165
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,400
Place it in the upper right corner.

166
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,640
SBS is putting a lot of effort
into this show now.

167
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,910
When Tae Hyun was here,

168
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,410
- he kept talking about the show.
- He did.

169
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,140
- Right.
- That was all he said.

170
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,880
Ms. Choi is putting
a lot of pressure on us.

171
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,350
- It's killing me.
- It has to succeed.

172
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,380
- Get over it.
- Ms. Choi does?

173
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,580
That's why...

174
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,850
Hyun Moo came straight here
after "Boss in the Mirror."

175
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,920
Are you allowed to do that
these days?

176
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,120
I didn't even tell them.

177
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,820
(I didn't even tell them.)

178
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,860
On impulse.

179
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,590
I don't usually go to a show
that's filmed without a roof.

180
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,400
This is really annoying.

181
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,930
- On impulse.
- Hyun Moo...

182
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,500
- Tae Hyun was here.
- isn't usually treated like that.

183
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,340
- He's treated like a kid here.
- How adorable.

184
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,610
- He's serious when he's with me.
- He's cute.

185
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,040
"Hello, dear viewers."

186
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,980
And now, he's like "Gosh, stop it!"

187
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,010
- "It hurts. Stop it."
- How dare you?

188
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,450
- How dare you?
- You're adorable.

189
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,610
I'm usually the oldest one
on other TV shows.

190
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,120
- He's a little kid here.
- He's a kid.

191
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,220
- How adorable.
- He's lovely.

192
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,250
We should change his diaper.

193
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,790
- Hyun Moo is back on Running Man...
- Right.

194
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,090
- after 10 years.
- It's been 12 years.

195
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,390
Wasn't he here
with Kwang Kyu back then?

196
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,430
We went to Ewha Womans University.

197
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,300
At Ewha Womans University,
I was less popular than Kwang Kyu.

198
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,930
- Back then...
- "The man you want to marry."

199
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,530
- What?
- You were in last place back then.

200
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,930
- Right.
- I was below Kwang Kyu...

201
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,570
- on "The man you want to marry."
- Back then, Hyun Moo...

202
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,100
ranked 11th or something.

203
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,440
- He did?
- He was almost in last place.

204
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,210
If you were to be born again,
who would you most like to date?

205
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,210
The last place...

206
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,280
is Jun Hyun Moo.

207
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,380
(The last place is Jun Hyun Moo.)

208
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,610
Jun Hyun Moo.

209
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,150
Jun Hyun Moo.

210
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,880
(Jun Hyun Moo!)

211
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,580
(He beat out all the ugly ones
and became the least wanted man.)

212
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,650
- He was almost in last place.
- Some woman said this.

213
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,950
"I'm not interested in him at all."

214
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,190
(Some woman said
she wasn't interested in him.)

215
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,890
- She wasn't interested at all.
- Indifference.

216
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,360
- I was really hurt.
- She never even considered it.

217
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,230
- Indifferent to Jun Hyun Moo.
- And Seung Hwan.

218
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,390
(It's Seung Hwan's first time
on Running Man.)

219
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,700
- It's been a while since I saw...
- He's here.

220
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,130
Seung Hwan in a slave costume.

221
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,830
- This is my first time.
- Is it your first time?

222
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes. And this is my first time
on Running Man too.

223
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,340
- Really?
- Really?

224
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,510
- It's your first time.
- You know, Seung Hwan is...

225
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,040
the Park Bo Gum of Antenna.

226
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,780
- Seriously?
- Yes.

227
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,350
- The Park Bo Gum of Antenna.
- Yes.

228
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,310
- He is?
- The Park Bo Gum of Antenna.

229
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,180
Just because you two
belong to the same agency...

230
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,350
- Even before I joined the agency,
- Yes.

231
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,090
- he settled down there.
- I see.

232
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,520
After he did many things,

233
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,790
- I joined Antenna.
- Right.

234
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,590
- He's the original artist.
- Park Bo Gum?

235
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,660
- Yes.
- What?

236
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,060
Is it that...

237
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,730
only those with protruding mouths
can join Antenna?

238
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,130
Is it that...

239
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,800
only those with protruding mouths
can join Antenna?

240
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,270
- The mouth.
- They all are protruding.

241
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,340
I didn't do that.

242
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,510
- It's a little protruding.
- You didn't get dental braces?

243
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,210
- Right.
- Se Chan has been getting...

244
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,780
orthodontic treatment
for six months.

245
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,010
- It's been 15 years.
- He got it?

246
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,580
- You did?
- Yes.

247
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,150
His teeth beat
the orthodontic treatment.

248
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,150
They wouldn't go in.

249
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,220
- Maybe we should punch them in.
- Punch them in?

250
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,350
(Maybe we should punch
his teeth in.)

251
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,090
Hey. Punch them in?

252
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,620
I just can't get used to this.

253
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,130
The sun is really hot.

254
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,330
- Right. The left side is burning.
- I know.

255
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,330
(Actually, during the talk...)

256
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,730
(He was gradually losing
his energy.)

257
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,600
(He lost his soul
even before the show started.)

258
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,540
Today, we're having...

259
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,570
a Chuseok special,
the Lords' Crops Race.

260
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,870
Is it Chuseok already?

261
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,580
- It's a Chuseok special.
- Is it?

262
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,280
- It's already like that.
- The day before Chuseok.

263
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,610
Today is the day...

264
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,310
when the two lords
harvest their crops...

265
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,250
- ahead of Chuseok.
- Crops?

266
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,850
The two teams,
Lord Yu Jae Seok and Lord Haha,

267
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,450
will compete against each other.

268
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,860
The team with the higher value
of their crops wins.

269
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,360
- The value of our crops?
- Yes.

270
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,460
On the winning team,
only the lord...

271
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,030
and the two highest-ranking members
receive the prize.

272
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,300
- Two members?
- Yes. And the remaining slaves...

273
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,370
will get the penalty...

274
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,670
- even if they win.
- Oh, no.

275
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,970
On the losing team, only the lord...

276
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,010
and the highest-ranking member
are exempt from the penalty,

277
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,540
- What about the rest?
- and all the remaining slaves...

278
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,280
will get the penalty.

279
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,410
That means, whether you win or lose,

280
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,580
the lords won't get the penalty.

281
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,280
- That's great.
- What?

282
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,250
(Whether they win or lose, the lords
are exempt from the penalty.)

283
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,990
- That's great.
- What?

284
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,620
- It's good for the lords.
- My goodness.

285
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,460
I don't understand
what she's saying.

286
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,360
- You'll figure it out over time.
- Over time?

287
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,030
Then the lords...

288
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,060
- It's too good for the lords.
- The lords should get the penalty.

289
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,660
So the slaves will
get the opportunity...

290
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,970
to change the lord
with the money they saved.

291
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,500
(The slaves can change the lord
with their money.)

292
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,700
(Understood)

293
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,410
- We...
- I see.

294
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,570
- We should work together.
- Right.

295
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,870
- We should work together.
- Let's do that.

296
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,240
We should get rid of them.

297
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,880
- Seok Jin. We should work together.
- Let's get rid of them.

298
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,410
- What?
- The lords don't get the penalty.

299
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,410
- All of a sudden...
- But they can...

300
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,880
change the lord?

301
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,180
We should work together.

302
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,750
- You should get rid of Jae Seok.
- Right.

303
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,120
- My gosh.
- Seriously...

304
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,890
- I can't believe this.
- How to change the lord...

305
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,960
with the money you saved...

306
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,390
will be explained separately...

307
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,390
- to the slaves later.
- Okay.

308
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,560
I think the slaves have
a kind of advantage.

309
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,600
- I guess so.
- It must be something like this.

310
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,830
You have to be the lord
to avoid the penalty.

311
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,930
That's right.

312
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,300
- But why...
- If that's the case,

313
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,600
the lords will have to do something.

314
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,770
Then...

315
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,870
how many rounds will there be?

316
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,440
The lords can change
between the rounds?

317
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,010
He's scared already.

318
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,980
They want it to be changed.

319
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,050
I should win the slaves over.

320
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,850
First, the two lords
will be given the basic crops.

321
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,490
They can hire...

322
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,890
the slaves they like
by giving them the crops.

323
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,690
I guess the slaves
will have to work, right?

324
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,660
They are real crops.

325
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What?

326
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,160
Of course, they're real.

327
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,930
- I thought we'd use fake ones.
- Lord Ha.

328
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,930
- I can't work for Grasshopper.
- Of course, they're real.

329
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,500
- Haha, I will...
- I can't work for Grasshopper.

330
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,570
You know I don't lie.

331
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,610
Me neither.

332
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,280
- Hang on.
- Okay.

333
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,210
All right. First...

334
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,550
Go ahead and choose
the lord whom you want to work for.

335
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,720
- I want you, Lord Ha.
- Okay.

336
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Go ahead and choose.

337
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,020
- Show us how you're feeling.
- All right.

338
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,590
We go way back,

339
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,790
- Right.
- so he will treat me nicely.

340
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,390
- We did a TV show together.
- Right.

341
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,460
Remember?

342
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,660
(He chooses his old colleagues
from "Happy Together.")

343
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,890
Where are you going?

344
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,290
Okay. I'll be with you.

345
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,560
The protruding mouths
should be here.

346
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,330
(The Protruded Brothers
choose Lord Yu.)

347
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,030
You got here first.

348
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,570
I'll take that into consideration.

349
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,100
And we worked together...

350
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,840
- for a long time.
- We did.

351
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,510
- All right. So, first...
- Yes...

352
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,710
(One carrot)

353
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,980
A carrot?

354
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,540
He thinks you're a horse.

355
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,480
I'll give you a carrot.

356
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,850
- A carrot.
- I see. A carrot.

357
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,620
- Carrot.
- We need a carrot on our team.

358
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,880
We need a carrot.

359
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,990
- Just take one for now.
- One is enough.

360
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,020
Ji Hyo.

361
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,260
The Protruded Brothers
of Antenna are here.

362
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,390
Good. I'll give you a potato.

363
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,390
- Thank you.
- Potato.

364
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,400
- I want the scallions.
- Okay. Scallions.

365
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,700
- Carrot.
- I got a carrot.

366
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,930
- I got a scallion.
- Onion.

367
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,130
Thank you, Lord Yu.

368
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,300
Good.

369
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,000
- All right then.
- Lord Yu.

370
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,040
Potato.

371
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,070
Just take a potato for now.

372
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,740
- Seok Sam.
- Yes.

373
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,780
I want the scallions.

374
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,780
You know, I'm crazy about scallions.

375
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,010
You love scallions.

376
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,780
I'm crazy about scallions.

377
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,720
- You do care about your character.
- Yes. Crazy over scallions.

378
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,350
(He hired slaves
by giving them only one crop each.)

379
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,890
(Yu Jae Seok: 2 onions, 2 potatoes,
1 scallion, 3 carrots)

380
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,020
- Seok Sam.
- Yes.

381
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,890
- You know what?
- I need many things.

382
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,290
- I don't want you to beat me.
- Right.

383
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,330
Of course not.

384
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,660
I'll give you many crops...

385
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,560
so that an unfortunate incident
won't happen.

386
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,660
I'll give you many crops...

387
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,600
(Seok Jin: 1 scallion,
1 potato, 1 carrot)

388
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,570
(Unlike Lord Yu,
he's being quite generous.)

389
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,800
- Why...
- You were there.

390
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,940
- You were there.
- Okay.

391
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,370
I came here first.

392
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,810
Of course. Our Ye Eun.

393
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,540
- You know I adore you, right?
- Yes.

394
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,610
He stole the carrot...

395
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,680
- Here.
- Thank you.

396
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,950
He stole the carrot...

397
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,350
- Thank you.
- Who?

398
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,520
- Slave Yang...
- Hey.

399
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,150
- stole one of your onions.
- Hey!

400
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,320
- Did you steal mine?
- He stole an onion.

401
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,590
What are you talking about?
This is mine.

402
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,820
- I got it from Lord Yu.
- Hang on.

403
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,590
(A moment ago, he lurked
around Lord Ha's place...)

404
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,130
(and ended up
stealing something again today.)

405
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,900
What did you just steal?

406
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,930
I didn't steal it.
I got it from him.

407
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,930
(He has no idea.)

408
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,730
- How many do you have?
- Keep your stuff safely.

409
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,800
How many do you have?

410
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,870
That darn...

411
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,240
- What are you talking about?
- He stole it.

412
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,270
- He stole it from you.
- What are you talking about?

413
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,510
- He stole it.
- I got it from him.

414
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,880
- I received this.
- Did you speak down to me?

415
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,640
- Give it back, you punk!
- I received this.

416
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,780
- Unbelievable.
- He gave it to me.

417
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,810
You punk.

418
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,480
There's something to point out...

419
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,980
because it's currently 3 against 6.

420
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,150
One of you should move
to the other team.

421
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,960
- Really?
- Split up the ballad duo.

422
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,190
- The ballad duo.
- Split them up.

423
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,560
- Sure.
- Split the ballad duo.

424
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,760
- Seung Hwan, join that team.
- Sure.

425
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,760
- I hope we get along.
- Welcome.

426
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,330
- Hold on. That...
- I have a potato.

427
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,070
- What?
- That's not nice.

428
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,430
(Lord Yu takes back
the potato he had given.)

429
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,800
I'm one of the generous masters.

430
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,910
- A carrot.
- You were given the same amount,

431
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,640
- but our people have more.
- Just a carrot?

432
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,110
(Pondering)

433
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,380
Since you're new to the family,

434
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,210
- you'll start off with one potato.
- Got it.

435
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,410
Did they start off
with more produce?

436
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,050
- You had the same amount.
- You were given the same amount,

437
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,650
but our people have more.

438
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,850
- How can you be sure?
- You haven't given them out yet.

439
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,260
I have. They each have one.

440
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,820
- Look at what our master gave us.
- I've shared the produce.

441
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,460
- How did you get so much?
- Aren't I generous?

442
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,290
- I'm the best he has.
- He was the first to join mine.

443
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,790
- We're slaves.
- They each got three.

444
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,060
Aren't I generous?

445
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,330
- Why don't we have as much?
- He was here first.

446
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,430
- Exactly.
- I was first in line.

447
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,870
- You received one of each.
- Instead of giving it all at first,

448
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,670
I'll give you a bunch at the end.
Don't worry.

449
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,910
Are we a team,
or are we meant to overthrow you?

450
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,110
- We're a team, of course.
- We're a team,

451
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,410
- but we can overthrow him.
- Together...

452
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,610
If we can't win games...

453
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,210
- Unless you give us more...
- Give us one more right now.

454
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,750
- Lord Yu, listen.
- Give us one more right now.

455
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,450
- Give us one more.
- We'll start a riot.

456
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,820
- Hold on a second.
- Give us one more.

457
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,150
- Give each of us one more.
- I'd like...

458
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,760
to remove about two
who might be a danger to me.

459
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,360
- Those who might overthrow you?
- Just look.

460
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,330
Look at his eyes.

461
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,930
- I know how he is.
- He's planning to overthrow you.

462
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,560
He wants to overthrow me.

463
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,000
- I'm waiting for my chance.
- He's waiting for his moment.

464
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,100
These two are a threat to me.

465
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,800
- They're on the same show.
- I'm putting my trust in you.

466
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,840
- You're right.
- Don't trust us.

467
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,940
Sure, got it.

468
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,610
If you find the produce
too heavy to carry,

469
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,250
the slaves can store it
in the shed out back.

470
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,350
- Can we steal from others?
- Others could steal from us.

471
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,420
What's the point of that
when it could be stolen?

472
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,680
- Still,
- What's the point?

473
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,050
We could call it a truce.

474
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,860
You can store it in your sheds...

475
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,720
- Got it.
- if you want.

476
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,560
The sheds the two masters own...

477
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,690
will have locks,

478
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,700
- and you can store it there.
- Good.

479
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,000
Let's head out for your first game.

480
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,700
- I can't place them in my shed.
- Okay.

481
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,640
I should lock mine with the key.

482
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,740
All right.

483
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,140
- Let's go.
- Off we go.

484
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,270
(Team Lord Ha)

485
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,340
We're heading indoors.
What a relief.

486
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,940
All right, let's go.

487
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,010
Off we go.

488
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,080
We're heading indoors.
What a relief.

489
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,550
(Laughing)

490
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,380
- Lord Ha.
- Lord Ha.

491
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,680
- Everyone.
- Goodness.

492
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,350
- Come this way.
- My slaves, come this way.

493
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,750
- Over here, guys.
- Sure.

494
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,650
Please sit here, Lord Jung.

495
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,490
- Am I a master?
- You're actually not.

496
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,120
- Got it.
- I got confused.

497
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,190
I'm giving you a warning.

498
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,660
Stop looking for cooler spots.

499
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,300
- I feel more at ease now.
- You...

500
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,230
- I hate UV rays.
- Stop...

501
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,230
- looking for breezy spots.
- I hate UV rays.

502
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,900
He has a knack
for finding those spots.

503
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,940
- And shades.
- Yes, shades too.

504
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,810
Hyun Moo isn't at a level...

505
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,080
- to be scolded like this.
- Also...

506
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,110
You've gotten cuter, Hyun Moo.

507
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,910
Do you want to hear something funny?

508
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,950
When I first gave him a carrot,

509
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,120
he asked for a scallion instead.

510
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,220
A scallion? Why?

511
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,850
"Because I'm known
to be crazy about scallions."

512
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,460
How dare you keep up this act here?

513
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,260
How is this somewhere
to stay in character?

514
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,290
He's hoping to carry it on.

515
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,700
- Crazy about scallions?
- That's my character.

516
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,400
Why would you keep up that act here?

517
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,170
- Where's the harm in that?
- Crazy about scallions?

518
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,670
- Why would you stay in character?
- Crazy about scallions.

519
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,100
I won an award for that, remember?

520
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,770
- That's true.
- I remember that.

521
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,410
Seung Hwan,
is there a style or vibe...

522
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,770
- A style?
- you're aiming for?

523
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,310
- Is there...
- How is that your concern?

524
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,480
- How dare you talk like that...
- What was that?

525
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,680
- to my master?
- Hey.

526
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,510
- Where are your manners?
- How dare you?

527
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,180
- Lord Yu.
- Drag him out.

528
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,880
- Get over here.
- Why are you dragging me out?

529
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,850
- Why isn't my team helping?
- How dare you?

530
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,250
- How dare you?
- But...

531
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,820
- You!
- You darn slave.

532
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,990
Why didn't you get up with me?

533
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,630
- Aren't we going to talk?
- Get up, will you?

534
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,790
(The pampered show host
doesn't get up easily.)

535
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,660
When your master takes action,

536
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,900
you should get up.

537
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,200
- You should stand.
- Got it.

538
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,230
You can't keep
sitting around like that.

539
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,700
- Slave Jun?
- What about him?

540
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,940
He used to be under my care.

541
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,410
- He was.
- Really?

542
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,710
- I changed his dirty diapers.
- On "Star Golden Bell."

543
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,810
(Hyun Moo and Seok Jin
were both on "Star Golden Bell.")

544
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,780
(Falling down)

545
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,150
- Who was it?
- Who was it?

546
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,490
- Who was it?
- Did you see that?

547
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,620
(Why do things like this
only happen to Slave Jee?)

548
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,760
Okay, that'll be all.

549
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,230
The sky is expressing its anger.

550
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,490
That'll be all.

551
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,560
That was hilarious.

552
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,760
See? Assassins are coming for me.

553
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,070
(The assassin's attempt on his life
was unsuccessful.)

554
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,840
That Slave Song over there.
That rowdy yahoo.

555
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,440
- What now?
- Slave Song.

556
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,370
Do you know what word
people link you to?

557
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,610
- What is it?
- Song Ji Hyo, Ms. Cupping.

558
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,910
(Slave Song's slave mark was shown
the day before filming.)

559
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,180
- On her back.
- The cupping on her back.

560
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,450
Did you post a photo of it?

561
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,910
- Did I post a photo of it?
- Watch our show, will you?

562
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,620
Don't just watch your shows.
Watch other shows too.

563
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,720
- Seriously.
- Hyun Moo.

564
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,350
- Watch our shows.
- I can't believe you.

565
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,490
- He only watches his shows.
- It was yesterday's show.

566
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,820
Was it posted on social media?

567
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,160
- No, it was on last week's show.
- It aired yesterday!

568
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,090
- Unbelievable.
- They'd love it...

569
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,660
- on "Home Alone."
- How so?

570
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,230
On this show, Hyun Moo is...

571
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,770
He's getting kicked around.

572
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,970
- The viewers would love it.
- I'm the eldest there.

573
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,040
Exactly. That's why they'd love it.

574
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,270
- There aren't any videos to watch.
- They'd love it.

575
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,470
- There's nothing.
- They'd approve.

576
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,480
Video, start.
You don't have that here.

577
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,940
- We don't.
- This is exhausting.

578
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,710
Here's the first game you'll play.

579
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,080
It's called This is Our Survey.

580
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,520
We conducted a survey asking
100 people for their opinions.

581
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,850
After discussing the topic,

582
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,350
you will try to answer...

583
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,120
what ranked 1st through 3rd.

584
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,220
- First through third?
- Yes.

585
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,630
The higher the ranking
you get right,

586
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,590
- the higher your score will be.
- Good.

587
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,900
- Slave Moo does this a lot.
- He's good at this.

588
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,200
Haven't you hosted
a lot of ranking shows?

589
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,530
- I have.
- See?

590
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,540
The team that scores
the highest overall will win.

591
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,240
- Here's the first topic.
- Let's do well on this one...

592
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,870
- instead of the other games.
- Bring out the board.

593
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,180
I wonder what it'll be.

594
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,540
Marriage?

595
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,810
Marriage is a frequent topic...

596
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,980
of nagging here during Chuseok,

597
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,650
so we asked people
why they are hesitant...

598
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,750
- to marry.
- Marriage?

599
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,220
I'm sure there was a time
when Hyun Moo thought about...

600
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,620
whether he should get married.

601
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,320
- Of course.
- "Should I or shouldn't I?"

602
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,460
- Let's hear from everyone here.
- Draw from experience, Hyun Moo.

603
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,900
Why are you hesitant to marry?

604
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,930
- Why am I hesitant to marry?
- I'm sure that was the case.

605
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,370
- Well, I...
- Tell us, Slave Yang.

606
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,370
There are still
many seniors of mine...

607
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,370
who haven't married yet.

608
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,770
I figure there are
more joyful things in life,

609
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,070
so I'm not that interested
in marriage.

610
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,270
What fun things do you do?
You just lie around at home.

611
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,140
- Right. I just lie around.
- You don't do anything.

612
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,210
- That's fun.
- Isn't it fun to lie around...

613
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,650
- and watch YouTube all day?
- Exactly.

614
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,320
- That's freedom.
- You don't get to do that.

615
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,020
I watch YouTube in the bathroom.
So what?

616
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,850
Can't you relax freely on the couch?

617
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,190
- I'd feel guilty.
- Right?

618
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,060
- I'd have to glance at my wife.
- You can't sit comfortably either.

619
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,490
- Of course not.
- See?

620
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,160
- How relaxing is it to lie around?
- Come to think of it,

621
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,730
- I haven't lied down on the couch.
- Really?

622
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,200
- Why am I hesitant to marry?
- I'm curious.

623
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,960
- The answer is right here.
- How so?

624
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,000
(The reason he's hesitant to marry
is here?)

625
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,230
Are you making another confession?

626
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,170
- It's because of Seok Jin.
- Why?

627
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,400
- It's because of Seok Jin.
- Why?

628
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,970
- I bet you remember this.
- What happened?

629
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,610
The gamjatang place in Yeouido.

630
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,480
- What?
- What happened?

631
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
(Did Seok Sam remember something?)

632
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,080
- What?
- The three of us had dinner.

633
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,180
- Yes, we did.
- What happened?

634
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,950
(What on earth happened?)

635
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,750
Jae Seok encouraged me
to get married,

636
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,160
telling me how good
and happy life becomes.

637
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,420
Seok Sam told me
to get married at 50.

638
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,730
"Marry as late as possible."

639
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,630
(Seok Sam advised him
to marry late.)

640
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,230
"Marry as late as possible."

641
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,870
- That sounded so real to me.
- Of course.

642
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,000
When people around you say that...

643
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,670
- I blocked what Jae Seok said.
- Unbelievable.

644
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,470
With desperation in his eyes,
he told me not to marry.

645
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,040
- Really?
- Isn't it because...

646
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,740
he said what you wanted to hear?

647
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,040
That was then.
I think differently now.

648
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,410
For someone
who's serious about marriage,

649
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,580
- why is it that...
- Hold on.

650
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,220
Why is your dating life
always on display?

651
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,020
- Half of the rumors aren't true.
- Really?

652
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,720
- The recent one with an anchor.
- Exactly!

653
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,190
I've never even met her.

654
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,490
It's like we dated online.

655
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,490
- Really?
- Still, half the rumors are true.

656
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,830
- What?
- Half the rumors are true.

657
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,830
Yes, they're true.

658
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,470
(Half the rumors are true!)

659
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,730
Half the rumors are true!

660
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,470
(Why you...)

661
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,210
Daniel, didn't you say...
you'd be helping Hyun Moo out?

662
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,140
- You traitor. Give him a beating!
- Hold on.

663
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,340
- Daniel.
- Hyun Moo,

664
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,250
- I'm one of your people.
- Okay.

665
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,750
One reason you all agree on
is freedom.

666
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,120
- That's right.
- You're satisfied...

667
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,480
with your current life.

668
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,120
- Also, I'm clueless.
- That's the same.

669
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,450
Marriage is uncharted territory
for me.

670
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,560
- That scares me.
- Exactly. I'm scared of it.

671
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,460
- It scares me.
- This is quite true.

672
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,990
It's true that marriage
can be scary.

673
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,930
Don't you feel anything
when you see Jae Seok, me,

674
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,070
- and Seok Jin happily married?
- I do.

675
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,330
- I want that happiness too.
- Don't you want to get married?

676
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,800
I've worked with Byul
on a number of shows.

677
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,410
She didn't seem all that happy.

678
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,110
- Doesn't she seem happy?
- You know what I mean.

679
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,580
- She doesn't seem too happy?
- It's like this.

680
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,240
She never said it was exhausting,

681
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,680
- but she doesn't seem too happy.
- Haha doesn't know everything.

682
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,520
- Really?
- Haha doesn't know.

683
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,320
- Even if it's your family...
- She may be his wife,

684
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,390
- Good for you.
- but that's what she might think.

685
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,360
You knew what would get a laugh.

686
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,290
Seung Hwan's not at the age
to be thinking...

687
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,690
- about marriage.
- He's still quite young.

688
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,190
How old are you?
What year were you born?

689
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,300
I was born in 1996.

690
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,530
- No way.
- He's still so young.

691
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,370
What's the longest relationship
you've had?

692
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,270
- What?
- How long did it last?

693
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,540
- How long was it?
- For real?

694
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,870
- Is there a problem?
- What's the issue?

695
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,510
- We won't ask who it was with.
- Just don't tell us who you dated.

696
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,470
- We won't ask who it was.
- Let's start with Hyun Moo.

697
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,440
- Hyun Moo?
- Everyone knows who I dated.

698
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,540
- We all know about his girlfriends.
- We know most of his girlfriends.

699
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,980
- Check news articles.
- Exactly.

700
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,020
- That's true.
- Check news articles.

701
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,220
- You can look it up.
- Half of the rumors are true.

702
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,920
- Half of the rumors are true.
- Look it up.

703
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,020
- The longest.
- The longest relationship.

704
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,860
- About three years.
- That was quite long.

705
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,830
- That was quite long.
- Three years is a lot.

706
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,960
Hold on. I have something to ask.

707
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,700
- What is it?
- It's for those who are married.

708
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,830
Did you know...

709
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,040
she was the one
you were going to marry?

710
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,240
That depends on the person.

711
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,670
- Really?
- What about bells ringing?

712
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,640
- That also varies.
- That happens when you kiss her.

713
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,580
You hear bells ringing
when you kiss the one.

714
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,410
Haven't you all kissed before?

715
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,450
Sure.

716
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,050
- I have.
- Haven't you?

717
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,720
I'm crazy about it.

718
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,620
Since my lips stick out,
they reach hers faster.

719
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,590
- It'd be quicker.
- Of course.

720
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,530
- Really?
- I have an honest question for you.

721
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,330
Do you remove your glasses
before kissing?

722
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,200
(A primitive question
no one expected)

723
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,300
- Can she get in the mood?
- You... Hey.

724
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,740
Haha, are you saying he'd pause
and take them off?

725
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,640
(Sliding off)

726
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,110
Would he pause and take them off?

727
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,040
As if you're leading.

728
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,950
- Then...
- Your lips are easy to reach.

729
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,450
Your nose must touch her face
before your lips do.

730
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,750
I tilt like this.

731
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,690
- He's a romantic.
- Sexy guy!

732
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,920
Nice one.

733
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,060
Not bad.

734
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
So sexy.

735
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,990
- We have to guess the answers.
- Yes.

736
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,900
"Why are you hesitant to marry?"

737
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,530
- This is...
- "Why are you hesitant to marry?"

738
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,770
Financial issues.

739
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,770
Yes, financial issues.

740
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,740
- That's definitely there.
- That's the biggest reason.

741
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,940
It's money.

742
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,470
You get 3 points for the 1st answer.

743
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,770
- Two for the second answer,
- Let's guess the first.

744
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,640
- and one for the third answer.
- Let me answer!

745
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,940
- Let me answer!
- Economic reasons.

746
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,080
- Okay.
- Economic reasons.

747
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
- Us.
- That's a safe bet.

748
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,950
- Funds for the wedding...
- For economic reasons.

749
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,780
- For economic reasons.
- They haven't saved up.

750
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,880
- Funds...
- A home.

751
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,850
- They're not satisfied...
- They haven't saved up.

752
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,020
- They haven't saved up.
- Yes.

753
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,460
That's number four.

754
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,620
- What?
- Number four?

755
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,290
- We want the top three answers.
- Yes.

756
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,330
- "I haven't saved up."
- That's number four?

757
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,630
It's lower than I thought.

758
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,270
(They must guess
the top 3 answers to gain points.)

759
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,170
- Just 13.8 percent?
- Then...

760
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,440
We asked single people
in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.

761
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,040
- Try to think on their level.
- Let me answer!

762
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,210
Couldn't it be that
they haven't found their ideal type?

763
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,540
- I agree.
- It's not that.

764
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,680
- Freedom.
- What we said.

765
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,780
- Freedom.
- The loss of freedom.

766
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,510
- Okay, go with that.
- Freedom.

767
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,450
Because they like
their lifestyle, the freedom.

768
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,850
For fear their freedom
will be intruded upon.

769
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,790
Shoot. I wanted to say that.

770
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,790
"I'm afraid I can't enjoy life
as much as I do now."

771
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,090
- Number one.
- Yes.

772
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,220
It's number one.

773
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,560
(Number 1!)

774
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,960
- For real?
- I knew it!

775
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,060
- That's it.
- My lord.

776
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,200
- All four of us...
- Yes.

777
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,470
- That's it.
- That's right.

778
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,800
What we said was right.

779
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,570
- Yes.
- He was right.

780
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,540
- We all think the same thing.
- The result's right.

781
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,470
- We can do this.
- We're all single.

782
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,780
The result is right.

783
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,210
Did you like what I said?

784
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,110
You nailed the idea.

785
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,680
We must say what we think.

786
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,250
- Give our reasons.
- Yes.

787
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,050
- Good going.
- They're too young...

788
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,390
- or too old.
- Right.

789
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,690
I think one of the answers
is about disapproving parents.

790
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,560
- What?
- Parents who aren't happy.

791
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,260
- These days?
- Let me answer!

792
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,730
- The parents...
- They disapprove?

793
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,830
They're so much in love,
but their family disapproves.

794
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,060
- These days?
- Yes.

795
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,430
- I'm right.
- Because family disapproves.

796
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,040
- It's not up there.
- It's not there.

797
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
It wouldn't be.

798
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,440
- I guess it's an old reason.
- That's not a reason these days.

799
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,270
Disapproving parents
is an ancient issue.

800
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,270
- Is it?
- Like in the 80s.
That's a late-Joseon thing.

801
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,640
I think I'd reconsider marriage
if my parents disapproved.

802
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,380
Jae Seok, if it's about marriage,
kids are involved.

803
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,550
Something about kids.

804
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,120
- Yes, something about kids.
- Children.

805
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,580
- Kids.
- Childcare.

806
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,020
- The restraint.
- Childcare.

807
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,550
- The stress of childcare.
- That's a good one.

808
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,690
Doing all the work alone.

809
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,290
- Let me answer!
- Yes, go.

810
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,490
The stress of childcare.

811
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,090
- Childcare.
- The stress of childcare?

812
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,660
That was among the unranked answers.

813
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,030
(That was among
the unranked answers.)

814
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,360
- Okay.
- Let me answer!

815
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,070
- Let's go with this one.
- It's similar.

816
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,830
The fear, pressure
of raising a child.

817
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,170
That's what they said.

818
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,170
It's different!

819
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,370
- We said...
- It's different!

820
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,040
- There's an eraser in his head.
- That's what we said.

821
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,080
- It's different.
- Honestly, Seok Sam.

822
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,110
Is he a fool or something?

823
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,110
Don't stop me.
(Chuckling)

824
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,980
- Is he a fool?
- He said the same thing.

825
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,580
- Calm down.
- What is it?

826
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,920
- This is...
- Gather round.

827
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,890
- So far...
- It's about kids.

828
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,790
- It's about kids.
- The person they want to marry...

829
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,960
They're not confident
they can raise a kid?

830
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,860
They think the kid
will have a tough life.

831
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,000
I considered that at one time.

832
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,530
Good. They don't want to
leave the kids our world.

833
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,960
They don't want to
leave the kids our world?

834
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,930
- The kid will have a hard time.
- Did you think so?

835
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,200
I did.

836
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,070
- I think I'll cry.
- The thought...

837
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,470
of leaving my three kids
makes my heart ache.

838
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,770
That's sad.

839
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,880
- I thought of that at one time.
- It makes my heart ache.

840
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,280
- That's sad.
- I thought of that at one time.

841
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
- I'm tearing up.
- I was like that.

842
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,680
(The crybaby got too into it.)

843
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,750
- When I thought of my kid,
- Yes.

844
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,690
my heart ached when I thought
he'd live in such a tough world.

845
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,120
- I'm tearing up.
- My heart ached.

846
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,690
(Pouting)

847
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,330
- That was after I was married.
- You're really tearing up.

848
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,390
Why are you tearing up
all of a sudden?

849
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,260
It's a dad's heart.

850
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,630
Yes. Your dad felt the same.

851
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,630
Hey.

852
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,670
- It's not "Problematic Men."
- Ye Eun's about to cry.

853
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,940
- She cried about...
- Why did she cry?

854
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,940
- He said something sad.
- What did he say?

855
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,170
Let me answer.
The world's a tough place,

856
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,370
and my kid's life...

857
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,540
My goodness.

858
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,610
I don't want him to inherit that.
I'm worried.

859
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,650
Isn't that sad?

860
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,010
It's philosophical.

861
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,280
(It's sad,
but it's not on the list.)

862
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,420
Let me answer!

863
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,190
I don't want my family
to spend the money I earned.

864
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,250
Incorrect.

865
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,090
You shouldn't marry
if you feel that way.

866
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,760
(Gasping)

867
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,130
- Gosh.
- Was that too fake?

868
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,960
It's something about kids.

869
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,730
- Kids...
- Their appearance?

870
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,630
- Being selfish.
- No.

871
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,540
- Taking after...
- My kid might be like me.

872
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,200
Let me answer. My kid...

873
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,470
- He wants to answer.
- Me.

874
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,070
My kid might be like me.

875
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,780
- That would be a worry.
- I'd worry about that.

876
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,080
- You, Se Chan...
- They might live like me.

877
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,580
- My kid might be like me.
- Grow up to be like me.

878
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,150
It's number three.

879
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,950
(That's actually the answer?)

880
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,920
- That's what I said.
- Yes.

881
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,690
Talking about yourself works.

882
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,390
- Yes.
- Yes!

883
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,590
(I'm afraid my kid
will take after me.)

884
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,000
Yes. They might be like me.

885
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,030
- But...
- For real?

886
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,230
That's not about appearances.

887
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,070
- Overall.
- In general.

888
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,770
- Becoming like me.
- Me.

889
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,940
Growing up to be like me.

890
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,270
Regardless of how I look,

891
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,040
I don't want them
to live like I did.

892
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,380
- It's what moms say.
- Yes.

893
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,850
"Just wait until you have a kid
just like yourself."

894
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,750
You've already gained four points.

895
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,920
We'll win.
We just need the second answer.

896
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,180
We need number two.

897
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,920
We must get at least two points.

898
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,590
- Please, Seung Hwan.
- Number two.

899
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,560
- What could it be?
- Say anything.

900
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,060
- Give us a hint.
- Let me answer.

901
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,860
- Why would you hesitate...
- He wants to answer.

902
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,030
Seung Hwan.

903
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,660
They can't be in love forever?

904
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,570
- That's it.
- They can't be in love forever?

905
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,730
(No way...)

906
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,040
- They can't be in love forever.
- They might change.

907
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,840
- This one...
- It's number two.

908
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,740
Yes, that's number two.

909
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,110
(Number 2!)

910
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,840
(That's number 2?)

911
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,680
There's no forever love?

912
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,780
Yes.

913
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,280
- They don't think...
- Finding someone they like.

914
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,120
- What?
- This is shocking.

915
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,490
To be honest,
I worried about this too.

916
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,290
- To be really honest.
- You did?

917
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,090
They're afraid
they'll change their mind?

918
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,290
Change how?

919
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,360
You know,
these answers are so honest.

920
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,460
It's so direct.

921
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,160
- Things have changed.
- If we asked this years ago,

922
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,770
this answer wouldn't be number two.

923
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,300
- True.
- When I married my wife,

924
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,200
I never worried about meeting
someone I'd like even more.

925
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,700
- Look at you stutter.
- Well...

926
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,910
- It's so annoying.
- You noticed.

927
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,940
But people these days... Gosh.

928
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,080
- They're honest.
- They're direct.

929
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,910
- Did you get it, Seung Hwan?
- Yes.

930
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,080
Well done.

931
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,550
- I knew it.
- The young man got it right.

932
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,690
It could be the lyrics to a ballad.

933
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,920
- Lots of songs are like this.
- Yes.

934
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,690
Hold on. What's number six?

935
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,160
- Looking after a family...
- The in-laws.

936
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,630
- Yes.
- I knew it.

937
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,730
- Being immature.
- Yes.

938
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,470
- I see.
- So...

939
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,540
when people think about
getting married these days,

940
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,040
they put themselves at the center.

941
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,310
- Their lives are about themselves.
- Yes.

942
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,080
- Times have changed.
- Things have changed a lot.

943
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,280
You need to think about this,
Hyun Moo.

944
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,080
- You're getting older.
- Yes.

945
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,650
Being alone is an ugly sight.

946
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,380
- No.
- It really is.

947
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,650
Why are you
still an ugly sight, then?

948
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,690
- Yes.
- He's right.

949
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,290
- Hey.
- You punk.

950
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,160
How dare you...

951
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,160
You punk!

952
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,730
(He's like an uncle
upsetting the dinner table.)

953
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,800
My wife loves me so much.

954
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,200
(Prankster Yu
grabbed the back of his pants.)

955
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,210
His pants might fall down.

956
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,010
Why did you pull my pants?

957
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,740
Why are you
looking into renting an office?

958
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,580
- What?
- Are you?

959
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,850
Why look for a studio apartment?

960
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,480
- Can't I look into that?
- He's been...

961
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,780
looking for an office space.

962
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,320
- For a studio?
- He's...

963
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,590
He's always scrolling
real estate apps.

964
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,060
I'll make a studio of my own.

965
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,660
- A studio?
- To do what?

966
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,090
- Seok Jin.
- To play games.

967
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,730
- Driving arcade games.
- To be alone?

968
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,400
My private arcade.
This is what I want to do.

969
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,170
I'll rent space in an arcade...

970
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,070
and play loud music
after everyone goes home.

971
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,070
What about
wearing headphones at home?

972
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,170
You have your own room.

973
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,410
I have a study,
but it's still uncomfortable.

974
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,010
Having a study at all is awesome.

975
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,910
Haha, don't you have
a room to yourself?

976
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,080
I don't. The bathroom's my room.

977
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,380
- He has 3 kids.
- He's a dad of 3.

978
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,380
Yes.

979
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,420
(The dads
desperately need their own space.)

980
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,790
I have a room to myself.

981
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,890
- But it's different to go outside.
- Is it?

982
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,290
- Yes.
- One thing's for sure.

983
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,690
Coming here
put me off marriage even more.

984
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,560
- I'm so put off.
- Are you?

985
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,330
Don't be like that.

986
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,040
Let's move on to the next question.

987
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,000
This is a nice one.

988
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,440
- "What lie makes you feel guilty?"
- We can take all the points.

989
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,510
Lies?

990
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,480
- Being ill.
- Wait.

991
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,610
- Definitely. Let me answer.
- What is it?

992
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,280
Lies that make me feel guilty.
Lying about being sick.

993
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,850
- Yes.
- You?

994
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,590
- Did you tell this lie?
- When he feels fine,

995
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,790
but he wants to spend time alone...

996
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,120
- "I'm ill."
- He pretends to be ill.

997
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,790
That was in the unranked answers.

998
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,490
- It's not listed.
- What a shame.

999
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,590
We must tell the lies we told.

1000
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,260
- Let me answer.
- What is it?

1001
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,100
You meet a friend
of the opposite gender,

1002
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,830
but lie you're meeting someone
who is your gender.

1003
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,700
- That's you, isn't it?
- It comes from experience.

1004
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,940
Are you confessing? Hyun Moo.

1005
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,570
- Come clean right now.
- Come on.

1006
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,870
- Confess.
- Well...

1007
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,880
- It's in the past.
- I bet everything it happened.

1008
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,680
That's number four.

1009
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,780
- It's definitely up there.
- It's true.

1010
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,120
- It gets on their nerves.
- Let me answer!

1011
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,020
- What could it be?
- What's the answer?

1012
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,690
Lies that make you feel guilty.

1013
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,320
I have one!

1014
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,420
- You have one?
- Yes.

1015
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,660
- Speak up.
- Let me answer!

1016
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,030
- Ye Eun.
- Let me answer.

1017
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,660
"You're my first."

1018
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,200
- What?
- First what?

1019
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,630
- Hey!
- Who would believe that?

1020
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,270
- It's true!
- She told that lie before.

1021
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,070
- You're a fraud.
- She's talking about herself.

1022
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,370
- Did you say that?
- My first whatever.

1023
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,070
- Movies...
- "I haven't seen this movie."

1024
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,680
"I've never been to this restaurant.
I've never kissed."

1025
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,780
- A padlock on Namsan Tower...
- She's really something.

1026
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,980
- "You're my first whatever."
- That's a fun answer.

1027
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
- It's there.
- It's there.

1028
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,550
- Please.
- It's similar.

1029
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,490
That's number five.

1030
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,660
- Number five.
- You'll never make money.

1031
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,690
I've said that before.

1032
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,860
I took my new girlfriend
to a place my ex had taken me.

1033
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,160
I was saying things like,
"Hey, it's really nice here."

1034
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,460
The server said, "You're back."

1035
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,300
(You're back.)

1036
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,470
Me too. That happened to me too.

1037
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,970
- I felt horrible.
- The employee messed up.

1038
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:15,970
I left my car with the valet.

1039
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,640
- How tactless.
- The valet attendant went,

1040
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,680
- "You're back."
- Seriously?

1041
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,680
- Hyun Moo too.
- Hey, you...
- Yes, the valet attendant said so.
- Hyun Moo...

1042
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,010
- "You got a new car."
- A new car?

1043
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,280
- "You got a new car."
- Oh, right.

1044
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,320
- Really, man? You went back?
- That's impressive.

1045
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,180
- The opposite might be true too.
- Not a first kiss.

1046
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,920
What about pretending like
you've done something when you haven't?

1047
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,990
(The opposite)

1048
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,020
(Pretending to have experience
when you actually don't?)

1049
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,390
- Pretending to have experience.
- Okay, let me answer.

1050
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,460
- Pretending to have experience.
- Pretending to have experience.

1051
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,460
- "I'm a great kisser."
- Yes.

1052
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,030
- Whatever it is.
- Acting like you have experience.

1053
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,090
- Pretending to be experienced.
- Yes, right.

1054
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,330
- Second place.
- That's right!

1055
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,960
(Acting like a player, but this
is actually your first girlfriend.)

1056
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,170
Thank you, Ye Eun!

1057
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,430
- Why are you so good at this?
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1058
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,930
- You're right.
- "You're my first kiss."

1059
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,900
- Something like this exists?
- Gosh, acting like a player.

1060
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,970
It's the opposite.

1061
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,710
- I never would've imagined.
- I guess it's important.

1062
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,310
- Gosh, I'm literally shocked.
- So, this is...

1063
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,380
- But...
- This being in second place...

1064
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,910
- haven't you done this before?
- I can totally understand why.

1065
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,280
- Well, if you let on...
- Oh, really?

1066
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,380
- it's your first relationship...
- Right, I guess...

1067
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,680
- it might be embarrassing.
- It is.

1068
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,380
It's like saying,
"I've dated plenty of girls."

1069
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,850
- Right.
- "You're not my first."

1070
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,820
- That's right.
- But you're shaking on the inside.

1071
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,520
Our experiences actually helped us
earlier too.

1072
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,760
Talk about a lie
that makes you feel guilty.

1073
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,430
- Let's talk among ourselves.
- Right.

1074
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,090
I have something like this. So, I...

1075
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,300
I can't drink alcohol,

1076
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,760
so I usually play a lot of games.

1077
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,270
But when someone contacts me
during a game, it can be bothersome.

1078
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,830
So, I say that my phone was off.

1079
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,640
You turned it off on purpose,
didn't you?

1080
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,740
"I ran out of battery!"

1081
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,310
What was that, all of a sudden?

1082
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,440
- "My phone was dead."
- Yes, that!

1083
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,740
- "I ran out of battery."
- It died.

1084
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,240
- Let me answer.
- I'll go.

1085
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,380
Saying that
your phone was out of battery...

1086
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,210
- is in the unranked answers.
- Let me answer.

1087
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,550
Also, the people who participated in
the survey were in their 20s to 40s.

1088
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,050
- Think about how young people act.
- Let me answer.

1089
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,920
- Let me answer.
- Yes.

1090
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,660
(Right then, the youngest person
raises his hand.)

1091
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,630
Calling on speakerphone...

1092
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,030
and looking at something else
on your phone.

1093
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,930
- That's it.
- He's right. I'm sure it's right.

1094
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,030
(Did MZ Seung Hwan do it again?)

1095
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,200
That is...

1096
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,100
- correct.
- My goodness.

1097
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,500
- He's good at this.
- On speakerphone...

1098
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,240
You're calling on speakerphone
and playing games.

1099
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,500
- I've done this before too.
- Oh, right.

1100
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,370
- Right.
- That's right.

1101
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,010
- I've done this too.
- I have as well.

1102
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,280
- I have.
- True.

1103
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,440
- Yes.
- Honestly, I have done it.

1104
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,510
Now,
only the first-place answer remains.

1105
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,980
- This is too hard.
- You're just three points apart.

1106
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,350
- It is hard.
- This team has to get it correct...

1107
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,580
- Oh, my.
- In order to tie.

1108
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,290
- You will be tied, then.
- The game is basically over.

1109
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,590
What could there be?

1110
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,620
Let me answer. You have two phones.

1111
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,120
Come on.

1112
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,730
It's a dish your ex cooked for you,

1113
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,530
but you pretend like you're
making it yourself for the first time.

1114
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,730
- Let me answer.
- What is it?

1115
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,430
"I'm going to marry you."

1116
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,300
- "I'm going to marry you."
- It's on the list.

1117
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,840
- "You're my last love."
- This is it.

1118
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,070
That was in sixth place.

1119
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,870
People these days just state...

1120
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,910
human nature from deep within
out loud.

1121
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,080
Let me answer.

1122
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,410
(Let me answer.)

1123
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,150
Saying you don't have money
for the date.

1124
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,920
- What? You don't have money?
- You don't have money.

1125
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,380
- Asking to split the bill?
- Not having money?

1126
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,850
That was in first place.

1127
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,820
- That's how it is these days.
- Gosh, really?

1128
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,850
- That was in first place?
- All right.

1129
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,190
Back in my day,

1130
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,320
- I paid for everything.
- Me too.

1131
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,030
Gosh, but they're so honest.

1132
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,160
- We asked young people,
- They're incredibly honest.

1133
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,330
- from those in their early 20s.
- I guess so.

1134
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,300
So, the final result...

1135
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,070
- was 9 to 3. Team Lord Yu wins.
- Okay!

1136
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,100
(Team Lord Yu wins!)

1137
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,770
This is nice.

1138
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,610
So, what did you say
the lords will change?

1139
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,040
The lord of the winning team...

1140
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,710
may change the market price
of two crops of his choosing...

1141
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,050
by raising or lowering them.

1142
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,980
The price of the crops...

1143
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,250
will be decided...

1144
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,390
by the lord in secret,
depending on who wins the mission.

1145
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,550
Oh, in secret.

1146
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,490
The slaves may go to the field...

1147
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,360
and harvest the crops
in order of rank.

1148
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,290
- We have to go first.
- Only slaves can enter the field,

1149
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,860
and the number of crops
you can harvest...

1150
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,430
will only be known
to the slaves as well.

1151
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,370
- So, we don't get to go there?
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1152
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:31,970
- But it's my field. I can't go?
- Right. The lords...

1153
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,070
are not allowed to enter.

1154
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,740
The lord may distribute...

1155
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,840
the crops brought back by the slaves
however he sees fit.

1156
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,870
- Okay.
- All right.

1157
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,910
The lord of the winning team...

1158
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,580
may change the market price
of two crops of his choosing...

1159
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,910
by raising or lowering them.

1160
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,780
But in return,
the lord of the losing team...

1161
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,990
may check the market price
of one crop...

1162
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,950
- of his choosing. Yes, just check.
- Just check?

1163
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,690
But if the slaves work together,

1164
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,990
we can definitely
bring the lords down.

1165
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,130
- Do the lords know the price?
- With this kind of mindset...

1166
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,830
I would never think such a thing.

1167
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,560
- All right.
- How can I trust you?

1168
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,630
Lord Yu, you may go first...

1169
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:04,100
- and decide the crop prices.
- Okay.

1170
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,370
(Price adjustment 1)

1171
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,300
(Lord Yu sets off first.)

1172
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,070
Currently, all crops cost one nyang.

1173
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,980
You may increase or decrease
the prices by a huge difference...

1174
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,640
of two crops.

1175
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,410
If you choose to raise the price,
it will cost five nyang.

1176
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,650
If you choose to lower the price,
it will cost zero nyang.

1177
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,420
All right, then.

1178
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,590
(Current prices: Carrot 1 nyang,
potato 1 nyang,)

1179
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,720
(onion 1 nyang, scallion 1 nyang)

1180
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,620
What do I have a lot of right now?

1181
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,460
(2 onions, 1 scallion,
2 potatoes, 3 carrots)

1182
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,090
Wait a minute.

1183
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,660
I should raise the price of carrots.

1184
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,430
Let's raise the carrot prices...

1185
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,700
(He increases the price of carrots
first as he has many of them.)

1186
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,270
Wait, so Ssaebssaeb and...

1187
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,940
(Se Chan: Scallion 1 and onion 1,
Ji Hyo: potato 1,)

1188
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,740
(Daniel: onion 1,
Hyun Moo: scallion 1)

1189
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,640
(Current prices: carrot 5 nyang,
potato 1 nyang)

1190
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,880
I'll lower the onion price.

1191
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,710
Onions.

1192
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,650
(He lowers the price of onions
since the slaves have many of them.)

1193
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,620
Onions. Yes.

1194
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,590
I think...

1195
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,250
(Lord Ha can only check the price
of 1 crop.)

1196
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,320
That guy has a specific target.

1197
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:03,290
All Se Chan has
on his mind right now...

1198
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,960
is to bring down the lords.

1199
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,600
I saw an onion in Se Chan's hand.

1200
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,270
Onion.

1201
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,470
The market price of onions
is zero nyang.

1202
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,500
(Haha reads Jae Seok's mind
and checks that the onion is 0 nyang.)

1203
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,640
Okay.

1204
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,640
(What results will the crop price
adjustment bring about?)

1205
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,010
This entire place is
full of distrust.

1206
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,180
(What results will the crop price
adjustment bring about?)

1207
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,150
- Lord Ha.
- What were you all doing?

1208
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,150
So, the slaves will now go
to the field...

1209
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,320
and harvest the crops.

1210
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,350
- Let me tell you something.
- What?

1211
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,190
- You may go now.
- Do all four of them go?

1212
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,560
- Only pick the onions.
- Do they cost a lot?

1213
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,560
(Lord Ha tells them to only pick
onions which cost 0 nyang.)

1214
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,660
Really?

1215
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,190
Why are you acting like this?

1216
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,560
But he has no reason to lie.

1217
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,060
Of course I don't. That's because...

1218
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,860
I also have to become rich myself.

1219
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,130
That's true.

1220
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,770
Okay.
I'm really going to do that, then.

1221
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,500
- We have to be selfish.
- Okay.

1222
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,540
- I'm really doing that.
- Just go for one thing.

1223
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,610
- Okay.
- Got it?

1224
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,440
(As he tries to protect his position
even if he goes broke...)

1225
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,510
- Jae Seok.
- Yes, all of them.

1226
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,710
What should we harvest?

1227
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,680
- That's a good question.
- Really?

1228
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,310
- What should we harvest?
- What should we harvest?

1229
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,080
- Harvest a variety of stuff.
- The number is set.

1230
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,950
You're being so vague.

1231
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,190
Okay, you're not going to say it,
are you?

1232
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,320
No.

1233
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,390
- Still, you have to tell us one...
- Just get a variety.

1234
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,820
to focus on so that we can...

1235
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,390
Jae Seok,
we're competing against them.

1236
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,890
I could choose between
crashing the price...

1237
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,500
or raising the price,

1238
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,800
- but I didn't crash anything.
- These two...

1239
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,870
- We can't trust anyone now.
- Go on.

1240
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,170
This is confusing.

1241
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,170
What should I get?

1242
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,540
Seok Jin, we have to work together.

1243
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,870
- We have to come together.
- Of course.

1244
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,070
- We have to, no matter what.
- We have to work together.

1245
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,670
- Seung Hwan, let's bring them down.
- We need to drive them out.

1246
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,310
I mean, Slave Jee...

1247
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,310
You used to be a nobleman.

1248
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,380
I'm a nobleman.

1249
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,950
- Jun Hyun Moo too.
- Those guys...

1250
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,650
Slave Jun used to be a nobleman too.

1251
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,220
- Those jerks, seriously...
- Let's overthrow them.

1252
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,750
- We have to get rid of them.
- Hyun Moo is royalty.

1253
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,750
He used to be royalty.

1254
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,490
All right. Let's go.

1255
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,820
Let's go. Let's take them down.

1256
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,290
Check it out

1257
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,060
(The field is ready for them
next to the palace.)

1258
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,460
Oh, is this how it's set up?

1259
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,460
"Lords not allowed."

1260
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,530
It's a communal field.

1261
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,170
But we don't know which prices
are up right now.

1262
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Awesome.

1263
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,970
What should I get from the field?

1264
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,100
I'm not sure, but...

1265
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,910
- Okay, take one of these first.
- All right.

1266
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,310
- This...
- Can we use these however we want?

1267
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,340
- Okay.
- Yes.

1268
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,340
The winning team can harvest
up to 15 crops...

1269
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,280
- and the losing team up to ten.
- That over there...

1270
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,750
- Okay.
- By the way, so...

1271
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,480
If we take these,

1272
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,150
will Jae Seok take them all?

1273
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,890
So, we could either hand them
all over,

1274
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,620
or we could pocket a few too.

1275
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,820
- Something not too obvious.
- They don't know...

1276
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,420
- that we can get 15 crops, right?
- They don't.

1277
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,060
But what if he finds out
how many they have?

1278
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,230
(The lords don't know
how many crops they can harvest.)

1279
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,960
- Seok Jin. Look.
- Seok Jin.

1280
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,860
Seok Jin, let me tell you something.
So, there's no need...

1281
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,300
- to give the lord everything.
- You can't give him everything.

1282
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,570
- You don't have to give him any.
- We can each pocket some...

1283
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,840
- Because they don't know...
- and give them the rest.

1284
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
You're right.

1285
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,270
- They don't know if we got 10 or 9.
- Yes, you're right.

1286
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,310
- We're the only ones who know.
- I'm sure they are...

1287
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,180
- Are we serving these up to them?
- Yes.

1288
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,580
- We have to.
- Is it all right living as a slave?

1289
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,220
- No.
- There is a way for you...

1290
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,820
- to take the lord's position.
- Yes, what is it?

1291
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,890
If you look to the side,
there's a secret store.

1292
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,320
You may purchase a slave stamp...

1293
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,860
and mark the lord's name tag.

1294
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,020
Then, your class and the crops
you own will be switched right away.

1295
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,190
(You must switch both class
and crops with the lord.)

1296
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,700
You may buy the stamp
with the crops you own.

1297
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,700
- How many does it cost?
- How many?

1298
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,900
The price of the stamp
is at the store.

1299
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,630
- Do these have different prices?
- Yes, that's right.

1300
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,870
If we take these over there now,

1301
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,540
we can figure out the market price.

1302
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,770
No matter how hard we try to
maintain our noble status,

1303
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,980
it won't be easy.

1304
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,110
- They'll throw a coup d'etat.
- Yes.

1305
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,380
- Over here...
- We have to...

1306
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,780
- This one. Yes.
- Are you sure?

1307
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,850
I trust him. I really do.

1308
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,620
(Lord Ha tricked them and said to
get onions which cost 0 nyang.)

1309
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,650
- Wait.
- But...

1310
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,920
- I trust him, really.
- Okay.

1311
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,190
Let's trust him this time.

1312
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,360
- You can only take onions too.
- Six, seven,

1313
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,420
- Or you can mix scallions...
- eight...

1314
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,890
- Should we take a carrot too?
- No.

1315
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,290
- Let's trust him. Yes.
- All of them?

1316
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,630
- I trust him.
- Are we really going all-in?

1317
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,360
- You want to go all-in?
- All-in.

1318
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,430
- Just trust me.
- Two,

1319
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,000
- I really trust him. Totally.
- four, six... Why...

1320
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,500
- I...
- Do you trust Lord Ha?

1321
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,840
(Do you trust Lord Ha?)

1322
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,770
- Still, let's take one of each.
- No.

1323
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,970
- Seok Jin.
- For real?

1324
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,510
Let's trust him. Really.

1325
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,480
- Why do you trust him so much?
- I just do.

1326
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,380
- Also...
- Okay, let's go!

1327
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,450
- Wait.
- Yes.

1328
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:45,080
- Let's see how much they get.
- Let's see how much it is.

1329
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,480
- Act like we're going to be allies.
- Then, we'll see how much that is.

1330
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,020
Then, with all of these crops,

1331
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,390
- let's hang onto them for now.
- Okay.

1332
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,450
Okay, let's go!

1333
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,060
(We are open.)

1334
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,060
- We're here.
- Let's trust him.

1335
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,560
Will you please present
the crops you have to trade?

1336
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,030
- How many onions do you have?
- Ten.

1337
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,200
- Ten onions?
- Yes.

1338
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,870
Unfortunately, with ten onions,

1339
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,840
- you cannot purchase a stamp.
- Darn it.

1340
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,870
See, you fool?

1341
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,540
Oh, what is this?

1342
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,740
I told you
the price of this wasn't raised.

1343
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,910
Wasn't it?

1344
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,310
- Hear me out.
- What's most expensive, then?

1345
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,710
- I'll explain what happened.
- Sure.

1346
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,320
Lord Ha understood the situation...

1347
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,820
and saw that telling us
what was costly...

1348
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,150
could put him at risk
of being overthrown.

1349
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,390
That's why he told us to buy
whatever cost the least.

1350
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:31,030
- He wouldn't have.
- That's the truth, Seung Hwan.

1351
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,930
- All of these...
- That's how variety shows are.

1352
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,430
- Seok Jin, no way.
- That's how it is, Seung Hwan.

1353
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,600
You fools.

1354
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,270
We should tell them though.

1355
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,500
- Let's tell them.
- Sure.

1356
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,800
Guys, wait up.

1357
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,800
- I'll tell you what happened.
- What is it?

1358
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,970
- To be honest...
- We need to swap these.

1359
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,610
- He used us.
- We failed.

1360
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,640
- What is that?
- We can't buy the stamp.

1361
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,610
- Why not?
- He told us to only get onions.

1362
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,680
- What happened?
- Don't get any onions.

1363
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,880
This must not cost a lot.

1364
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,650
Toss all the onions you have.

1365
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,990
- Se Chan, it's the carrots.
- The carrots, right?

1366
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,320
(Unlike others, Slave Jun
saw through his master's plan.)

1367
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,560
You and Se Chan both have scallions.

1368
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,320
Jae Seok wouldn't have raised
its price.

1369
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:03,990
- How about this?
- That would put him...

1370
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,090
at a disadvantage.

1371
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,130
Let's take a potato and carrots.

1372
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,630
Two potatoes and one carrot.

1373
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,730
I'll take 2 potatoes and 1 carrot.

1374
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,270
I'll take 2 scallions and 1 carrot.

1375
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,470
Can we go and ask?

1376
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,200
- Let's ask.
- Can we swap?

1377
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,610
Show me the goods you want to trade,

1378
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,240
- and I'll tell you if it's enough.
- Wait.

1379
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,810
- Give him the carrots.
- The carrots.

1380
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:21,880
Give him three carrots.

1381
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,010
These are all the carrots I have.

1382
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,780
- We'll present two carrots.
- Good.

1383
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,720
(2 carrots and 1 potato
are worth 11 nyang.)

1384
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,050
Unfortunately, it's not enough.

1385
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,190
How about 3 scallions,
2 carrots, and 1 potato?

1386
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,220
Are we giving everything up?

1387
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,390
(3 scallions, 2 carrots,
and 1 potato are worth 14 nyang.)

1388
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,390
It's not enough.

1389
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,430
- No way.
- How much is it?

1390
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,460
How much is the stamp?

1391
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,760
They'll be able to buy it.

1392
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,100
(60 nyang)

1393
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,330
(They can buy it with 12 carrots.)

1394
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,100
- Three potatoes...
- That's a lot.

1395
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,570
- and three carrots.
- It's not enough.

1396
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,740
Three potatoes, three carrots,

1397
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,110
- and three scallions.
- It's not enough.

1398
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,010
- How much is the stamp?
- What the...

1399
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,110
- All we have won't be enough.
- What are you saying?

1400
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,950
We have ten onions.

1401
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,150
I have three.

1402
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,050
- We'll keep 3 each and give him 1.
- Exactly.

1403
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,320
- One each?
- We'll say we harvested four...

1404
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,620
and kept one each.

1405
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,020
(They even match their stories.)

1406
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,730
- Lord Ha, come on.
- Unbelievable.

1407
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:12,230
- How could you?
- We put our trust in you...

1408
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,630
and did our best to make a living.

1409
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,360
- What is it?
- How could you?

1410
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,570
- What's wrong?
- How could you?

1411
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:17,900
- I seriously...
- Just look at Seung Hwan.

1412
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,500
I trusted you,
and now I'm disappointed.

1413
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,370
- Why?
- Anyway,

1414
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:22,770
since our team lost...

1415
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:23,910
(Sticking to script)

1416
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,440
- We couldn't harvest much.
- Exactly.

1417
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,380
- Only onions.
- We could only take four.

1418
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,280
- So we took one each.
- We took one each...

1419
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,480
- and returned with one for you.
- Is that why...

1420
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,280
- I get it now.
- This is frustrating.

1421
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,320
(Their acting
has been flawless so far.)

1422
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,320
Why did you harvest so many onions?

1423
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:42,560
(Slave Ji's sack is bulging.)

1424
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,690
(Laughing)

1425
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,590
- We didn't harvest a lot.
- What's with the onions?

1426
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,000
- Unbelievable.
- Look at Ye Eun.

1427
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,570
How hilarious is her sack?

1428
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,400
It's so funny.

1429
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,640
I'm in tears.

1430
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:55,300
This is hilarious.

1431
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,810
- Unbelievable.
- They can't buy the stamp.

1432
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,510
(Lord Ha is letting it slide
since onions are worth 0 nyang.)

1433
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,850
What about my team?
Why aren't they back?

1434
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,410
- That's it.
- Let's hide what we got.

1435
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:05,780
Where should we hide them?

1436
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,850
In the shed.

1437
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,780
Let's not steal from each other.

1438
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,320
- Let's not steal from each other.
- Not from each other.

1439
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,350
- That'd be insane.
- Se Chan, don't steal from us.

1440
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,090
- You have a reputation.
- If you do,

1441
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,190
I'll make you pay.

1442
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,190
- Don't worry.
- Sure.

1443
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,960
- That's Seok Jin's.
- Can we look inside?

1444
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,330
(They head to the shed
after getting Se Chan's word...)

1445
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:21,930
(The sheds don't have doors
that can be locked.)

1446
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,570
- Just hide one of them.
- Just one?

1447
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,470
(Se Chan throws in a carrot
for the others to see.)

1448
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:30,640
(The rest is kept in his sack.)

1449
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,210
(After seeing what Se Chan did...)

1450
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:42,150
(Newbie Hyun Moo relaxes
and puts his goods in the shed.)

1451
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,920
(Scanning complete)

1452
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,990
It's the same
as keeping these outside.

1453
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,590
(Will Hyun Moo's produce be safe?)

1454
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,090
(The scallions are sticking out.)

1455
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:51,160
Let's please not steal...

1456
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,100
- from each other.
- Let's not do that.

1457
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,830
We'll be working together
on other shows.

1458
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:55,830
I won't take yours.

1459
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,000
I'll end up hating you.

1460
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,300
- Got it. Hyun Moo.
- You...

1461
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,870
- We see each other every week.
- You have to see me on Thursdays.

1462
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,500
- Exactly. So how could I steal...
- You'd be a monster.

1463
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,810
from you?

1464
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,540
It took us a while.

1465
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,840
- Goodness.
- Are you back?

1466
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,640
- What took you so long?
- The shed isn't secure.

1467
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,850
- Tell me about it.
- The shed...

1468
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,050
Hold on a second.
Why do you only have that much?

1469
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,180
- What?
- What?

1470
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,820
- Shouldn't you have more?
- We only got what we worked for,

1471
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,050
- but that wasn't a lot.
- Right.

1472
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,420
We were able to get this much...

1473
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,260
- only because we won.
- Even though we won...

1474
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,560
This is considered a lot.

1475
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,560
This is all that you harvested?

1476
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,360
Lord Yu, we did our best.

1477
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,930
Lord Yu, you said
you'd hand them out.

1478
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,430
- Go on.
- Let's see.

1479
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,330
- I'll give half of this.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1480
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,300
The price could change though.

1481
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,640
- It could change.
- Of course.

1482
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,870
- Take it.
- Thanks.

1483
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,940
You have completed
the first round of harvesting.

1484
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,440
- You'll wait here.
- Sure.

1485
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,180
Here we go. One, two, three.

1486
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,680
(They rest before the next game.)

1487
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,490
(Hyun Moo absentmindedly
heads to the restroom...)

1488
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:51,890
(They make their move.)

1489
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,390
(What the pampered show host
didn't know...)

1490
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,560
(Variety shows keep running
even when they're on break.)

1491
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,270
(They immediately betray Hyun Moo.)

1492
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:08,470
(Se Chan takes his back too.)

1493
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,540
Did you take everything?

1494
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,640
(They also steal from Daniel.)

1495
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,080
Se Chan, shouldn't we hide ours?

1496
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,210
We should.

1497
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,610
(They steal from a fellow member
and even the guest.)

1498
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,820
(He even steals from Ji Hyo
when she's not looking.)

1499
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,560
- Did you get everything?
- I did.

1500
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,230
Let's keep these with us
during the earlier rounds.

1501
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,700
- Sure.
- We'll keep these on us.

1502
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:42,070
(After the two thieving slaves
rummage through the sheds...)

1503
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,780
(Lord Yu comes out to check
moments later.)

1504
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,180
Nothing's here.

1505
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,680
Everything's gone already.

1506
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,120
Unbelievable.

1507
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,190
(Observing the crime scene)

1508
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,720
They couldn't have hid them here.

1509
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,590
Yours are missing.
Someone took them.

1510
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:01,860
- Mine?
- Yes.

1511
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,660
(Lord Yu shows concern
for the thief.)

1512
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:04,930
Someone took yours.

1513
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,230
Someone stole yours.

1514
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,260
Ours?

1515
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,170
(This all happened in 3 minutes.)

1516
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,000
- I approve.
- This is insane.

1517
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
The shed.

1518
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,240
A lot of your sheds are empty.

1519
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,740
- We'll move on...
- What?

1520
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,070
- to the second game.
- Tell us how to play.

1521
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:20,040
Here's the second mission.

1522
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,380
- It's The Uncommunicative Chef.
- What's that?

1523
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,050
One person from each team...

1524
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,680
will cook relay style
for five minutes...

1525
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,020
to finish two dishes.

1526
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,490
We should know what we're cooking.

1527
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:33,920
The dish will only be revealed
to the first person cooking.

1528
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,460
- From the second person onward,
- We'll be in the dark.

1529
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,730
- you'll have to guess the dish...
- We won't know what we're cooking.

1530
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,330
- and keep cooking based on...
- No way.

1531
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,060
- what the previous cooks made.
- How is that possible?

1532
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,400
Can we check our phones?

1533
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,430
No, you'll have to cook
without checking your phones.

1534
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,800
- In the Joseon Dynasty?
- Don't you know what year this is?

1535
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,540
- The setting is the Joseon period.
- Hey!

1536
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,910
- Can't we check YouTube?
- You can't.

1537
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,210
- We can't?
- He's from the future.

1538
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,740
He's from modern times.

1539
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,880
- If what you cooked...
- I know how to make curry.

1540
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,450
matches the keyword,

1541
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:59,580
you will win five points per dish.

1542
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,020
If you end in a tie,
the staff will decide the winner...

1543
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,220
after tasting the dishes.

1544
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,860
For the team of four,

1545
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,230
the last person
will have ten minutes to cook.

1546
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:12,360
You're allowed to decide...

1547
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,030
- the order you'll be cooking in.
- Okay.

1548
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,930
I won't cook much of the dish...

1549
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,670
- but will leave clues.
- Clues?

1550
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,070
You'll drop clues
about what the dishes are?

1551
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,170
It's important you get them.

1552
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:23,210
I'm going to cheat as much as I can.

1553
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,470
- We only get five minutes each.
- Do we all cook?

1554
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,340
The first person needs
to set everything so that...

1555
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,380
- we can guess what the dishes are.
- Exactly.

1556
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,280
If it's a stew,
let it show by making a broth.

1557
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,980
If you only chop up some kimchi,

1558
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,620
we could think
it's kimchi fried rice.

1559
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,390
Place the main ingredient
so we can see it.

1560
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:37,690
People call me Mooden Ramsay.

1561
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,160
Make sure the others
know what to cook.

1562
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,390
- What was that?
- Mooden Ramsay.

1563
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,890
- Who'll go last?
- I'll wrap up the dishes.

1564
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:44,030
- Yes, you do that.
- Okay.

1565
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,030
Should this be the order?

1566
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,530
It all depends on the first cook.

1567
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:47,930
The first cooks will step forward.

1568
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,730
- Go, Hyun Moo.
- This is the crucial step.

1569
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,430
- Hyun Moo.
- Do we cook indoors?

1570
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,530
The cookoff begins.

1571
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:53,970
Slave Moo,
you have to do a good job.

1572
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:56,640
Haha, don't forget
to leave us clues.

1573
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,110
- Got it. Clues.
- Leave us clues.

1574
00:48:58,370 --> 00:48:59,470
Is this where we cook?

1575
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,740
(The showdown will take place
in the yard.)

1576
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:05,050
(Various cooking tools...)

1577
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:07,520
(and ingredients
that have been washed)

1578
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:10,750
(The kitchen at the lord's estate
is as fancy as the royal kitchen.)

1579
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:12,450
(They start by putting on
spit guards.)

1580
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,690
Do we begin right away?

1581
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,830
You're wearing it upside down.

1582
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,500
Let me see. How were you wearing it?

1583
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
He stuck his nose in there.

1584
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,130
He's flimsy too, isn't he?

1585
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:25,900
No wonder
I couldn't breathe properly.

1586
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,170
So that's how you wear it. Okay.

1587
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:31,510
These are the dishes you must cook.

1588
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,380
Only you'll see it.

1589
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,980
Those who come after
won't get the chance.

1590
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,310
These are the dishes you must cook.

1591
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,980
Beef and radish soup
served at ancestral rites...

1592
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,820
and chopped octopus
with beef tartare...

1593
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,050
cooked with seasonal octopus.

1594
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,120
(Seasonal fall dish:
Chopped octopus with beef tartare)

1595
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,190
Where's the octopus?

1596
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:51,560
(Both dishes feature
a distinct main ingredient.)

1597
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,590
How can we cook those?

1598
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,130
Isn't there a recipe?

1599
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,500
There aren't any recipes.

1600
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,030
- This...
- Make them like in the picture.

1601
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,200
Let me see.
I don't have great vision.

1602
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,070
There are ingredients
on the countertops...

1603
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,240
and in the fridge.

1604
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,170
- The octopus must be in there.
- Use the ingredients you have...

1605
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,380
to cook the dishes.

1606
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,640
Beef and radish soup?

1607
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,110
You will have
only five minutes to cook,

1608
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,850
starting now.

1609
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,080
- I...
- Get ready.

1610
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,180
(The cookoff begins.)

1611
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,220
What do I have to do?

1612
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,550
Where's the beef? Where is it?

1613
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:20,960
- In there?
- The beef is in here.

1614
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,090
How stupid are you?

1615
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:24,730
- There's the octopus.
- The octopus.

1616
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,260
(Both cooks gather
the ingredients first.)

1617
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,670
(To let the others know
what the dishes are,)

1618
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:33,340
(it's crucial
to set out the ingredients.)

1619
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:34,770
All right.

1620
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,910
(Hyun Moo lays out the ingredients.)

1621
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:39,310
(Beef and radish soup:
Beef, radish, tofu)

1622
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:40,340
Where's the knife?

1623
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,810
The first cook has a lot to do.

1624
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,580
(Chopped octopus with beef tartare:
Beef, octopus, pear)

1625
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:46,950
Get moving.
There isn't a lot of time.

1626
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,120
(Lord Ha next door)

1627
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,220
(He lays out the ingredients
except the pear.)

1628
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,450
Okay, let's stir-fry this.

1629
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,890
Beef and radish soup.

1630
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,860
Where's the knife?

1631
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,890
(Lord Ha begins...)

1632
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:59,190
(by prepping the ingredients
for the beef and radish soup.)

1633
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,400
(He cuts the beef first.)

1634
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,070
I hope no one thinks
we're making curry.

1635
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:06,670
Tofu.

1636
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,570
(The chunks are larger
than what you'd find in soup.)

1637
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,910
I just have to spread it all out.

1638
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:12,510
That's good.

1639
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,640
(Next, he prepares the radish.)

1640
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:18,310
(The key is to slice them thinly.)

1641
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,480
Darn it.

1642
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:24,120
Honestly, the radish...

1643
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,490
The shape has to be kind of...

1644
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,220
(It looks rather different
from a normal radish soup.)

1645
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,060
(Slave Moo also prepares
the radish.)

1646
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,830
(Mooden Ramsay
cuts it up by the book.)

1647
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,160
I'm sure they'll know from this.

1648
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,940
I'm sure they'll be able to tell
that this is how they should cut it.

1649
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:41,840
Gosh, this is some good meat.

1650
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,910
(After that, he cuts off
a big chunk of meat too.)

1651
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,780
This means
they should slice it like this.

1652
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,410
Go like this.
Follow along with your instincts.

1653
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,750
- Do it like this.
- What do you think?

1654
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:57,350
(Mooden Ramsay focuses on setting up
the ingredients as per strategy.)

1655
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,060
Water.

1656
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,230
(Drinking water in a jug)

1657
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,890
(Groaning and lifting)

1658
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:07,930
What's wrong with him?

1659
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:10,870
That guy turned out to be
totally flimsy.

1660
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,470
(Struggling)

1661
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:18,410
(Jun Stew has only ever used
an island sink on his own.)

1662
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:21,210
(Wrestling with a water jug
which has never been in his cards before)

1663
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,980
Moo. What's up with him?

1664
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,550
(Panting)

1665
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,750
(Huffing and puffing)

1666
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,690
(He barely manages
to fill it up with water.)

1667
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,560
(Flicking)

1668
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:39,560
(Jun Stew has only ever used
a luxury induction stove on his own.)

1669
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,370
(He faces another obstacle
with the cheap gas burner.)

1670
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,930
(MC Moo is flustered from
the variety-style cooking conditions.)

1671
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:46,970
Hey. Shoot.

1672
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,440
It'll be confusing if you add water
from the beginning.

1673
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:53,210
Let's stir-fry this. Do that, and...

1674
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:55,540
For beef and radish soup,

1675
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,050
add sesame oil,
seasoned salt, black pepper...

1676
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,050
(He stir-fries the meat first
after adding sesame oil and seasonings.)

1677
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,350
Let's add the radish too.

1678
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:02,050
(He adds the chunks of radish
as well.)

1679
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:03,050
It's hot.

1680
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:06,050
(Still, he added
all of the main ingredients.)

1681
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,420
- Okay, you have 1 minute left.
- There's only 1 minute left?

1682
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,660
Oh, that's hot.

1683
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,330
(Neither of them has gotten started
on the chopped octopus.)

1684
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:16,730
The chopped octopus...

1685
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,970
Chopped octopus... Pear.

1686
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:21,370
(Chopped octopus with beef tartare
main ingredients)

1687
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:25,040
(Instead of preparing the octopus,
he chooses to set up the pear.)

1688
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,310
(He also grabs eggs
for the yolk garnish.)

1689
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:30,350
I'm sure they'll know
when they see the egg and octopus.

1690
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,510
Darn it.

1691
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,320
They won't add the pear to this,
will they?

1692
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,520
(Slicing the pears in a hurry)

1693
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,950
- All right. Ten, nine,
- These are separate from these.

1694
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,490
eight, seven,

1695
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:41,990
six, five,

1696
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,360
four, three,

1697
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,830
two...

1698
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,600
Please put everything down now.

1699
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,170
Please put that down, Hyun Moo.

1700
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,270
- Okay, please go inside right away.
- No.

1701
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,870
Oh, the octopus is alive.

1702
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,740
That might burn.
(Team Lord Ha: Set the octopus free,
Stir-frying beef and radish chunks)

1703
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,510
- Gosh, this is hard.
- We'll take care of that.

1704
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:01,880
This is hard.

1705
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,380
- You only set up the ingredients?
- It has to be obvious.

1706
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,120
Gosh, that was definitely
not enough time. What's this?

1707
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,550
(Will the next player be able to tell
what's on the menu?)

1708
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,150
(The members who are done cooking
get to watch from the monitor room.)

1709
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,760
Oh, they were watching.

1710
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,760
All right. The beef and radish soup.
I tried to make it obvious.

1711
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,530
The only dish you stir-fry beef in
sesame oil is beef and radish soup.

1712
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,030
This guy has quick wits, you know.

1713
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,470
He does. That's why
I set up the ingredients like that.

1714
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:28,440
What is this?
There's octopus. All right.

1715
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,440
What could this be?
Beef rump? This is...

1716
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,840
Seeing how there's meat...
We have the same menu.

1717
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,410
I'm going to make
beef and radish soup.

1718
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,140
That's right.

1719
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,010
(Ssaebssaeb catches on right away!
He continues Hyun Moo's prep work.)

1720
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,280
With this... Hang on.

1721
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,320
That's it. He figured it out.
He figured out the radish soup.

1722
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,920
Gosh, what... This...

1723
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,790
Oh, Yang Se Chan...

1724
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,830
He's got the hang of it.

1725
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,830
He knows his way around the kitchen.

1726
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,300
- He's a good cook.
- He is.

1727
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,400
- Good job.
- Gosh, he's really good at cooking.

1728
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:01,700
Beef, and this is Radish.
Beef and radish soup.

1729
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,540
But how do I make that?

1730
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:05,740
How am I supposed to make
beef and radish soup?

1731
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,480
Seung Hwan!
At least pour some water in there.

1732
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,640
- Do I add water?
- Not yet...

1733
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,650
(Thinking)

1734
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:12,950
(Dribbling)

1735
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,120
What kind of character is this kid,
Seung Hwan?

1736
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,120
He doesn't know how to do anything
besides singing.

1737
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:19,450
He's only good at singing.

1738
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,120
(His talent is only focused
in one area.)

1739
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,120
Oh, dear.

1740
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,660
(The 2nd player's time is up.)

1741
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,630
- You're done. Please put it down.
- There. It just has to simmer.

1742
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,900
- Please move to the monitor room.
- I'll leave the burner on.

1743
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,160
This is too hard.

1744
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,230
(The third player of
the relay cooking game enters.)

1745
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:31,370
Is this it?

1746
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:33,370
What is...

1747
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:34,570
(The third players:
Big Portions versus Food Fighter)

1748
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:35,600
- What?
- My gosh.

1749
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,470
I think I should add the octopus.
My gosh!

1750
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,710
- What's wrong?
- It's so gross! I can't touch it!

1751
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:40,910
(The live octopus
that Haha set free)

1752
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,310
Ji Hyo, it's an octopus!

1753
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,110
(Out of so many octopus dishes,
what will Food Fighter make?)

1754
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,050
- What is she doing?
- No way.

1755
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:48,220
- Why? What is she doing?
- I mean...

1756
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,650
Beef and octopus soup.

1757
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:53,220
- Hey! She put the octopus in there.
- My gosh.

1758
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,590
- Why did she add the octopus?
- What did she think it was?

1759
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:56,490
- I'm sure it tastes good, though.
- We're doomed.

1760
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:58,560
It's beef and octopus soup.

1761
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,330
What's with the pear?
Why is it halfway sliced?

1762
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,900
I should chop the pear first.

1763
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,630
Ji Hyo grabbed the pear first.
She must be thinking of adding it.

1764
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,570
But why did I slice the pear?

1765
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:08,640
(She somehow ends up
successfully slicing the pear.)

1766
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,940
Really, what is this?

1767
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:13,680
(The second kick of chopped octopus,
egg yolk)

1768
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,640
(Did Ji Hyo guess
the chopped octopus correctly?)

1769
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,150
Oh, no. She's beating the eggs.

1770
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,750
- She's making jeon.
- She's making jeon.

1771
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,080
- This is bad.
- No.

1772
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:24,150
What? What did she do there?

1773
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:25,350
Why did she beat the eggs?

1774
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,760
Okay,
please head to the monitor room.

1775
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,690
- What do I do?
- I just...

1776
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,030
Did you just touch the octopus?

1777
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:33,700
She added the whole octopus.

1778
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,860
- Ji Hyo.
- We're doomed.

1779
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:41,340
What is this dish?
Gosh, what are we making that...

1780
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,540
What kind of dish is this?

1781
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,740
Goodness, why is everything so wet?

1782
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:46,510
- What is this?
- Goodness.

1783
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:48,010
(The fourth players:
Lord Yu versus Slave Jee)

1784
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:50,510
- What is this?
- When Jae Seok sees that,

1785
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:51,910
- he'll guess beef and radish soup.
- Oh, no.

1786
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,380
This is beef and radish soup,
for sure.

1787
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,580
- There's another octopus, right?
- I think...

1788
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,480
- Right, he can chop that up.
- There's an octopus there.

1789
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,950
- As long as he chops the octopus...
- Why is it so...

1790
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:59,150
- What is this?
- What is it?

1791
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,520
Okay, are you ready? Get set, go.

1792
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,490
- Wait, what is this?
- Hang on. What is this?

1793
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:06,160
Beef...

1794
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,900
Oh, is this beef and radish soup?

1795
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,530
Hey,
he just said beef and radish soup.

1796
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:13,030
- Okay. Can you tell...
- He said beef and radish soup.

1797
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,070
- from his protruding mouth?
- Yes, I can.

1798
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:15,100
The chopped octopus...

1799
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,640
Wait, why are there beaten eggs?

1800
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,640
What is this?

1801
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,210
- Wait. Why did she do this?
- Why is the sesame oil here?

1802
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:23,340
- This... Why did she do this?
- The sesame oil... How is this...

1803
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,510
(It seems like radish soup,
but he's confused by the beaten eggs.)

1804
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,550
- Wait. This...
- If he adds that, he's a huge fool.

1805
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:31,290
Hang on. Octopus?
But there's beef in here.

1806
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:33,350
Then, is it beef and radish soup?

1807
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:34,890
(Will Lord Yu be able to save
the beef and radish soup?)

1808
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,160
Hang on. Octopus?
But there's beef in here.

1809
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,160
Then, is it beef and radish soup?

1810
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,860
(Pouring it all in)

1811
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,600
No!

1812
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,800
- Oh, Ji Hyo.
- That's the worst.

1813
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:49,670
- My gosh.
- I think we've won.

1814
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:50,670
(The huge disaster
started by Ji Hyo)

1815
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,140
Hey, but this does look like
it will taste good. Let me see.

1816
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,340
So,
this is beef and radish soup, right?

1817
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,210
I mean, what is this?

1818
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:59,980
Hang on. What is this? Octopus.

1819
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,220
Why is there an octopus in here?

1820
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,250
(Finding it odd)

1821
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,890
It looks like beef and radish soup,
but there's octopus in here.

1822
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:08,420
I just don't get it.

1823
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,460
Oh, it's an invigorating soup.
It has everything inside.

1824
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,300
I should taste it, though.

1825
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,230
(Then, how does it taste?)

1826
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,770
(Sounding disgusted)

1827
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:20,070
I should just add
some chili powder...

1828
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,500
and give it some spice.

1829
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,840
Let's make it
a spicy, invigorating soup.

1830
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,440
Why is he adding chili powder?

1831
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,780
- Oh, my.
- Did he just...

1832
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,040
- It looks nice and spicy.
- Right?

1833
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,980
This is... Okay.
It just has to boil now.

1834
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:36,150
This is an invigorating soup.
It's delicious.

1835
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,490
(Not knowing a thing, he brings
the invigorating soup back to life.)

1836
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:42,060
That's delicious! So good.

1837
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,560
Gosh, it's good.
Let's add some scallions.

1838
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,800
That's spicy fish stew.
Korean bullhead stew.

1839
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,200
- Seriously. It's spicy fish stew.
- Okay. Add the scallions.

1840
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:54,440
Why did she slice up the pear?
The pear...

1841
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:56,470
What was she trying to do
with the pear?

1842
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,740
(The egg soup chef is fixated
on the sliced pear this time.)

1843
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:00,780
Also, there seems to be
something with octopus.

1844
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,650
Oh, chopped octopus
with the pear. Right?

1845
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,050
It was meant for chopped octopus.

1846
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,320
But I can't touch live octopus.

1847
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:13,520
- Jae Seok can't touch it.
- I guess he can't.

1848
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,260
- Honestly, I can't either.
- Soy sauce.

1849
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,890
Gosh, Ji Hyo didn't touch it
before she left either.

1850
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:18,890
(At a loss)

1851
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:20,860
(First, he successfully
opens up the plastic bag.)

1852
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,160
Gosh, this is too big.

1853
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,000
(Sighing)

1854
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,770
What am I supposed to do
with the octopus?

1855
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,110
(Groaning)

1856
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,710
What is Jae Seok doing right now?

1857
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,880
- Is he going to keep it?
- I guess he'll keep it.

1858
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,340
As long as he takes that...

1859
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,910
I'm not sure how to make
chopped octopus.

1860
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,950
Let's just slice up the pears first.
This will...

1861
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,790
I'll leave Daniel
to take care of that.

1862
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:47,690
I'm just not sure
I can make chopped octopus.

1863
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,220
- Gosh, what is that guy doing?
- I think he's on the right track.

1864
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,390
- Jae Seok!
- Why is he...

1865
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,130
Okay, then...

1866
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:54,260
(Seok Sam is trying to guess
the second dish on the menu.)

1867
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:57,700
Then, the next dish will be this.

1868
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,040
There's flour.
Why would there be flour here?

1869
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:02,670
- Flour?
- What about the flour?

1870
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,140
Is he going to make sujebi?

1871
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,270
I've made up my mind.
This is an amazing dish.

1872
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:08,240
There are two dishes.
One of them is almost done.

1873
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,680
- Why did he grab flour?
- What will he do with flour?

1874
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,880
He'll do badly.

1875
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,450
An incredible dish...

1876
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:14,680
Will he make beef jeon?

1877
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,350
will come out.

1878
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:17,350
(It doesn't look anything like
chopped octopus.)
And...

1879
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,890
What is he doing?

1880
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:21,220
(Frustrated)

1881
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,490
It looks delicious.

1882
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,230
- What is he doing?
- It looks delicious.

1883
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,230
I'll make a truly delicious food,
you guys.

1884
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,130
I think I'm doing it right.

1885
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,600
- Seok Jin, stay where you are.
- Okay.

1886
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,470
- I...
- Jae Seok needs to be switched out.

1887
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:34,540
I...

1888
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,270
He didn't do anything!

1889
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:37,670
For goodness' sake.

1890
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:40,310
I'm sure Daniel will do well.

1891
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:41,380
(Lord Yu leaves
after adding eggs to the soup...)

1892
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,640
Jae Seok is unbelievable.

1893
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,680
(and slicing a pear.)

1894
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,580
- You're the last one.
- Okay.

1895
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:46,680
What's this?

1896
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:48,950
I don't have much time.

1897
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:50,390
I don't have much time.
What's this? Pear?

1898
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:51,450
(Seok Jin continues to cook.)

1899
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:52,490
What's this?

1900
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,290
Where are the eggs?

1901
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,360
Why did he put scallions
on the pan like that?

1902
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,200
(Is he sprinkling meat?)

1903
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,530
- What is Seok Jin doing?
- What is he doing?

1904
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,830
- What is he doing?
- What is he doing?

1905
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,100
He wants to make jeon.

1906
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:07,970
- Why are the meat pieces so big?
- What kind of jeon...

1907
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:08,970
is he making?

1908
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:11,110
- That meat won't get cooked.
- It won't get cooked.

1909
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,070
- It's beef tartare.
- It's too much.

1910
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:14,340
It's like mungtigi.

1911
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,250
Will he make it like that?

1912
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,910
(He pours the batter.)

1913
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:20,010
All right.

1914
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,620
It has to be this dish.

1915
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,650
(The dish he's making)

1916
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:23,820
Beef jeon.

1917
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,220
Beef and scallion jeon.

1918
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,760
Beef and green scallion jeon.

1919
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,460
(Seok Jin assumed that it was jeon.)

1920
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,160
Is that pizza or what?

1921
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,260
(Is that pizza or what?)

1922
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:35,230
How will we eat that?

1923
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:37,030
It'll be tasty once it's cooked.

1924
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:38,930
It'll be tasty once it's cooked.

1925
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:40,640
(In the end, both dishes became
completely different.)

1926
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,000
I don't know
if it'll be cooked in time.

1927
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,200
What's this?

1928
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,440
What kind of dish is this?

1929
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:45,710
Octopus?

1930
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,880
Octopus? He sliced a pear.

1931
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,080
A pear?

1932
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:51,080
Why did he slice a pear?

1933
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:53,250
What can you make with octopus?
Octopus.

1934
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:55,220
Chopped octopus.

1935
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,190
(Daniel figures out the menu.)

1936
01:01:58,490 --> 01:01:59,890
The legs...

1937
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:02,160
That's right. Chop the legs
to make the chopped octopus.

1938
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,560
He figured it out.

1939
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,730
There you go. That's it.

1940
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:06,630
- He's putting them in. That's it.
- Good.

1941
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:07,700
That's it.

1942
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,860
I haven't had chopped octopus.

1943
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,470
(However)

1944
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:13,070
Does chopped octopus contain...

1945
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:14,300
chili peppers?

1946
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,900
Does it contain chili peppers?

1947
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:18,710
He's good.

1948
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:20,710
He's good.

1949
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:23,210
(He adds spicy Cheongyang chili.)

1950
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:24,310
Chili peppers.

1951
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:26,050
Does it contain...

1952
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,280
soy sauce?

1953
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:30,150
Does chopped octopus contain
soy sauce?

1954
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:31,790
(Add soy sauce, sesame oil, salt,
sugar, minced garlic, and pepper.)

1955
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,690
I think it'll contain oil.

1956
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:34,790
Sesame oil.

1957
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,020
Does it contain minced garlic?

1958
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,160
(He adds the condiments
for savoriness.)

1959
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,230
Shall I add a bit?

1960
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:40,030
Sugar. Sugar makes things tasty.

1961
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:41,260
Sesame.

1962
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:43,130
- He's good at cooking.
- He's good at cooking.

1963
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:44,470
He's good.

1964
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,930
- Mix them. That's it.
- That's it.

1965
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,670
- That's chopped octopus.
- He's set.

1966
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:49,500
- Nice.
- That's chopped octopus.

1967
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,270
Daniel does things well
in the background.

1968
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:52,340
He's set.

1969
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:53,610
I just want Seok Jin to do...

1970
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:54,840
everything he wants to do...

1971
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,010
before he goes home.

1972
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:59,550
Now, please plate the dishes.

1973
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,650
All done.

1974
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,020
(Lord Yu's final dishes)

1975
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,380
I feel like I'm in Mokpo.

1976
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,020
- I think we're set.
- We're set.

1977
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:07,090
It looks like beef and radish soup.

1978
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:08,490
We also have chopped octopus.

1979
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:10,320
What's that? Is that buchimgae?

1980
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,790
(Lord Ha's final dishes)

1981
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:13,490
Is that beef and radish soup?

1982
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:15,530
Beef and radish soup
should be white in color.

1983
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:16,960
That's scallion jeon.

1984
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,130
We had incredible teamwork.

1985
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:21,200
We made beef and radish soup
and chopped octopus.

1986
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,400
- Those are what we imagined.
- Do they look perfect?

1987
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,740
- We're practically in Mokpo.
- Mokpo.

1988
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:28,480
- They look similar.
- They look similar.

1989
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,510
- Eggs.
- You put the yolk on the top.

1990
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:32,510
- That explains the egg.
- That's right.

1991
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:33,810
They must've had...

1992
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,980
a hint on the chopped octopus.

1993
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,020
- No, we didn't.
- No.

1994
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:39,390
- The conditions were the same.
- Hyun Moo put a pear on the table.

1995
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:40,560
- That's right.
- Listen.

1996
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,620
Also...

1997
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:42,790
- You should've put a pear there.
- Haha...

1998
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:44,560
- didn't put a pear on the table.
- Listen.

1999
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,390
Had you chopped the octopuses,

2000
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:47,660
I would've known
that it was chopped octopus.

2001
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:49,500
Had you chopped the octopuses,

2002
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,730
I would've known
that it was chopped octopus.

2003
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:53,130
What's this anyway?

2004
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:54,170
Is it flour cake?

2005
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:55,570
To be honest,

2006
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:58,010
I had no hint whatsoever.

2007
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:00,510
I didn't think the soup was done.

2008
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:02,240
- What are you talking about?
- This is an invigorating soup.

2009
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,850
- Yukgae invigorating soup.
- With meat and octopus?

2010
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:06,080
Yes. That was why I added...

2011
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,620
- meat and... Yes.
- Yukgaejang?

2012
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:09,280
- I made it spicy.
- He's making things up.

2013
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,990
This is yukgaejang.

2014
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:13,120
Like yukgaejang, I made it spicy.

2015
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,860
- This is scallion jeon.
- How is it yukgaejang?

2016
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:15,920
- But...
- I saw lots of scallions.

2017
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,190
why did you add meat like that?

2018
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:20,290
- It's beef and scallion jeon.
- But...

2019
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:23,030
Team Lord Yu won.

2020
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:24,770
(With a score of 4 to 0,
Team Lord Yu won.)

2021
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:26,200
- Well done.
- Thank you.

2022
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,300
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2023
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,900
Seeing the octopus and pear helped.

2024
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,100
That's right. Thank you.

2025
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,340
The second mission has ended.

2026
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,840
- I'm annoyed.
- Since Team Lord Yu won,

2027
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,910
Jae Seok can adjust
the price of two crops.

2028
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:37,910
I'll need to do well.

2029
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:42,920
Haha can adjust
the price of one crop.

2030
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,690
- Shall we do it now?
- Yes. Let's move right away.

2031
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:48,020
- I'm ruined.
- Adjust the prices well.

2032
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,690
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

2033
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,330
I'll be back.

2034
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:52,460
Go ahead.

2035
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:53,460
(2nd price adjustment)

2036
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:55,330
Hey, hurry up and change the lord.

2037
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:56,500
I don't have money to do that.

2038
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,700
- I can't do it alone.
- But...

2039
01:04:58,070 --> 01:04:59,730
There goes Hyun Moo.

2040
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,070
- Hyun Moo?
- He must have some crops.

2041
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:02,270
I stole Hyun Moo's crops already.

2042
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,270
Did you do that?

2043
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:06,040
(Jun Hyun Moo)

2044
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,540
(Gosh!)

2045
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,980
(Chuckling)

2046
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:11,910
Someone took mine.

2047
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:12,950
- Already?
- Yes.

2048
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:13,950
Are there no crops left?

2049
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,520
Everything got stolen.

2050
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,780
(Slave Hyun Moo finally realizes
that his crops are gone.)

2051
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,150
My shed is empty.

2052
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:19,520
Hyun Moo is nice.

2053
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,990
He hid them like I asked.

2054
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:24,260
Someone took mine.

2055
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,460
Hyun Moo, are yours gone?

2056
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:28,030
Hey, yours are gone too.

2057
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:29,660
It's Se Chan's doing.

2058
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:30,770
Se Chan's shed is empty too.

2059
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,730
- The other team took them.
- He hid them somewhere else.

2060
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,940
- Se Chan did? Is that allowed?
- Yes.

2061
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:36,640
(But he's on the same team.)

2062
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,270
He must've put the crops
in a plastic bag and buried them.

2063
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:40,880
He stole all the crops.

2064
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,010
Is that allowed?

2065
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:44,750
- Does this show have no rules?
- He stole all the crops.

2066
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:45,950
He stole all the crops.

2067
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:48,720
Here are the current prices.

2068
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,790
Carrot is 5 nyang,
potato is 1 nyang,

2069
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:52,990
scallion is 1 nyang,
and onion is 0 nyang.

2070
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,190
You can pick two crops...

2071
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:56,190
to increase or decrease the prices.

2072
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,490
(He can increase or decrease
the prices of two crops.)

2073
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:59,530
People expect me
to increase the price of carrots.

2074
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:00,930
(The slaves expect him to do that.)

2075
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:02,230
I'll increase the price
of the potato.

2076
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:05,070
(Current prices: Carrot 5 nyang,
potato 5 nyang,)

2077
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:07,770
(scallion 1 nyang, onion 0 nyang)

2078
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:10,240
I'll double the price of the potato.

2079
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,910
(He uses both chances on potato and
increases the price to 10 nyang.)

2080
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:14,110
Potato is 10 nyang,
carrot is 5 nyang,

2081
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:16,110
scallion is 1 nyang,
and onion is 0 nyang.

2082
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:19,850
All of my crops got stolen.

2083
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,350
(Meanwhile, the slaves are sitting
at the tavern.)

2084
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:22,880
- Did your crops get stolen?
- Yes.

2085
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,020
My shed is completely empty.

2086
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:26,850
All the crops are gone.

2087
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:27,990
Mine too?

2088
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,590
- All the crops are gone.
- All the sheds are empty.

2089
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,290
- All the crops are gone.
- The baskets are empty.

2090
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:32,430
Mine too?

2091
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:33,590
You're the most likely culprit.

2092
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:34,630
- It isn't me.
- It's you.

2093
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:36,300
- It's you.
- Stop suspecting me.

2094
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:37,630
That's why you need to carry them.

2095
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:39,430
But there are cameras
before the sheds.

2096
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:41,740
Who takes the crops despite that?

2097
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,270
They take the crops
because there are cameras.

2098
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:45,640
They're less than human.

2099
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,380
I'll give you
the current price of one crop.

2100
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,450
Really?

2101
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:54,620
The current price of onion...

2102
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:57,180
continues to be zero nyang.

2103
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,450
Is it the same?

2104
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,090
It's my strategy...

2105
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:01,460
to decrease the price for all crops.

2106
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:05,460
I'll decrease the prices
so that they can't change the lord.

2107
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:07,630
Thus, we can't make money.

2108
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:09,600
We'll be poor,
but I'll continue to be a lord.

2109
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:11,630
That's what I want.

2110
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:15,400
(He wants to stay as a lord
so that he'll avoid the penalty.)

2111
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,800
Carrot.

2112
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,970
- Crash the price?
- Crash the price.

2113
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:19,840
No, it isn't yours.

2114
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:21,680
- What's this? Hey.
- You.

2115
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,840
- No.
- Se Chan.

2116
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,040
(They're interrogating Se Chan.)

2117
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:26,210
You know that you need to see me
on Thursday, right?

2118
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,420
- Of course.
- Hey.

2119
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:28,680
You're less than human.

2120
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,920
- It's Haha's.
- Listen.

2121
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:31,090
Hey,

2122
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:32,690
- Slave Hyun Moo.
- "Special Reporter..."

2123
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:34,160
"25hr."

2124
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,590
We need to meet biweekly.

2125
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,160
- You guys have that chemistry.
- Yes, we do.

2126
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,660
- Hey.
- I can't.

2127
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:39,760
- Are you Santa Claus?
- I can't.

2128
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,760
No.

2129
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,930
- Are you Santa Claus?
- I can't show you.

2130
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:44,030
Now, you'll move...

2131
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:46,770
on to the second harvest.

2132
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:47,870
Let's go.

2133
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,800
Gosh, I'm so busy.

2134
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:51,040
My goodness.

2135
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,210
Lord Ha.

2136
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:55,480
Well,

2137
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,450
if you could tell me
which crop is expensive...

2138
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:59,610
Do it as you have.

2139
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:00,610
(He recommends onion.)

2140
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,780
- Shall we do it as we have?
- Yes.

2141
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:02,880
Onion?

2142
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:03,920
Onion.

2143
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:06,550
- Seriously.
- This is driving me crazy.

2144
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:10,260
- Which crops should we bring?
- Which crops should we bring?

2145
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,000
I'll be honest with you.

2146
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,130
Be honest with us.
Think about your image.

2147
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:20,330
Bring onions.

2148
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:21,370
We need scallions.

2149
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,370
We need scallions.

2150
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:25,270
- How is he on Running Man?
- Onions.

2151
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,940
- Jae Seok lies at times.
- Does he lie?

2152
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,540
- Onions.
- Onions. Okay.

2153
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,340
He's lying today.

2154
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:32,550
The prices have changed, right?

2155
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:34,320
We need to change the lords.

2156
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:38,120
- Hey, you...
- Se Chan.

2157
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,620
- You shouldn't do this to me.
- Hey.

2158
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,020
- Hey.
- These crops aren't yours.

2159
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:43,090
- Hey, I'm here as a guest.
- You promised not to do this.

2160
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:44,190
- These crops aren't yours.
- How could you steal from me?

2161
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:45,690
These crops aren't yours.
They're Haha's.

2162
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:47,130
- How did you steal Haha's?
- All of our crops are gone.

2163
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:48,200
I stole Haha's.

2164
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,300
- What?
- I stole Haha's.

2165
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:50,430
How did you steal Haha's?

2166
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:51,670
He had crops.

2167
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,830
- That's nonsense.
- Seriously.

2168
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:54,900
- He had crops. I'm serious.
- Hey.

2169
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,340
- It isn't like that.
- Listen.

2170
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,470
- Slave Jun.
- Yes?

2171
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:58,510
Why aren't you changing things up?

2172
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,510
- What?
- You have the stamp.
We need to change things up now.

2173
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:01,910
- Don't you have the stamp?
- We don't have the stamp.

2174
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:03,280
- Didn't you buy it earlier?
- No.

2175
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,850
- Why not?
- We didn't have enough money.

2176
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:05,910
We couldn't buy it.

2177
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,580
- Can we buy the stamp alone?
- How many?

2178
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:08,750
- How many can we take?
- Se Chan.

2179
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,350
- How many can we take?
- It's 15 for the winning team...

2180
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:11,550
and ten for the losing team.

2181
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:13,290
- It's meaningless.
- Okay.

2182
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:14,620
- Even if we win...
- Se Chan, come here.

2183
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,820
- Let's join forces.
- Okay.

2184
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,330
Let's join forces to take one...

2185
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:19,790
- of the lords down.
- Don't think about betraying us.

2186
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:21,830
(They decide to give the crops
to one person.)

2187
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:23,260
The slaves need to join forces.

2188
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:24,630
One potato.

2189
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:25,900
(Will they be able
to purchase the stamp and revolt?)

2190
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,100
- All done. Let's go.
- Let's go.

2191
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,170
Let's join forces.

2192
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,540
- Where have you guys been?
- There weren't...

2193
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:31,810
any crops in the field.

2194
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:33,270
- There was nothing.
- How is the field...

2195
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:34,880
- so barren?
- Why is the field like that?

2196
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,340
The field was in bad shape.

2197
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,350
I brought back the basket.

2198
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:40,250
- Seriously.
- You didn't bring back anything.

2199
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,050
- Why isn't Se Chan coming?
- Haha.

2200
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:43,320
He's digging the earth...

2201
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,920
- since there's nothing.
- Hey, where have you been?

2202
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,090
I had to check.
All my crops are gone.

2203
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:48,820
- What did you have to check?
- Se Chan.

2204
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:50,520
Although you went to the field...

2205
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,530
The second harvest is complete.

2206
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:56,830
You'll eat the dishes you've made
for lunch.

2207
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:58,300
But the winning team
will have a benefit.

2208
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,500
- Okay.
- What is it?

2209
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,870
You'll get a high-technology device
that's rare in Joseon Dynasty,

2210
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:03,300
so you can cook pork belly with it.

2211
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,540
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

2212
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,440
- My goodness.
- Nice.

2213
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,840
It's really nice.

2214
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:09,780
- This is incredible.
- It's my first time seeing it.

2215
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:12,210
It turns and cooks pork belly
on its own.

2216
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:13,610
- Hey.
- The meat won't lose its oil.

2217
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:15,280
(When they're focused on the device)

2218
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:16,880
This is incredible.

2219
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,820
(It's the stamp!)

2220
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:20,690
- This is incredible.
- Is it for cooking pork belly?

2221
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:22,120
- You can put it in here.
- Really?

2222
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:23,890
- It's actual pork belly.
- Do we just put it in here?

2223
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:25,560
- Do we just put it in here?
- Yes. It'll turn on its own.

2224
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,260
- Really?
- That's amazing. Really?

2225
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,660
It cooks the meat evenly.

2226
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:29,900
(He stamps the name tag!)

2227
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,430
(Yu Jae Seok)

2228
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:33,230
What...

2229
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,300
Hold on.

2230
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,710
- What was that?
- Please say it.

2231
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:39,110
Yu Jae Seok,

2232
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,440
Slave Yang Se Chan put a stamp
on your name tag...

2233
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,810
and made you a slave.

2234
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:44,780
- You punk!
- Yang Se Chan is...

2235
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:45,980
- the new lord.
- Is he the new lord?

2236
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:48,380
(Lord Yu gave one crop each.)

2237
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,380
(Lord Ha gave three crops each.)

2238
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,450
(He exploited the slaves
by paying them badly.)

2239
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:56,760
(Lord Yu beat his slaves regularly.)

2240
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:00,560
(The angry slaves collected money
and purchased a stamp.)

2241
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,060
(Slave Yang got selected...)

2242
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,730
(and succeeded in the rebellion!)

2243
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,600
Their statuses will be switched.

2244
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,170
Their properties
will get switched too.

2245
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,140
Here. Take this.

2246
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,110
Will their properties
get switched too?

2247
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:15,510
Their properties
will get switched too.

2248
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:16,610
The ones with a protruding mouth...

2249
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:18,980
- I mean...
- Gosh, he has collected a lot.

2250
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,180
Bring me the key.

2251
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:22,650
For goodness' sake.

2252
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:24,420
See? You should've been
more generous.

2253
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,750
- Seriously.
- You became a slave.

2254
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:28,390
I think they took our crops.

2255
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:30,290
- Se Chan must've taken them.
- Seriously.

2256
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:31,960
Seriously. I couldn't...

2257
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:34,600
- I couldn't buy the stamp.
- You couldn't do that.

2258
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:37,460
(During the amicable 2nd harvest,)

2259
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,770
(the lords suddenly called
for the slaves.)

2260
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:46,340
(Seok Jin and Ye Eun trusted
Seung Hwan with the crops.)

2261
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:50,980
(You live alone anyway.)

2262
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:55,080
(To live alone, he hid the crops!)

2263
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,020
(He hid all the crops.)

2264
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:01,120
- Where are the crops?
- I ran into bandits.

2265
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,390
- What?
- Bandits.

2266
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:03,690
Did you buy the stamp?

2267
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:05,430
Bandits suddenly appeared.

2268
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:06,790
- Did they take the crops?
- They're gone.

2269
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:08,560
They stole everything
while I was preoccupied.

2270
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,530
(Seok Jin and Ye Eun got betrayed
by the rookie slave.)

2271
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:13,600
You're on this side, right?

2272
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,600
(Will he keep them hidden
until the end?)

2273
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,040
The ones with a protruding mouth...

2274
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,140
Take off the clothes.

2275
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:19,470
(Jae Seok changes
to the slave outfit.)

2276
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:20,870
Grasshopper, sit down.

2277
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,140
(Hyun Moo talks down to him
right away.)

2278
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,880
- Grasshopper, sit down.
- Both of us...

2279
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:26,150
- Grasshopper.
- Both of us are slaves.

2280
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:27,480
- I'm your senior.
- Newbie.

2281
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,850
Pork belly looks tasty.

2282
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,850
- It looks tasty.
- For goodness' sake.

2283
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:33,450
- It looks tasty.
- Hey, glasses.

2284
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:35,260
Don't show your back to the cameras!

2285
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,320
"Hey, glasses."

2286
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:37,660
Glasses.

2287
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:41,300
(Pork belly goes into the machine.)

2288
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,360
- This is good.
- Newbie is good at this.

2289
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,670
It turns on its own.

2290
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:47,070
- The smell is insane.
- You don't need to do any work.

2291
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:49,470
Oil doesn't splatter everywhere.
It's clean.

2292
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:50,570
Oil doesn't splatter.

2293
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:52,210
- We don't need to turn the pieces.
- It doesn't even smell.

2294
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:53,970
- It does things automatically.
- As it turns,

2295
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,410
it'll cook the meat evenly.

2296
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:58,080
The newbie slave's voice
is too loud.

2297
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,650
- What?
- The newbie slave.

2298
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:03,320
Lord Yang is unhappy about
the newbie slave's loud voice.

2299
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:05,890
- All right, Lord Yang.
- Go over there.

2300
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:07,820
Don't think about sitting with us.
Go over there.

2301
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,960
- Come here.
- How...

2302
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,690
- Come here.
- How will we set the table?

2303
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:13,130
- Bring the table here.
- But...

2304
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:14,500
Come here.

2305
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,860
The smell is insane.

2306
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:16,960
Open the machine.

2307
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,600
- That's right.
- I'll open it, Lord Yang.

2308
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,670
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

2309
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:22,670
It's no joke.

2310
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,040
(The meat is glossy
and nicely cooked.)

2311
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,010
This is amazing. This is incredible.

2312
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:28,640
- It's fully cooked.
- It looks so tasty.

2313
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:30,640
- It got cooked evenly.
- I'll try it.

2314
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:32,650
Is it cooked already?

2315
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:35,850
No way.

2316
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:39,020
- It's so tasty.
- How did you season it?

2317
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:40,650
- Gosh!
- It's so tasty.

2318
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:42,890
It's so tasty.

2319
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:44,890
- It's so tasty.
- It tastes like boiled pork slices.

2320
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:46,590
- Yes.
- It tastes like grilled pork too.

2321
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,760
It's so tasty.

2322
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,160
- This is incredible.
- It's nicely cooked.

2323
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,160
It's so tasty.

2324
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,770
The meat is tasty.

2325
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:52,800
Try it.

2326
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,540
The meat is tasty. Try it.

2327
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:55,740
- Seriously.
- That device is amazing.

2328
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:56,940
It doesn't look tasty, Seok Jin.

2329
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:00,140
(Team Lord Ha has
Slave Jee's dishes for lunch.)

2330
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:01,340
I want pork belly.

2331
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,310
- This is incredible.
- I'm curious.

2332
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:04,480
This is amazing.

2333
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,580
- Eat up, newbie.
- It's nice.

2334
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:08,580
(Their eyes are on the dish
they can't have.)

2335
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:10,220
- It's tasty.
- It's really tasty.

2336
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:11,890
- Seriously.
- It's really tasty, right?

2337
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:13,950
The meat is really tasty.

2338
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,420
Please give us a few pieces
in exchange for scallions.

2339
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,660
Give me a break.

2340
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:19,490
(They have a break
before the next game.)

2341
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,500
There can't be anything here.

2342
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,230
All the sheds are empty.

2343
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:27,430
Where did they hide the crops?

2344
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,340
These places are empty.

2345
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,870
(He goes through
the nooks and crannies.)

2346
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:34,980
At a place like this...

2347
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:39,380
(He even goes through
the staff members' bags.)

2348
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:41,450
These are the staff members' bags.

2349
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:43,650
They hide things here.

2350
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,150
(The camera team's equipment bag)

2351
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:51,960
(At that moment,)

2352
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,190
(he finds something!)

2353
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:54,660
There are only a few.

2354
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,870
(Lord Yang hid the crops
with similar hiding skills...)

2355
01:14:57,870 --> 01:15:00,970
(back when he was a slave.)

2356
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,700
There are only a few.

2357
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:07,570
(Will Slave Yu be able
to get back up on his feet?)

2358
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:10,040
Aren't they too heavy
to carry around?

2359
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,040
You should give them to me.

2360
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,480
I can't do that...

2361
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,880
- because you might run with them.
- That's ridiculous.

2362
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,880
Gosh, now we've got
a water mission to do.

2363
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:18,150
- With a water carrier...
- I'm exhausted.

2364
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:20,620
- Please keep this.
- For goodness' sake.

2365
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:21,990
(Lord Hang leaves the crops
with the production crew.)

2366
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:23,520
You can't touch it.

2367
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:25,630
- Why not?
- I'm keeping it here.

2368
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:27,190
- Why?
- You can't rob the bank.

2369
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:29,000
- Is this the bank?
- You can't touch what's here.

2370
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,600
- I see.
- You've collected many crops.

2371
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:34,770
Hyun Moo, are you carrying
everything in your bag?

2372
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:35,940
(Yes.)

2373
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:37,240
Why are you doing this?

2374
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,310
I plan to eat them later.

2375
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:40,410
Look at Seung Hwan.
He never puts down his bag.

2376
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:42,940
- Why don't you put it down?
- I need to work out.

2377
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:44,750
I'll explain the last mission.

2378
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:45,780
- The last mission is...
- Okay.

2379
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:47,750
the Lord's Water Jar.

2380
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:49,580
You'll bring water
using a water carrier.

2381
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:52,090
The team that fills up the water jar
with more water will win.

2382
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:55,890
You'll have a relay for ten minutes.

2383
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:57,120
I haven't done this in a while.

2384
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,490
- It's fun, right?
- Seriously.

2385
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,290
It's fun.

2386
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,760
The team that brings water
with a water carrier...

2387
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,230
and fills up the water jar
with more water will win.

2388
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:08,570
There will be obstacles
on the path to the water jar.

2389
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:11,640
You must go through all obstacles.

2390
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,610
You can't go around them.

2391
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:16,480
Today is a difficult day,
so Jong Kook got lucky.

2392
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,010
- Seriously.
- For real.

2393
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:19,780
Today is a difficult day.
The weather is hot too.

2394
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:21,350
You know that I hate this
the most, right?

2395
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,620
- The guests had no luck.
- I need air conditioning.

2396
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,350
Why are you making me do this?

2397
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,750
Seriously.

2398
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,420
- Don't you guys watch a video?
- Seriously.

2399
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,560
He keeps saying that.

2400
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,190
He's like a plant in a greenhouse.

2401
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:32,890
I think he lost a bit of weight.

2402
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:34,900
- He did lose a bit of weight.
- I'll get ruined.

2403
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:36,830
You should go back
to the hair salon.

2404
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:39,070
I know. I should go back
to the hair salon.

2405
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:40,170
Seriously.

2406
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:41,800
- Don't you guys watch a video?
- Seriously.

2407
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,270
- Go when we tell you to.
- That's too fast.

2408
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:45,870
(Round 1 is between
Team Lord Ha's Slave Ji)

2409
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:47,810
Don't go that way. Go to the front.

2410
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:49,510
- That's too fast.
- Don't go to the back.

2411
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:50,640
- There you go.
- That's too fast.

2412
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,850
- Now.
- Go when it hits the ground.

2413
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,010
Go when it hits the ground.

2414
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,080
- There you go.
- There you go. Go.

2415
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:57,420
- Just step on it.
- I don't think I can do it.

2416
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,420
- It's too scary.
- Jump over it.

2417
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,520
- Go.
- Jump over it.

2418
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:04,390
- Don't get scared.
- Jump over it.

2419
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:06,730
Jump over it.

2420
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,030
- For goodness' sake.
- For goodness' sake.

2421
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:10,500
- He's clumsy.
- You spilled the water!

2422
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,630
I can't believe it.

2423
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:13,770
He can't do it
since he's always in the studio.

2424
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:15,270
- For goodness' sake.
- Come on.

2425
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:16,440
He's like Yeong Goo.

2426
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:19,070
(It looks like Hyun Moo is dancing.)

2427
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:20,740
- Come on.
- He can't use his body.

2428
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:22,980
- Hyun Moo.
- Hyun Moo, what are you doing?

2429
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:24,750
- Use your brain.
- There you go.

2430
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:25,750
Come here.

2431
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,410
Studio Jun, hurry up.

2432
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:28,580
- Okay.
- There you go.

2433
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,480
- You look cool.
- That's right. You're still young.

2434
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,250
- That's good. Come here.
- There you go.

2435
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,550
- There you go.
- Jump roping.

2436
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:35,290
There you go. You're in your prime.

2437
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:36,860
Come on, Studio Jun!

2438
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:38,890
- Slowly.
- Jump over it.

2439
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:40,160
There you go.

2440
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,630
Hurry up. Pour the water inside.

2441
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:44,000
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

2442
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,200
(He arrives before passing out!)

2443
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,370
(Slave Ji follows him.)

2444
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:48,370
- Go past it.
- Come on.

2445
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:50,370
(Screaming)

2446
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:51,740
It hurts.

2447
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:53,240
(Slave Ji gets whipped.)

2448
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,340
Look at Ji Hyo.

2449
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:56,410
Okay.

2450
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:58,350
(Team Lord Ha's Seung Hwan
arrives quickly.)

2451
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:00,610
- There you go.
- Pour it in.

2452
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:02,180
- Hurry up and pour it in.
- Ye Eun, pour it in.

2453
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,720
- Okay.
- Slaves, use your brain.

2454
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:05,850
Go.

2455
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,190
- This is so hard.
- Gosh.

2456
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:09,490
(Team Lord Haha, Team Lord Se Chan)

2457
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:12,130
- It's no joke.
- It's my turn.

2458
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:13,860
- All right.
- Step on it.

2459
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:15,960
- All right.
- There you go. That's good.

2460
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:18,000
Seok Jin, hurry up.

2461
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:19,700
He isn't on my team.

2462
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:21,700
Seok Jin, sit down. There you go.

2463
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,070
That's a lot of water.

2464
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,440
(Spilling)

2465
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,310
- Hey.
- Nice.

2466
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:29,840
(Bumping)

2467
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,210
It hit his nose.

2468
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,710
That little...

2469
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:34,710
Kick him.

2470
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,050
(Slave Big Nose attacks back.)

2471
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:37,180
They're fighting.

2472
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:40,350
(A dogfight begins.)

2473
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:41,690
It's a ruckus.

2474
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:43,560
- It got messy.
- It's a ruckus.

2475
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,230
- It's a ruckus.
- Their combined age is 100.

2476
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:46,960
(The game turns into a watersport.)

2477
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,260
It's a dogfight.

2478
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:49,730
It has begun!

2479
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,670
- Let's go!
- It has begun!

2480
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:52,730
Let's go!

2481
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,800
It's a party!

2482
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,270
- This is what you call a party!
- Nice!

2483
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:58,670
- It's a party!
- This is what you call a party!

2484
01:18:58,670 --> 01:18:59,710
(The middle-aged slaves
go back to their childhood.)

2485
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:03,080
- All right.
- It's the slaves' rebellion.

2486
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:05,480
The slaves are playing well.

2487
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,880
(The two slaves forget
about the competition...)

2488
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,250
(and lose their minds.)

2489
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:09,820
- There you go.
- The front.

2490
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:10,920
He's using his brain.

2491
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,390
- There you go.
- That's better.

2492
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:13,590
- That's better.
- That's better.

2493
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:14,820
- He won't be able to jump rope.
- That's better.

2494
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:17,590
- Thirty seconds remain.
- Thirty seconds. Hurry up.

2495
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:18,930
Haha doesn't have a lot of hair.

2496
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:20,530
- Seriously.
- He doesn't have a lot of hair.

2497
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,830
- Jump.
- He should jump sideways.

2498
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:25,500
There you go.

2499
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:27,700
(Lord Yang drops one bucket.)

2500
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:30,200
- There you go.
- He'll succeed in it.

2501
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,470
(If Lord Ha does well,
he'll be able to win!)

2502
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:32,510
Okay.

2503
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:36,040
(He enters the jump roping section
as he drools!)

2504
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:37,680
One.

2505
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:39,450
- Okay.
- He did well.

2506
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,350
(Now, he needs to pour water
into the jar!)

2507
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:43,780
- Hurry up.
- Pour it in.

2508
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:45,950
Come on.

2509
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,520
(He spills it.)

2510
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:51,020
(Screaming)

2511
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:52,890
No!

2512
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,660
- For goodness' sake!
- You greedy man!

2513
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,700
(The game ends.)

2514
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:59,570
I'm so annoyed.

2515
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,400
In the last mission,

2516
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,800
Team Lord Yang won again.

2517
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,870
- Good.
- Team Lord Yang won.

2518
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:10,840
As for Team Lord Ha,
they lost three times in a row.

2519
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,580
You can make a final adjustment
to the crop prices.

2520
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:15,420
- They can adjust the prices.
- You will go...

2521
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:16,850
- and adjust the prices now.
- Okay.

2522
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:18,320
- The bag.
- The bag.

2523
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,250
There's nothing of value.

2524
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:23,020
You can increase
or decrease the prices...

2525
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,320
of two crops of your choice.

2526
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,890
The potatoes cost ten nyang.

2527
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,860
Onions and carrots cost nothing,
and scallions cost one nyang.

2528
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:32,000
Jae Seok put them all
on the potatoes.

2529
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:34,400
I'll make the price of this crash.

2530
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,200
- Potatoes?
- The potatoes will cost nothing.

2531
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,040
(Potato prices crash
from 10 nyang to 0 nyang.)

2532
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,070
Onions.

2533
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:40,370
(Onions increase to 5 nyang.)

2534
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:42,380
- Did you decide?
- I did.

2535
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:46,110
Let's be fair and clean at the end.

2536
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:47,210
Tell me.

2537
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:48,320
- What...
- Tell us. Let's be clean.

2538
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,080
If I tell you,
you'll make me a slave.

2539
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:52,890
It's better to avoid the penalty.

2540
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:54,520
It's better to win.
If we win, two slaves...

2541
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,490
- will be exempted.
- Our team should win against them.

2542
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:57,560
- After all,
- If Lord Ha didn't play...

2543
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,660
with the prices, it's the carrots.

2544
01:20:58,660 --> 01:20:59,760
I increased the carrot prices.

2545
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,430
(He lies that he raised
the price of carrots.)

2546
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:04,000
- Who?
- I did.

2547
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:05,500
- You can adjust two crop prices.
- I just did for one.

2548
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,670
- Are you lying again?
- I reduced the price of one.

2549
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:08,170
- No. You changed the potato prices.
- Yes.

2550
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:10,470
I decreased the potato prices
and increased the carrot prices.

2551
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:12,640
- You did?
- But if they...

2552
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:13,840
do otherwise, we wouldn't know.

2553
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,540
I heard they were going to increase
the onion prices.

2554
01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:17,010
- Really?
- Yes.

2555
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:19,510
Ye Eun has many onions there.

2556
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,880
They probably did that
to benefit their member.

2557
01:21:22,450 --> 01:21:24,320
- That's all they can do.
- Right.

2558
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:28,420
Since you lost, you can check
the price of one crop...

2559
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:31,060
and only increase the price
of one crop.

2560
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:32,630
- I can only increase the price?
- Yes.

2561
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:34,160
What's the price of onions now?

2562
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,660
Onions cost five nyang.

2563
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:38,030
- Pardon?
- Five nyang.

2564
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:39,400
(The price of onions increased
after being zero for a long time.)

2565
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,070
- Five nyang?
- Yes.

2566
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:43,970
Then we might win if we do well.

2567
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:46,610
They only have onions now.

2568
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:47,970
So I was going to drop
the onion prices.

2569
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:49,780
But come to think of it,
this is the final round.

2570
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,510
We no longer change the lords.

2571
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:53,380
- They could change.
- Really?

2572
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:56,480
(Current prices:
onion 5 nyang, scallion 1 nyang,)

2573
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,590
(carrot 0 nyang, potato 0 nyang)

2574
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:02,060
I'll raise the price of potatoes.

2575
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:03,690
(He increases the price of potatoes
that he owns in abundance.)

2576
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:06,130
Hold on. Then the onions...

2577
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:08,430
I should say it like this.

2578
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:11,330
I raised the onion prices.
That's what I should say.

2579
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,870
- Then the onions...
- Then they would sell the onions.

2580
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:16,200
I have to do this
in order to buy them.

2581
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:20,210
(His devious laughter begins.)

2582
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,910
- Why is he coming with a smile?
- No.

2583
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:27,380
He's already... Do you trust him?

2584
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:29,150
I don't trust him.
I don't trust him now.

2585
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:31,420
- He's laughing.
- Come here.

2586
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:33,890
- It's true.
- Let's go.

2587
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:36,890
I thought we would have more onions,

2588
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:38,890
so I increased the onion prices.

2589
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:40,730
- I'm telling the truth.
- Then why are you laughing?

2590
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:43,730
I feel good. It feels good to win.

2591
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,200
I'm serious. Seok Jin.

2592
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:48,840
- I'm telling the truth.
- This is annoying.

2593
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,210
(He heard the onion prices
were 0 nyang at the first check.)

2594
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:56,740
(He deceives them right away.)

2595
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:59,450
(The slaves were fooled
because they trusted him.)

2596
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:02,550
(He confirmed that the onion prices
were 0 nyang at the 2nd check.)

2597
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:04,550
(Just keep going with onions.)

2598
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:08,860
(He kept telling them
to get the 0-nyang onions.)

2599
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:10,560
- You trust him?
- Hey.

2600
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,060
I promise. Fine?

2601
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:14,330
- I promise.
- Seriously.

2602
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:15,830
Look at the result later.

2603
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:18,600
- See how Lord Ha betrays you.
- I'm not betraying you.

2604
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,700
- It's weird.
- We'll go and harvest.

2605
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:22,000
Don't get just the onions.

2606
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,540
Are we not going to get the onions?

2607
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:28,110
He could have told us
to get the onions on purpose.

2608
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:29,240
- He could have said that...
- Was it five?

2609
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,340
so we didn't dig up onions.

2610
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:32,980
- Was it ten?
- No. We shouldn't get the onions.

2611
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:34,250
He was laughing.

2612
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:36,880
- He made us think like that.
- But...

2613
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,750
Let's just get what we think
is right.

2614
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,050
- Okay.
- Also,

2615
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:43,060
- let's not give it to Lord Ha.
- Okay.

2616
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,060
Let's keep everything.

2617
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,690
I'm sure the lords will be replaced.

2618
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:50,730
That can't happen.
I have a really good plan now.

2619
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,900
- I've been with Se Chan for a day,
- Yes.

2620
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:55,670
- and he lies all the time.
- Goodness. He's...

2621
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:57,540
- It was serious.
- He's almost...

2622
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:58,610
- I mean...
- about to be arrested.

2623
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:00,540
He doesn't care about the team.

2624
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:03,740
I don't know what Haha did
at the end.

2625
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:06,450
This time, the team that won
can harvest 20 crops.

2626
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:08,110
- Twenty?
- Let's harvest twenty.

2627
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:10,050
Are we going to stamp it?

2628
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,490
- Let's buy the stamp...
- Let's do it.

2629
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:14,750
Will we get 20 carrots
or choose different crops?

2630
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,890
Shall we get 10 carrots
and 10 potatoes?

2631
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:19,430
Jae Seok has many carrots
and potatoes.

2632
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:21,060
- They belonged to Se Chan before.
- He brought a lot.

2633
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:24,600
I think Se Chan would have increased
their prices because he has many.

2634
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:25,870
Since he has many of them?

2635
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:27,870
Then shall we get many carrots?

2636
01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:30,140
Do you think Se Chan
really raised the carrot prices?

2637
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,870
- In my opinion...
- Yes?

2638
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:34,010
They said they'd raised
the onion prices.

2639
01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:35,110
But do you believe that?

2640
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,880
Haha said he was going to raise it.

2641
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,150
(We have many onions.)

2642
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:40,350
(Okay.)

2643
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:46,520
(Daniel heard the news about onions
by looking down from his height.)

2644
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,590
(Go away. Leave.)

2645
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,660
- You want us to get the onions?
- Shall we?

2646
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,590
- Onions?
- Let's drop these and get these.

2647
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:56,060
- We won't take the carrots?
- We won't. Let's do this.

2648
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:57,060
- Eight,
- Nine,

2649
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:58,100
- ten.
- ten.

2650
01:24:58,100 --> 01:24:59,270
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2651
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:01,900
How many do we need to get a stamp?

2652
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:04,200
- Let me check.
- We brought ten each.

2653
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:06,140
Should I place these first?

2654
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,440
So you have ten onions...

2655
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,240
- and ten potatoes.
- Yes.

2656
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,040
You can purchase the stamp...

2657
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,310
- with these.
- Yes.

2658
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:14,150
(They can purchase the stamp
because they switched to onions.)

2659
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:15,480
Please give them to me.

2660
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,780
Since the four of you
did it together,

2661
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:19,250
we'll draw lots to decide
who will take the stamp.

2662
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:21,120
- You can take it.
- What is it?

2663
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,960
(They have to become a lord
to be exempted from the penalty.)

2664
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:27,230
(Who will become the final lord?)

2665
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:30,630
Goodness.

2666
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:32,430
(Yu Jae Seok was picked.)

2667
01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:34,700
What is this?

2668
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,240
(Jae Seok
gets the noble title again!)

2669
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,870
Then give them to us.

2670
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:40,010
You should give us the potatoes.
You will become the lord.

2671
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,540
They will get changed.
Se Chan will take those.

2672
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,440
Okay.

2673
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,480
Jae Seok.

2674
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,880
- Lord Yang.
- Lord Yang.

2675
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,020
Lord Yang went
to look for the slaves' crops.

2676
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,120
- What?
- Where is Lord Yang?

2677
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:55,560
(He came to look for the crops
that were already taken...)

2678
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,790
I hid them here.

2679
01:25:56,790 --> 01:25:57,890
(without knowing the situation.)

2680
01:25:57,890 --> 01:25:59,330
Someone stole them?

2681
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:01,160
Why did you get greedy again?

2682
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,360
You're all very greedy.

2683
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,270
- I know.
- The rich are worse.

2684
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:06,700
- You're really...
- That's what I'm saying.

2685
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,670
- Did he go to look for ours?
- To look for ours.

2686
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:10,340
He went to look for ours
in that time?

2687
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:12,070
- You really can't trust him.
- You really can't.

2688
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:16,080
- We're also...
- Lord Yang is really horrible.

2689
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,780
What was that?

2690
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:20,750
(He stamped it!)

2691
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:21,850
What was that?

2692
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,350
- I stamped it.
- What was that?

2693
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:26,520
Yu Jae Seok is the lord now.

2694
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,690
All of a sudden? Why?

2695
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,020
He's not in my team.

2696
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:32,630
That means
Jae Seok will be switching teams.

2697
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:33,960
- Lord Ha.
- Then...

2698
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,160
(Jae Seok becomes a lord again.)

2699
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:37,630
- Then is Jae Seok the noble?
- Yes.

2700
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,270
(Stamping)

2701
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:43,170
- Get changed, Lord Ha.
- What?

2702
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,010
I haven't changed my clothes yet.

2703
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:47,940
- I haven't changed my clothes yet.
- He stamped it.

2704
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:49,280
- But since you were stamped,
- The stamp is valid.

2705
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,610
you became a slave.

2706
01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:52,050
- Haha...
- I need to switch with you.

2707
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:54,010
Jung Seung Hwan will become a lord.

2708
01:26:54,010 --> 01:26:55,550
How is this possible?

2709
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:57,720
He stamped it when I hadn't
even changed my clothes yet.

2710
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,450
(After the second harvest,)

2711
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:05,560
(Seung Hwan stole the crops.)

2712
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:08,860
(I met a bandit.)

2713
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:13,070
(He shamelessly claimed
that he met a robber.)

2714
01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:15,940
(He got the crops he hid
until the end.)

2715
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:18,440
(Can I buy a stamp with these?)

2716
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:20,540
(We can't trust him.)

2717
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:23,380
(The unexpected twist
of the gentle-looking ballad slave!)

2718
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:24,680
Justice will win.

2719
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:27,210
- Nice.
- Jung Seung Hwan.

2720
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:28,850
- Hold on.
- He was aiming for this.

2721
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:29,950
How...

2722
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,850
You should have stamped Se Chan.
Why did you stamp me?

2723
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:33,250
I know.
You should have stamped Se Chan.

2724
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:34,690
Why did you stamp me?

2725
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:36,560
- I couldn't find him...
- He couldn't find him.

2726
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,760
I couldn't find him.
I was running out of time.

2727
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,230
He couldn't find him.

2728
01:27:39,490 --> 01:27:40,490
Did someone get stamped?

2729
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:41,760
There was a war here...

2730
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,230
- while you were gone.
- This is amazing.

2731
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:44,930
Jung Seung Hwan really...

2732
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:48,400
An Antenna member
betrays an Antenna member.

2733
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:49,670
- Right.
- An Antenna member...

2734
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:50,870
- betrays an Antenna member.
- He didn't hesitate.

2735
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:52,310
I've adapted to Running Man.

2736
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:53,770
Good.

2737
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:56,440
Is betraying the company tradition
of Antenna?

2738
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:57,780
Why are you bringing up
the company tradition here?

2739
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:00,310
That's horrible.
You betray each other.

2740
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:03,020
So, the final lords...

2741
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:04,680
are Yang Se Chan
and Jung Seung Hwan.

2742
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,490
- What is this?
- That's how it ended.

2743
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:07,490
No one...

2744
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:09,420
He was really not fair.

2745
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:10,590
He's a viper.

2746
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:11,790
- You can't trust him.
- If it is you

2747
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:13,760
Goodness.

2748
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,530
You're really lucky.

2749
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:20,070
I went to get the crops I stole,
but they weren't there.

2750
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:22,070
- So I sighed and...
- Where did you hide them?

2751
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:23,600
In the cameraman's bag.

2752
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,870
How would a new guest know
to check the cameraman's bag?

2753
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:27,840
- In the gear bag.
- Watch our show.

2754
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,610
- Watch our show.
- He...

2755
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:31,840
- You'll learn everything if you do.
- He was really gentle.

2756
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,750
- Why?
- He only collects his.

2757
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:35,150
He doesn't know
how to steal from others.

2758
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:36,150
I don't go to places...

2759
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:37,950
- that don't have cameras.
- Right.

2760
01:28:37,950 --> 01:28:39,620
- You kept it where there were...
- There are cameras everywhere.

2761
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:40,950
- Everywhere?
- He came to me and said,

2762
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:43,660
"Can you hide them in places
without cameras?"

2763
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:45,560
I would have hidden them anywhere
if I had known.

2764
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:48,860
The values of the crops
you own now...

2765
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:51,230
have been calculated.

2766
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:54,400
First, Team Lord Jung.
Yu Jae Seok...

2767
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,240
- moved to this team as well.
- Right.

2768
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,240
(Jae Seok switched teams
by stamping Haha's back.)

2769
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,010
- Right. He became a slave.
- Me?

2770
01:28:59,010 --> 01:29:01,440
- He stamped Haha.
- No!

2771
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,540
- That's right.
- Hold on. What?

2772
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:03,940
So there are five members
in this team,

2773
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:05,550
- It doesn't matter.
- Then only one gets the penalty.

2774
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:07,380
- and four in this team.
- That's bad for us.

2775
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:09,650
The total value of the crops...

2776
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:10,780
- will decide which team wins.
- What?

2777
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:12,590
- We win.
- We won.

2778
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:14,520
- Having more members is better.
- Only Jae Seok...

2779
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,760
So the combined total...

2780
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,930
for Team Lord Jung...

2781
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:20,860
is 152 nyang.

2782
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:22,430
- We have a lot.
- We lost.

2783
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:23,430
- Then,
- We lost.

2784
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:25,400
- as for Team Lord Yang...
- Around 140 nyang.

2785
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,400
(The total for Team Lord Yang
with only 4 members)

2786
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,740
- It is 161 nyang in total.
- Yes!

2787
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:31,540
(161 nyang in total)

2788
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,110
- We win!
- We win!

2789
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:34,540
- We win!
- I can't believe this.

2790
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:37,080
On the winning team, Lord Yang...

2791
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,580
and only Ji Hyo and Daniel,

2792
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:43,180
who have the highest amount
of money, will get the prize.

2793
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:44,480
(Slave Jun, with the lowest amount
of money, gets the penalty.)

2794
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,150
The remaining member
will get the penalty.

2795
01:29:46,150 --> 01:29:48,220
Studio Jun!

2796
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:49,420
Why do I get the penalty
when my team wins?

2797
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:50,660
Until the end...

2798
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:52,830
Only the members above you
get the prize.

2799
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:54,460
Why were you happy?

2800
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:55,900
I still don't understand the rules.

2801
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:57,460
Why... My team wins.

2802
01:29:57,530 --> 01:29:59,300
- On the winning team,
- Two members.

2803
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:00,500
you have the lowest amount of money.

2804
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,530
- Except for the lord.
- You're in last place.

2805
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:02,970
You look like a greedy cat.

2806
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:04,870
All the members
of this team will get the penalty?

2807
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:06,570
On the losing team,

2808
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:08,440
- Only one member is safe,
- except for Lord Jung Seung Hwan,

2809
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:09,640
only one member
with the highest amount of money...

2810
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:11,310
- will be exempt from the penalty.
- Only Ye Eun is safe.

2811
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:13,150
- That's great.
- Only Ji Ye Eun is exempt.

2812
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:14,780
- My goodness.
- The rest of them get the penalty.

2813
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:17,820
- I knew it.
- We will bring in the prize first.

2814
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:19,520
- What's the prize? An iPad?
- This is the worst.

2815
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,520
An iPad?

2816
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,220
Why would they give away an iPad?

2817
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:23,760
- What?
- Here is the prize.

2818
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,030
We prepared a dried persimmon set
to celebrate Chuseok.

2819
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:27,160
That looks delicious.

2820
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,660
- All right.
- I love free stuff like this.

2821
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,830
You will get the penalty then.

2822
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:32,900
It's the penalty
that suits the Joseon Dynasty.

2823
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,330
It's flogging.

2824
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,770
We are soaked in water.

2825
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:38,940
- I hope they don't flog too hard.
- What...

2826
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:40,740
Among the members
to get the penalty,

2827
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:42,240
- It will stick to your skin.
- the one with the most money...

2828
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:44,140
will flog the one
with the second most money.

2829
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:46,280
And the one with the 2nd most money
will flog the one with the 3rd.

2830
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:48,050
That's how it goes.

2831
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:49,480
The member
with the highest amount of money...

2832
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:51,220
- is Jun Hyun Moo.
- Am I in first place?

2833
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:52,690
Yes. You will be flogged...

2834
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:55,120
- by the lord of the winning team.
- Who's that?

2835
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,120
- Se Chan.
- Me?

2836
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:57,560
- I'd love that.
- No.

2837
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:59,190
- It will feel great.
- No.

2838
01:30:59,190 --> 01:31:01,060
- Se Chan is strong.
- It will be great.

2839
01:31:01,090 --> 01:31:02,530
- I'll make it delicious.
- We have to meet on Thursday.

2840
01:31:02,530 --> 01:31:03,700
- I'll make it delicious for you.
- Wait.

2841
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:05,670
You should talk
about "The Ballad of Us."

2842
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:06,830
- It's Thursday at 9 p.m.
- Thursday at 9 p.m.

2843
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:07,900
- Thursday at 9 p.m.
- Yes.

2844
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:09,700
At 9 p.m. on Thursdays in the fall,

2845
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,100
- Okay.
- the world of ballads will begin.

2846
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,740
Korea will fall
into the world of ballads...

2847
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:14,840
It's strange that you talk about it
looking like that.

2848
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,540
You'll fall for it.

2849
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:18,080
- We will fall for it.
- You'll fall for it.

2850
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,250
This is why
Seung Hwan came here today,

2851
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:22,480
and Hyun Moo even came back
after 12 years.

2852
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:25,150
This is my second time here,
and I feel uneasy every time I come.

2853
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:27,190
It won't feel like that
on your third time.

2854
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:28,390
- On the third time?
- If you come again,

2855
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:29,690
- you'll feel refreshed.
- Really?

2856
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:32,230
- Then, Hyun Moo gets flogged first?
- Yes.

2857
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:33,690
Let's go and do it.

2858
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,560
Se Chan is... My gosh.

2859
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,400
(It seems like Hyun Moo's 3rd time
will be after another 12 years.)

2860
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:40,330
Se Chan, don't make Hyun Moo
regret joining our show.

2861
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:41,830
- Hang on.
- Why?

2862
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,540
When will you hit me?
On the count of three?

2863
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:45,100
I'll say "The Ballad of Us,"

2864
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,410
- and I'll hit you as I say "Us."
- "Us."

2865
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:47,740
"The Ballad of Us!"

2866
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:49,380
- "Us!"
- As you say "Us."

2867
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:52,180
"The Ballad of Us!"

2868
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:54,050
"The Ballad of Us!"

2869
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:58,480
(The sticky taste
of a real variety show)

2870
01:31:58,480 --> 01:31:59,520
It's really...

2871
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,520
Nice.

2872
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,060
"The Ballad of Us!"

2873
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:06,130
- "The Ballad of Us!"
- You have to aim.

2874
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,300
(Spitting)

2875
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:13,370
(The roughneck spits water
to make it hurt even more.)

2876
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,930
- This is unfair.
- He was a lord earlier.

2877
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:16,140
I'll make it delicious.

2878
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:17,570
(Starting as a lord, he ended up
getting the penalty as a slave.)

2879
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:18,670
My goodness.

2880
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:20,210
It must hurt.

2881
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:22,140
This hurts and is not fun.

2882
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:23,210
It must hurt.

2883
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,780
(The 4 actors came from
"Run to the West" to the variety world.)

2884
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:29,480
(The member they least want
to be on a team with)

2885
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:30,520
(Just stare at the person.)

2886
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:31,820
(Staring at Seok Jin)

2887
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:32,990
(Embarrassed)

2888
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:35,220
(Method-level immersion
even in a variety show)

2889
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:36,490
(Passionate Byun Yo Han)

2890
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,160
(I wear the same underwear
for about 7 to 8 years.)

2891
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,530
(The familiar vibe of a stingy man)

2892
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:41,490
(Stingy Jong Kook has finally found
the other half of himself.)

2893
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:43,000
(Jong Kook's type, Kim Kang Woo)

2894
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:45,030
(You seem very nervous.)

2895
01:32:45,330 --> 01:32:46,530
(Shaking)

2896
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:49,070
(A 100 percent pure man
who knows no lies)

2897
01:32:49,070 --> 01:32:50,170
(I'm sorry
I'm living a boring life.)

2898
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:51,470
(Is Jae Seok handsome?)

2899
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:53,610
(Honest Yang Se Jong)

2900
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:55,470
(If I meet my boyfriend
after a few days...)

2901
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:57,510
(An extreme introvert
who feels shy around her lover)

2902
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,580
(An extreme introvert sometimes play
board games alone.)

2903
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:00,810
(An aspiring loner, Bang Hyo Rin)

2904
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:02,210
(She's scary!)

2905
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:03,580
(It's all a lie!)

2906
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:04,850
(Can I trust him?)

2907
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,190
(Will the 4 actors be able to survive
in the variety show world?)

2908
01:33:07,450 --> 01:33:08,620
(A World Where
Only the Average Survives)
