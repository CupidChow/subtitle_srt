1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,610
- We must be going on a trip.
- This feels like a trip.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,810
Let's enjoy our trip.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,810
Where are we going?

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,210
- This is backpacking.
- Right.

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,780
- Hello.
- Hey, Ssaebssaeb.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,820
What's up?

7
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,620
Hello.

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,760
- By the way...
- This is typical vacation wear.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,060
- It really is.
- This is...

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,060
the typical outfit you wear
for a trip on a TV show.

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,060
Yes. This is it.
I need something colorful.

12
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,100
This is very tight.
The hat is tight.

13
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,730
When you go on a vacation...

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,340
Hey, Ji Ye Eun.
What's with your outfit?

15
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,340
Is this for a vacation?

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,870
- Vacation. This is...
- You're...

17
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,610
the winner
of the Good Influence Award.

18
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,380
I'm the winner
of the Good Influence Award.

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,380
- The Good Influence Award.
- The Good...

20
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,580
What's with your outfit?

21
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,080
(The reason Ye Eun is called
the Good Influence.)

22
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,750
(She won the award
at the Blue Dragon Series Awards.)

23
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,250
(It's called
the Good Influence Award.)

24
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,920
(Ye Eun was surprised to win it,
so she gave a goat-like speech.)

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,030
- Good influence.
- I laughed a lot watching it.

26
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,190
- Hey.
- What's with your outfit?

27
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,590
- It was really...
- I'm dressed like an angel.

28
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,700
The good influence.

29
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,060
The Good Influence Award.

30
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,030
The Good Influence Award
was hilarious.

31
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,330
Good influence.

32
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,740
- Hello.
- What happened?

33
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,870
Haha.

34
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,970
He's all dressed up.

35
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,270
- But...
- Haha.

36
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,670
Why did you roll up your sleeves?

37
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,670
Why?

38
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,040
- Haha, in summer...
- Hey.

39
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,680
- How much...
- Seok Sam's outfit is too much.

40
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,580
- This is...
- What's with Seok Sam?

41
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,480
(The real deal shows up.)

42
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,920
- What is that?
- It's over the top.

43
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,350
Mr. Corn Silk Tea!

44
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,390
- Hello, everyone.
- It's a scarecrow.

45
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,490
(The ever-reliable
fashion guinea pig)

46
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,560
It's over the top, brother.

47
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,290
Corn silk tea is
a summer vacation must-have.

48
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,330
- Come on.
- By the way, Seok Jin.

49
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,460
- Ji Ye Eun.
- It's too much.

50
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,560
- Haha.
- Yes?

51
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,860
I was wearing another hat,

52
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,930
- and you said this was better.
- It's lovely.

53
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,630
- It's over the top.
- No.

54
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,570
- Hello.
- Hey.

55
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,540
- Where's the hat?
- The straw hat.

56
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,610
I think it's over the top.

57
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,070
- No, it's not.
- Come on.

58
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,110
I mean it.

59
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,380
Come on now.

60
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,940
You brought it all the way here.
It'd be a waste.

61
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,250
- Come on.
- It's nice, Seok Jin.

62
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,510
- It's nice.
- Stop.

63
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,750
I thought it was really cool
when I saw it in the car.

64
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,950
You know what he said?

65
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,220
- "Fine. If you insist."
- I wanted to wear another one.

66
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,590
- I'm supposed to hide behind.
- I love it.

67
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,890
- You shouldn't laugh.
- You can't see my face.

68
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,860
- Corn silk tea.
- I didn't wear it to be funny.

69
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,930
- Okay!
- It's for my skin.

70
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,160
(At that moment)

71
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,330
Okay!

72
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,800
(A real tourist breaks
into the shoot.)

73
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,370
- Love it.
- Okay.

74
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,100
(The tourist showed up
half skin, half pink.)

75
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,240
You're wearing pink.

76
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,610
- Of course.
- This is...

77
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,670
- This is funny.
- This is funny.

78
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,040
- But...
- I love it.

79
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,380
the opening should've
come down to here.

80
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,510
- Your nipples should show.
- They should.

81
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,250
- It's...
- This is TV appropriate.

82
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,150
We are the extreme opposites.

83
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,850
I'm too staged,

84
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,750
- and he's hyper-realistic.
- Yes.

85
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,560
- He's like a real tourist.
- This is how they dress.

86
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,590
(His tourist outfit is
as real as it gets.)

87
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,560
- Right.
- That's how you actually dress.

88
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,760
- This is how he actually dresses.
- This is real.

89
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,530
- Look at her!
- She's so pretty.

90
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,230
- Okay!
- Song Ji Hyo.

91
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,330
- She's dressed up.
- She's cute.

92
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,540
- You look fine today.
- You're pretty.

93
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,470
(Denim on Denim with Sunshine Socks)

94
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,570
- You're pretty.
- You look fine today.

95
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,570
- I'm going on a vacation, you see.
- Why is she so awkward?

96
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,440
Why do you sound so awkward then?

97
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,680
- "I'm going on a vacation."
- I'm...

98
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,150
- going on a vacation.
- "I'm going on a vacation."

99
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,180
- Hey.
- But look.

100
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,180
It seems you didn't have
much confidence.

101
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,350
You hid your tummy with the mic.

102
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,520
- No, I'm full of confidence.
- You're pretty.

103
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,820
- I can lift it up.
- I see the skin.

104
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,350
I'm known for my vacation fashion.

105
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,120
Today's opening concept is...

106
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,520
"vacation," like you mentioned.

107
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,060
Summer break has started,

108
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,830
and the summer getaway season
is approaching too.

109
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,060
- Nice.
- Do you have...

110
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,060
any summer vacation plans?

111
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,200
This summer? Can we go on...

112
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,870
- How can we travel?
- We can't...

113
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,840
How can we go on a trip?

114
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,670
Travel and summer vacation?
Not happening for us.

115
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,910
We can't go.

116
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,440
- It's out of the question.
- We have the shoot every week.

117
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,640
- How can we travel?
- Right.

118
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,780
Since you all can't easily
go on a trip, we've prepared...

119
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,920
the 2025 Day Goblin's Room Tour.

120
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,880
- Day Goblin's Room Tour?
- Day Goblin's Room Tour?

121
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,150
- I guess we're staying in a room.
- It's usually the night goblin.

122
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,220
- Right.
- But this is Day Goblin's Tour.

123
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,160
- You're supposed to leave at night.
- Right.

124
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,960
Before you go on the trip,

125
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,060
we will give you R coins
to use during your trip.

126
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,600
You will travel around the rooms...

127
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,500
that are decorated
with different concepts.

128
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,240
With the R coins remaining
at the end of your trip,

129
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,040
- you can buy a souvenir.
- Okay!

130
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,140
Really?

131
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,880
- Nice.
- The member who fails...

132
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,310
to buy a souvenir...

133
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,910
- will be punished.
- Are you serious?

134
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,080
Each of you chose one item
you would like to take on your trip.

135
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,190
You said to keep it a secret.

136
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,550
Yes. Bring in the items, please.

137
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,720
What's up?

138
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
- Hello.
- Hey.

139
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,460
As always,
I have a question for you.

140
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,130
Why do you have so many questions?

141
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,430
If you were to go on a trip,

142
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,970
what is one item from your car
you would want to take?

143
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,230
- From my car?
- Yes.

144
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,040
(What is one item from your car
you would want to take on a trip?)

145
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,170
- All right.
- Okay.

146
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,340
He's...

147
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,410
I'm getting dressed!

148
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,640
I couldn't see you from the outside.

149
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,140
Do you really have to film me now?

150
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,410
I couldn't see you from the outside.

151
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,450
Why are you in such a hurry?

152
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,080
- I'm not dressed, you see.
- Gosh, no.

153
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,180
Please roll up your window.

154
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,490
Jong Kook,
if you were to go on a trip,

155
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,760
and you had to take
one thing from your car...

156
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,220
I'm going on a trip?

157
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,560
Choose one item...

158
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,830
from your car
that you would like to take.

159
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,660
- From my car?
- Yes.

160
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,960
What should it be?

161
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,460
(What should it be?)

162
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,100
Something big, perhaps?

163
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
Okay. Go.

164
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,140
(Ssaebssaeb tries to find out
what it's all about.)

165
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,170
Something big.

166
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,240
It must be the weight.

167
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,470
I just know it.
It's about the weight.

168
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,740
(Is there a hidden meaning
behind the item?)

169
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,840
Hey.

170
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,840
I chose something realistic.

171
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,250
I chose something realistic too.

172
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,950
Are those the souvenirs?

173
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,480
- No way.
- It can't be.

174
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,580
Are we going to be splitting those?

175
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,020
- Hey.
- I never carry an umbrella...

176
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,060
anywhere.

177
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,620
- I'm too lazy.
- When you go on a trip alone,

178
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,690
- you need an umbrella.
- Why?

179
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,490
When you are exposed...

180
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,260
- to danger...
- Come on.

181
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,260
- Don't be ridiculous.
- What can you do with it?

182
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,400
- What are you talking about?
- The umbrella?

183
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,700
- Come on.
- Stop.

184
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,540
- You're not a Kingsman agent.
- You'd take an umbrella on a trip?

185
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,970
- I would carry it around.
- How can you carry it around?

186
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,640
- Look.
- You can't even carry this around.

187
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,370
This is the strangest choice.
An umbrella?

188
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,540
What's strange about this?

189
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,610
It's strange.

190
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,780
What's wrong with it?

191
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,250
I'm sorry. It slipped.

192
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,850
Why did you hit me?
It's the strangest.

193
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,820
- Why is it the strangest?
- I never carry it around.

194
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,880
- It's a hassle.
- It's...

195
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,450
Don't tell me
you picked a cell phone.

196
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,320
- He couldn't have.
- You're such a hip guy.

197
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,490
A cell phone is ridiculous.

198
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,220
- That's a disappointment.
- It can't be a cell phone.

199
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,230
That's just wrong.

200
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,690
He must have picked
something we never thought of.

201
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,460
That means he didn't think.

202
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,860
You don’t deserve to get paid today.

203
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,060
- No.
- You picked a cellphone?

204
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,400
Who are you to blame me
for choosing the umbrella?

205
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,740
But this is a realistic choice,
a cell phone!

206
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,370
But this is a realistic choice,
a cell phone!

207
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,810
(Come on.)

208
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,440
- Come on.
- No way.

209
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,540
- I quit.
- Seok Jin.

210
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,210
Did I let you down?

211
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,910
- But this is realistic.
- Come on.

212
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,750
That's not a vacation item.

213
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,850
- It's the first thing I thought of.
- That's...

214
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,220
- That's too basic.
- Go back.

215
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,450
- Right. Go back.
- That's too basic.

216
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,890
They didn't ask you to choose...

217
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,920
- so you can choose that.
- Choose the straw hat.

218
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,560
- The straw hat is better.
- Right.

219
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,960
- All right.
- I will put this in.

220
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,690
I am a man who values harmony.

221
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,530
- What did you pick?
- Me?

222
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,600
I chose...

223
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,660
- slippers.
- Come on.

224
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,930
(Ji Hyo's travel item is slippers.)

225
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,040
- It's because...
- Aren't those from the show?

226
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,470
- You..
- Aren't those from the show?

227
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,610
(Why are the show slippers
in her car?)

228
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,640
Those are from the show.

229
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,570
- Why do you have those?
- I...

230
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,240
- I just...
- Did you steal the props?

231
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,280
- She steals!
- If you steal props,

232
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
- you will be...
- Did you steal them?

233
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,580
You will be cursed
for three generations.

234
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,320
I happened to wear these to my car.

235
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,450
I was going to return them.

236
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,820
That's stealing!

237
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,950
No, it's not.

238
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,620
- I'm going to return them today.
- You can do that.

239
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,290
I hate having
hot feet in the summer.

240
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,360
To move around comfortably,

241
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,260
- you need slippers.
- You're right.

242
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,260
The top of your feet
won't get burned.

243
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,330
- Ms. Good Influence is next.
- Ms. Good Influence is next.

244
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,700
- I chose an aromatherapy oil.
- Ms. Good Influence!

245
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,930
- What?
- Aromatherapy oil.

246
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,270
- Come on.
- That's not it.

247
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,470
- Let me explain.
- Ye Eun.

248
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,640
- That's not it.
- Stop it, will you?

249
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,410
- What's that?
- If you do this...

250
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,640
- and rub it on your skin...
- Come on.

251
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,280
- You spilled it.
- You're going on a vacation!

252
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,440
Try rubbing it on your skin.

253
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,780
- Should I?
- It will feel cool.

254
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,180
Rub it on your skin,
the back of your ear.

255
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,450
- Let me try.
- Okay.

256
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,120
It's like we're in Southeast Asia.

257
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,820
- It's like we're in Southeast Asia.
- It cools your skin, doesn't it?

258
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,220
It's like what you smell like
when you do a group massage...

259
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,320
and come out of the spa.

260
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,190
- Put it at the back of your ear.
- Can I have some?

261
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,560
- Can I have some?
- Can I have some too, Ye Eun?

262
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,390
- Give me some. It's nice.
- Put it at the back of your ear.

263
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,130
- This is nice.
- I want it too.

264
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,400
- Give me some too.
- It smells good.

265
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,930
- Put it at the back of your ear.
- It's like being at a spa.

266
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,770
- It cools your skin.
- It's like being at a spa...

267
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,770
in Bangkok.

268
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,200
- Sawadee ka.
- A group spa...

269
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,840
- Khob khun ka.
- Like we're in a spa in Thailand.

270
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,910
- It's...
- The car smells like this.

271
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,170
- It's like being at a spa.
- You can do this in a car.

272
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,540
- It's natural.
- Ji Ye Eun!

273
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,280
Ms. Good Influence!

274
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,350
She shared it with all of us.

275
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,710
- Nice.
- Is your skin cooled?

276
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,620
I need to be a good girl now.

277
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,180
It reminds me of Southeast Asia.
I want to go.

278
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,450
- Right? It's amazing, isn't it?
- It is.

279
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,890
- I chose this.
- What is it?

280
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,060
It's something you must have.

281
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,660
- A ball cap.
- Gosh.

282
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,530
- You need a ball cap.
- Come on.

283
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,230
You don't know
where you will end up.

284
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,430
- What is it?
- A wet wipe.

285
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,130
- Hey.
- I thought of that too.

286
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,670
You must've given it
a lot of thought.

287
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,930
- I thought of that too.
- Look.

288
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,170
When you travel with children,
you need the wet wipes.

289
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,570
- Children.
- You could just buy it.

290
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,310
- You need a box of it.
- You need it if you have children.

291
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,470
- Should I go next?
- Yes.

292
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,040
(Se Chan thought weight
was important. What did he choose?)

293
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,980
It goes perfectly with my outfit.

294
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,710
- What is it?
- It's a cooler.

295
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,250
He wins.

296
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,950
- It's a cooler.
- Come on.

297
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,850
- He wins.
- You had that in the car?

298
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,320
- This is...
- Nice.

299
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,660
- I had it in my car.
- I have one too.

300
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,990
You have to have this
when you go on a vacation.

301
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,860
- Okay.
- Is there anything in it?

302
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,560
- There's water.
- Why did you ask us to choose?

303
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,700
By the way, I didn't realize...

304
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,430
people still took a cooler
on vacation.

305
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,030
You each brought an item...

306
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,440
you would like to take with you...

307
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,540
- on a trip.
- Right.

308
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,470
We weighed...

309
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,040
the items you brought.

310
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,340
(Is weight really the important
factor as Se Chan predicted?)

311
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,750
When you go on a trip,
the lighter you travel, the better.

312
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,520
The lighter your item is,
the more R coins you’ll receive.

313
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,490
- I even got water inside.
- This is...

314
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,020
I put three water bottles,
just in case.

315
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,260
A cell phone
would've been really bad.

316
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,760
- Come on, ma'am.
- That would've been bad.

317
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,460
Seok Jin, you originally picked
the cell phone,

318
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,300
- and it weighed 264g.
- Right.

319
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,870
- We have to weigh yours again.
- Thank you, guys.

320
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,130
- To decide your ranking.
- Gosh.

321
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,600
- You are so good to me.
- Ma'am.

322
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
I'm so grateful.

323
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,310
I think this weighs only about 20g.

324
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,910
Originally, it's...

325
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,940
- This is...
- It was really about the weight.

326
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,610
It weighs 264g.

327
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,050
- How about this one?
- I wanted to go with the gum.

328
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,250
I can't see.

329
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,720
I can't see.

330
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,920
- What is it?
- Why...

331
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,190
Why doesn't it stop?

332
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,320
(Is it heavier than the phone?)

333
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,190
It's 800g? What happened?

334
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,590
- It doesn't make sense.
- It's 800g?

335
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,560
- No.
- It's 800g!

336
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,030
(Pressing)

337
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,360
Is this a comedy sketch?

338
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,530
(He found another way
to use the umbrella.)

339
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,940
- It's 784g.
- I'm worried about him now.

340
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,010
I worry about him.

341
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,040
- I worry about him.
- This is strange.

342
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,710
It doesn't make sense.

343
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,080
(He finally finds out.)

344
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,150
Are you Charlie Chaplin or what?

345
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,050
Hey, Jae Seok!

346
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,220
Gosh.

347
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,090
- You really didn't know?
- Stop it.

348
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,120
(The umbrella can also be
a dance prop.)

349
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,060
- It's...
- It's 118g.

350
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,620
- It's 118g.
- Goodness.

351
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,560
- That weighs 118g?
- That's crazy.

352
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,330
The lighter your item is,
the more R coins you will get.

353
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,000
The winner's item weighed...

354
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,970
just two grams.

355
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,440
Daniel's wet tissue
weighed two grams.

356
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,040
The winner will receive 50 R coins.

357
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,240
I have a chance.

358
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,980
- And the second place...
- Come on.

359
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,110
weighed 56g.

360
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,710
It was Ye Eun's item.

361
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,580
- Ye Eun will receive 45 R coins.
- Gosh, Ms. Good Influence!

362
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,150
- Gosh, you.
- So good.

363
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,390
Ms. GI.

364
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,020
The ones who ranked 3rd and 4th
will receive 40 R coins each.

365
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,590
The 3rd place goes to Jong Kook.
His ball cap.

366
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,830
Haha was supposed...

367
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,030
- to be the fourth.
- It's me.

368
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,570
But because Seok Jin switched
to the hat, he came in fourth.

369
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,440
So the two of them
will be getting 40 each.

370
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,940
Those who came
in 5th, 6th, and 7th...

371
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,510
- will receive 30 R coins each.
- Gosh.

372
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,980
Haha came in fifth.

373
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,680
Ji Hyo came in sixth.

374
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,720
Jae Seok came in seventh.

375
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,280
The one in last place
will only get 20 coins.

376
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,620
- The cooler weighed 3.16kg.
- It's Ssaebssaeb.

377
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,860
It weighed 3.16kg...

378
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,690
- because I added...
- There's water inside.

379
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,860
four bottles of water just in case.

380
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,230
The coins you just received
are the seed money for today's race.

381
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,000
(The R coins they received will be
their funds for today's trip.)

382
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,600
(Travel Fund Status)

383
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,640
Nice.

384
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,340
- I only have 20 coins.
- I have the most.

385
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,340
You'll now head
to the first travel destination.

386
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,440
- Sure.
- Okay!

387
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,610
Read the concepts written
on each of the two doors outside,

388
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,950
then head
to the destination you want.

389
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,750
- Really?
- First, you'll split into...

390
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,620
The first group is as follows.
Seok Jin, Jong Kook,

391
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,720
- Daniel, and Ye Eun.
- Get going.

392
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,730
- I wonder what the choices are.
- This group's members...

393
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,760
- Let's go.
- are all a positive influence.

394
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,130
- A positive influence.
- A positive influence.

395
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,200
- PI, let's get going.
- Sure.

396
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,200
Let's get going.

397
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,900
How many coins did you receive?

398
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,540
- I have 40.
- I have 50.

399
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,470
- I have 40.
- You have the most.

400
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,610
- I have the most.
- I have 40.

401
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,880
- An ability?
- This uses one's ability.

402
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,640
- Seok Jin, look.
- An ability?

403
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,880
- Hold on.
- On the doors!

404
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,480
- Is it this one too?
- This requires three.

405
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,780
I'd rather go for luck.

406
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,050
- An ability?
- This uses one's ability.

407
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,550
- Seok Jin, look.
- An ability?

408
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,090
Here, you use your ability.

409
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,390
That only costs you three coins.

410
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,490
Luck!

411
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,020
(Luck Room: Wooden doors
from the Joseon era)

412
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,990
(5 coins to enter)

413
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,460
(Luck: 5 coins)

414
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,930
This requires three.

415
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,200
- I'd rather go for luck.
- Is this solitary confinement?

416
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,200
- Cheaper is better. What's this?
- I prefer to be lucky as well.

417
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
- Is this solitary confinement?
- I know what this is.

418
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,700
- Who's she?
- Hello.

419
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,970
(An unknown person is standing
between the two doors.)

420
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,040
- Hello.
- Where are you from?

421
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,640
Are you Korean?

422
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,810
It costs three coins
to enter the Ability Room...

423
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,010
and five coins
to enter the Luck Room.

424
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,080
I'm not that fond of luck.

425
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,980
Each room can have only two people.

426
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,990
Which room would you choose
for your trip?

427
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,190
- Only two people?
- I'm choosing luck.

428
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,520
- I choose luck.
- I'm choosing luck.

429
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,820
I can blame myself
if it doesn't work out...

430
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,320
after using my ability.

431
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,090
I'd rather fail
from not being good enough.

432
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,900
Don't think I chose it
because it's cheaper.

433
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,960
Would you rather be lucky?
Where do you want to go?

434
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,270
- I choose luck.
- I choose luck.

435
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,630
- I don't have any abilities.
- Must you do that?

436
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,670
- I choose luck.
- Sure.

437
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,170
I like to let luck decide my fate.

438
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,610
- I'll let you have it, Daniel.
- Sure.

439
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,010
- Then...
- I choose the Ability Room.

440
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,740
I'm letting you have this one.

441
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,310
- Good luck!
- That's what the kids wanted.

442
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,250
- Okay, the Ability Room.
- Here we go.

443
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,750
- The Ability Room.
- What is all this?

444
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,290
- What's all this?
- What's going on?

445
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,190
Welcome to the future.

446
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,290
- The future?
- Here, you can use your skills...

447
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,260
to play games
and earn more travel funds.

448
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,630
Do you know the Soap-Candy Game?

449
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,460
I know the game. It's played a lot
on social media these days.

450
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,800
(To "candy,"
you must lick the candy.)

451
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,600
(To "soap," you must
sniff the soap.)

452
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,440
I knew there was a twist.

453
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Soap.
(Lick)

454
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,480
- Like this.
- Baam. Okay.

455
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,350
The game will be played
for a minute.

456
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,880
If you make two or fewer mistakes,

457
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,080
you will get five times
the R coins you bet.

458
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,750
Five or less
gets you four times the amount.

459
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,720
Seven or less
gets you three times the amount.

460
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,160
Fourteen or less
will get you twice the amount.

461
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,630
If you get it wrong
15 times or more,

462
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,330
- Is that even possible?
- you'll lose your coins.

463
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,260
Should I get it wrong just for fun?

464
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,530
- I won't get it wrong on purpose.
- Right.

465
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,100
I won't. I've moved on
from doing comedy like that.

466
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,400
- Really?
- Of course.

467
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm done with
getting it wrong on purpose.

468
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,340
- Let's not fake it.
- Exactly.

469
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,340
I'm going to do my best.

470
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,340
How can someone get it wrong
15 or more times?

471
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,610
I should bet all my coins on this.

472
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,410
- The worst outcome is impossible.
- Okay, got it.

473
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,810
- How many are you betting?
- About 15 coins.

474
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,080
- Really?
- I'm pretty confident.

475
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,220
What's the duration of the game?

476
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,590
(The trendsetter bets
15 out of his 40 coins.)

477
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,990
- Four, five, six.
- That's right.

478
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,960
I saved some just in case.

479
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,060
Still, it's the same
as going all-in.

480
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,330
- Just think about it.
- Of course.

481
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,960
- The worst outcome is impossible.
- It's next to impossible.

482
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,400
- It doesn't make sense.
- It won't be easy to fail.

483
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,830
- You'll play the game right away.
- Sure.

484
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,200
Candy, soap, soap.

485
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,540
Candy, soap, soap,

486
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,340
soap, candy,

487
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,540
candy, candy,

488
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,710
soap, swap.

489
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,210
Soap, candy.

490
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,250
Darn it.

491
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,120
(Lick)

492
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,350
Soap, soap,

493
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,320
candy, candy,

494
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,790
soap, swap.

495
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,020
Swap.

496
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,060
Soap.

497
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,760
(Swapping it twice in a row
fried his brain.)

498
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,500
Candy, soap, soap.

499
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,930
(Lick)

500
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,970
Soap, candy, swap.

501
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,300
(Chuckling)

502
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,340
Candy.

503
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,310
Soap.

504
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,710
Has it not been a minute yet?

505
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,210
I think he lost all his money.

506
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,850
Candy, soap.

507
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,150
Your time is up.

508
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,320
(Even until the end,
he kept licking the soap.)

509
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,620
This is infuriating.

510
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,490
Darn.

511
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,820
- This is infuriating.
- I told you it wasn't easy.

512
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,220
It's harder than it looks.

513
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,790
Seok Jin, you made
more than 15 errors.

514
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,260
- See? What did I tell you?
- Did I?

515
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,800
- Seok Jin.
- Really?

516
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,700
You lost the coins you bet.

517
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,030
Can I rinse my mouth?

518
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,740
I licked the soap multiple times.

519
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,270
I'll go rinse my mouth.

520
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,410
(His breath will smell better
than anyone else's.)

521
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,440
Those who work out regularly...

522
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,680
have well-developed peripheral nerves.

523
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,250
We're pretty good
at reacting to things.

524
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,250
(The next player
is full of bravado.)

525
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,320
I won't fail like Seok Jin did.

526
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,550
- I made more than 15 errors.
- I'll bet 3 coins.

527
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,220
- You're only betting three coins?
- That's right.

528
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,560
- Hey!
- What?

529
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,360
- Don't be cheeky like that.
- Why not?

530
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,630
- You can't bet only three coins.
- Seok Jin, hear me out.

531
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,030
- I'm concerned, that's all.
- About what?

532
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,330
I know I can do well.

533
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,560
- That's why...
- I'll be good at this...

534
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,030
- because...
- Of course.

535
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,430
- Those who work out are different.
- Don't get it wrong on purpose.

536
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,370
People who exercise
are faster to react.

537
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,600
- I mean it.
- I'll look forward to it.

538
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,970
- It's true.
- Try the game and then talk.

539
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,440
- I really mean it.
- Just play the game.

540
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,040
- Go ahead.
- It's true. I won't joke around.

541
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,280
- Sure thing.
- I apologize in advance.

542
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,510
- It's better to be serious.
- You already made us laugh.

543
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,220
(Go)

544
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,150
Candy, soap, candy.

545
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,520
Candy, soap, candy.

546
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,620
(Hesitant)

547
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,920
Candy, candy, soap,

548
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,860
soap, soap, candy,

549
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
swap.

550
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,160
- Okay.
- Soap.

551
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,930
Soap,

552
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,560
candy, candy,

553
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,900
soap, candy, soap,

554
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,170
soap, soap, candy, candy,

555
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,600
candy, soap,

556
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
- swap.
- Okay.

557
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,900
- I got the hang of it.
- How many times was that?

558
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,270
Soap, candy,

559
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,410
swap.

560
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,740
- I got it now.
- Swap.

561
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,140
Soap.

562
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,480
(Attacking him
with the double swap!)

563
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,750
(Lick)

564
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,350
That counts as an error.

565
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,920
Soap, candy, soap.

566
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,050
(Licking again)

567
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,620
Your minute is up.

568
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,690
- He got it wrong many times.
- Hold on.

569
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,090
- I faltered but...
- That counts as an error.

570
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,330
I didn't get it wrong so many times.

571
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,930
- Even that counts as an error.
- Right.

572
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,500
Jong Kook, you made eight errors.

573
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,230
- Still, you doubled the coins.
- I doubled it. What a relief.

574
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,300
You still managed
to double your coins.

575
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,970
That was very confusing.

576
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,770
- That was hilarious.
- I doubled it.

577
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,140
That's better than nothing,
Seok Jin.

578
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,310
Here are the coins you earned.

579
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,080
- Here we go.
- You only bet three.

580
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,110
(As he takes
his small amount of coins)

581
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,110
Good for you.

582
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,780
- Okay. Thank you so much.
- Unbelievable.

583
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,380
- Yes!
- Nice!

584
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,520
- Nice.
- Good job.

585
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,650
Thank you.

586
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,950
(Did Ye Eun and Daniel
get lucky in the Luck Room?)

587
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,520
- I think we did all right.
- It wasn't too bad.

588
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,060
- Thank you.
- Here are the coins you earned.

589
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,490
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

590
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,300
- Nice!
- Yes!

591
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,500
(What trip did they take
in the Luck Room?)

592
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,830
I wonder what game they played.

593
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,130
It costs three coins to enter...

594
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,700
- the Ability Room.
- Right.

595
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,840
It costs five coins
to enter the Luck Room.

596
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,940
Three coins to enter
the Ability Room?

597
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,380
And five coins to enter
the Luck Room.

598
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,150
(Jae Seok sided with luck
on every occasion.)

599
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:33,250
- I'll choose the Luck Room.
- I choose the Luck Room too.

600
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,320
Off you go, then.

601
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,750
(The two tiger moths
are drawn to the Luck Room.)

602
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,320
- Welcome.
- Hello.

603
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,960
Who is she?

604
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,260
She must be our tour guide.

605
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,860
- Would you like to pay?
- Sure.

606
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,190
Thank you.

607
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,290
- Five.
- That's five coins.

608
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,030
I'm off to the Luck Room.

609
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,200
Thank you.

610
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,600
(What is in
the unrevealed Luck Room?)

611
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,400
- It's a simple game.
- What's this?

612
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,700
What is this?

613
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,870
(20 gourds)

614
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,970
We have to cut it to and fro.

615
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,980
Welcome to the Joseon era.

616
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,550
Here, you can have fun
splitting the lucky gourds...

617
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,610
and earn more travel money...

618
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,650
- in the process.
- Sure.

619
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,750
Together, you will decide
on one gourd to split.

620
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,120
You will add to or subtract
from your coins...

621
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,460
based on the instruction
inside the gourd.

622
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,120
That's what I'm talking about!

623
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,530
You may choose to stop
splitting gourds at any time,

624
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,000
and you can stop at different times.

625
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,360
We can stop when we're satisfied.
Got it.

626
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,900
- Over there.
- Choose a big one.

627
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,230
Let's go with one
in the front first.

628
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,140
- Sure.
- We should choose one of these.

629
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,010
- Which one should it be?
- How about 19? Easy as 19.

630
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,540
- Okay.
- It sure is easy to make money.

631
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,010
We'll go with number 19.

632
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,440
- Okay.
- And go.

633
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,340
(How lucky
are the bucktooth brothers...)

634
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,280
(on their very first try?)

635
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,380
- Goodness. What's that?
- One, two.

636
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,920
There.

637
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,550
(Current Travel Fund:
Jae Seok: 25, Se Chan: 15)

638
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,590
There.

639
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,560
- Plus 5.
- Plus 5.

640
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,260
(The bucktooth brothers
are lucky on their first try,)

641
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,690
(which is rare.)

642
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,230
How could we stop?

643
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,900
- All right. Then...
- That's the least we should get.

644
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,970
Of course.

645
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,770
This is how we make more money.

646
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,540
Number 11, the striker.

647
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,370
- Number 11, and go.
- Go.

648
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,010
(Current Travel Fund:
Jae Seok: 30, Se Chan: 20)

649
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,910
- Plus one!
- What the...

650
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,550
This is chump change.

651
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,150
We need to hit the jackpot.

652
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,520
- How about lucky number 7?
- Maybe 4, the number of death.

653
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,690
(The tiger moths aren't satisfied
with what they won so far.)

654
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,090
Maybe five that's between them?

655
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,620
- Five as in five coins.
- That's the number in between.

656
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,960
- And go.
- Go.

657
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,430
(Will they continue
the winning streak?)

658
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,730
(They gain coins yet again.)

659
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,470
- Plus one?
- That's not too bad.

660
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,630
We're up by four.

661
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,870
- But...
- Maybe I should stop.

662
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,100
We need to hit the jackpot.

663
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,200
We need to get about 20...

664
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,540
to be back in the game.

665
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,770
Should we split two more?

666
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,980
- Let's do that.
- Just two more.

667
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,080
Okay, let's do this.

668
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,050
Jae Seok, how about this?

669
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,550
What if we split all of them?

670
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,250
Wouldn't that get us up to...

671
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,780
Wait, we can also lose coins.

672
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,490
Exactly. We could lose coins.

673
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,950
- All right. Next.
- We could open them all.

674
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,120
- Number 17?
- Number 17?

675
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,330
(The train of greed
heads to station number 17.)

676
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,530
(What did they get?)

677
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,470
Times two!

678
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,700
(They really hit the jackpot!)

679
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,200
We should stop. Let's stop.

680
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,470
(Current Travel Fund:
Jae Seok: 68, Se Chan: 48)

681
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,110
Should we stop?

682
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,940
- Should we continue?
- How many do I currently have?

683
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,150
Yu Jae Seok has 68 coins.

684
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,820
Yang Se Chan has 48 coins.

685
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:22,750
(To go or to stop?)

686
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,490
To be honest, if I'm to win,
I need to keep going.

687
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,590
You're just the type to keep going.

688
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
We must play once more.
Let's play again.

689
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,500
The big ones
yielded some good results.

690
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,670
- How about this one?
- The one in the middle?

691
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,340
- Let's do it. Go. To and fro.
- Go.

692
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,800
(Current Travel Fund:
Jae Seok: 68, Se Chan: 48)

693
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,340
(Bankrupt)

694
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,740
You went bankrupt. You can stop now.

695
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,610
You both went bankrupt.

696
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,480
(They got too greedy
and lost everything.)

697
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
But...

698
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,380
(Current Travel Fund:
Jae Seok: 0, Se Chan: 0)

699
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,690
No!

700
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,120
Darn it.

701
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,620
Why did you suggest we keep going?

702
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,830
- I'll go first.
- You'll go first?

703
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,830
(Ji Hyo and Haha
are in the Ability Room.)

704
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,490
- Do I bet now?
- How many will you bet?

705
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,300
I'll bet five coins.

706
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,430
I just need to concentrate.

707
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,230
Do I lick on "candy"
and lick on "soap?"

708
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,240
Sniff the soap?

709
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,370
You'll froth at the mouth
if you lick the soap.

710
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,340
- You're right.
- You'll froth at the mouth.

711
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,940
Get ready, and go.

712
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,110
- Swap.
- What?

713
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,710
- Swap.
- No.

714
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,180
(Haha the kid argues with the AI.)

715
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,580
- Swap.
- Swap?

716
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,590
Swap. Soap.

717
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,050
Candy. Soap.

718
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,250
(Lick)

719
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,260
Swap. Soap.

720
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,060
(The taste of soap
made him lose focus.)

721
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,100
- Candy. Soap.
- I think you'll break down.

722
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,930
Swap. Soap.

723
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,770
Candy. Soap.

724
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
- Stop.
- The minute is up.

725
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,630
- How many times did I lick?
- Haha.

726
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,340
- You got it wrong 13 times.
- Yes.

727
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,470
- You doubled your bet.
- Okay, double!

728
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,710
I will bet...

729
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,040
seven coins.

730
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,850
We'll begin.

731
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,120
Soap. Soap.

732
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,520
- It's soap.
- Soap.

733
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,050
Candy. Soap.

734
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,120
Swap.

735
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,350
Soap.

736
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,620
- Candy.
- Don't mess up.

737
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,220
Soap. Candy.

738
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,960
Candy. Soap.

739
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,560
- Your time is up.
- I feel stupid.

740
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,830
Ji Hyo, you got it wrong 15 times,

741
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,300
so you lost all the coins you bet.

742
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,070
Here are the coins you won.

743
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,240
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

744
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,870
- I should've won triple.
- Gosh.

745
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,380
It's hot.

746
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,550
What's this?

747
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,380
What happened to you?

748
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,980
Don't ask.

749
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,220
We should've stopped. Why did you...

750
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,220
We got greedy. We were blinded.

751
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,360
- Darn it.
- How much did you win at first?

752
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,030
We had almost 70 coins.

753
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,490
- For real?
- It's such a shame.

754
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,130
We could've done better.

755
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,400
I knew this would happen.

756
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,770
How much did you make?

757
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,800
Can you give us just two?

758
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,970
One each so we can survive.

759
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,210
- You lost everything?
- Everything.

760
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,240
- We have nothing.
- We're bankrupt.

761
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,440
- Don't lie.
- I'm serious.

762
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,510
- We're bankrupt beggars.
- We lost it all.

763
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,080
- Gosh...
- Give us a coin each.

764
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,080
- Could you...
- Why did you get so greedy?

765
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,420
- Could you...
- Why did you get so greedy?

766
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,150
He's talking down at us.

767
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,850
Why did you get so greedy?

768
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,190
- If you give us one each...
- Give us something.

769
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,760
- What will you do for me?
- You have a lot.

770
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,660
- We'll be loyal to you.
- You got too greedy.

771
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,130
We'll be loyal to you.

772
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,400
- Do you want this?
- Yes.

773
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,500
- Do you want this?
- My gosh...

774
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,100
- This punk...
- Attention.

775
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,040
For just one coin...

776
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,170
"Just one?"

777
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,680
For just one coin, do I have to...

778
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,010
"For just one?"

779
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,580
I'm standing at attention.

780
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,020
- I like that about you.
- Thank you.

781
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,920
- You sell water, right?
- Yes.

782
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,120
- You can do better if you try.
- Okay.

783
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,290
How many coins do you have
that you brag so much?

784
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,230
I'm pretty successful.

785
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,030
If you give me one,
I'll become a good example.

786
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,060
Do you want it? Yes or no.

787
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,530
I want it, sir.

788
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,470
- Ye Eun. Do you have many coins?
- Princess Ye Eun.

789
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,600
- Can you spare...
- Ms. Good Influence.

790
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,740
- Ye Eun. Are you rich?
- Please spare me one.

791
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,840
- What happened here?
- I'm rich.

792
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,110
- What's this?
- I'm rich.

793
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,610
We got greedy and went bankrupt.

794
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,640
- You're bankrupt?
- For real?

795
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,650
- Yes.
- Yes.

796
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,650
Why did you do that?

797
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,780
- You shouldn't get greedy.
- Just...

798
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,850
stick to what's ordinary or average.

799
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,120
- What's this?
- Why go too far?

800
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,190
- What now?
- The bankrupt bros.

801
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,620
Some of you lost all your coins.

802
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,630
Yes.

803
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,630
We arranged a random opportunity
so you can...

804
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,760
win some coins back.

805
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,470
We'll give you coins
relative to the number of times...

806
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,170
- you hit your teammate.
- Really?

807
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,740
- Sounds good.
- Good.

808
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,970
I'll play like crazy.

809
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,270
It's me? Come here!

810
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,470
(Attacker: Seok Jin)

811
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,640
Hey. What's going on?

812
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,380
Grab someone.

813
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,380
Now!

814
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,550
He's my team,
and I still can't stand him.

815
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,220
Here goes.

816
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,050
He's targeting just one person.

817
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,350
Just Seok Jin. We're not a target.

818
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,860
Why just me?
Why are you chasing just me?

819
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,760
- Hey!
- Fell him over!

820
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,260
Darn you.

821
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,400
Okay.

822
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Okay.

823
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,330
(Whack)

824
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,900
Fight back!

825
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,040
Just let go.

826
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,540
It's too much.

827
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,810
Keep hitting him. That's it!

828
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,110
You'll get as many coins as
the number of times you hit someone.

829
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,350
- Jae Seok gets 53 coins.
- Okay.

830
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,720
- Se Chan will get 70 coins.
- My gosh.

831
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,390
- You're back in the game.
- I'm back.

832
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,550
Here are the coins you won.

833
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,390
- Okay.
- Thanks. Ye Eun.

834
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,390
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

835
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,260
I'll use this to get back up.

836
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,360
It's still something.

837
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,760
- Yes.
- Thank you.

838
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,100
They gave you another life.

839
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,430
Gosh, Se Chan. You're rich.

840
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,800
- Se Chan's rich.
- Se Chan's rich.

841
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,570
Okay! That game was hard work.

842
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,910
I should try to get back up.

843
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,940
- What's this?
- What is this?

844
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,850
It's time to choose
the next travel destination.

845
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:49,850
Let's go!

846
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,750
(Two doors lead to
the next destination.)

847
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,020
The entrance fee is on the door.

848
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,020
It costs seven coins
to enter Room A.

849
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,290
- Gosh. It's too expensive.
- The price is too...

850
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,260
Seven coins? Why is it so expensive?

851
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,260
(On the other hand)

852
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,070
It costs two coins to enter Room B.

853
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,100
You must pay seven coins
to enter Room A,

854
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,740
- and two to enter Room B.
- Okay.

855
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,970
- We must go to the nice place.
- You know me.

856
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,980
Keep in mind that you can enjoy
your 1st pick for 30 minutes,

857
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,710
and after 30 minutes,
you can visit the other room.

858
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,720
- This is the destination?
- We can switch?

859
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,450
Yes, but to enter
the new destination,

860
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,060
you must pay the entrance fee.

861
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,560
- Each room can hold...
- The destination...

862
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,730
- four people.
- Really?

863
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,660
I don't scrimp
when it comes to traveling.

864
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,560
- Me neither.
- Even though I'm stingy.

865
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,230
I once went to an amusement park
with Jong Kook.

866
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,340
He spent 2,000 dollars there.

867
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,370
- I spend on trips.
- For real.

868
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,540
- For real?
- Your ultimate goal...

869
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,810
is to save up coins...

870
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,440
- to buy a souvenir.
- Yes, to shop.

871
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,940
Still, you must spend.

872
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,210
You must go where it's nice.

873
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,210
You know me.

874
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,250
- Save up.
- Save up?

875
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,480
Save up?

876
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
I'll save up.

877
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,020
- You will?
- Pay the tour guide.

878
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,090
Okay.

879
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,490
Would you like to pay?

880
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,720
Here's two.

881
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,760
You must spend
when you're traveling.

882
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,260
- Seven coins.
- The extra cost...

883
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,560
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook
pay 7 coins.)

884
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,560
- Thanks.
- You may stand over there.

885
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,960
I'll pay two coins.

886
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,130
It's not 2, it's 7.

887
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,130
Two for that room.

888
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,600
- You're going there?
- Two for me too.

889
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,840
- Two coins.
- Two coins.

890
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,010
Two coins from me.

891
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,370
One of you must join them.

892
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,640
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

893
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,480
- Not me.
- I don't want to go.

894
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,610
- No.
- You three...

895
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,610
You shouldn't scrimp when traveling.

896
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,650
Life is about flexing!

897
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,980
When traveling...

898
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,550
Okay. I'll show some good influence
and give up my spot.

899
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,920
Daniel, pay five more coins.

900
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,020
Yes. It's so hot out here.

901
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,560
Here are five more.

902
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,360
You paid the entrance fee,

903
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,000
so you can go inside.

904
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,130
Still, it looks...

905
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,900
- What's this?
- You'll regret it.

906
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,600
- Okay!
- Let's go.

907
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,070
- It's nice here.
- Gosh.

908
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,810
Let's go.

909
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,810
- It's nice here.
- Gosh.

910
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,210
- It's luxurious.
- How nice is this?

911
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,440
It's cool in here.

912
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,740
This is what we want.

913
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,180
(They exclaim loudly
as soon as they enter.)

914
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,550
It's so nice here.

915
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,350
- As I always say...
- My gosh. Look.

916
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,550
There's a pool too.

917
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,750
Why don't you have a nice soak?

918
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,390
This is no joke.

919
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,130
Isn't that the devil's fruit?

920
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,060
- It's dragon fruit.
- Dragon fruit.

921
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,130
What's this? There are games too.

922
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,430
What's that?

923
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,330
I don't know. It says "dud."

924
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,340
(Lots of things to play)

925
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,740
This is why we earn money.

926
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,540
- That's right.
- This is why we work.

927
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,380
- Open for meal time?
- Food?

928
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,480
We can eat.

929
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,540
- No way.
- "Meal time open."

930
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,310
- Let's eat.
- You can eat.

931
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,310
It says travel funds are closed.

932
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,650
- Hey.
- This is the place to be.

933
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,920
- Is this...
- You can enjoy...

934
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,250
- everything freely.
- For real?

935
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,820
- Enjoy everything freely.
- For real?

936
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,120
- Is it all free?
- You can...

937
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,020
- enjoy everything freely.
- For 30 minutes?

938
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,290
For how long?

939
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,760
You can enjoy everything freely.

940
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,660
- Can we eat everything?
- Can we eat everything?

941
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,230
Are you serious?

942
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:58,130
(7 coins gave them
the freedom to eat.)

943
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,400
- I love it!
- We can eat!

944
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,570
Let's have ramyeon.

945
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,540
- We get to eat!
- Jong Kook!

946
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,010
- Cook some ramyeon.
- Getting to eat...

947
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,180
- Cook some ramyeon.
- Cook some ramyeon.

948
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,210
- Let's cook ramyeon.
- Tell me if you need anything.

949
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,380
- Let me know if you need help.
- Hey, make the ramyeon.

950
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,450
- Make the ramyeon!
- Make the ramyeon.

951
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,020
- Gosh, this is...
- Hey, make the ramyeon, man!

952
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,920
- Can we open the fridge?
- Ms. Guide.

953
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,790
- Jong Kook, we can open the fridge.
- What?

954
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,620
Hey, make the ramyeon.

955
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,020
- Can we eat it?
- My gosh!

956
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,160
- Pork belly!
- My gosh!

957
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,290
(There's pork belly too!)

958
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,290
- Can we eat it?
- My gosh!

959
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,160
- Pork belly!
- My gosh!

960
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,530
That's insane!

961
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,700
- Isn't this crazy?
- Gosh, pork belly.

962
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,900
- Hey, hurry up and grill it.
- Jong Kook, pork belly!

963
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,100
Hey, Ji Ye Eun, that fool.

964
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,870
- Should we grill it?
- I mean, for seven coins...

965
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,340
- For 7 coins?
- For 7 coins,

966
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,340
- What is this?
- this is totally...
Hurry up and grill the meat
over there.

967
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,340
- My gosh!
- I'll make the ramyeon.

968
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,940
- These prices are cheap.
- What is this?

969
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,980
Seven coins is cheap.

970
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,050
- Can we eat this?
- My gosh.

971
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,380
- I'll grill the meat.
- Make the ramyeon.

972
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,050
- Hey, grill the meat.
- Gosh, what is this?

973
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,650
- What is this?
- What is all this?

974
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,150
(The quality of the refrigerator
is worth their entrance fee.)

975
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,950
(He spots something.)

976
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,590
Gosh, there's chicken breast!

977
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,260
- My gosh!
- Jong Kook!

978
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,560
Hey, hurry up and make the ramyeon.

979
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,130
This is what I call happiness!

980
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,930
- They have hamburger steaks too.
- Gosh, hamburger steaks!

981
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,330
- What's there to life?
- No way.

982
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,830
- Those fools.
- This is what life is all about.

983
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,270
- We should enjoy life, fools.
- Of course.

984
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,300
That's what I always say.

985
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,500
- Don't try to save money on a trip!
- Of course not!

986
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,070
Not on a trip!

987
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,640
- My goodness.
- Don't make your family suffer.

988
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,240
Hey, will you take these coins
with you when you die?

989
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,180
My goodness.

990
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,580
Don't try to save money on a trip.

991
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,280
You can't enjoy yourself.

992
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,420
And in life,

993
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,750
- you never know when you'll go.
- Right.

994
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,350
- How would you know?
- That's what I'm saying.

995
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,750
Hearing you say that makes me sad.

996
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,290
You never know
when it's your time to go.

997
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,690
You never know with life.

998
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,020
- Everyone will go someday.
- Right.

999
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,290
This is really popular these days.

1000
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,060
- Can I have one too, Seok Jin?
- Sure.

1001
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,600
(The trip goers enjoy watermelon
as an appetizer.)

1002
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,970
You should travel with people
you get along with.

1003
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,070
I know, right?

1004
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,840
- Travel mates are important.
- On a trip...

1005
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,440
So,
this is what they call a vacation!

1006
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,970
(Haha gets the ramyeon going.)

1007
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,080
Gosh, seriously, what is this?

1008
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,580
They're seriously not coming here?

1009
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,710
(Daniel gets ready
to grill the meat.)

1010
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,380
- I love this.
- Hey, we're only five coins apart.

1011
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,620
- Those fools.
- And honestly,

1012
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,320
- this should've cost 20 coins.
- I know.

1013
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,750
What's this?
What is the Cost Effective Room?

1014
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,050
(What about the members who went on
a 2-coin Cost Effective Tour?)

1015
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,190
Hey, this isn't too bad.

1016
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,520
- It's nice and cool to begin with.
- It's all right.

1017
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,660
- It's so nice.
- This is so nice.

1018
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,590
What is this?

1019
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,700
Gosh, it's hot.

1020
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,860
It really is hot.

1021
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,800
- Let's dip our feet first.
- What is this?

1022
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,830
(Small rubber basins where they can
barely wash their feet in)

1023
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,070
This is... My gosh.

1024
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,000
Can we just cook for ourselves?

1025
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,940
- I'm hungry.
- What is this?

1026
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,470
There's something fun.

1027
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,940
There must be something here.

1028
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,840
It's such a humid day.

1029
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,310
Why did you turn on humidifiers?

1030
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,580
It's so humid right now.

1031
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,550
- They have food here too.
- I know, right?

1032
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,120
Can we just cook for ourselves?

1033
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,850
It says meal time is open.

1034
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,420
(The Cost Effective Room is
also open for meal time.)

1035
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,620
There's ramyeon too!

1036
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,760
They have ramyeon too?

1037
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,030
- Can we eat this?
- Of course we can.

1038
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,230
- Jae Seok!
- Yes?

1039
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,460
- There's a freezer and everything.
- What?

1040
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,900
- No way.
- There's food in there too.

1041
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,030
- What?
- No way.

1042
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,170
There's tteokbokki!

1043
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,340
They have sausages too.

1044
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,900
(Cost Effective Room: sausages,
Luxury Room: pork belly)

1045
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,210
(Cost Effective Room:
whole watermelon that's hard to cut)

1046
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,510
(Luxury Room: Pre-cut watermelon)

1047
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,380
- No way.
- Jae Seok! Can we have watermelon?

1048
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,010
I wish I could have some watermelon.

1049
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,480
- Eat. Can we eat this?
- Please.

1050
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,580
How much does it cost?

1051
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,110
- Is it free?
- And the tteokbokki!

1052
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,820
- You can just eat it yourselves.
- "Eat it yourselves?" Wait.

1053
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,020
- Mister.
- Wait a second.

1054
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,250
- Hey, that's not right. Wait.
- This is...

1055
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,990
- This must be a trap.
- We have to eat after we negotiate.

1056
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,820
- Just hurry up and tell us.
- The tteokbokki!

1057
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,990
Are we paying to eat?

1058
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,260
Or can we just eat?

1059
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,390
I'm not the guide here.

1060
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,030
- I mean...
- Is there a guide?

1061
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,900
- Let's have the tteokbokki.
- What do you say?

1062
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,770
- You can eat it by yourself.
- All right.

1063
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,900
- Jong Kook... What's that?
- Oh, my.

1064
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,470
- Wait, Jong Kook... What's that?
- Oh, my.

1065
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,740
Gosh, that scared me.

1066
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,340
(The ukulele man appears
out of nowhere.)

1067
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,540
Unde pote gracia

1068
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,950
Mister.

1069
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,450
- Excuse me.
- What did he say?

1070
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,380
(He must be embarrassed too
as his face keeps getting redder.)

1071
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,250
Hey, that's not it.

1072
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,350
(Doesn't care at all)

1073
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,090
(Singing)

1074
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,360
- Mister.
- What brings you here?

1075
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,960
It's good to see you.

1076
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,560
- I'm...
- I see you everywhere these days.

1077
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,160
Yes, I go wherever people call me.

1078
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,460
Friday, Saturday, Sunday...

1079
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,930
- You look so dry and fluffy.
- You're so...

1080
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,600
- Your hair is so nice.
- Mister, do you have debt?

1081
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,700
Why are you working so much?

1082
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,900
I went to the salon
for the first time in a while.

1083
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,170
- You went to the salon?
- Yes.

1084
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,370
You smell nice.

1085
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,740
- You smell like baby powder.
- I know.

1086
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,140
You must've been
somewhere nice and powdery.

1087
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,340
Do you wash yourself these days?

1088
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,540
I wash up sometimes.

1089
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,650
- You've made it big. You even wash.
- You smell nice.

1090
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,650
Oh, yes.

1091
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,180
I sprayed some essence in my hair.

1092
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,720
- I can smell it.
- Yes.

1093
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,020
I think Ji Ye Eun fell for him.

1094
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,450
- It's good to see you.
- I think Ye Eun fell for him.

1095
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,520
Do you like me?

1096
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,920
What in the...

1097
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,660
- That's just what she's like.
- What is up with her?

1098
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,190
Are you really going to be like this
all of a sudden?

1099
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,930
- I guess you like this type.
- Well, actually...

1100
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,460
She's a cheerful weirdo.

1101
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,100
A cheerful weirdo. A cheer-weird.

1102
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,230
But why are you here?
What are you doing here?

1103
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,600
Well, I...

1104
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,540
You chose the Cost Effective Tour.

1105
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,640
- Yes.
- Right.

1106
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,940
In charge of
the Cost Effective Tour,

1107
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,170
I'm your guide.

1108
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:37,350
Woo Il is here!

1109
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:40,120
Nice!

1110
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,650
Nice!

1111
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,690
- By the way...
- Nice!

1112
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,790
- Woo Il.
- This is...

1113
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,990
Your voice was so hoarse
when you said, "Woo Il is here."

1114
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,660
- You've been saying it too much.
- I have.

1115
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,990
- You've said it too much.
- Oh, dear.

1116
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,260
So, I'm your guide, in charge of...

1117
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,600
- your Cost Effective Tour.
- Is that so?

1118
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,700
- If you ask for some coffee,
- Yes?

1119
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,630
- I could make it for you.
- Really?

1120
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,170
- That's nice.
- If you ask for food, I could cook.

1121
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,000
You could cook for yourselves,

1122
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,670
or you could ask me
for what you need.

1123
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,440
- This place is nice.
- I could do it for you.

1124
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,210
(The guide looks a bit shabbier
for some reason.)

1125
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,610
Woo Il is joining us. That's nice.

1126
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,910
Well,
you can tell me anything you need.

1127
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,350
- We should have a meal.
- Yes, let's eat.

1128
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,420
- A meal.
- You can cook for yourselves.

1129
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,120
- You said you'd cook for us, so...
- How much is it?

1130
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,550
The cost is...

1131
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,820
Since it's based on market price,

1132
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,060
I can't tell you that.

1133
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,760
- Yes.
- But you have to tell us.

1134
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,590
- You have to tell us for us to eat.
- Don't you think so?

1135
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,630
Just eat it first.

1136
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,830
And based on the flavor,

1137
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,300
- Excuse me.
- the prices might change.

1138
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,830
We're your seniors here.

1139
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,740
- I'm the seventh batch at KBS.
- Okay?

1140
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,770
- Which batch are you?
- Which batch?

1141
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,210
- But we're at SBS right now.
- It doesn't matter.

1142
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,270
I was accepted into SBS too.

1143
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,840
- Oh, you got into SBS too?
- Yes.

1144
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,110
- He did.
- Really?

1145
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,480
He got into MBC and everything.

1146
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,910
Which batch are you?

1147
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,350
I'm in the 26th batch.

1148
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,680
- The 26th? What year was that?
- That's much later.

1149
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,720
In 2011.

1150
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,750
You have to behave yourself.

1151
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,690
Hey, junior. Do a good job.

1152
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,990
But aren't you an actress?

1153
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,460
- She's your senior for being on TV.
- Were you a comedian too?

1154
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,090
- I'm your senior for being on TV.
- Is that so?

1155
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,100
- She was on TV first,
- But I...

1156
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,100
- so she's a senior.
- Still...

1157
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,200
(Woo Il is being grilled
by the 15-year crew of Running Man.)

1158
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,700
By the way, what year were you born?

1159
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,730
I was born in 1981.

1160
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,770
- You're the same age.
- Yes.

1161
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,800
- Hey, friend!
- Are we the same age?

1162
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,840
- Hey, buddy!
- Really?

1163
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,640
This guy has longer hair than me.

1164
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,070
- Friend...
- It's good to see you.

1165
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,940
- It's so...
- Take a look around.

1166
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,280
- Let's take a look.
- The ice box.

1167
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,080
- The ice box is insane.
- Yes.

1168
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,380
You can eat what you want to eat.

1169
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,080
Jae Seok, how about ramyeon...

1170
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,480
- Tteokbokki.
- with those eggs...

1171
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,520
- Let's do that.
- Yes.

1172
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,220
- Shall I make the ramyeon?
- Will you do that?

1173
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,350
- Chop up some kimchi.
- Ramyeon?

1174
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,560
- I'm good at making ramyeon.
- There's a lot of stuff.

1175
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,320
You can make it yourself.

1176
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,860
- Then... Yes.
- With the ramyeon,

1177
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,630
let's add this
and make a meal out of it.

1178
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,660
With fried eggs.

1179
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,100
Okay, let's make fried eggs.

1180
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,900
- There are sausages in here too.
- Oh, right.

1181
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,330
Friend, will you grill these for us?

1182
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,240
- Oh, these? Okay, got it.
- Yes.

1183
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,840
By the way, can you grill up
the dried filefish too?

1184
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,110
I can grill it all up.

1185
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,940
- How many dried filefish?
- One dried filefish.

1186
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,980
- Two? One?
- Yes.

1187
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,040
I'll only grill one dried filefish.

1188
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,010
- One sausage, one dried filefish.
- Okay.

1189
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,350
- Se Chan, I like mine over easy.
- Okay.

1190
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,180
(As a pro,
he wears a sanitary mask.)

1191
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,990
(He takes out the sausage...)

1192
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,990
(with his hand?)

1193
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,660
Friend, are you grilling the sausage
with your hands?

1194
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,960
- No, I have gloves on.
- Oh, gloves.

1195
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,630
Will that be okay? The fire...

1196
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,430
You shouldn't touch the fire.

1197
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,500
(He ends up using tongs.)

1198
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,660
Hey, still,

1199
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,270
there's a lot of good food.

1200
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,630
We have everything.

1201
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,000
(The quality of the menu is lower
compared to the room next door.)

1202
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,640
Who wants ramyeon?

1203
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,770
Me.

1204
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,140
Gosh, I like this.

1205
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,980
This feels like a vacation.

1206
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,210
(This feels like a vacation.)

1207
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,310
With Woo Il here,

1208
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,050
- it's like a comedian's retreat.
- Yes.

1209
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,050
Have some. No worries.

1210
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,350
- One dried filefish.
- What should I do with this?

1211
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,090
- Filefish. You pronounced it wrong.
- One dried filefish.

1212
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,120
- One dried filefish.
- One dried filefish.

1213
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,520
- I like dried filefish.
- Okay.

1214
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,930
How long have you been working here?

1215
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,060
(He spots Woo Il's cheat sheet.)

1216
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,360
You have your lines...

1217
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,900
- But why...
- Hey, Woo Il.

1218
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,170
No, they're not my lines.
It's for the guide...

1219
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,570
It's the guide's manual.

1220
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,800
Gosh, you have a big role.

1221
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,000
- Yes.
- Woo Il.

1222
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,070
- Woo Il has made it big.
- He has.

1223
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,310
How can he have cue cards?

1224
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,510
- He's on "Home Alone" these days.
- I know.

1225
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,040
I saw it.

1226
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,310
(Meanwhile, Se Chan is about to
make fried eggs.)

1227
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,650
I'm okay.

1228
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,250
What's this?

1229
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,190
Is it a boiled egg?

1230
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,290
What's this?

1231
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,090
(A boiled egg instead of a raw one)

1232
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,160
What is this?

1233
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,320
Why is this boiled?

1234
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,990
(He cracks another egg.)

1235
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,400
- What is this?
- Boiled eggs...

1236
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,130
- But...
- Why are there boiled eggs in...

1237
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,570
- Mister!
- What?

1238
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,900
Mister, these are...

1239
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,440
They're soft-boiled.

1240
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,010
No, we were going to make
fried eggs. What are these?

1241
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,140
- Mister.
- Don't you like boiled eggs?

1242
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,380
- I mean...
- Wait, raw eggs...

1243
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,610
We don't have raw eggs.

1244
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,610
Are these ones raw?

1245
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,520
The tteokbokki looks good.

1246
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,780
First of all,

1247
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,790
- the sausage is done.
- Oh, the sausage? Nice.

1248
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,050
- That's Ji Hyo's.
- Sir, this is too burnt.

1249
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,450
But it's too...

1250
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:41,090
- Is that okay to eat?
- Is that still edible?

1251
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,490
It's slightly... Yes.

1252
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,830
- Isn't it too...
- I wanted to add a smoky flavor.

1253
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,460
I did it to add a smoky flavor.

1254
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,730
It's not burnt. No.

1255
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,200
(After a prim excuse, he focuses
on grilling the dried filefish.)

1256
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,200
It's too burnt.

1257
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,540
- Why is the dried filefish burnt?
- This is...

1258
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,840
It's too burnt.

1259
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,210
- Why is the dried filefish burnt?
- This is...

1260
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,040
- This is too burnt as well.
- It's too...

1261
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,410
Dried filefish tastes best...

1262
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,840
- when it's slightly burnt.
- The flavor?

1263
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,880
It's not slightly burnt, though.

1264
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,550
But if you don't let it burn
like this, it smells fishy.

1265
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,320
- Do you like fishy stuff?
- Yes.

1266
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,580
Oh, really?

1267
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,920
(Maybe because it's a cost effective tour,
everything seems a bit lax.)

1268
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,220
- You can eat it if you want. But...
- Mister.

1269
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,420
You can't work like this.

1270
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,790
- By the way, Se Chan...
- Okay?

1271
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,920
- Is that okay?
- This is...

1272
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,560
- I mean, Woo Il is...
- You should...

1273
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,190
Why do you get so angry
whenever you look at me?

1274
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,160
You seem so full of anger.

1275
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,600
Does anyone need anything else?

1276
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,230
Sir, are there any pickled radishes?

1277
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,370
- Pickled radishes?
- Yes.

1278
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,770
Pickled radishes. Wait a second.

1279
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,670
- Yes, we have pickled radishes.
- Yes.

1280
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,670
- In the bottom of the fridge.
- Is it at the bottom?

1281
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,740
The lower shelf.

1282
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,150
Pickled...

1283
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,980
I'll just eat what you give me.

1284
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,420
Where are the pickled radishes?

1285
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,280
- The pickled radishes?
- They're not here.

1286
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,690
If they're not there,
you should go and buy them, mister.

1287
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,250
Mister.

1288
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,790
- Friend, the pickled radishes.
- Mister.

1289
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,490
- The bottom shelf.
- Go and buy some, then.

1290
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,630
Oh, there they are.

1291
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,330
Gosh, thank you.

1292
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,330
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1293
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,560
Mister, do a good job.

1294
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,200
I thought it was a Korean melon.

1295
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,530
- A Korean melon?
- Doesn't it look like one?

1296
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,870
- Egg and soy sauce rice is good.
- I thought it was a Korean melon.

1297
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,370
- The sausage is really...
- It's beautiful.

1298
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,440
All right. Pickled radishes.

1299
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,570
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1300
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,970
- Is there anything else you need?
- Oh, my.

1301
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,340
- Water?
- The water...

1302
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,340
It's still boiling.

1303
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,780
- There's nothing here.
- Go back to your seat.

1304
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,810
I'll serve this when it's done.

1305
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,580
- Really?
- Should I pour up to the line...

1306
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,920
- or slightly below it?
- Slightly below it.

1307
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,350
I know exactly what you mean.

1308
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,650
I'm serious when I say
we're out of energy...

1309
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,320
and starving.

1310
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,920
- This is one with extra water.
- Right.

1311
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,460
- Thank you.
- With extra water.

1312
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,790
Two were made
with slightly less water.

1313
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,790
This is too much water!

1314
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:26,960
This is too much water!

1315
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,660
(There's too much water.)

1316
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,930
- This is like the Han River!
- Hey, mister.

1317
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:30,930
- Yes?
- This is like the Han River.

1318
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,230
You poured in too much water.

1319
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,270
(He can't even get the water right
for cup noodles.)

1320
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,040
- How about this, then?
- I'll have that instead.

1321
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
- Sure.
- Have it right now.

1322
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,970
- No, I'll have it.
- Okay.

1323
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,310
- Then...
- Pour it up to the line.

1324
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,710
Woo Il, pour it up to the line.

1325
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,280
- Up to the line. Got it.
- I should've done it myself.

1326
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,550
I poured it up to the line.

1327
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,080
(Delivering cup noodles
with the right amount of water)

1328
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,520
- I'll take that. Thanks.
- Sure.

1329
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,150
- Thanks, Woo Il.
- Careful.

1330
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,250
The tteokbokki.

1331
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,720
Why isn't there enough?

1332
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,060
- Mister!
- What is it?

1333
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,160
- What...
- Are you kidding me?

1334
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,730
How is someone supposed to eat this?

1335
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,300
- What's wrong?
- I meant the line inside,

1336
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,660
not the brim.

1337
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,000
The brim.

1338
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,030
(He lost all their faith
thanks to his watery noodles.)

1339
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,400
Mister, I won't be paying for this.

1340
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,070
- Oh, no.
- Mister, you can't pour water...

1341
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,270
over the line like this.

1342
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,440
- Oh, dear.
- Too much sodium is bad for you,

1343
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,610
so try it for now.

1344
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,510
- I'll try it, then.
- Go ahead.

1345
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,680
(Guide Im might lose his job!
What will happen to him?)

1346
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,450
What's taking this so long?

1347
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,150
Darn.

1348
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,080
(The griddle has been on the stove
for a while.)

1349
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,990
(Nothing's happening.)

1350
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,450
I bet they'll have it rough.

1351
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,860
Two griddles are stacked
on top of each other.

1352
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,060
Hey!

1353
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,000
(The blame falls on Daniel,
who placed the meat.)

1354
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,260
Hey!

1355
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,800
- You idiot!
- Come on.

1356
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,900
- Sorry about that.
- No wonder.

1357
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,240
- But this...
- The griddle wouldn't heat up.

1358
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,640
- Who placed the griddles?
- Unbelievable.

1359
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
I'm sorry.

1360
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,210
- Seriously?
- Is this for real?

1361
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,440
- I didn't know.
- Really?

1362
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,570
It wasn't me who placed the griddle.

1363
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,740
What's wrong with you?

1364
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,280
- Seok Jin, wasn't it you?
- Hold on.

1365
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,880
(He's correct.)

1366
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,420
(Seok Sam set them on the table...)

1367
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,120
(not realizing
there were two griddles.)

1368
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,120
- Lift it up.
- Who stacks two griddles?

1369
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,890
Let me. No wonder.

1370
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,520
(Daniel was scolded for no reason.)

1371
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,160
Why don't we sing a song?

1372
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,360
Just press any button.

1373
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,430
Jong Kook, is there a song
you want to sing?

1374
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,370
- How about "Black Cat Nero?"
- I...

1375
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,530
- No, not that.
- No?

1376
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,640
- I love "Twist King."
- I want to sing one...

1377
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,170
by Byun Jin Sub.

1378
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,610
(Normally, when they do karaoke)

1379
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,170
(He doesn't get off the couch.)

1380
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,710
(Jong Kook stayed seated
while the others had fun.)

1381
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,810
(Even when they play his song...)

1382
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,620
(Please...)

1383
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,450
(Even though he's a singer,
he hates taking the mic.)

1384
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,520
I used to love Jin Sub's songs.

1385
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,990
(For some reason,
Jong Kook volunteers to sing.)

1386
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,620
("To Lady" by Byun Jin Sub)

1387
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,100
Go, Jong Kook!

1388
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,270
Can you believe this?

1389
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,670
I love you, Kim Jong Kook!

1390
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,410
Why can't he chant to the beat?

1391
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,510
(Despite the disruption
from an intense fan,)

1392
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:01,350
(he truly shows how good he is
in his element.)

1393
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,830
(Lost in the song)

1394
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,360
(Joining in for a duet)

1395
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,230
(They lock eyes,
which comes off as rather cheesy.)

1396
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,870
(The staff enjoys
this rare performance...)

1397
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,070
(from Singer Kim.)

1398
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,210
(Crowing)

1399
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,540
(The original product)

1400
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,980
- No way.
- That was incredible!

1401
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,780
Jong Kook,
I see you differently now.

1402
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,950
That brings back so many memories.

1403
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,290
(He's embarrassed for no reason.)

1404
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,460
I love that song.

1405
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,690
All this time, I only saw you
as a strong, muscular guy.

1406
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,790
Seriously?

1407
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,890
I'm celebrating
my 30th year as a singer.

1408
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,560
No way. That was insane.

1409
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,370
Daniel, he won the Grand Prize
on all three major TV networks.

1410
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:51,430
No way.

1411
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,870
- He owes it all to me.
- He released amazing songs.

1412
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,100
Does he owe it all to you?

1413
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,610
(Meanwhile, Haha's ramyeon
is cooking up deliciously.)

1414
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,240
(Adding some ssamjang)

1415
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,310
Haha, are you adding ssamjang...

1416
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,340
- to the ramyeon?
- Just a little bit.

1417
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,880
- Does it taste better with some?
- It adds depth.

1418
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,910
Really?

1419
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:09,420
I believe this is the best choice
I've made all year.

1420
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,050
I was right to spend seven coins.

1421
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,120
This song is just as good.

1422
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,260
(The pork belly that'll impress
Seok Sam is being cooked as well.)

1423
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,620
Isn't there some doenjang?

1424
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,530
Is there a good song I can sing?

1425
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,760
(Feeling cheerful, Singer Kim
wants to sing another song.)

1426
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,100
Jong Kook, I loved that song.

1427
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,560
- I love songs by Boohwal.
- Well...

1428
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,130
There's a song that goes,
"What you didn't..."

1429
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,600
- That's "The More I Love."
- Yes, "The More I Love."

1430
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,600
- That song's killer.
- "The More I Love."

1431
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,640
Should I raise the key?

1432
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,640
("The More I Love" by Boohwal)

1433
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,240
(My gosh)

1434
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,180
This intro!

1435
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,020
When was this song released?
In your 20s?

1436
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,680
I think this came out
when I was in high school.

1437
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,390
- In high school?
- Was it when I debuted?

1438
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,360
Close the fridge door, Seok Jin.

1439
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,860
(Wide open)

1440
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:50,890
Come on. It's not like...

1441
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,130
(Obedient)

1442
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,000
(Starting off on a good note
after making him close the door)

1443
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,910
(A rare sight of seeing
a singer actually sing)

1444
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,410
No way.

1445
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,350
(Singing passionately,
even though no one asked him to)

1446
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:17,390
Where would you experience
something like this?

1447
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,490
We're listening to Jong Kook sing
while grilling meat.

1448
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:22,990
Here we go!

1449
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,390
(The sound of grilling meat overlaps
like the sound of rain.)

1450
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:28,900
(This is just like
a live singing cafe in Misari.)

1451
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,940
(Guests from Seoul,)

1452
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:39,610
(and even the kitchen lady,
are lost in the music.)

1453
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:46,550
(While he continues
to passionately sing)

1454
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,020
Your ramyeon is ready!

1455
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,420
Get your ramyeon!

1456
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:54,420
- This is great.
- Take a bowl each.

1457
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,420
No way.

1458
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,290
A singer is singing for us,

1459
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,700
an actor is grilling meat for us,

1460
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,260
and the all-around entertainer
is cooking ramyeon for us.

1461
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,330
Meanwhile, Seok Jin
is serving our food.

1462
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,330
(Seok Jin, Comedian, Server)

1463
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,840
(They could go out
and open a live cafe of their own.)

1464
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,180
(Nice!)

1465
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,610
Joy!

1466
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,480
- It's here.
- Joy!

1467
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,890
- Joy is right here.
- Right here!

1468
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,020
Joy, when did you come to us?

1469
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,530
(He passionately sings
without being able to eat.)

1470
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,200
- Nice.
- That was amazing.

1471
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,400
Amazing!

1472
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:39,940
When will I ever get
to hear Jong Kook sing live?

1473
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,170
- That was insane!
- No way.

1474
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,010
- I see.
- Is it done already?

1475
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,210
(When the performance ends,
their food is ready to enjoy.)

1476
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,780
- These were grilled nicely.
- I didn't want them to burn.

1477
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,610
- I love the color on them.
- Don't they look good?

1478
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:50,810
It burned a little over here.

1479
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:51,880
This is insane.

1480
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,250
Dumplings!

1481
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,150
It feels weird to have ramyeon
after singing like that.

1482
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,290
I feel like I'm on vacation.

1483
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,220
Should this be allowed?
It's a first for me.

1484
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:01,590
Is this even allowed?

1485
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:02,620
(Suspicious)

1486
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,990
(Unresponsive)

1487
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:06,060
- Is this even allowed?
- We paid for this food,

1488
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,200
so enjoy.

1489
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,070
- Just enjoy the food.
- Can we really eat freely?

1490
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,070
Of course. We paid for this.

1491
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,570
What if we get a penalty
based on how much we ate?

1492
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Come on.

1493
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,510
Look at that.

1494
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,080
(A big bite)

1495
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,640
Can we really eat freely?

1496
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:27,080
(The others enjoy the food
without questioning it.)

1497
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,180
- Should I turn off the stove?
- See the color on that.

1498
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,350
- It's really good.
- This is delicious.

1499
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,320
- Really?
- How can it taste like this?

1500
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,460
- Have a dumpling.
- Grilled pork belly...

1501
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,130
with ramyeon?

1502
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,700
(He has a bite after seeing
how freely the others are eating.)

1503
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,270
We'll be doing
so much more after this.

1504
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,400
- Haha, the ramyeon is amazing.
- It makes no sense.

1505
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,500
It's so good.

1506
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,340
(They feel as if seven coins
bought them the world.)

1507
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,410
Try wrapping the noodles around it.

1508
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,680
- It's so good.
- Have a dumpling.

1509
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,840
This is insane.

1510
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,680
- You know...
- Here's your rice.

1511
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,880
- Thank you so much.
- My gosh.

1512
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,820
Are you going
to heat that up for us?

1513
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,180
(They were served the rice
that Seok Sam requested.)

1514
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,220
- Thank you.
- No way.

1515
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:06,390
How can only five more coins
give you a meal this much better?

1516
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:08,420
- I mean...
- Life is all about...

1517
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,690
- making wise choices.
- Some know how to have fun,

1518
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,060
while some don't.

1519
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,900
Why do you think
I save up plastic bags?

1520
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:15,730
It's the same as this.

1521
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:16,930
(Overjoyed, he lectures them
on life's philosophy.)

1522
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,130
That's how I live my life.

1523
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,870
- By saving up plastic bags,
- Exactly.

1524
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,840
- I'm frugal most of the time.
- you could afford a house.

1525
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,870
You then go on vacations.

1526
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:24,510
- This is cheap if you ask me.
- Yes.

1527
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:25,910
It didn't cost us much.

1528
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:29,110
I bet that two-coin meal
is giving them a hard time.

1529
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,550
Since this is cost-effective,

1530
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:34,950
we don't have a lot of choice
for protein.

1531
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,750
- We only have fried eggs.
- We only have fried eggs.

1532
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:41,160
(Chef Yang took over for the guide
who wasn't earning their trust.)

1533
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:47,030
It's nice to sit back
and be served by my juniors.

1534
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,160
Just sit tight.

1535
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,600
(Filling their stomachs
with 8 eggs at once)

1536
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,770
This is great.

1537
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,630
- The fried eggs are almost done.
- Sure.

1538
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,210
Look how pretty this is.

1539
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:01,240
(The most cost-effective
source of protein)

1540
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,680
That's pretty.

1541
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,980
(The fried egg pancake is ready.)

1542
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:04,980
Here are the fried eggs.

1543
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,150
Is there anything else you need?

1544
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,980
- We're good.
- Are you sure?

1545
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,590
We're lucky we're getting this much.

1546
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,050
That looks so good.

1547
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,760
- I'll cut this for you.
- Thanks.

1548
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:16,060
I need ketchup.

1549
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,260
That looks good.

1550
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,130
Who needs a plate?

1551
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,300
(Eating their meal
with economical side dishes)

1552
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,400
- Can I get a plate?
- Sure.

1553
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:25,870
It's so good.

1554
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:26,870
Here you go, Ji Hyo.

1555
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,370
That looks good.

1556
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,070
This looks good. I'll enjoy.

1557
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,540
- Please enjoy.
- Goodness.

1558
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,870
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1559
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:33,940
(Cutting the sausage
to prove he helped out)

1560
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,480
(Yummy)

1561
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,750
- Be grateful for this much.
- I haven't had fried eggs lately.

1562
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,460
I think I should add kimchi to this.

1563
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,290
(Seasoning the ramyeon with kimchi)

1564
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,960
Let me give you a pointer.

1565
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,060
It'll taste really good
with a fried egg.

1566
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,700
- In the ramyeon?
- That's right.

1567
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,070
- Now...
- I should add a fried egg.

1568
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,900
You should. This is really good.

1569
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,270
Ramyeon with a fried egg
is to die for.

1570
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:04,570
- Help us out, okay?
- I get it.

1571
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:05,870
Of course. You can trust me.

1572
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:07,510
(Yummy)

1573
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,240
- It's good, isn't it?
- Is it okay?

1574
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:12,850
Then, that's good.

1575
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,420
(Not knowing about
the feast next door,)

1576
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,980
(they're pretty satisfied
with this meal.)

1577
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,490
- It's okay, isn't it?
- Nice.

1578
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:20,490
This is good.

1579
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,390
You're not going to dump
a huge bill on us later, are you?

1580
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,900
Gosh, this is so good.

1581
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:30,870
(Brushing his hair over
to focus on eating)

1582
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:32,970
Gosh, this is good.

1583
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:33,970
(Mumbling)

1584
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,270
(Right then,
the green guide comes in.)

1585
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:39,240
(Tearing off)

1586
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,340
- What's that?
- What?

1587
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,310
What? "Win travel expenses?"

1588
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,350
As you wanted,
you will play a game to win...

1589
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:51,190
- travel expenses. Yes.
- Really?

1590
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,990
He's getting changed now.

1591
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:55,190
This is the Cost Effective Tour,
you know?

1592
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:58,830
I'm in charge of that part
as well as this one.

1593
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,700
- Gosh, I had a good meal.
- Mister, do you need help?

1594
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,860
So, are you okay?

1595
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,330
(Meanwhile, he's fishing for laughs
with his slapstick act.)

1596
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,330
Oh, yes.

1597
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,100
(Meanwhile, he's fishing for laughs
with his slapstick act.)

1598
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,470
- Do you need help?
- No, I'm fine.

1599
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:11,840
One of the buttons was
still done up.

1600
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,080
(The variety show seniors aren't
impressed by the low-quality joke.)

1601
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,480
I'm done. All right.

1602
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,580
Yes, so you can win back...

1603
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,780
- some of your travel expenses.
- Yes.

1604
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,120
- You should give us a chance.
- Yes.

1605
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,620
What's that?

1606
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,090
It's opening. It's open!

1607
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:28,560
Oh, it's open.

1608
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,890
We can just win it back here.

1609
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,230
Hey, they even let us make money.

1610
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,830
(But if you think about it,)

1611
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:42,370
(they only paid 7 coins
to come in...)

1612
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:45,810
(They had fun and ate
without any conditions.)

1613
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:49,740
(They were anxious about it.)

1614
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:53,450
From now on, it's time for
Self-Sufficient, Win Travel Funds.

1615
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,350
(A suspicious vacation
that even lets you earn coins)

1616
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,820
Okay.

1617
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,550
Those of you who want to earn
travel funds, gather here.

1618
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,260
- I should go.
- Okay!

1619
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,820
(They erase the suspicions
from their minds.)

1620
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,890
- Let me take one of these.
- I should go too.

1621
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:06,760
(The members are simply excited
about winning coins.)

1622
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,860
Hello.

1623
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:08,860
Hello, Ms. Guide.

1624
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,330
Gosh, here, for our travel funds...

1625
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:12,870
We can just win them back.

1626
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:13,900
This is Water Gun Survival...

1627
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,000
- to earn travel funds.
- Okay.

1628
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,270
This game will proceed
in a 1-on-1 format.

1629
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:20,980
The 2 contestants will take turns
to choose 1 water gun...

1630
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,750
out of the ten
and shoot it at the opponent's face.

1631
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:24,750
- Okay.
- Yes.

1632
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:28,180
However, among these water guns,
only one works properly.

1633
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:31,090
- The other nine are broken.
- Oh, okay.

1634
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:34,290
Before the water gun fight begins,
the guide and two contestants...

1635
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:37,790
will take five fruit cards
and place them in order.

1636
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:41,000
At this time, the number of cards
that match the guide's card order...

1637
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,860
will be the number of normal
water guns that you can get.

1638
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,070
How many you match up?

1639
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:46,740
Therefore, how well you read
the guide's mind...

1640
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,840
will have a critical effect on
your choice of water guns.

1641
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:54,080
The contestants can bet as many R coins
as they want on their victory,

1642
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,910
and if they win, they will get five times
the R coins that they bet.

1643
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:59,250
(They get 5 times the amount
of R coins that they bet.)

1644
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,720
There's nothing more to see, then.

1645
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,120
- Let's sit right down.
- Sit.

1646
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,550
- Sit down, man.
- This...

1647
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:05,890
This is 30 coins.

1648
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,560
- What?
- How many?

1649
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,260
(Haha will bet half of
his entire fortune of 62 coins.)

1650
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,390
Haha, that's right.

1651
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:14,260
Gosh, are you betting 30 coins?
That's a huge bet.

1652
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,400
(Tossing the coins)

1653
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,870
Hey.

1654
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,830
What, JK? Scared?

1655
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,400
Just run
the barbecue restaurant properly.

1656
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,770
Hey,
we haven't closed our restaurant.

1657
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:24,770
(An actual article: "Haha, Jong Kook
Close Barbecue Restaurant?")

1658
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,470
People still line up outside.

1659
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,780
Please have Gym Jong Kook
come and confirm it.

1660
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,450
- Okay, do a good job.
- Yes, sir.

1661
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:31,450
(Their barbecue place recently had
unintended rumors about closing.)

1662
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,620
I want to bet five coins here.

1663
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,620
How many is this?

1664
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,850
- Ten.
- Ten.

1665
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,290
Your cards have to match up
with the guide's, right?

1666
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,360
- I'm sorry, but... Ms. Guide?
- Let's see.

1667
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,060
Could you say stop for me?

1668
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:45,490
- Stop, please.
- There we go.

1669
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:47,300
- What is that?
- Excuse me, Ms. Guide.

1670
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,700
- Yes?
- I've made up my mind.

1671
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,970
- Just...
- You said stop for me.

1672
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,670
- It's random anyway.
- Of course.

1673
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:53,700
(Shuffling)

1674
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,070
- She's not looking at the cards.
- Really?

1675
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,370
She's not looking.

1676
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:59,310
- Gosh, really?
- Indeed.

1677
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,810
- She's like me.
- Indeed, she's a risk-taker.

1678
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:03,750
Will you please set mine up?
I won't look either.

1679
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,510
- Oh, really? Okay, then.
- Yes, I'll leave it up to you.

1680
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,020
(Everyone, including Haha,
sets their cards at random.)

1681
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,890
Okay, let's go.

1682
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:11,920
That's so insincere.

1683
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,260
- You're not just lazy, are you?
- I know.

1684
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,190
- That was so insincere, you know?
- Gosh, this is...

1685
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,990
- What do you care?
- What do I care?

1686
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:19,390
All right. Let's go, Ms. Guide.

1687
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:21,030
Yes, please reveal the first card.

1688
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:22,430
(The guide's 1st card is revealed.)

1689
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:24,370
- Okay!
- Oh, an apple.

1690
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:25,770
- Apple?
- Apple.

1691
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:26,800
(Will the two contestants
also get the same apple card?)

1692
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,240
- Apple!
- You don't know what you have yet.

1693
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,110
- What is it?
- Let's see.

1694
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,310
Why are you taking so long?

1695
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,480
- It's red!
- It's red!

1696
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,180
- It's red.
- Mine is red too.

1697
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,850
- It's red.
- Me too.

1698
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:39,610
- Oh, hey. Is it a peach?
- Show us.

1699
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,650
It's not.

1700
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:41,680
- I hope it's not.
- Is it?

1701
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,920
- I don't think so.
- It's not.

1702
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,990
It's an apple!

1703
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:45,920
(It matched with the guide's card.)

1704
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,290
It was a match. My gosh.

1705
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,490
- Gosh, that was a match.
- Hey.

1706
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,690
- It was a match.
- I told you I wanted to bet five.

1707
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,900
- Orange. Gosh, it's an orange.
- Oh, man.

1708
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,170
- Hey, this is actually possible.
- It was actually a match.

1709
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,500
What if he gets another match?

1710
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,070
- Okay.
- It can actually be a match.

1711
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:02,170
Reveal the second card.

1712
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,240
Okay, number two!

1713
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,640
- Peach!
- It's similar.

1714
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,870
- Peach.
- The leaf.

1715
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:07,740
- I'll just go.
- Okay. Peach.

1716
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,050
- Darn it!
- A banana. It's totally different.

1717
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,250
Is it a match?

1718
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,250
- The odds of the second card...
- Is it round?

1719
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,780
- also being a match are slim.
- Oh, that's not a match.

1720
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:15,820
Orange.

1721
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:18,120
- Reveal the third card.
- No.

1722
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:20,620
(The banana which Haha already has)

1723
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,260
- It's not a match.
- Mine is definitely not a match.

1724
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,660
Okay, I still have a chance.

1725
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,260
- A yellow one.
- Gosh, still.

1726
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,730
- I'm glad he already had this.
- The yellow one...

1727
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,800
I don't think that's it.
If you saw that much, it's not a match.

1728
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,270
- It's not a match.
- It's okay, though. She had this.

1729
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,270
- It's better to get what she had.
- Yes, what she had before.

1730
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:34,570
You still have a chance.
Do you have grapes?

1731
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:35,800
- Let's go, grapes.
- All right.

1732
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,810
- Grapes.
- Let's go.

1733
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,710
- Orange.
- Darn it.

1734
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,180
- I had that before.
- Both of his will be wrong.

1735
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,480
- I had both.
- If you don't get grapes here...

1736
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,110
- He got a match.
- No.

1737
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:46,650
- I got a match!
- You got a match.

1738
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:48,680
- No.
- I got a match!

1739
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,980
(Haha got a successful match
with the grapes.)

1740
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,020
- Grapes!
- If it's not grapes, it's a match.

1741
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,760
- He got it.
- Grapes!

1742
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,890
- He got it, then.
- Grapes!

1743
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:56,560
- Right, he got one.
- He got it.

1744
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,760
- Please.
- Grapes!

1745
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,090
(Then, Jong Kook needs
a banana this time.)

1746
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,130
- If it's yellow, you win.
- Please be grapes.

1747
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,960
- You can't get purple.
- Please be grapes.

1748
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,700
- Nice!
- Hey.

1749
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:06,000
- Hey. He got a match.
- I got it.

1750
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,070
- That's a match. Last one!
- Two, one.

1751
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:09,540
- Okay, in 1, 2, 3.
- Grapes.

1752
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,870
- Two and one.
- Gosh, I got a match.

1753
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:12,770
- He got 2 matches.
- I got 2 matches.

1754
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:16,680
Then, Jong Kook had 2 matches
and Haha had 1.

1755
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,610
This is a huge advantage.

1756
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:21,480
- Haha, you'll get a gut feeling.
- Then will there be 3 or 2 in here?

1757
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,780
I don't have that gut feeling.

1758
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,790
So, 2 and 1?

1759
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,290
Haha, just try to feel it.

1760
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,390
(Out of 10 water guns, only 2 are
real for Haha, and 3 for Jong Kook.)

1761
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:29,720
- Who goes 1st?
- You have good odds with 3.

1762
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,960
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors?

1763
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,130
- Winner goes first.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1764
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,630
The winner definitely
has an advantage.

1765
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:35,030
- But it's random.
- That's right.

1766
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:37,230
There are broken water guns
and real ones.

1767
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,970
This time, I have my hidden move.

1768
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:41,340
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1769
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,970
Go ahead.

1770
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,010
(He picked one!)

1771
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:46,140
JK, goodbye.

1772
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,010
(Fail)

1773
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:50,010
Next time.

1774
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:52,010
- All right, Seok Jin. Watch.
- Okay.

1775
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,380
- There are three.
- Do you have a feeling? Yes.

1776
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,280
- Consider the distribution.
- The distribution.

1777
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,250
- Would they all be in the middle?
- This area and that...

1778
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,120
- No.
- There's one on the side for sure.

1779
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,090
- Right.
- That's right.

1780
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:02,990
- There's one on the side for sure.
- That's true.

1781
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:04,630
- This is too hidden.
- Yes.

1782
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,390
- Doesn't it seem intentional?
- Yes.

1783
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:08,300
Since you can pick this up easily?

1784
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,300
- He grabbed one.
- That makes sense.

1785
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:11,800
He grabbed one.

1786
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,130
Hey.

1787
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,940
Run the barbecue restaurant
properly.

1788
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:17,440
Hey, aren't you taking off
those sunglasses?

1789
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,240
- Here it comes.
- Aim.

1790
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,280
(The odds are 30 percent!)

1791
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:27,420
Russian roulette.

1792
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:29,550
(Fail)

1793
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,990
Come on.

1794
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:32,990
(Pretending like he wasn't scared)

1795
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:35,020
- It wasn't real.
- He survived!

1796
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,390
(It's the Mapo-gu Sheriff's
turn again.)

1797
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:38,930
- JK.
- Yes?

1798
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:41,100
- I've been waiting for this moment.
- Okay.

1799
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:44,800
(Out of the 9 remaining guns,
2 are real.)

1800
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,070
Farewell, JK.

1801
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,770
(He fails again.)

1802
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,810
(Groaning)

1803
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,240
Oh, boy.

1804
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,680
(Screaming in frustration)

1805
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,180
It's such a shame.

1806
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,080
- Hey.
- Gosh, it would've felt so good!

1807
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,480
That was so cute, you know?

1808
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,690
Yes, right.

1809
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,490
- The side.
- The side?

1810
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:06,720
(He chooses from the side again.)

1811
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,090
- It's definitely on the side.
- I'm sure.

1812
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,290
Why did you do that to me?

1813
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,460
(Flinching)

1814
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,700
(There isn't any!)

1815
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,270
- There's no water, is there?
- There's no water.

1816
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:20,270
There isn't any!

1817
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:21,670
- Really?
- Why did you go on...

1818
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:23,340
"Boss in the Mirror?"

1819
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,470
Why did you go on
"Boss in the Mirror?"

1820
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:28,540
(Business partner Kim seems to
have lots of resentment.)

1821
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,810
Why did you have to
cause problems...

1822
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:31,810
for no reason?

1823
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:35,080
- No!
- Why? For no reason?

1824
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,850
(Shaking his head)

1825
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,190
That was precise, wasn't it?
It was on the side.

1826
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:41,790
- You're right.
- It was on the side.

1827
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:42,820
- I told you, for sure.
- Darn you!

1828
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,590
Darn it.

1829
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,100
- It was this one.
- I was going to pick that next.

1830
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,860
Seok Jin, the side.

1831
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,700
- Gosh, you get 50.
- Did I just lose 30?

1832
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,070
- Yes.
- Jong Kook won.

1833
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:54,470
Jong Kook won.

1834
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:56,370
You will get five times
the amount you bet.

1835
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,070
- Gosh, Jong Kook. Fifty coins.
- All right.

1836
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,310
- You suddenly became rich.
- Okay.

1837
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:00,510
I'm not exactly rich yet.

1838
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:01,580
- I didn't have money.
- Here are your coins.

1839
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,480
- Thank you. I had no money.
- My goodness.

1840
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,480
Jong Kook, if you had the money,
how much would you have bet?

1841
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,580
- Probably about 20.
- Probably 20? My goodness.

1842
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,390
- Hey.
- At least 20.

1843
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:13,890
No, it's fine.
My goodness. At least 20.

1844
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:14,990
Let's go.

1845
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,890
- Turn, roulette!
- Turn!

1846
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:19,760
(They're also playing a game
to win travel funds.)

1847
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,260
Turn! All right.

1848
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,860
(A human roulette)

1849
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,600
This stays still,
and my hand spins around.

1850
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,340
There are only three duds.
The rest are all...

1851
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,340
But if I get a dud,
I would go crazy.

1852
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:32,240
- Five.
- Five? Okay.

1853
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,080
- I don't trust this.
- Here we go.

1854
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,740
- Turn!
- Turn!

1855
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,980
Turn, roulette!

1856
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,320
Stop!

1857
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,690
Stop!

1858
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:46,390
(Five times, so easily?)

1859
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,620
- It was random.
- For real?

1860
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,960
- Hey, what was that?
- There's a formula to this.

1861
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,530
Se Chan.

1862
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,460
- All right. Here we go.
- This actually works.

1863
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:57,170
Because I don't have
very many R coins.

1864
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:59,700
I have the fewest coins.
I'll bet everything except two.

1865
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,740
Okay. Ten, here we go.

1866
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:05,470
The roulette spins!

1867
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:06,510
Spin!

1868
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:10,980
- Stop.
- Stop.

1869
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:12,810
- Stop.
- What?

1870
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:14,580
Plus five!

1871
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:17,150
(After Se Chan, it's Ji Hyo.
They win 2 times in a row.)

1872
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:18,920
- Not bad.
- I want to go next.

1873
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:20,050
I'll collect R coins
a bit at a time this way.

1874
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,020
- I want to go next.
- I did it for real.

1875
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,190
- Listen.
- Yes?

1876
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:25,230
I'm from the seventh term.

1877
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,330
(It's a visit
from a senior comedian.)

1878
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:28,430
That's...

1879
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:30,530
- Okay.
- I'm your senior.

1880
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:31,970
In that case,

1881
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:35,040
I'll put more care into it.

1882
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,300
I'll do it for real.

1883
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,370
- All right.
- Let's begin.

1884
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,940
Five coins.

1885
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:39,970
Let's go.

1886
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,040
Stop!

1887
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:43,280
Stop!

1888
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:46,050
- May I try it as well?
- I'll bet the same number of coins.

1889
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,080
- I want to try it.
- Okay.

1890
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,580
- This...
- I'll do it properly.

1891
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,780
- He seems trustworthy.
- Okay. Good.

1892
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,690
- He seems trustworthy now.
- Good.

1893
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:52,890
- I'll bet ten coins.
- Ten.

1894
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:53,890
Ten?

1895
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:55,560
(He invests 10 coins right away.)

1896
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,590
Here I go.

1897
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,960
Here I go.

1898
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:00,400
(The human roulette sets off.)

1899
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,170
Stop!

1900
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,730
- Minus 5.
- Minus 5.

1901
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,300
Stop!

1902
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:08,470
- Minus 5.
- Minus 5.

1903
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,370
(He loses 5 coins
right after winning 5 coins.)

1904
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:12,140
- My finger landed here.
- Five coins?

1905
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:13,470
Do you want to go once more?

1906
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,210
- Once more.
- Once more. Okay.

1907
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:17,350
- My goodness.
- You can talk to the guide.

1908
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:18,550
I'll bet ten coins.

1909
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:19,850
Here I go.

1910
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:21,420
Here I go.

1911
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:23,450
- Stop!
- Gosh!

1912
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,090
You know, Jae Seok...

1913
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:27,920
(Jae Seok said "Stop"
when his finger was here.)

1914
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,190
(But Woo Il put his finger here!)

1915
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,190
You know, Jae Seok,

1916
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:34,700
he was determined
to pick that block.

1917
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,130
- Jae Seok.
- That was...

1918
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,270
I think I saw this scene
in my dream.

1919
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:38,300
Seriously, what you've done...

1920
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,470
- I saw this scene in my dream.
- is unacceptable.

1921
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:40,570
- After all...
- He did it right.

1922
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:41,870
- I did it right.
- No.

1923
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:43,740
- He did it right.
- He didn't go in a circle.

1924
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,970
- No, he didn't.
- His finger went across the wheel.

1925
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,540
- Woo Il...
- His finger moved like this.

1926
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:49,180
- He went, "Gosh!'
- No.

1927
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:52,180
- Our motor nerves have...
- We need to be fair.

1928
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,280
their limits.

1929
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,820
So even if you tell me to stop,

1930
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,220
- it takes me time to hear it...
- Right.

1931
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,450
and stop my finger on a block.

1932
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,190
You should know that.

1933
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:00,420
I want to try it too.

1934
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,090
- All right.
- Ye Eun is here.

1935
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:03,320
Okay. That's good.

1936
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,590
Ye Eun is here.

1937
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,590
All right.

1938
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,460
- I'll bet ten coins.
- Ten coins. Okay.

1939
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,830
- Once you put the coins here,
- I'll put them here.

1940
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:12,170
- you can't touch them.
- Three, four...

1941
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,940
I'll go slowly. All right.

1942
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,340
Wait for him to go around once.

1943
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:22,810
(Ddochi wait for the right timing.
with caution)

1944
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,150
Stop!

1945
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,250
(Minus 10 coins)

1946
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:29,120
- You said "Stop" here.
- You said it here.

1947
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,490
- You know, Ye Eun...
- Ye Eun.

1948
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:32,250
Stop.

1949
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:36,160
(She shouted
when he was at minus 10.)

1950
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,390
- You said "Stop" there.
- That was...

1951
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:38,990
- You said "Stop" there.
- I couldn't help you.

1952
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:40,330
- Seriously.
- Ye Eun, you said "Stop" there.

1953
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:42,300
- Everyone saw it.
- The guide became startled.

1954
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,460
We saw it. You said "Stop" there.

1955
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,930
- I couldn't help you.
- For goodness' sake.

1956
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:45,970
- Seriously.
- All right.

1957
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,100
Okay. My friend.

1958
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:49,340
My friend, I'm serious
when I say this.

1959
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,170
- These are all the coins I have.
- Okay.

1960
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,010
All right. Let's begin.

1961
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:54,080
(Ji Hyo is currently at the bottom
in terms of coins.)

1962
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,680
These are all the coins I have.

1963
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,040
- How many coins do you have?
- You have many coins.

1964
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,610
- You have many coins.
- You had a bag full of coins.

1965
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:00,050
- Okay.
- This is half the amount.

1966
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:01,180
- Let's begin.
- All right.

1967
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,680
- Spin!
- Spin!

1968
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,420
- Spin!
- Roulette!

1969
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,450
Minus.

1970
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,520
Minus.

1971
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,020
Minus.

1972
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:12,590
- Stop.
- Gosh!

1973
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:13,660
(Gosh!)

1974
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,100
(Ji Hyo said "Stop"
when his finger was here.)

1975
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,570
(But Woo Il put his finger here
again!)

1976
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:20,130
My goodness.

1977
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,540
- Is it possible to win?
- Just now...

1978
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:22,840
Just now, did you see Ji Hyo?

1979
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,240
- "You little..."
- Did you see her?

1980
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:25,640
"You little..."

1981
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:29,210
Why did you keep moving
when I told you to stop?

1982
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:30,310
- Hold on.
- At "S," I was here.

1983
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:32,480
- Mister.
- At "Top," I was here.

1984
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,550
- At "Top," I was here.
- I'll call a district office.

1985
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:35,580
I'll report you.

1986
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,290
- Seriously.
- You need to cancel it.

1987
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,050
Mister, do you have permission
to run this establishment?

1988
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:41,020
- Check the camera.
- You need to cancel it.

1989
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,020
- This...
- Hurry up.

1990
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,160
- It can't be helped.
- Cancel it.

1991
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,290
- No, I can't cancel it.
- He can't cancel it.

1992
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:45,830
- You need to pay up.
- For goodness' sake.

1993
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:47,330
- But...
- There are other games.

1994
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,130
- There are other games.
- Let's play other games.

1995
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:50,160
Let's play other games.

1996
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,730
- Let's play other games.
- Other games.

1997
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,100
- Okay.
- Seriously,

1998
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,940
- I can't play games anymore.
- I lost 15 coins here.

1999
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,200
- I can't do it.
- I only have a few coins.

2000
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,810
There are other games.

2001
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:00,270
That man is a swindler.

2002
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,910
(That man is a swindler.)

2003
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,310
- Isn't this Find Woo Il?
- No.

2004
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,880
This game is
the Matching Fruits Machine.

2005
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,380
- What's that?
- Matching Fruits Machine.

2006
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,950
(Random Fruit Game)

2007
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:11,190
We were going to set up
a slot machine,

2008
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,550
but it was too expensive.

2009
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,590
- Mister.
- In three slots,

2010
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,390
- Okay.
- the reels will spin.

2011
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:17,990
When you shout "Stop..."

2012
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:19,760
- and press the button,
- Stop.

2013
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,460
the fruits will appear.

2014
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,460
(1 of 3 fruits will appear
at each slot.)

2015
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:26,430
If all three fruits are the same,
you'll win...

2016
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:28,600
- five times the coins you bet.
- If all three are the same?

2017
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,770
(You get 5 times the coins you bet
if all 3 fruits are the same.)

2018
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:31,040
- If all three are the same?
- Yes.

2019
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:33,210
- Five times, right?
- You have a chance.

2020
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,080
Who wants to go first?

2021
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,710
- Me.
- How many coins will you bet?

2022
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:37,810
(The senior who is an easy target
goes first.)

2023
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:38,850
- All right. The roulette...
- Five.

2024
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:39,880
- I'll bet five coins.
- Five.

2025
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:40,980
Okay. Good.

2026
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:42,580
Let's begin.

2027
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:44,150
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

2028
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:45,150
All right.

2029
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:46,890
The Matching Fruits Machine...

2030
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:49,120
will start now.

2031
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:52,560
(Spinning)

2032
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,630
The machine will start now.

2033
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,900
(Startled by the low quality
that exceeds expectations)

2034
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,270
Do I say "Stop"
without seeing the fruits?

2035
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:03,470
(He presses the stop button.)

2036
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,470
(Ding!)

2037
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:08,910
(Ding!)

2038
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,240
(Orange)

2039
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,380
(Pineapple)

2040
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:12,450
(Orange)

2041
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,680
(They aren't the same.)

2042
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,520
These people are swindlers.

2043
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:21,120
They're swindlers. Jae Seok.

2044
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,490
- This is...
- Incorrect.

2045
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,530
- Hey, mister.
- Come here.

2046
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:26,560
Drag out this man.

2047
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,600
- Hey, mister.
- Come here.

2048
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,660
- Drag out this man.
- Hold on.

2049
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,930
- Mister.
- Seriously.

2050
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:30,930
- Are you kidding me?
- Listen.

2051
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:31,970
Are you kidding me?

2052
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,330
- What's this?
- What's this?

2053
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:34,840
- This is nonsense.
- What's this?

2054
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:35,870
All right.

2055
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:38,040
This is a cost-effective tour.

2056
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,240
- This isn't cost-effective.
- This makes no sense.

2057
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,740
- We just got...
- We just got played.

2058
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,310
- This is nonsense.
- We just got robbed.

2059
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:45,610
I'm sure you know this.

2060
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:47,920
We can't see each other's fruits.

2061
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:49,220
- He lost five coins.
- Seriously, we...

2062
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,320
- I lost 20 coins here.
- We chose the fruits...

2063
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,490
as we wanted.

2064
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,820
- All right. Let's go.
- I'll give it a go.

2065
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:54,860
- Okay. Let's go.
- Listen.

2066
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:55,960
- You're...
- This is nonsense.

2067
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,430
You're just toying with us.

2068
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:58,630
- Let's begin.
- Five coins.

2069
01:05:58,630 --> 01:05:59,830
- Gosh.
- Five coins?

2070
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:02,660
Good. Se Chan will bet five coins.

2071
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,030
The Matching Fruits Machine...

2072
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:05,800
will begin.

2073
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:08,870
(Pressing)

2074
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:12,470
(Two bananas!)

2075
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:15,610
(The last one needs to be a banana!)

2076
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,510
(Pineapple)

2077
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,050
Come on! Are you kidding me?

2078
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:21,880
Hey, are you kidding me?

2079
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,580
Mister, are you kidding me?

2080
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,820
- What's this?
- Come on out.

2081
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,090
- Come on out. I'll drag him out.
- Hey, you.

2082
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:28,420
- Come here.
- Let's teach him a lesson.

2083
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,460
- Seriously.
- Mister, come on out.

2084
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,990
- Listen.
- Mister, what are you playing at?

2085
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:32,990
- All right.
- What are you playing at?

2086
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:34,600
- I mean...
- You're a ridiculous man.

2087
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,430
- You're a ridiculous man.
- What's this?

2088
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:38,800
Did you receive permission
from the district office?

2089
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,300
Take a look at the system.

2090
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,800
There is no way of knowing
which fruits...

2091
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,940
other people will pick.

2092
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:45,070
Then I'll go.

2093
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,670
- Ye Eun,
- There is no way of knowing that.

2094
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:47,910
you'll win this time.
The third time is the charm.

2095
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:49,480
- Otherwise, shut it down.
- Shut it down...

2096
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,680
- if I don't win.
- Really?

2097
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,310
Five coins.

2098
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:55,120
Five coins.

2099
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,320
- Why are you saying? Mister!
- If you guys talk...

2100
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,450
If you guys talk...

2101
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,720
(They get caught on the spot.)

2102
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,920
- Why are you saying? Mister!
- If you guys talk...

2103
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,690
- What?
- I mean...

2104
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,030
- What's this?
- Mister!

2105
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:07,030
What?

2106
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:08,860
- I won't play this game.
- You said something to her.

2107
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,700
- What?
- I won't play this game.

2108
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:12,500
I asked her if she had eaten.

2109
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,770
- You said something to her.
- All right.

2110
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:15,140
I'll tell you this.

2111
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:16,340
Ye Eun,

2112
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,970
today is your lucky day.

2113
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,070
Today is your lucky day.

2114
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:21,910
Ye Eun, Woo Il likes you.

2115
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:23,010
- Let's begin.
- Bet ten coins.

2116
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:24,580
- Then I'll bet ten coins.
- Okay.

2117
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:27,080
- I'll bet ten coins.
- I don't lie.

2118
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:28,950
I said that because you entered...

2119
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:31,120
at the perfect timing.

2120
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,590
- I'll bet ten coins.
- Okay.

2121
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:34,660
- All right.
- Woo Il likes you, Ye Eun.

2122
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:35,760
The Matching Fruits Machine...

2123
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,190
will begin.

2124
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:42,330
(If she wins this time,
she'll receive 50 coins!)

2125
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:47,940
(Two pineapples!)

2126
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:51,110
(Will there be the first jackpot?)

2127
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:55,640
(Say hello to an orange.)

2128
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:58,480
(Ye Eun failed.)

2129
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:03,980
Come on out.

2130
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,090
- Come on out.
- Come on out.

2131
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:06,890
- Come on out.
- Hold on.

2132
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:08,420
- You. Come on out as well.
- This is just...

2133
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,490
- Hey, come here.
- Jong Seo, come on out.

2134
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:10,760
- Come on out.
- Come here.

2135
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,060
- Come on out.
- Are you kidding me?

2136
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:13,490
Come on out.
What are you playing at?

2137
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,460
- I can't believe it.
- Seriously.

2138
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,260
- They're swindlers.
- I had no way of knowing.

2139
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,770
- I can't believe it.
- What was that?

2140
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:20,630
You said that I had a chance.

2141
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,700
The third time should be the charm.

2142
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:23,940
What are you playing at?

2143
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,410
- You said that I was lucky.
- I had no way of knowing...

2144
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:26,710
what the fruits would be.

2145
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:28,080
- All right.
- Okay.

2146
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,680
The three of you, decide on
one fruit while I ask nicely.

2147
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,480
- Shall we do that?
- Yes.

2148
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:32,550
In that case,

2149
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:33,880
Ji Hyo.

2150
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,080
- Ji Hyo, you should go.
- You're my friend of the same age.

2151
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,820
- You don't have any more coins.
- Seriously.

2152
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:40,420
- I only have about 12 coins.
- I lost my coins.

2153
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,260
- Are these all you have? Okay.
- Seriously.

2154
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,390
Bet five coins.

2155
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:44,890
- Help me this once.
- Okay.

2156
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,090
- Five?
- Five.

2157
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:48,330
Don't use all of your coins.
Just bet five coins.

2158
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:51,670
- Seriously, I...
- I'm ruined.

2159
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:52,730
You're too much.

2160
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:54,270
- You're too much.
- You're too much.

2161
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:55,400
Ji Hyo.

2162
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:57,170
You're very lucky.

2163
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,570
I won't say more.

2164
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,280
- How could he...
- You have a good friend.

2165
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,710
- You have a good friend.
- For goodness' sake.

2166
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:06,050
- Okay.
- You can bet more coins.

2167
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:07,450
This is your last chance.

2168
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:09,350
Will you bet 5 coins or 10 coins?

2169
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,320
- This is your last chance.
- Ji Hyo, go ahead.

2170
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,720
- Test your luck this time.
- Shall we begin?

2171
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,490
- No.
- Ji Hyo, go all in.

2172
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:15,620
Shall we begin for real?

2173
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:18,490
Aren't you afraid of the future B?

2174
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,330
Aren't you afraid of the future B?

2175
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:21,560
Will you bet all the coins?

2176
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,330
Be honest.
Aren't you afraid of the future B?

2177
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,970
- What's the future B?
- What does that mean?

2178
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:26,530
- What's the future B?
- Is that English?

2179
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,940
Aren't you afraid
of the future beating?

2180
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:29,340
- Okay.
- The future beating.

2181
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,970
- Beating. Okay.
- The future beating.

2182
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:33,770
- Most people use "Future trouble."
- The future B.

2183
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,140
Future trouble.

2184
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:37,680
- Is that what you mean?
- Future trouble.

2185
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,910
- Future trouble.
- Aren't you afraid of it?

2186
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,720
- I wondered what you meant.
- The future B. Okay.

2187
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,020
Seriously, help me this once.

2188
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,390
- Okay.
- Ji Hyo, bet all the coins.

2189
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:45,520
Seriously, help me this once.

2190
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,120
(People in the machine become busy.)

2191
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,860
- One.
- Seriously, these coins...

2192
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:50,190
(Spotting)

2193
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,430
- Ji Hyo.
- Seriously.

2194
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:53,760
It's okay. I think you'll win.

2195
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,060
- Go.
- Ji Hyo, this is your chance.

2196
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:56,530
- Go all in.
- Go all in.

2197
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:58,130
I think you'll win. Go. Ten coins.

2198
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:59,230
Only one coin remains.

2199
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:00,270
- Ten coins.
- Yes.

2200
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:01,340
Bet the last coin as well.

2201
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,470
- Trust me.
- That's incredible.

2202
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:05,270
- What's this?
- Really?

2203
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:06,440
It sounded a bit like
a confession of love.

2204
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,510
Yes, it kind of sounded like that.

2205
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:08,510
Hey.

2206
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,050
- "Trust me."
- "Trust me."

2207
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:12,080
(Is it a ploy to make her lose big?)

2208
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,810
- I'll bet the last one.
- Okay.

2209
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:14,920
- Press it, Ji Hyo.
- Seriously.

2210
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,150
(In the end, Ji Hyo goes all in.)

2211
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,850
The Matching Fruits Machine
will begin.

2212
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:20,290
Ji Hyo.

2213
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:23,090
(The slot machine of fate begins!)

2214
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:32,970
What?

2215
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:35,670
(There are two oranges!)

2216
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:38,010
(Will Madame Song get back
on her feet?)

2217
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,080
What?

2218
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:46,110
(The fruits don't match.)

2219
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:49,750
(Ji Hyo goes bankrupt.)

2220
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:57,320
- Ji Hyo, come here.
- Hey.

2221
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,490
(The customers got swindled
right under their noses.)

2222
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:04,100
(The beating begins.)

2223
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,200
- Ji Hyo, here.
- Hold on.

2224
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:09,640
(She throws a duck grenade.)

2225
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,340
- Hold on. Among us...
- Come here.

2226
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,640
- Hold on. We... No.
- Move out of the way.

2227
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,880
- Ji Hyo. No. Hold on.
- You...

2228
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,980
(She is about to throw water
at him.)

2229
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:20,810
- Don't do that. Hold on.
- I warned you.

2230
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:23,080
- Hold on. It isn't like that.
- I warned you about future trouble.

2231
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,190
- I mean...
- Look.

2232
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:27,090
- This is nonsense.
- They're swindlers.

2233
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,490
- I lost 30 coins.
- You...

2234
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:29,520
- Hold on.
- Just you wait.

2235
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,860
Let's bet coins over there.

2236
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,090
- After all,
- I have no coins to bet.

2237
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:35,100
if you fail to win coins here...

2238
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,230
- I'm leaving too.
- Have a nice trip.

2239
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:39,070
You're a swindler.

2240
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:41,400
- He is too much.
- I'm leaving too.

2241
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,540
(Hoping to win coins,
they move to the Luxury Room.)

2242
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:44,200
I lost 30 coins.

2243
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:46,140
I need to get back up
on my feet here.

2244
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:48,140
Now, I...

2245
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:50,310
- Gosh, hello.
- Hello.

2246
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:51,680
- Why did you guys come here?
- Why did you guys come here?

2247
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,050
- I want to play games here.
- That room is a fraud.

2248
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:55,320
- It's a fraud.
- Is it a fraud?

2249
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,320
- It's a fraud.
- You can't win coins there.

2250
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,390
- I lost a lot of coins.
- Hey, watch us play.

2251
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:00,990
Hey, did you guys have a good meal?

2252
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:02,060
- Yes. We had cup noodles.
- We had cup noodles.

2253
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:03,290
- Cup noodles.
- Gosh,

2254
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:04,890
- we had pork belly.
- Didn't you smell pork belly?

2255
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:07,160
- Everything was open to us.
- There were pork belly,

2256
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,700
- yogurt, and everything.
- I want a big break.

2257
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,230
- Everything was free.
- Over there,

2258
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:11,670
we had Im Woo Il as the guide.

2259
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:12,830
- It was a big mess.
- Really?

2260
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:14,170
- Yes.
- Yes. It's fun.

2261
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:15,170
- You should go.
- You should go.

2262
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,370
- Woo Il? Who?
- Woo Il.

2263
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:18,070
- Did Woo Il come?
- You can win coins there.

2264
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:19,470
- Jong Kook.
- You can win there.

2265
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:21,580
If you play games there,
you'll win so many coins.

2266
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:22,740
- Really?
- Make sure to go. You'll win.

2267
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,550
- What are the games?
- They're simple games.

2268
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:28,350
(Before entering the room,
Jae Seok organizes the coins.)

2269
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:31,820
Does the color mean something?

2270
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:34,150
This room is green,
while that room is...

2271
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,190
pink.

2272
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:40,360
(Jae Seok saw the betting zone
of the Luxury Room.)

2273
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:43,600
(Green)

2274
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:48,600
(The place where they ate earlier
was pink.)

2275
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:52,340
(The place where they played roulette
was green.)

2276
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,210
(You're changing.)

2277
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:59,450
(Guide Im changed into
a new outfit for some reason!)

2278
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:04,250
(Do the pink and green colors
mean something?)

2279
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:05,850
- Does anyone want to go?
- I want to go.

2280
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:07,320
- It's fun.
- Ye Eun and I want to go.

2281
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,390
- Do you have coins?
- Five times.

2282
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:09,460
I...

2283
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,230
You haven't paid the entrance fee.

2284
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:12,960
- Please pay the entrance fee now.
- For goodness' sake.

2285
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:16,260
(Woo Il felt bad and let Ji Hyo win
10 coins at the very end.)

2286
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,200
We should've entered this room
earlier.

2287
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,370
This is it.

2288
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,170
- Seven coins.
- Seven coins.

2289
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:22,800
Five, six, seven.

2290
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,840
- Thank you.
- Five times.

2291
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,140
I think this is better.

2292
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:26,240
What's this?

2293
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:29,080
- What's this?
- I'll explain the game.

2294
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,010
This game is called
the Rolling Bingo.

2295
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:33,250
You'll put 10 balls in the holes
1 at a time.

2296
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,150
If you complete a bingo,
you'll succeed in the mission.

2297
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:36,520
- That sounds good.
- If you succeed in it,

2298
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,120
you'll receive five times
the number of coins you bet.

2299
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,290
- Five times.
- Five times.

2300
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:41,590
If you fail to complete a bingo
with ten balls...

2301
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,290
If you fail to complete a bingo
with ten balls,

2302
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:46,160
you can pay 5 coins
to buy 1 additional ball.

2303
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,360
If it takes 1 more ball,
you'll get 4 times the balls you bet.

2304
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,800
If it takes 2 more balls,
you'll get 3 times the balls you bet.

2305
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,800
If it takes 3 more balls,
you'll get 2 times the balls you bet.

2306
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,870
This is hard.

2307
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:55,640
- Let's go. Let's do this.
- Why are you so determined?

2308
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:57,540
- I bet ten coins.
- Okay.

2309
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:59,670
(Jae Seok and Se Chan bet
10 coins each.)

2310
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:00,870
All right.

2311
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:02,840
This is hard.

2312
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,110
It isn't easy.

2313
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:06,780
Shall I begin?

2314
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:07,950
You need to do it
without any thought.

2315
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:09,080
(Will he be able to win coins
with the Rolling Bingo?)

2316
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,820
(Jae Seok's balls)

2317
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:12,050
For goodness' sake.

2318
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:13,150
It isn't easy.

2319
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,190
It goes over the holes.

2320
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:19,860
You shouldn't roll the balls
with too much force.

2321
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:21,360
I can't do it well.

2322
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,600
(Jae Seok's balls)

2323
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,630
Gosh. Look at that.

2324
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:25,470
(He fails 3 times in a row.)

2325
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:26,930
(He moves on
to the next ball right away.)

2326
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:27,970
Look at that.

2327
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,070
- I did it.
- He got one ball in a hole.

2328
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,970
(He finally filled one hole.)

2329
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:34,910
(Now, he needs to complete a bingo.)

2330
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:36,510
The balls bounce off.

2331
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:39,950
(He rolls the ball to the center.)

2332
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:41,350
(It lands on the bingo line!)

2333
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:42,350
- Go.
- You did it.
Get a ball in that hole.

2334
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,450
- Gosh. One more hole.
- One more hole.

2335
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,960
(Target hole)

2336
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,260
(He aims at the target!)

2337
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:51,530
(If he succeeds in it,
he'll win 5 times the coins he bet!)

2338
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:53,090
It'll go in.

2339
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:54,260
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2340
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:56,360
(The ball closely misses the hole.)

2341
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,070
- This game is hard.
- Please.

2342
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,600
(He misses again.)

2343
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:05,710
Getting it in that hole is hard.

2344
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:06,910
(Only 2 balls remain.)

2345
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:07,940
This is annoying.

2346
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,010
(The 9th ball...)

2347
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:11,180
(passes the target hole
in an annoying way.)

2348
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,280
It's over for me.

2349
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:14,510
- It's over for me.
- Hold on.

2350
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:16,980
(It lands two holes down
the target hole.)

2351
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:21,460
(He just needs to get a ball
in 1 of the 3 holes!)

2352
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:23,060
Only one ball remains.
What should I do?

2353
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,490
Does only one ball remain?

2354
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:28,260
(Out of the provided balls,
only one remains.)

2355
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,600
(Still, he has a chance!)

2356
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,670
(He rolls the last ball.)

2357
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:38,940
(Is it going
in the accurate direction?)

2358
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:40,370
(Faltering)

2359
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:42,640
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2360
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,180
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2361
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,310
(Sighing)

2362
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:48,720
(The location of the balls is
too good for him to give up.)

2363
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:50,550
- You should pay five coins.
- In that case...

2364
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:51,690
(You should pay 5 coins.)

2365
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:52,820
Give me one more ball.

2366
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,190
I don't have many coins left.

2367
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,260
- You need to go for it.
- You need to go for it.

2368
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:59,030
One ball. You need to go for it.

2369
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:00,130
(If he succeeds in it now, he'll get
4 times the coins he bet.)

2370
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:01,460
Jae Seok, this is the only way.

2371
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:02,630
That's right. This is the only way.

2372
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:04,570
- These four holes.
- You're right.

2373
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:07,370
Those two are doable,
but this one is a better option.

2374
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:09,340
Let's begin.

2375
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:11,840
(Will he succeed in it this time?)

2376
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:16,640
(Going in)

2377
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,250
- Hold on.
- He failed.

2378
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,110
- It's over.
- He was so close.

2379
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:22,820
For goodness' sake.

2380
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,620
Give me one more ball.

2381
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:27,390
This is...

2382
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:29,290
(The tiger moth spends
5 out of the 9 coins he has left.)

2383
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:31,060
(Jae Seok faces
the 2nd danger of going bankrupt.)

2384
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:32,730
If you succeed in it this time,
you'll get three times the coins.

2385
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:33,790
How much is it?

2386
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,930
(Super focused)

2387
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:40,770
It's over.

2388
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,700
It's over.

2389
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,000
(He failed.)

2390
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,210
Jae Seok, how many coins
did you lose?

2391
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:46,540
- How many coins do you have?
- I lost everything.

2392
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:47,980
(20 R coins evaporated.)

2393
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,040
Not even five.

2394
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,280
(Jae Seok only has 4 coins.)

2395
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,380
Jae Seok, will you stop playing?

2396
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:54,680
I don't have enough coins.

2397
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,820
(Staring longingly)

2398
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:00,250
Ye Eun.

2399
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:01,690
Ye Eun, give me one coin.

2400
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:04,460
I lost all the coins.

2401
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:05,530
Give me one coin.

2402
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:07,690
(In the end, Jae Seok borrows
from Ddochi again.)

2403
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:08,960
(Torn)

2404
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,400
I'm really sorry.

2405
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,230
Will you give me a coin if you win?

2406
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:13,400
I'll be sure to do that.

2407
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,700
(At least there is no interest.)

2408
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:15,940
Here are five coins.

2409
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:18,640
If you succeed in it this time,
you'll get twice the coins you bet.

2410
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,610
(It looks like Jae Seok is dying
to become a beggar again.)

2411
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:23,010
(Everything he has
depends on this round.)

2412
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:24,080
Gosh, this is...

2413
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:26,110
Please.

2414
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:30,550
(He rolled the ball.)

2415
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:34,150
(If he fails, he'll go bankrupt
for the 2nd time.)

2416
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:38,360
(He completed a bingo!)

2417
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,360
Did you do it?

2418
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,460
(Jae Seok succeeded in getting
2 times the coins he bet.)

2419
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:42,730
I'll only get 20 coins.

2420
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:44,430
- Thank you.
- Here are your coins.

2421
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:45,800
- There are 20, right?
- Yes.

2422
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,870
(Since he bet 10 coins,
he receives 20 coins.)

2423
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:49,100
I'll play another round
with ten coins.

2424
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,510
(I'll play another round
with 10 coins.)

2425
01:17:51,610 --> 01:17:55,780
(He hasn't come to his senses yet!)

2426
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:00,010
Jae Seok, what are you doing there?

2427
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:03,750
Jae Seok, you're playing the game
quietly by yourself.

2428
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:04,790
(It looks like Jae Seok can't stand
having some coins left.)

2429
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:06,950
(Gosh!)

2430
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:09,260
(Se Chan gave up a long time ago.)

2431
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,630
Jae Seok is playing the game
quietly...

2432
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:14,900
all day long.

2433
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,130
This is how you go bankrupt.

2434
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,770
Who wants to go first?

2435
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,270
- Jong Kook, why don't you go 1st?
- Okay. I'll go 1st.

2436
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,270
- I'll bet five coins.
- Five coins.

2437
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,040
Let me repeat what I said.

2438
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,240
We can't plan what to do
ahead of time.

2439
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,640
Since we came from the Luxury Room,
this place looks so shabby.

2440
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,850
All right. Let's begin.

2441
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:35,850
The Matching Fruits Machine
will begin.

2442
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:39,050
(Spinning)

2443
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,920
What's this?

2444
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:44,930
(It's a human slot machine
with the winning rate of 0 percent.)

2445
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,660
(What will be the result
for Kim Muscles?)

2446
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,400
(Ding, ding, ding)

2447
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,970
They're swindlers. Hold on.

2448
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:01,210
No. Hold on.

2449
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:03,880
(The client starts educating
the machine.)

2450
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,750
No. Hold on.

2451
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,350
(Trembling)

2452
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:09,350
- Okay.
- I thought he was nice.

2453
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:10,920
- As you can see...
- I mean...

2454
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,320
As you can see,
we can't plan anything.

2455
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,520
We just choose one and show it.
That's the truth.

2456
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,130
Aren't you giving signs inside?

2457
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:20,530
We're not doing that. Really.
This place is blocked.

2458
01:19:20,530 --> 01:19:21,700
We're not doing that.

2459
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,600
Let's try it one more time.
I'll do it.

2460
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,000
- Try it.
- I'll try.

2461
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,630
I'll bet 20 coins.

2462
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,300
- I'll go with 20.
- Okay.

2463
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,710
You've placed the highest bet
among the tourists who came today.

2464
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:34,810
We'll take extra care.

2465
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:36,880
- Fine.
- Matching Fruits Machine...

2466
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,110
will begin.

2467
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:41,920
(If Daniel succeeds,
he will get 100 coins!)

2468
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,520
(Two fruits are the same!)

2469
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,690
(Ding)

2470
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:51,830
(The fruits don't match.)

2471
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,530
- What is it?
- Seok Jin.

2472
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:55,300
- What is it?
- This is annoying.

2473
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,530
Hold on.

2474
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,600
This person. Seriously.

2475
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,600
Ding, ding?

2476
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,500
He holds the fruit a bit late.

2477
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:04,800
- Okay. Daniel.
- Okay.

2478
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,610
- They keep luring you.
- Is it annoying?

2479
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:08,280
It's very annoying here.

2480
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:10,640
But why are there
so many pink things here?

2481
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:12,150
But...

2482
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:14,180
- Pink?
- At the end, he...

2483
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,180
- Jong Seo isn't clear.
- This...

2484
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:17,950
- Hold on.
- Is there...

2485
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:19,290
This is weird.

2486
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,220
- The board...
- Do you have a bonus time?

2487
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:22,320
- Bonus time?
- Yes.

2488
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:24,520
A bonus depending on the bet.

2489
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,430
I've lost so many.

2490
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:27,960
- We can do it together, right?
- Success?

2491
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:31,800
I had great success over there.

2492
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,070
- Okay.
- You won?

2493
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:35,200
I bet 30 coins and won.

2494
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,440
You won?

2495
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:39,070
(He played Russian roulette
with Haha...)

2496
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:42,510
(and won.)

2497
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:46,780
(He returns as a nouveau riche!)

2498
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:49,220
- I'll bet 10.
- You'll bet 10. Okay.

2499
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:51,720
(Rolling)

2500
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:55,760
Goodness.

2501
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,430
- See?
- What is this?

2502
01:20:58,430 --> 01:20:59,690
- This...
- This is annoying.

2503
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:00,890
Second attempt. Let's do it again.

2504
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:03,060
- We'll start.
- Don't give signals.

2505
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:06,170
(The rich fool keeps shooting.)

2506
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:11,300
- Goodness.
- They're tempting you, right?

2507
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,870
(It's not a match.)

2508
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:14,840
- They're luring you.
- It feels like it will work.

2509
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,080
Ten more.

2510
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:19,550
- Okay.
- I'll give you a chance to bet 20.

2511
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,920
Okay. I'll bet two of these.
Let's go easy.

2512
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:23,920
(The nouveau riche guy
doubles his bet.)

2513
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,590
Why are you looking down?

2514
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:26,950
- Look in front.
- He's suspicious.

2515
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:28,590
The third guy is acting suspicious.

2516
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:29,990
- Okay.
- The cowboy hat.

2517
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:31,890
Okay.

2518
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:33,430
(He succeeds
if the last one is an orange.)

2519
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:35,330
Seriously!

2520
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:38,000
(The fool lost his bet.)

2521
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,600
- You guys have a sign, right?
- We don't.

2522
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:43,240
(He lost 40 coins in an instant.)

2523
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:46,970
(He doesn't give up
and tries the human roulette.)

2524
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:49,910
Stop!

2525
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:51,810
(He lost again.)

2526
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:54,710
(He kept earning and losing money.)

2527
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,720
- This person...
- So...

2528
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,820
Well done. I'll get going.

2529
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:00,120
Well done.

2530
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,820
- Bye, Woo Il.
- Okay.

2531
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:03,790
What is this?

2532
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:04,960
What is this?

2533
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:08,300
- Hold on.
- What?

2534
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:09,830
- Awesome.
- I think I know what it is.

2535
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:11,130
(What's the final course
of the Day Goblin's Tour?)

2536
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:12,900
We have to choose.

2537
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,230
There are two doors.

2538
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:16,770
We have to make a choice.
We'll be choosing today.

2539
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,910
We had a pink room
and a green room earlier.

2540
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:22,510
- That's right.
- Will it be pink...

2541
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,780
- Even the people wearing clothes.
- or green?

2542
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:26,510
Nice to meet you.

2543
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:27,880
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

2544
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,250
The shirt colors were different.

2545
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:33,190
(The guides are wearing
pink and green shirts.)

2546
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:35,120
- That's right.
- Will it be pink...

2547
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,190
or green?

2548
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:38,190
(What secret lies
beyond the two doors?)

2549
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:41,190
We're left with the final choice.

2550
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:43,400
There are two doors behind you.

2551
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,500
Choose a door you like and enter.

2552
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,000
- A door we like?
- Yes.

2553
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,670
- We have to choose.
- We'll give you some time.

2554
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:52,910
- Decide on a door.
- Four on each door, right?

2555
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:54,810
- No.
- No. There is no capacity limit.

2556
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:56,340
- Really? Then how...
- Your decision...

2557
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:59,810
will not be affected by others.

2558
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:01,820
- One by one.
- You will line up on this line,

2559
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:03,820
- and when we count to three,
- One, two, three.

2560
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:05,290
- you can choose a side.
- Okay.

2561
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:07,250
- What is this?
- What is beyond this?

2562
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:08,250
- Will we not bet on anything?
- Like the color of the rooms.

2563
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:11,730
- What is it?
- You have been given a hint...

2564
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:13,260
throughout the day.

2565
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:14,430
You gave us a hint
throughout the day?

2566
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:15,830
What hint was there?

2567
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,700
- What is it?
- The place where we ate was pink.

2568
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:19,770
Yes.

2569
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:23,170
The table where we cut
the watermelon was pink too.

2570
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,840
- That was pink.
- That was pink.

2571
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:25,870
What was that...

2572
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:27,840
It was green when Woo Il was here.

2573
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:31,280
When Woo Il was swindling us,
it was green.

2574
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,410
- It's a scam.
- Right.

2575
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:35,450
That's right.
He was wearing a green shirt.

2576
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:38,720
I thought it was interesting
because the fridge had pink things.

2577
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,290
- There was pink on our fridge?
- Yes.

2578
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:41,320
It was a bit too much.

2579
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:42,660
- Didn't you know?
- I didn't.

2580
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:44,620
You said it earlier.

2581
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:47,260
"Why are there
so many pink things here?"

2582
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:51,500
(During the second course tour)

2583
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,500
Is there something
related to the colors?

2584
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:57,740
This place is green,
and this place is pink.

2585
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:00,010
Why are there
so many pink things here?

2586
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:01,170
I mean...

2587
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:06,880
(Detective Kim
also noticed the pink color.)

2588
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,780
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook
with sharp intuition...)

2589
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:11,320
(was suspicious about the colors.)

2590
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:12,990
- What is it?
- Please give me just five.

2591
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:14,720
(What colored door will they choose
with their intuition?)

2592
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,520
- Which is good? What would it be?
- Okay.

2593
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,930
Please stand in a line.

2594
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:21,330
I've made up my mind.

2595
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:23,200
- Make a high jump.
- A high jump.

2596
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,030
- Make a clear jump.
- Where do I go?

2597
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:27,900
- This.
- Jump on three.

2598
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:30,340
- I have no idea what this is.
- I'll count.

2599
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:31,810
- This is the last selection.
- Really?

2600
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:32,840
It will decide whether or not
you will get a penalty.

2601
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,110
I'm so nervous.

2602
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:35,410
- We jump after three?
- But what is this about?

2603
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:37,080
I really don't want
to get the penalty.

2604
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:40,110
It's not one, two, three, jump.
It's one, two, jump.

2605
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:41,450
- One, two, jump.
- One, two, jump.

2606
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:42,450
Yes.
(Who would have figured out
the secret behind the colors?)

2607
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:44,780
Ready.

2608
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,350
- I don't know.
- One, two, three!

2609
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:49,920
(Jump)

2610
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:52,060
- Okay.
- That's it?

2611
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:53,160
Two,

2612
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,930
(They have decided.)

2613
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:58,670
- We're the only ones in pink?
- Only three of you chose pink.

2614
01:24:58,670 --> 01:25:01,600
- The rest chose green.
- Why?

2615
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:02,800
What is this?

2616
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,440
- This...
- Do you know what it is?

2617
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,640
Did you decide
because you knew something?

2618
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:08,780
- I don't really know.
- Pink had many good things.

2619
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:10,980
- But...
- Someone wearing pink...

2620
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,110
kept taking the money.

2621
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:13,310
- You never know.
- It's a bet.

2622
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:14,680
You never know
what the result will be.

2623
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:16,020
- In front of the door?
- In front?

2624
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,180
- Stand in front of the door.
- Awesome.

2625
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,620
- We made our last bet.
- Right.

2626
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:22,720
- Good.
- This is amazing.

2627
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,120
It can't be the penalty.

2628
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:26,460
- Do we enter?
- Enter.

2629
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,000
- Do we enter?
- Enter.

2630
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:31,160
- Hello.
- What is it?

2631
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:32,770
- Do we enter?
- Enter.

2632
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,500
- Hello.
- What is it?

2633
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,000
(What's the last course
hidden behind the doors?)

2634
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,040
(Exclaiming)

2635
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:40,710
(A table of souvenirs)

2636
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:41,840
What do they have?

2637
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:44,180
It's true.

2638
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:46,180
(Souvenirs from 8 provinces are
displayed behind the green door.)

2639
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,080
- What is this?
- I love this!

2640
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,080
(The final jackpot
was behind the green door!)

2641
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,390
(Then what's behind the pink door?)

2642
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:53,650
Goodness.

2643
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:55,460
They hit the jackpot.

2644
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:58,890
- Those who chose pink must pay up.
- No way!

2645
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:01,900
- Pardon?
- Those who chose pink...

2646
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:03,300
must pay up.

2647
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:04,700
How many are there?

2648
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,230
- What?
- We have to pay for this?

2649
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:08,940
We have to pay for this?

2650
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:10,870
(An endless list of bills...)

2651
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:15,510
(that is taller than Haha.)

2652
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:18,180
(They have to pay for all that?)

2653
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:20,250
What do they have?

2654
01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:22,180
- We have to pay for this?
- That's right.

2655
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:24,150
- How much...
- How much per person?

2656
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:33,660
(They paid a small entry fee
and had fun eating and playing.)

2657
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:38,130
(They enjoyed a luxury tour
with a guide as well.)

2658
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:41,030
(Everything was added to the bill.)

2659
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:43,900
(Today's tour destination...)

2660
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:46,740
(had Pink and Green Zones.)

2661
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:50,040
(The area where they ate
and had fun...)

2662
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,280
(was the Pink Zone.)

2663
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,680
(The area where they played games
to earn coins...)

2664
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:59,220
(was the Green Zone.)

2665
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:03,690
(Two guides were with them
from the beginning.)

2666
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:06,890
(They wore
pink and green shirts too.)

2667
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,330
Would you like to pay?

2668
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:10,300
Would you like to pay? Okay.

2669
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:12,130
- I'll take the entrance fee.
- I should have come here earlier.

2670
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:13,330
- This was the place?
- I'll take the entrance fee.

2671
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:17,770
(Pink always appeared
whenever they had to pay.)

2672
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,570
- Here are the coins you won.
- Thank you.

2673
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:26,380
(On the contrary, green appeared
whenever they earned R coins.)

2674
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:32,690
(Woo Il gave them a clear hint
by changing in front of them.)

2675
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:35,520
(Right before the announcement)

2676
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,760
- When we received money,
- Green.

2677
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,030
we received them on a green tray.

2678
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:41,160
Really?

2679
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:42,560
The tray was always pink
when we lost money.

2680
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,860
- Right. Pink was for the bets.
- You're really smart.

2681
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:45,870
- That's right.
- I...

2682
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:47,200
(Detective Kim
predicted accurately!)

2683
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,600
(In the Green Zone,
the acquiring area,)

2684
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,970
(they earn souvenirs
even at the end.)

2685
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:55,380
(Meanwhile, the three members
in the Pink Zone, the paying area,)

2686
01:27:55,380 --> 01:28:00,780
(have to pay for everything
they spent in the Pink Zone.)

2687
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:03,180
For Team Pink,

2688
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,320
we have a bill for the amount...

2689
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,220
- you have spent today.
- A bill?

2690
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:10,360
A bill?

2691
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,460
(Team Green is exempt
from paying the travel expenses.)

2692
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:12,630
Really?

2693
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:13,660
(Team Green is exempt
from paying the travel expenses.)

2694
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:15,960
My gosh, Seok Sam.

2695
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,600
(Dejected)

2696
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:22,840
- Hang on.
- Today, Seok Sam is…

2697
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,140
- Room A...
- Are we paying separately...

2698
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:25,470
for Room A and Room B?
Or are we paying all together?

2699
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:26,470
- Yes.
- All together.

2700
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:28,010
- Separately?
- You are paying separately.

2701
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:29,910
(Everything from food to utensils
costs 7 coins each.)

2702
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:30,910
(A total of 427 coins,
107 coins per person)

2703
01:28:30,910 --> 01:28:35,380
(The luxury room costs a whopping
107 coins per person.)

2704
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:36,580
(Meanwhile, it's only 2 coins each
in this room.)

2705
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:37,780
(Woo Il's guide fee, 50 coins)

2706
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:38,890
(A total of 196 coins,
49 coins per person)

2707
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:40,790
(Including Woo Il's guide fee,
it's only 49 coins per person.)

2708
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:43,590
Those who were
in the cost-effective room…

2709
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,490
- It's 107 coins.
- Se Chan should...

2710
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:48,060
- pay 49 coins.
- Oh, dear.

2711
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,200
I have the money.

2712
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,600
(Se Chan still has 28 coins left
after paying 49 coins.)

2713
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:54,170
Seok Jin and Haha,
who used the luxury room,

2714
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:57,340
- should pay 107 coins.
- My gosh. They pay 107 coins.

2715
01:28:57,340 --> 01:28:58,440
They'll go broke.

2716
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,040
- I don't have that many coins.
- I have some.

2717
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:01,970
I don't have 107 coins either.

2718
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:02,980
(I don't have 107 coins either.)

2719
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:05,710
- Then both of you went bankrupt.
- Okay.

2720
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:07,350
- I need to pay 49 coins, right?
- Yes.

2721
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:09,220
It's a bill.

2722
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:11,150
Did you hear that?

2723
01:29:11,150 --> 01:29:12,550
She told them to take you two away.

2724
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:13,590
Did you hear that?

2725
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:15,190
- Take me away?
- She told them to take you away.

2726
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:17,260
What's going on?

2727
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:18,290
(The end of the two players
who enjoyed it without a doubt.)

2728
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:19,390
What is all this?

2729
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:20,460
- This is really...
- What's this?

2730
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,590
This is hilarious.

2731
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:22,960
I mean, things were
going well for me...

2732
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,500
- from beginning to end.
- I got 150 coins.

2733
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,570
I know.

2734
01:29:25,730 --> 01:29:27,200
I have enough coins to pay the bill.

2735
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:29,000
- Would you like to pay?
- Yes.

2736
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:30,270
- Can I give her everything I have?
- Yes.

2737
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:31,340
(Se Chan is done paying.)

2738
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:32,670
Your payment has been completed.

2739
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:33,970
- Us?
- What's worse is...

2740
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:35,680
- Where are they going?
- They are taking us somewhere.

2741
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:36,910
- Where are you going?
- This is crazy.

2742
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:38,610
- Hey.
- What's the penalty?

2743
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:40,250
Seok Sam is getting a penalty
after a long time.

2744
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,380
What’s the penalty?

2745
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:42,850
- A penalty?
- All right. Now,

2746
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:44,320
- you can choose...
- There must be something.

2747
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,990
your prize in order
of the number of coins...

2748
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:50,420
- and buy it.
- I see.

2749
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:54,430
First place goes
to Kim Jong Kook with 111 coins.

2750
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:56,000
- You have a lot.
- You can choose a prize you want...

2751
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,160
and buy it with your coins.

2752
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:58,500
What?

2753
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,530
You are so annoying.

2754
01:29:59,530 --> 01:30:02,140
- I played many games today.
- My gosh.

2755
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:03,870
- The abalone is the best, right?
- This is...

2756
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,270
- I guess this is...
- I want the peaches.

2757
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:06,270
the most expensive one, right?

2758
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:07,770
- Yes.
- You can choose what you want.

2759
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:09,110
- They are abalones from Wando.
- Okay.

2760
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:10,180
- You should take the abalones.
- And...

2761
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:11,440
- You need your protein.
- second place...

2762
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:14,480
goes to Daniel with 92 coins.
You can choose your prize.

2763
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:16,120
- Eight? You have enough coins.
- This is it.

2764
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,280
I’ll have the watermelon.

2765
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:19,050
- Watermelon.
- Okay.

2766
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,850
- Third place goes to Jae Seok.
- Okay.

2767
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,920
- Fourth place goes to Ji Hyo.
- Then...

2768
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:24,920
- I'm the fifth.
- Hang on.

2769
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,160
- What should I choose?
- Beggars.

2770
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:27,930
- Hang on. What should I choose?
- Beggars.

2771
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:29,800
There are beggars.

2772
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:30,930
Beggars.

2773
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:32,500
(The two broke ragtags are here.)

2774
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,630
There are beggars.

2775
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:35,070
(The two broke ragtags are here.)

2776
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:36,240
There are beggars.

2777
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:38,670
Things were going so well for me.

2778
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:40,470
- Seok Jin, seriously...
- At the last minute...

2779
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:42,140
- Unbelievable.
- What? Seriously, what?

2780
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:45,110
All right. I'll take the peaches.

2781
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:46,110
I'll take the dried persimmons.

2782
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:48,080
- I want Korean melons.
- Okay.

2783
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,780
The sixth is Se Chan with 28 coins.

2784
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:52,150
- You can choose one.
- Ssaebssaeb.

2785
01:30:52,150 --> 01:30:53,650
What am I supposed to take?

2786
01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:55,220
I'll take the pine nuts.

2787
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:56,720
- Okay. Pine nuts.
- Pine nuts.

2788
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:59,590
- The pine nuts go to Se Chan.
- This is better.

2789
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:00,760
Now it's time for the penalty.

2790
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,860
You're dressed as beggars now.

2791
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:04,560
Since the weather is warm,

2792
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,000
while eating some
warm emergency crops,

2793
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,370
you will discuss
what you did wrong today...

2794
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:11,270
before going home.

2795
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:12,510
That's the worst.

2796
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:14,240
Under the scorching sun?

2797
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:15,310
(In this heat, dressed like this?)

2798
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:16,740
(A perfect penalty for those
who tried to take life easy)

2799
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:17,740
That's really nice.

2800
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:19,410
- It's the worst.
- It's nice.

2801
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,780
Seok Sam is getting a penalty
after a long time.

2802
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:23,050
I have no choice.

2803
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,220
Give us the food.

2804
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:25,890
- Under the scorching sun.
- It's really nice.

2805
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:26,950
- I like it.
- No shade.

2806
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:28,120
- Thank you for today.
- Thank you for today.

2807
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:29,620
- Thank you for today.
- Bye.

2808
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:32,120
- What we did wrong today?
- Bye.

2809
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:35,290
Think carefully
about what you did wrong.

2810
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:37,430
Gosh, it's really hot.

2811
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:38,600
Seriously...

2812
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:40,770
What did we do wrong?

2813
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:41,930
We didn't do anything wrong.

2814
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:42,940
(Fighting heat with something hot)

2815
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,840
- The thing is...
- Okay.

2816
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:46,640
I could've bet only ten coins,

2817
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,540
but I was being greedy
and I didn't consider losing.

2818
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:50,340
So I bet 30 coins twice.

2819
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:52,550
That's what I did wrong.

2820
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:54,750
I didn't care about anything else,
like colors and stuff.

2821
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:56,850
(He's wrong
about what he did wrong.)

2822
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:58,220
- This is...
- It's just futile.

2823
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,390
Once it is over,
the R coins are useless.

2824
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:01,790
- It's just a piece of plastic.
- Right.

2825
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:03,460
But I go crazy
once the camera is turned on.

2826
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:05,830
I learned life through this episode.

2827
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:07,990
You shouldn't take on
unreasonable challenges...

2828
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:09,200
- or make unreasonable choices...
- Right.

2829
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:10,430
- in life.
- You shouldn't be greedy.

2830
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:12,630
You shouldn't be greedy.

2831
01:32:12,630 --> 01:32:15,470
You shouldn't leave
your life to chance.

2832
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:17,340
It's so hot!

2833

that gives lessons is over!)

2834

It's hot.

2835
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:21,070
It's too hot.

2836

of the Yu family)

2841
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,250
- My feet hurt.
- Honey.

2842
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:35,920
I think you have bigger feet
than I do.

2843

who maintains family discipline)

2846
