1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,210
- My gosh.
- What is this?

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,710
- The 15th anniversary.
- Okay.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,450
This is amazing.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,150
(Running Man has been
running together for 15 summers.)

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,520
It's the 15th anniversary.

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,580
That's right.

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,620
- What is this?
- Gosh, what's all this?

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,590
Hello. What is all this?

9
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,120
The 15th anniversary?

10
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,420
(Yooruce Willis is wearing
a snapback from the early days.)

11
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,690
Salute. Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,030
- Hey, look at Seok Jin.
- Hello.

13
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,030
Hello.

14
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,370
- Okay. It's the 15th anniversary.
- Hello.

15
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,070
(Why are the members
dressed like this?)

16
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,210
- This is amazing.
- Okay.

17
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,540
- Go.
- Does he know that?

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,910
It's beautiful.

19
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,210
A man who stops time!

20
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,280
Run!

21
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,480
After Yooruce Willis of SBS...

22
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,020
Race, start!

23
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,890
(The first episode of Running Man
in 2010)

24
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,260
It's the 15th anniversary.

25
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,360
This is what Seok Jin was wearing
during the opening.

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,930
This is what I still remember.

27
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,900
- You look the same.
- My stylist is still the same.

28
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,330
- Really?
- Yes. It's the same stylist.

29
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,030
So she got me the same outfit.
Even the glasses.

30
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,530
- Right.
- Here's why I remember this.

31
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,170
When I first saw him
during the opening,

32
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,700
I found his outfit really tacky.
He looked terrible.

33
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,010
It looks fine now.

34
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,440
- Jae Seok.
- It's not fine at all.

35
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,180
- I think it's okay. It's not bad.
- That's because he's old.

36
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,710
- This is...
- Seok Jin, you're fashionable now.

37
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,150
- I remember the day.
- And you...

38
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,650
- Running Man. Bang!
- Bang!

39
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,150
(This is 15 years ago.)

40
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,620
- Right.
- I did this.

41
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,620
- Do you remember that?
- I watched it so many times.

42
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,690
Seok Jin actually
looks even younger.

43
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,960
- Right. He's become younger.
- Yes.

44
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,230
What are you wearing?

45
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,030
- I'm wearing...
- He wore this a lot back then.

46
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,200
- During the shoot of Running Man...
- He was dressed like this.

47
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,000
- This is what I used to wear.
- He wore a snapback.

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,700
- The flat brim.
- Right.

49
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,900
- He wore a snapback.
- The flat brim.

50
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,000
You wore that?

51
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,740
These are the sneakers
that were popular back then.

52
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,610
- Really? The shoes?
- Yes.

53
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,840
- You're right.
- This is it.

54
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,810
- These were popular back then.
- That's right.

55
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,580
They were hard to find back then.

56
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,620
- Right.
- Hey. These are special items.

57
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,080
- Yes. They were special items.
- Right.

58
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,150
- They were popular back then.
- Yes.

59
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,720
This isn't the uniform
you were wearing back then.

60
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,690
- This isn't it.
- It's not the digital camo pattern.

61
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,130
But I was discharged from the Army
in this uniform.

62
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,460
- I see.
- Okay.

63
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,730
- I was discharged in this.
- Really?

64
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,100
I joined the military
when Running Man started.

65
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,100
- Really?
- That's when I enlisted.

66
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,040
Se Chan, did you watch Running Man
while serving in the military?

67
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,970
- No.
- You couldn't watch it.

68
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,340
- I couldn't.
- We weren't popular back then.

69
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,010
- Ji Hyo, we weren't that popular.
- We weren't popular.

70
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,050
- I didn't watch it.
- You didn't get to choose.

71
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,580
I couldn't. I didn't get
to choose a channel to watch.

72
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,590
- You couldn't watch anything.
- You look handsome.

73
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,220
- That's right.
- Daniel, is it that you are...

74
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,820
This is from
"High Kick Through The Roof."

75
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,590
- Right. "High Kick."
- Doctor Lee.

76
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,590
- From "High Kick Through The Roof."
- Right. It's the drama.

77
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,160
- That's right.
- Yes.

78
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,930
(The epitom of a dandy man
from back then, Dr. Lee Ji Hoon)

79
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,800
(Even the checkered shirt
and glasses are still the same.)

80
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,840
(Impressed)

81
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,940
- From "High Kick Through The Roof."
- It's "High Kick Through The Roof."

82
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,140
- Yes. "High Kick."
- It's "High Kick."

83
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,350
Did you call Sae Kyeong
in the drama?

84
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,750
- "Sae Kyeong."
- "Sae Kyeong."

85
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,380
- "Sae Kyeong. Jung Eum."
- Yes.

86
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,080
- You look like a decent guy.
- When you're dressed like that...

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,120
Seriously...

88
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,520
- You look like an actor.
- Yes. You look nice.

89
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,820
- Yes.
- What are you, Ye Eun?

90
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,920
- Were you a high school student?
- I was a high school student.

91
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,030
- What grade?
- I don't know.

92
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,130
Think about 15 years ago.

93
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,360
There are a lot of old ladies...

94
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,960
dressed like this
in an amusement park.

95
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,800
- Right.
- Old ladies?

96
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,470
- As a group.
- They get a discount.

97
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,140
- No. I'm...
- You think of your school days.

98
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,410
- Yes.
- She was a high school student...

99
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,640
- about 15 years ago.
- A high school student?

100
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,170
- She's 32.
- By the way,

101
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,040
- Haha is dressed like Jason Mraz.
- I'm...

102
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,950
Yes. I used to wear a fadora
with Gary back then.

103
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,110
- This reminds me of the old days.
- The Panama hat.

104
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,580
- He used to wear that.
- Yes. I remember that.

105
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,580
It reminds me of the old days.

106
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,190
- Do you remember that?
- Yes.

107
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,790
Haha doesn't age.

108
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,720
- That's true.
- He just got a big belly.

109
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,990
Yes. He just got a big belly.

110
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,530
- He just got a big belly.
- Only a big belly.

111
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,960
- I always wore those sneakers.
- Right.

112
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,830
- This is what I wore all the time.
- I see.

113
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,260
- I...
- I'm wearing the team uniform.

114
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,630
Ji Hyo is wearing
the team uniform from back then.

115
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,740
- She is wearing the team uniform.
- Is it the team uniform?

116
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,200
Yes, this is the team uniform.

117
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,940
I was always wearing a snapback
with my hair banged like this.

118
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,470
- I remember the snapback.
- Yes.

119
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,980
It looks all right.
It has been 15 years already.

120
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,580
It's been 15 years.

121
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,580
This isn't just
the longest-running variety show.

122
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,710
There aren't
many variety shows left now.

123
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,480
- That's right.
- We are the living witnesses.

124
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,950
Isn't this a new record?

125
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,190
It's been longer
than "Infinite Challenge," right?

126
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,250
- It's been longer.
- Right.

127
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,950
- Yes. A lot longer.
- Right.

128
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,190
And we haven't had any members
who were fired.

129
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,790
- Right.
- We had members...

130
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,060
- who chose to leave the show,
- Yes.

131
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,330
but there haven't been
any unfortunate incidents.

132
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,960
- No unfortunate incidents.
- That's right.

133
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,430
I had three children
while doing this show.

134
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,430
It's unbelievable.

135
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,340
I'm sorry, but don't mix
your personal affairs with our show.

136
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,910
- I mean... Don't you think so?
- What...

137
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,340
I'm saying it's been a long time.
While doing this show...

138
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,040
- But why...
- We also have a lot to say.

139
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,540
We have a lot to talk about.

140
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,250
You remember that.
While doing Running Man...

141
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,950
- You invited us to your wedding.
- I had the press conference.

142
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,180
- My gosh.
- There were news articles...

143
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,050
What does it
have to do with our show?

144
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,490
They said it was a wedding
of the couple of the century.

145
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,520
The couple of the century?

146
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,890
They said we were like Brangelina.

147
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,890
- What did you say?
- It was really upsetting.

148
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,530
- Brangelina of Korea.
- What did you say?

149
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,630
Brazilian.

150
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,930
- Brazilian?
- Brazilian?

151
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,800
(Brazilian?)

152
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,900
- The Brazilian couple of Korea?
- Brazilian?

153
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,340
Brazilian.

154
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,370
Right.

155
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,600
- Brazilian?
- She's unbelievable.

156
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,910
That's too much.

157
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,440
- She's...
- The Brazilian couple?

158
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,610
She says we are
the Brazilian couple of Korea.

159
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,610
(The more he thinks about it,
the funnier it gets.)

160
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,650
I don't think
she knows what Brangelina is.

161
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,850
The thing is, Brangelina
was from a long time ago.

162
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,520
Right. It was a long time ago. Good.

163
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,150
We have a cake to celebrate
our 15th anniversary.

164
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,950
- Shall we?
- Please blow out the candles.

165
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,820
- Okay.
- My gosh.

166
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,530
It has R coins
and dice on it, right?

167
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,890
- We've done a lot of things.
- Yes. Look at the R money.

168
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,800
We've thrown a lot of dice.

169
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,100
- It's not easy.
- It's amazing it's been 15 years.

170
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,830
- All right.
- The longest-running variety show.

171
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,440
- All right, everyone.
- Happy birthday

172
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Congratulations!

173
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,740
- Yes!
- Congratulations!

174
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,910
It's the 15th anniversary!

175
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,240
(Weak)

176
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,110
Why does it look so weak?

177
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,310
They look quite weak.

178
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,780
(Weak again)

179
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,190
(Here comes the confetti.)

180
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,190
What's wrong with these?

181
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,420
We are celebrating
the 15th anniversary...

182
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,990
- Okay.
- thanks to our viewers...

183
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,260
- and production staff.
- That's right.

184
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,830
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

185
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,060
We are really grateful.

186
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,230
We are having a special event
for our viewers...

187
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,930
on the official website
of Running Man.

188
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,200
It's an event to celebrate
our 15th anniversary.

189
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,400
I hope many of our viewers...

190
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,740
- will participate.
- Okay.

191
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,340
- Yes.
- All right.

192
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,240
It's been 15 years. How nice.

193
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,250
This year marks the 15th anniversary
of Running Man.

194
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,610
- Yes.
- We have guests who are...

195
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,650
celebrating a special year...

196
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,020
- like Running Man.
- Who are they?

197
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,420
They are celebrating a special year?

198
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,950
- Guests from back then?
- Is that it?

199
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,820
Please come on in.

200
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,020
- Who are they?
- Who are you?

201
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,120
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

202
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,360
They're here. It's Eunhyuk.

203
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,430
Eunhyuk.

204
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,000
It's Eunhyuk.

205
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,960
(Leeteuk, Kyu Hyun, and Eunhyuk
of SUPER JUNIOR)

206
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,630
- Kyu Hyun.
- It's their 20th anniversary.

207
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,430
It's been a long time.

208
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,940
(SUPER JUNIOR, more than just idols,
celebrating the 20th anniversary)

209
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,340
(SUPER JUNIOR with a lot of hits
returns on their 20th anniversary.)

210
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,540
(Leeteuk, Eunhyuk, and Kyu Hyun
of SUPER JUNIOR in its 20th year)

211
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,240
- Leeteuk.
- Kyu Hyun.

212
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,550
- Hello.
- You're back again.

213
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,210
- Welcome.
- It's okay to come back, right?

214
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,420
- Sure.
- Hey.

215
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,780
You're here often.

216
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,620
Hello.

217
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,790
- Hello.
- It's been a while, Leeteuk.

218
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,890
Gosh, Seok Jin.

219
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,960
- Hello.
- Okay.

220
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,220
(It feels like a real party
with the variety show veterans.)

221
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,130
- So...
- It's so nice to meet you.

222
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,460
Se Chan.

223
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,960
- You are wearing skinny jeans.
- It's been a long time.

224
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,130
- Hey.
- My gosh.

225
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,730
- Your pants are hilarious.
- Kyu Hyun.

226
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,800
- Leeteuk.
- Where should we stand?

227
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,970
- Stand here.
- SUPER JUNIOR.

228
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,140
We are SUPER JUNIOR.

229
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,040
- We are SUPER JUNIOR.
- We are SUPER JUNIOR.

230
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,380
(This is how
they introduced themselves.)

231
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,910
What do we do with Kyu Hyun's pants?

232
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,910
I'm wearing skinny jeans again
after a long time.

233
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,380
- His pants...
- Right.

234
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,380
Are you wearing the jeans
from back then?

235
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,520
This is the style from back then.

236
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,720
Your thighs look great.

237
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,250
- Really?
- They are not stretchy.

238
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,720
They're supposed to be tight.

239
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,220
Was this in fashion back then?

240
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,690
- Yes. We had things like this.
- It was in fashion.

241
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,090
- The chain?
- The chain was in fashion.

242
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,930
- We had necklaces like that.
- Yes.

243
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,630
We have many accessories
like a muffler.

244
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,730
- That's right.
- We had to wear...

245
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,970
- a vest like this back then.
- You're right.

246
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,600
- We had to wear a vest.
- Right.

247
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,140
- It looked too simple without it.
- Right. You had to wear it.

248
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,840
The vest was really popular.

249
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,540
Right. I wore it a lot.

250
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,380
Is Seok Jin wearing a vest
underneath his jacket?

251
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,750
That's right.

252
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,350
Seok Jin, take off your jacket.

253
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,020
- Why?
- It looks the same.

254
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,350
SUPER GRANDPA.

255
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,420
Sir.

256
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,820
I'm SUPER GRANDPA!

257
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
- Sir.
- What?

258
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,230
I'd like a tenderloin steak, please.

259
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,630
Okay. Medium-rare?

260
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,800
- And a pumpkin soup.
- Okay.

261
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
(He receives orders with dignity.)

262
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,700
So is SUPER JUNIOR...

263
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,900
celebrating their 20th anniversary?

264
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,540
- Yes.
- Really?

265
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,540
We've survived.

266
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,710
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

267
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,740
You guys are amazing.

268
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,250
So they are coming back
with their new full-length album,

269
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,080
- "SUPER JUNIOR25."
- That's right.

270
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,650
The lead track is "Express Mode."

271
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,180
- Yes.
- "Express Mode."

272
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,350
What mode is that?

273
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,350
What mode?

274
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,460
- It's a fast mode.
- A fast mode?

275
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,590
- Yes.
- Like an expressway.

276
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,190
Yes. It goes non-stop.

277
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,630
- Okay. We should watch it then.
- Really?

278
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,030
- All right.
- We should watch "Express Mode."

279
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,070
SUPER JUNIOR is known
for their tough dance moves.

280
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,630
- This one is quite tough.
- It is?

281
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,000
- Is it tough?
- It is.

282
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,870
- Let's take a look.
- Is the dancing that hard?

283
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,740
They've been performing
for a long time now.

284
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,910
Let's do this.

285
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,110
("Express Mode" by SUPER JUNIOR)

286
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,680
(Their joints are still well-oiled.)

287
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,450
(The one, two step
is the heart of this dance.)

288
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,560
(The army recruit
is beginning to party.)

289
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,300
(Past the hook...)

290
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,260
(and into the dance break)

291
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,830
(Popping)

292
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,970
(Sliding)

293
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,370
He couldn't match the energy.

294
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,540
(Laughing)

295
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,710
(Though he looks determined
and serious,)

296
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,810
(his steps are actually quite cute.)

297
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,950
Looking good!

298
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,520
(The main dancer and leader
stay steady even in express mode.)

299
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,750
(However, the balladeer
looks flushed.)

300
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,790
(Getting ready to tease him)

301
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,260
(The performance is reaching
its peak.)

302
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,430
(SUPER JUNIOR is back.)

303
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,740
- They still have it.
- They still have it.

304
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,640
- They haven't lost their touch.
- That was so cool.

305
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,870
Were we good?

306
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,210
- You still have it.
- Guys!

307
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,080
- Good job.
- That was amazing.

308
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,440
- Do we still have it?
- That was great.

309
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,080
- You did it, Kyu Hyun.
- Nicely done.

310
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,610
- You did it.
- That was incredible.

311
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,050
- You were doing a lot.
- It was so cool.

312
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,680
There was a lot going on.

313
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,880
I got goosebumps
when Eunhyuk stepped forward.

314
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,420
He stepped forward with intensity.

315
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,620
- One step, two step.
- Like this.

316
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
Meanwhile,

317
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,830
you seem out of breath.

318
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,490
- I'm exhausted.
- You seem out of breath.

319
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,760
He was smiling through that.

320
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,030
- It's too early for this.
- Kyu Hyun.

321
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,330
- You've got a little belly.
- My belly?

322
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,070
- It's too much for a balladeer.
- Exactly.

323
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,100
The moves are too dynamic for him.

324
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,000
- It's been a while since he danced.
- It's been too long.

325
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,270
Even the soldier loved
the performance.

326
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,440
Of course. Us soldiers...

327
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,840
(Bring it!)

328
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,010
(The army recruit pulls off
some adorable moves.)

329
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,280
There you go.

330
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,480
- The soldier's loving it.
- Nice.

331
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,080
- Individual combat!
- Combat!

332
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,250
(That talent of his would have
earned him some time off.)

333
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,050
- I'm in love with the song.
- Nice.

334
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,150
Running Man celebrates 15 years,

335
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,460
- and SUPER JUNIOR hits its 20th.
- Right.

336
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,760
The members of Running Man
are dressed in the style...

337
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,160
that was trendy in 2010,
the year it first aired.

338
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,890
Meanwhile,
SUPER JUNIOR is dressed...

339
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,930
in the fashion
of their debut year, 2005.

340
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,660
Go ahead...

341
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,600
and rank each other based on...

342
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,800
who recreated the look best.

343
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,070
- You'll line up from 1st to 11th.
- Really?

344
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,440
- Who best recreated the look?
- Seok Jin is the clear winner.

345
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,570
As for me, I'm dressed...

346
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,440
in the exact same outfit
for the opening.

347
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,480
- Seok Jin's clearly the winner.
- He wins.

348
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,810
- Seok Jin...
- Isn't this exactly...

349
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,080
- how I looked back then?
- He's in first place.

350
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,350
You did.

351
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,620
He's wearing the same outfit.
That puts him in first place.

352
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,820
- Well...
- Hold on.

353
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,190
- There are no complaints, right?
- No.

354
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,590
Jae Seok, what about Se Chan?

355
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,020
- It's hard to rank his look.
- How can you rank my look?

356
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,020
- His look is hard to rank.
- I know, this is...

357
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,360
- He's in military uniform.
- You're at the bottom.

358
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,860
- It's just a military uniform.
- Exactly.

359
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,390
- You're at the bottom.
- Exactly.

360
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,530
- You...
- Go over there.

361
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,960
I'm not playing dress-up.
I actually served back then.

362
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,770
- I was in high school.
- She was in high school.

363
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,170
- We can't let uniforms rank high.
- But...

364
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,200
- uniforms can't count.
- What about Ye Eun?

365
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,100
You should've at least tried...

366
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,640
- to make them look more authentic.
- Exactly.

367
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,540
You should stand here.

368
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,940
What? Hold on.

369
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,140
Yours feels less authentic.

370
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,380
- You're one to talk.
- You should've shaved your head.

371
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,950
How could I possibly shave my head?

372
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,350
- Daniel did a decent job.
- How did I do?

373
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,480
- He looks good.
- Daniel looks good.

374
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,690
- He's decent.
- Am I among the top?

375
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,350
Daniel looks just like he did
in the series.

376
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,760
I feel like I'm seeing a ghost.

377
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,520
- He looks the same.
- He looks like his character.

378
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,590
- He should stay over here.
- He should.

379
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,290
- I feel like I belong here too.
- Yes, you did good.

380
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,760
- Ji Hyo, wait.
- Because...

381
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,060
- Ji Hyo.
- I'm wearing the team uniform.

382
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,860
This may be the team uniform, but...

383
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,100
- It's too small on her.
- It's too small.

384
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,830
- The vibe isn't the same.
- Go over there.

385
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,000
- The uniform's too tight on you.
- It's not the same.

386
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,540
It's true I gained
some weight, but...

387
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,570
- It's too tight on you.
- Daniel looks good.

388
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,210
(The members of SUPER JUNIOR
slowly make their way forward.)

389
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,080
(Slowly approaching)

390
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,610
(The two quietly move up
into the top ranks.)

391
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,750
- Hold on.
- Daniel looks good.

392
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,220
- Jong Kook didn't do a good job.
- Jong Kook, move down.

393
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,920
- I agree.
- Go on.

394
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,550
- Haha did a good job.
- Haha looks good.

395
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,690
- How is this a good job?
- Don't I look good?

396
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,160
- How so?
- This is how I dressed back then.

397
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,260
- This is exactly how I dressed.
- Get over here.

398
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,230
- He's not in the top three, though.
- Haha...

399
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,490
- Not you.
- Exactly.

400
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,900
Let's have SUPER JUNIOR
in the top ranks.

401
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,730
- You stand over here.
- I'll be right below SUPER JUNIOR.

402
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,760
- They...
- This is a good choice.

403
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,030
They remind us of the old times.

404
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,200
Come to think of it,

405
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,670
I think SUPER JUNIOR did
a better job recreating their looks.

406
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,940
- We made the effort.
- We...

407
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,940
- Look it up.
- That's right.

408
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,970
- This is what we wore in 2005.
- They look the same.

409
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,480
- Actually...
- This is what I actually wore.

410
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,180
Honestly, Kyu Hyun's look
misses the mark a bit...

411
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,910
because of his thicker waist.

412
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,250
But his look is the best.

413
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,450
- He was brave.
- Let me see.

414
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,150
Seok Jin should come down
a few spots.

415
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,550
Seok Jin, step down one rank.

416
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,550
- That sounds better.
- Seok Jin, you should.

417
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,890
Step down a few ranks.

418
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,390
This is how I looked back then.

419
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,390
(Look! This was the vibe back then!)

420
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,360
(Revealing the photo from 2005)

421
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,430
- You're right.
- His hairstyle.

422
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,900
- Hold on.
- Your hair is different.

423
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,130
- His hair.
- Hey.

424
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,700
- Too bad.
- His hair.

425
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,070
You have
a completely different hairstyle.

426
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,600
- But...
- Step down.

427
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,700
- Step down.
- Hold on.

428
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,740
- You don't belong up there.
- Wait.

429
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,770
You didn't do as well as I did.

430
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,940
- It's not the same vibe.
- You didn't do as well as I did.

431
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,970
You lose points because of the hair.

432
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,480
I'm sure he's wearing shoe lifts.

433
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,240
Leeteuk, hold on.

434
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,280
- Should I show you?
- Leeteuk.

435
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,580
- Haha said something.
- Yes?

436
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,650
- He says you've gotten too tall.
- Me?

437
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,250
He thinks you're wearing shoe lifts.

438
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,350
- Let me take a look.
- Shoe lifts?

439
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,660
If you prove that you're
actually wearing shoe lifts,

440
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,760
- we'll approve.
- Exactly.

441
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,420
- He wore them back then too.
- Right.

442
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,530
Are you asking
if I have them in my shoes?

443
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,860
- Yes.
- Today.

444
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,990
I think you're wearing them.

445
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,560
These shoes have high platforms.

446
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,770
- Aren't they too high?
- Not really.

447
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,070
Let's see.

448
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,430
You wear lifts with those shoes?

449
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,570
- Aren't they too high?
- Not really.

450
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,100
- I left my phone in here.
- Even now?

451
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,210
Hello?

452
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,940
(Hello?)

453
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,080
- It's not that high.
- What was that?

454
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,480
Mom, I'll call you later.

455
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,650
- Go up the ranks.
- He's good.

456
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,080
- Go up the ranks.
- Check this out.

457
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,480
Even the joke is dated.

458
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,520
- That's it.
- You can stay there.

459
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,990
- Stay there.
- Yes, stay there.

460
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,250
- You can stay there.
- Exactly.

461
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,750
- There's a huge difference.
- Just by that much.

462
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,390
- Check it out.
- There's a huge difference.

463
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,160
Hold on. Here's a photo of Eunhyuk,

464
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,560
- and he looks different.
- No, I look the same.

465
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,290
- Check out this scarf.
- He looks different.

466
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,500
That much is allowed.

467
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,130
I don't like the hair, though.

468
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,800
- He didn't make the effort.
- The hair is too trendy.

469
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,930
Yes, the hair.

470
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,170
- My hair?
- Seriously.

471
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,200
He's way more handsome.

472
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,840
You failed to recreate
the hairstyle.

473
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,510
- The hair's too trendy.
- Seok Sam's in third place.

474
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,140
- Exactly. Seok Sam's in 3rd.
- Let Seok Sam be in 3rd.

475
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,310
How can you recreate the hairstyle?

476
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,040
Seok Jin, is that a wig?

477
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,650
- No, this is my hair.
- Did you style it?

478
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,380
- This is my real hair.
- Really?

479
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,120
- Seok Jin...
- I've been getting that...

480
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,090
- a lot these days.
- How was this even possible?

481
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,750
- How was this even possible?
- What about it?

482
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,290
- I grew it out.
- Was it your stylist?

483
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,320
- No, this is just how it is.
- Seok Jin styled it.

484
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,630
You should get to a salon.

485
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,660
I think I look better.

486
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,360
I definitely look better.

487
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,200
I made the effort.

488
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,260
I made the effort too.

489
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,670
I even have a name tag.

490
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,800
No way.

491
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,900
Come talk to me
after you remove your veneers.

492
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,070
You should remove your braces then.

493
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,400
I had them back then.

494
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,310
Ye Eun's in last place.

495
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,940
You ranked yourselves
from 1st to 11th.

496
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,980
In the order you ranked yourselves,

497
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,680
you will receive R coins
as your seed money today.

498
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,750
- Really?
- First place gets thirty coins.

499
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,850
(Daniel gets 30 coins
being in 1st place.)

500
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,520
Second place
gets twenty-seven coins.

501
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,620
Seriously?

502
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,360
Those in 3rd to 5th place
will each receive 25 coins.

503
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,060
- That's not bad.
- That's a lot.

504
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,360
Those in 6th to 10th place
will receive 20 coins.

505
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,430
And the one in 11th place
will get 15 coins.

506
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,570
Okay.

507
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,630
(Ji Ye Eun, in last place,
gets 15 coins.)

508
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,940
This is your seed money for today,

509
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,340
- so keep the coins safe.
- Ye Eun, that's too bad.

510
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,910
- No stealing is allowed.
- Sure.

511
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,440
- No stealing today.
- No stealing.

512
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,640
- You can let your guard down.
- No stealing today.

513
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,280
- Who's in second place?
- That's me.

514
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,310
- First place?
- That's me.

515
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,480
This isn't much.

516
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,680
It's not a lot.

517
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,150
Today,

518
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,780
you'll be competing for gold,

519
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,490
Running Man's greatest prize.

520
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,520
The price of gold has skyrocketed.

521
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,090
- Gold prices have soared.
- No way.

522
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,590
- Gold?
- This is insane.

523
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,590
This is You Could Win Gold Today.

524
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,030
In today's race,
you'll collect R coins.

525
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,530
The more you have,

526
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,400
the better your chance
of winning the gold.

527
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,670
The fewer you have,

528
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,640
the higher your chance of a penalty.

529
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,370
You'll now play the first game.

530
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,670
There's no way
I'll win the gold today.

531
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,910
Would I be able
to win the gold today?

532
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,280
- Kyu Hyun. Have you been well?
- Yes?

533
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,310
Of course, Ji Hyo.

534
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,580
The pants look uncomfortable.

535
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,180
I had a hard time
fitting into these.

536
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,380
(His legs feel trapped.)

537
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,420
- These are snug.
- These are skinny pants for sure.

538
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,850
You all look the same,
especially Leeteuk.

539
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,320
- Especially Leeteuk...
- They haven't aged.

540
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,460
and Eunhyuk.

541
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,460
- Exactly.
- They maintained their look well.

542
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,530
It must be because I don't drink.

543
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,400
People describe them as anchovies.

544
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,860
Anchovies. That's right.

545
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,830
- Do you mean us three?
- Gosh, no.

546
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,570
The three of them
look like brothers.

547
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,200
- The three anchovies.
- Anchovies?

548
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,270
Us anchovies.

549
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,300
Anchovy 1, 2, and 3.

550
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,270
We start off
with the bamboo anchovy.

551
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,670
- Wait.
- The three anchovies.

552
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,440
- Bamboo anchovies.
- You three look like brothers.

553
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,380
There's a drop in commercial value,

554
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,980
- but we're still bamboo anchovies.
- You're right.

555
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,850
Kyu Hyun isn't one of them.

556
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,950
- He's not skinny.
- I'm not.

557
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,650
- He's more of a sardine.
- A sardine.

558
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,420
- I have a bit of meat on me.
- Right.

559
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,890
I see he's gained some weight.

560
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,620
Kyu Hyun's been working out
a lot lately.

561
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,860
To keep a team strong
for a long time,

562
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,360
loyalty is necessary.

563
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,730
- Of course.
- Here's a game for you...

564
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,100
since loyalty is your middle name.

565
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,700
I'm Not Sorry Sorry Loyalty Boss.

566
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,970
(Mission 1:
I'm Not Sorry Sorry Loyalty Boss)

567
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,900
You'll split into two teams...

568
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,040
and challenge each other
to a spicy food eating contest.

569
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,710
- Oh, no.
- Spicy food, of all things?

570
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,180
Some of us here
can't handle spicy food.

571
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,440
- I can't eat spicy food.
- Jong Kook in particular.

572
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,750
- Unbelievable.
- I can't eat spicy food either.

573
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,710
- And on empty stomachs?
- Are you good with this?

574
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,720
(Of course)

575
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,380
I love it.

576
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,390
Do we all have to eat the food?

577
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,220
The first player
starts with spicy level one.

578
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,060
They will continue to eat
until they can't.

579
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,860
You must finish all the food
on your plate...

580
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,000
before moving on
to the next spice level.

581
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,960
The team that reaches
the higher level wins.

582
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,230
If there's a tie,

583
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,000
the team that took less time wins.

584
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,210
In short, to win,
you must eat more and faster.

585
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,240
The number of R coins you get...

586
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,080
depends on whether you win or lose.

587
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,710
If you remember what I said,

588
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,110
the game will test your loyalty.

589
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,420
Each team will only get
one bottle of water.

590
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,650
- Each team?
- Just one bottle?

591
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,950
- Water?
- Is it a liter of water?

592
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,220
- No, it's 500ml.
- A bottle of 500ml?

593
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,820
- That's not a lot.
- No way.

594
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,630
You will split into 2 teams
of 5 to 6 members each.

595
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,130
Since the five-man team
is at a disadvantage,

596
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,060
- you will be given a soft drink.
- That's nice.

597
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,500
First of all, split into two teams.

598
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,930
One with 5 members,
and one with 6 members.

599
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,240
- Ye Eun can handle spice.
- I'm terrible with spice.

600
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,000
- Ji Hyo, what about you?
- Me?

601
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,640
- I'm not on expert level.
- Ji Hyo's fine.

602
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,710
- She's above average.
- She can handle spice just fine.

603
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,940
I think she's above average.

604
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,240
Ye Eun and Ji Hyo...

605
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,510
- should be on different teams.
- Exactly.

606
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,880
- Can Ji Hyo handle it better?
- Sure.

607
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,550
Ji Hyo can join the other team.

608
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,880
These two are spice lovers.

609
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,650
- I love spicy food.
- Really? That's good.

610
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,420
I'm great with spice.

611
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,590
- Can you handle spicy food?
- Yes.

612
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,620
- Nice.
- Then...

613
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,860
Leeteuk, what about you?

614
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,260
- I like spicy food.
- That's not ideal.

615
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,530
I'm Mr. Spice.

616
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,290
Eunhyuk can handle spice,
so they should be on different teams.

617
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,200
- Leeteuk, go over there.
- Should I?

618
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Ji Hyo, you can join us.

619
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,400
- I love spicy food.
- Then...

620
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,770
You can't handle spicy food.

621
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,570
- I can't.
- I'm sure Leeteuk will carry us.

622
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,170
- Leeteuk is good.
- He can eat spicy food.

623
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,370
When you've been in this industry
for a long time,

624
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,670
you risk it all for the show.

625
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,110
- Exactly.
- Isn't that the right attitude?

626
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,110
- You're amazing.
- It is.

627
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,710
That's how I lasted for 20 years.

628
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,040
Leeteuk's been giving his all.

629
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,750
(This is why he's insisting on
risking it all for the show.)

630
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,320
(During "Star King" days,)

631
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,280
(Leeteuk learned to risk it all.)

632
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,920
We'll eat until we die.

633
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,220
People who've been around
in this business for a long time...

634
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,390
- Right. We'll eat until we die.
- have the strength to endure all.

635
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,190
We prepared the medication...

636
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,990
to protect the stomach just in case.
Does anyone want to take it now?

637
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,130
- I want to take it now.
- I want one.

638
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,730
- I want one.
- I will take one.

639
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,930
Is it that bad?

640
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,830
- Is it that spicy?
- Gosh.

641
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,540
You have to protect
your stomach wall.

642
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,770
(I get hiccups!)

643
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,770
(Spice wimps
freaked out every time.)

644
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,910
We have to take it.

645
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,480
- We...
- We have to take it, just in case.

646
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,280
SUPER JUNIOR once went on
this SBS show...

647
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,950
"Explorers of the Human Body."

648
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,620
Back then, we even ate things
like ghost peppers...

649
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,650
- We ate everything.
- and all that!

650
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,620
- We had to endure it.
- We had to.

651
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,060
So it was like that back then.

652
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,260
- Time to return to your roots.
- Goodness.

653
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,360
It tastes like toothpaste.

654
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,500
As long as you pretend
to be okay, you're fine.

655
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,530
Right.

656
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,930
Are you not taking one?

657
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,830
- No, we're fine.
- We will live.

658
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,200
Jae Seok, you'll get rushed
to a hospital.

659
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,140
You're not going to
eat the spicy food, are you?

660
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,180
- We can handle spicy.
- Maybe they won't eat it.

661
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,350
It can't be that bad.

662
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,080
- We little anchovies are fighters.
- Yes.

663
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,080
- It's like dipping in gochujang.
- Right.

664
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,180
- We just do it.
- They're amazing.

665
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,290
The team of five will go first.

666
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,620
Please decide the order.

667
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,260
- In this order.
- We will go in this order.

668
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,330
Let's do this.

669
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,060
What's that?

670
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,260
- I think we won't last.
- Se Chan...

671
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,500
(Here come the Red Devils,
one after another.)

672
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,830
That pork cutlet is inedible.

673
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,540
- This will kill you.
- There's Level 11?

674
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,340
Level Eight and above
are impossible.

675
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,970
- How can we possibly eat them?
- This is... Gosh.

676
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,870
- Spicy jjamppong is really spicy.
- It's really spicy.

677
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,310
It smells so spicy.

678
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,680
The smell is so strong.

679
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,880
(How far can they go
on loyalty alone?)

680
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,350
- It's going to be so spicy.
- I know.

681
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,520
- This is easy.
- That's bearable.

682
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,650
I can go this far.

683
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,490
(Starting light...)

684
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,220
(with Levels 1 and 2)

685
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,390
- This will knock you out.
- Is it Silbi Kimchi?

686
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,690
(Level 3 is the kimchi
known for its spicy flavor.)

687
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,090
- I can't eat it.
- What if I can't eat it?

688
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,590
- Have you tried it?
- This will knock you out.

689
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,860
And when you get to Level Four...

690
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,200
I think you will immediately
get rushed into a hospital.

691
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,930
- Level Six is the spicy tteokbokki.
- You can't eat that.

692
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,170
(The spice wimps fuss over Level 4.)

693
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,470
- It's the spicy tteokbokki.
- It looks so spicy.

694
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,700
- Gosh, it's no joke.
- It smells so pungent.

695
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,870
(When you get past
the crazy spicy tteokbokki...)

696
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,710
They are super red.

697
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,710
Look at that.

698
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,910
There's Level 11?

699
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,750
Starting Level Eight, it's no joke.

700
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,750
(Mid-to-high level difficulty ones
are wrapped in a red blanket!)

701
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,750
Is that the one?

702
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,120
I can only get that far.

703
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,490
I've never tried it.

704
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,350
It looks ridiculously spicy.

705
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,620
It smells super spicy.

706
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,120
I don't think
I will be able to eat it.

707
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,890
These must be
spicy beyond imagination.

708
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,130
- Right.
- Yes.

709
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,530
It smells super spicy.

710
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,930
(It will be served hot
so they can enjoy it more.)

711
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,530
- It's spicy.
- That's really hard to find.

712
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,300
The team of six should sit down.

713
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,000
The one from the team of five
who will start with Level One...

714
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,410
should stand.

715
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,470
- Level One?
- The team of five...

716
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,510
has one less member.

717
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,440
So they get two glasses of drink.

718
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
- Go.
- Let's go.

719
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,980
- Ready.
- Should I start?

720
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,950
Start.

721
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,620
(Jong Kook, who is not immune
to spicy food, goes first.)

722
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,650
(Yum)

723
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,050
Level One isn't exactly hot.
It's got a hint of spiciness.

724
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,760
- That has to be fine.
- How is it, Jong Kook?

725
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,260
- It must have a hint of spiciness.
- It must taste ordinary.

726
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,560
- Ordinary.
- Like an ordinary sauce.

727
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,590
- Like an ordinary sauce.
- His stomach will get upset.

728
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,700
- It must be slightly spicy.
- It must be somewhat spicy.

729
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,200
- It must be good.
- No.

730
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,600
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- No.

731
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,770
- What? It's okay.
- Is it okay?

732
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,870
- Is it bearable?
- It is.

733
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,470
- He has to finish it, right?
- Does he have to eat all of it?

734
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,700
Do I have to finish it?

735
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,870
You have to finish it.

736
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,210
- I have to finish it?
- Everything on the plate?

737
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,370
- Right.
- Gosh.

738
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,980
So you have to eat all of it.

739
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,280
You have to finish Level One
and move on quickly.

740
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,950
- Lucky me. They're both chicken.
- Right.

741
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,280
You have to move on quickly.

742
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,980
You are really chewing every bite.

743
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,780
- I am.
- Is it good?

744
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,650
How does it taste? Is it good?

745
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,920
- It's not bad.
- It's not bad?

746
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,960
It must taste like
an ordinary sauce.

747
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,020
He's moving onto Level Two.

748
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,620
That's going to be a tiny bit spicy.

749
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,690
It's going to get a little spicier.

750
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,730
(Level 2 is about
as spicy as Shin Ramyun.)

751
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,530
(Smelling)

752
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,830
I can feel the heat.

753
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,870
It's already too spicy for him.

754
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,900
(Did he pass Level 2 easily?)

755
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,330
- It looks spicy.
- It must be a little spicy.

756
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,870
- It's spicy.
- It hit him.

757
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,940
(The big baby's
already feeling the heat.)

758
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,240
- There he goes.
- It's spicy.

759
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,810
- It's too spicy.
- There he goes.

760
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,840
He's cute.

761
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
- It hit me.
- Give him some water.

762
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,880
- It hit him.
- Why are we doing this?

763
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,320
- What?
- Have some water.

764
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,480
Have some water.

765
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,220
It hit so suddenly.

766
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,590
- Hurry up.
- Have some water.

767
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,650
You won't drink it?

768
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,920
You care for your team.

769
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,890
- He cares for his team.
- Pass it, if you can't eat it.

770
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,690
- Hurry.
- It must be bearable.

771
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,390
Who's next? Go.

772
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,100
- Go.
- Go.

773
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,560
I think I'm getting the hiccups.

774
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,400
- I'm getting the hiccups.
- He's getting the hiccups.

775
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,600
He's getting the hiccups again.

776
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,240
- Gosh. It's kimchi.
- It's Silbi Kimchi.

777
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,770
Isn't it hard to eat that much?

778
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,470
That looks really good though.

779
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,740
(Level 3. Spicy kimchi)

780
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,110
Look at him.

781
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,210
- That must be so spicy.
- Gosh.

782
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,250
Go, Haha!

783
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,280
(Short Kid musters up
his courage and eats the kimchi.)

784
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,750
(Pausing)

785
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,920
Is it spicy?

786
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,590
- I'm okay.
- That kimchi is good.

787
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,860
(The bravery disappears
in just 3 seconds.)

788
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,060
- Goodness.
- How is it?

789
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,490
- Just shove it in.
- Shove it inside your mouth.

790
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,760
- You have to shove it in.
- Just shove it all into your mouth.

791
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,100
- Just shove it in.
- Here's some water.

792
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,800
- Don't touch our water bottle.
- Here's some water.

793
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,930
I thought he could use some.

794
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,500
- Have some juice.
- Wait.

795
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,900
Leave it.

796
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,070
(He's constantly tempted
to drink water.)

797
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,210
- What...
- Just shove it in.

798
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,710
(Really Short Kid
shoves the kimchi into his mouth.)

799
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,410
- Good job, Haha.
- The sauce.

800
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,440
- Nice one.
- There's a lot of sauce.

801
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,080
- Is he eating it?
- Haha.

802
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,380
- Put it in your mouth.
- Just eat the dumpling.

803
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,450
- The dumpling.
- Great.

804
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,320
(He shoved the fire dumpling
straight into his mouth.)

805
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,190
You're amazing, Haha.

806
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,060
- Haha eats spicy food well.
- He's good.

807
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,390
He's good.

808
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,520
Just eat it.

809
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,290
(He finishes
Level 4, fire dumplings.)

810
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,460
(Short Kid fought well.)

811
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,230
He can handle spicy food.

812
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,360
- Right.
- One more?

813
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,770
- Come on.
- You're good, Haha.

814
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,370
(Ji Hyo goes for Level 5.)

815
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,700
- Is it burning?
- It's burning.

816
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,840
- It burns all of a sudden.
- Ji Hyo!

817
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,510
- New Food Fighter.
- New Food Fighter.

818
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,480
- How is it?
- New Food Fighter.

819
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,910
- She's amazing.
- Hypnotize yourself.

820
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,210
(Gosh!)

821
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,110
- Is it spicy?
- Is it spicy?

822
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,380
Stop!

823
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,720
(New Food Fighter overcomes crisis
and picks up speed.)

824
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,090
(Level 6 spicy tteokbokki)

825
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,990
- Nice.
- Great.

826
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,630
Nice.

827
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,290
It's almost black.
That tteokbokki is almost black.

828
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,360
- Go.
- Really?

829
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,430
- Ji Hyo, were you hungry?
- Look at Ji Hyo.

830
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,000
Can I have the medication?

831
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,240
(You want one too?)

832
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,580
I should take one.

833
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,910
Having seen them,

834
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,150
I think we should take precautions.

835
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,620
- Oh, dear.
- Jae Seok's scared.

836
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,320
- He said he didn't need one.
- We shouldn't act tough.

837
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,850
It must be really spicy.

838
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,020
(While the next member gets ready)

839
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,590
Ji Hyo must've been hungry.

840
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,060
Ji Hyo is good.

841
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,690
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- Give it up for her.

842
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,300
- My ears are hot.
- Are you okay?

843
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,060
I can't eat anymore.

844
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,670
- No.
- All right.

845
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,830
I will eat now.

846
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,900
(Right at Level 8,
Mr. Anchovy makes his appearance.)

847
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,640
Just shove it into your mouth,
Jae Seok.

848
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,970
Let's watch him.

849
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:40,140
(Jae Seok was boastful.
Will he be able to handle Level 8?)

850
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,950
(He eats the whole thing.)

851
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,080
I think the curry would be fine.

852
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,480
Wait. This is...

853
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,590
- Gosh.
- This is super spicy.

854
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,850
- I don't think he can handle it.
- No?

855
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,150
(What?)

856
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,360
I don't think he can handle it.

857
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,930
Are you okay?

858
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,660
- Keep moving. That's right.
- Gosh.

859
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,130
- This is...
- You will feel better then.

860
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,800
Drink it.

861
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,970
That's it. Drink it.

862
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,500
- Is it really that spicy?
- Gosh, this is...

863
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,900
(Shivering, he enters Level 9.)

864
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,070
What's that? It's Hamburg steak.

865
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,440
(Just looking at it
makes your mouth water.)

866
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,940
Let's do this.

867
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,340
- Move.
- Let's do this.

868
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,350
- Keep moving.
- He's broke.

869
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,980
Let's do this.

870
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,850
His body is malfunctioning.

871
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,720
It looks like he's clubbing.

872
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,820
- He's clubbing.
- He's clubbing.

873
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,820
- It smells spicy.
- He handles spicy food well.

874
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,730
(If you're high on
spicy food, scream!)

875
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,960
You got this. Just a little more.

876
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,270
- He eats spicy food well.
- He eats spicy food really well.

877
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,670
- He enjoys it too.
- Stop here.

878
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,240
- Gosh.
- You should walk around.

879
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,110
- I'm scared.
- What's this?

880
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,640
Only the ones in the back are left.

881
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,340
- Next is the pork cutlet.
- Are you eating it?

882
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,480
You have to eat the pork cutlet.

883
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,380
I can't eat that.

884
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,980
That will kill you.

885
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,010
What's this?

886
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,620
(Level 10, bomb pork cutlet)

887
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,020
Jae Seok is good.

888
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,450
It's okay if you stop.

889
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,950
- Good job.
- Go, Jae Seok.

890
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,560
You have to eat it.

891
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,730
Don't stop, Jae Seok.

892
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,200
- Just eat the whole thing.
- Eat the whole thing, Jae Seok.

893
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,960
Eat the whole thing.

894
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,730
He's not in his right mind.

895
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,170
- Are you done?
- Mr. Anchovy is good.

896
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,570
- It hit him.
- Stop.

897
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,300
Mr. Anchovy ate so well.

898
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,610
What will he do?

899
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,410
- Gosh. Are you done?
- Gosh.

900
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,640
(Red eyes)

901
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,250
I think his eyes turned red.

902
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,580
- He's crying.
- It's really spicy.

903
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,620
- He's crying.
- Are you okay?

904
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,920
You have to start right away.
We're running out of time.

905
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,950
- Go.
- Should I go now?

906
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,150
Let's watch Eunhyuk.

907
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,960
- Gosh.
- What's that?

908
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,290
He handles spicy food
better than I do.

909
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,860
- Are you biting into it?
- Just eat the whole thing.

910
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,360
(He eats Level 11 in one bite.)

911
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,830
Move.

912
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,200
- Gosh.
- There's food behind you.

913
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,970
There it is.

914
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,640
- What is that?
- There it is.

915
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,070
- It's soup.
- There it is.

916
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,140
- What is it?
- It's jjamppong.

917
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,540
- It smells...
- Wait.

918
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,710
- It still hasn't hit. Eat it now.
- My mouth is burning.

919
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,780
- Eat.
- Is it that spicy?

920
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,750
- Is he eating it now?
- You shouldn't take breaks.

921
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,880
Is he eating it now?

922
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,280
- He's eating it right away.
- It must be spicy.

923
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,190
- Is he drinking the broth too?
- It must be spicy.

924
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,060
- Are you okay?
- Drink the broth too.

925
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,390
- The broth.
- Don't push him too far.

926
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,960
- Don't drink the broth.
- Just the noodles.

927
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,030
We won't ask him to drink the broth.

928
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,000
The noodles must've
soaked up all the broth.

929
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,460
Is it spicy?

930
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,400
- It must be spicy.
- It hit him.

931
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,000
Don't overdo it, Eunhyuk.

932
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,340
(Level 15)

933
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,410
(He picked up another bowl?)

934
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,710
- I'm sweating.
- Gosh, that's...

935
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,640
(Slurping up the fire jjamppong)

936
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,510
(20-year veteran, rookie attitude!)

937
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,480
- He's incredible.
- Wasn't that chili?

938
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,750
(Back in those days,
we had to die on set.)

939
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,020
(Faltering)

940
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,790
You're so good.

941
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,990
- How can you eat that?
- How can he eat that?

942
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,960
Jae Seok, we lose.

943
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,530
- We give up.
- We will surrender.

944
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,230
I think we'd better surrender.

945
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,760
We will eat
until the crispy chicken.

946
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,660
- We're hungry.
- Right. We're hungry.

947
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,670
How can one eat this?

948
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,940
- Gosh. You know...
- Yes, you're right.

949
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,170
- It's tasty.
- Is it really?

950
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,210
- It's spicy but good.
- He didn't even break a sweat.

951
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,570
It's spicy but good.

952
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,670
He's not even sweating.

953
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,940
- I have a headache.
- Level 14.

954
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,680
If we don't eat everything, we lose.

955
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,150
He's eating that with rice?

956
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,120
(Let's go all the way.)

957
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,790
You really can handle the heat.

958
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,290
- He's good.
- Leave just one.

959
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,390
Eunhyuk can handle the spice.

960
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,260
- That's it.
- Yes. Leave the soup!

961
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,960
Scoop out just the rice.

962
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
(He doesn't have to drink the soup!)

963
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,560
- Hey, Eunhyuk.
- Dance. Dance it out.

964
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,670
- Dance it out.
- "Sorry, sorry."

965
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,970
- I feel it now.
- Don't you?

966
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,070
- I feel it.
- Yes.

967
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,040
Just the rice.
Leave the soup. That's it.

968
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,540
Okay. Let's go.

969
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,980
- He can take the heat.
- Stop at Level 14.

970
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,040
- You can't do 15. That'll do.
- Leave it.

971
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,950
- That's it. Stop.
- You completed Level 14.

972
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,680
- That's how far you got.
- Eunhyuk.

973
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,550
Eunhyuk, drink this. Here.

974
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,920
- You need to drink that.
- Respect. How did you do that?

975
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,490
There's no way. You can't finish it.

976
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,560
- Eunhyuk, how bad was it?
- Was it doable?

977
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,390
- He's tearing up.
- Is it doable?

978
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,460
I'm tearing up.

979
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,530
The spice hits you later on.

980
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,630
(Team Jae Seok completes Level 14.)

981
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,540
Decide the order you'll go in.

982
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,370
- Why are you number one?
- Why are you first?

983
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,470
I can't eat spicy food.

984
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,640
Neither can I.

985
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,870
Why are you number one?

986
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,580
- I'll go first.
- Then Seok Jin.

987
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,310
- I'm first.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

988
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,410
- Just us two.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

989
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,580
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors!

990
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,280
(Mr. Lee the teacher is 1st.)

991
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,350
You go first.

992
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,880
You can go up to Level Seven.

993
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,020
- What are you talking about?
- That's right.

994
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,350
- I can't.
- Ye Eun's pretty good.

995
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,760
Let's all eat two each.

996
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
- Yes.
- Two each.

997
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,560
- Two plates each? Okay.
- Yes, two each.

998
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
- Two each?
- Cowards.
Get some fresh air.

999
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,760
Let's... Hey, he...

1000
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,000
Look at him. Eunhyuk.

1001
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,500
- Is it that bad?
- This isn't bad.

1002
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,400
- My gosh.
- If you smell it...

1003
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,270
- It's no joke?
- It hits you later.

1004
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,110
Eunhyuk stopped at Level 14.

1005
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,880
- Now Leeteuk has a goal.
- We must do this.

1006
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,140
Let's go all the way to 15.

1007
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,210
- Right? You have a goal.
- Yes.

1008
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,780
Are you any good with spicy food?

1009
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,380
- I enjoy it.
- That's fine, then.

1010
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,280
- I must do this.
- You'll go all the way.

1011
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,150
I'll eat the kimchi too.

1012
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,450
- Are you sitting in order?
- Get to Level Three.

1013
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,650
- Eat the kimchi.
- Okay.

1014
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,990
Eat the kimchi too.

1015
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,360
- Are you ready?
- The kimchi too. I'll try.

1016
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,860
The longer you take...

1017
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,560
The heat builds up.

1018
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,830
- So...
- Drink some water.

1019
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,830
- Drink some water.
- Drink some water.

1020
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,940
Is it that bad?

1021
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,400
- Is it that bad?
- You want your mom.

1022
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,540
Eat up.

1023
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,910
(2nd player Seok Sam
tries the Level 3 kimchi.)

1024
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,480
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- Gosh.

1025
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,280
You're taking too long.
Eat faster. You must.

1026
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,580
How much water are you drinking?

1027
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,010
That's enough water.

1028
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,680
Eat the dumplings right away.

1029
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,580
It's worse if you go slow.

1030
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,990
Cool them down.

1031
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,690
Shove it in at once.

1032
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,020
(Screaming)

1033
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,630
(The dumpling kiss was electric.)

1034
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,830
He can't do it.

1035
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,830
(Water!)

1036
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
This is fun.

1037
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,870
Don't think it's spicy
because then it feels worse.

1038
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,170
- It's so spicy.
- There's not much left.

1039
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,270
Pretend it's not spicy.

1040
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,400
(Ssaebssaeb makes up for the water
and kisses the Level 5 dumpling.)

1041
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,910
- Don't lie.
- It's really spicy.

1042
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,270
- Don't lie.
- I'm serious.

1043
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,480
You're awesome.

1044
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,180
- How is it?
- How is it?

1045
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,580
(He explodes in the end.)

1046
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,010
I told you it was no joke.

1047
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,050
Take over.

1048
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,420
How is it?

1049
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,550
- Take over.
- You're taking over now?

1050
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,250
- For real?
- They won't make it.

1051
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,190
Can you eat spicy food, Kyu Hyun?

1052
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,920
Kyu Hyun's not that good
with spices.

1053
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,360
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

1054
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,630
- It's not bad.
- Kyu Hyun's... How is he at this?

1055
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,100
- Can he take it?
- Don't savor it.

1056
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,800
He must be okay.

1057
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,130
- What?
- It's not bad?

1058
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,370
Am I good at eating spicy stuff?

1059
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,770
- You're okay.
- Move on fast.

1060
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,410
- Move on, then.
- The tteokbokki.

1061
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,310
- Level Six.
- We have a surprise rival.

1062
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,780
He likes tteokbokki.

1063
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,180
- Does he?
- Yes.

1064
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,550
- I'm called Cho Tteok Cho Tteok.
- Yes, right?

1065
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,550
- Is this the original?
- Yes.

1066
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,850
- This one is okay.
- It's the basic tteokbokki.

1067
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,220
That's fine, then.

1068
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,150
- He's feeling it.
- It hit him.

1069
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,650
- It hit him.
- This is when you eat.

1070
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,260
- That's right.
- Keep eating.

1071
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,260
Go on.

1072
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,260
- He's managing.
- Your tongue and stomach...

1073
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,360
- feel it.
- You're doing good.

1074
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,860
Shove it all in.

1075
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,960
We won this.

1076
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,370
Kyu Hyun's doing pretty good
on his end.

1077
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,470
- Do you need water?
- He must be fine.

1078
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,100
Now pour the pho in at once.

1079
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,470
The pho isn't bad.
Try to eat the curry too.

1080
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,570
(He tries Level 7 too.)

1081
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,770
He's sweating.

1082
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,410
- It's the spicy pho.
- Gosh!

1083
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,410
(Forget my flimsy past!)

1084
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,780
- He's pretty good.
- Is it doable?

1085
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,480
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1086
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,180
- You're okay.
- You're doing great.

1087
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,780
(The blood of an entertainer
flows in him.)

1088
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,420
- Okay.
- He's doing really well.

1089
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,260
- Just one more.
- He's good at this.

1090
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,460
That end is killer.

1091
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,660
Eat just one more, Kyu Hyun.

1092
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,630
Why are you
trying to take the water?

1093
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,230
Why would you take it?

1094
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,200
You drank most of the water
after one piece of kimchi?

1095
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,930
- No.
- He's still suffering?

1096
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,400
My gosh.

1097
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,440
(He's still making a fuss
after eating Level 3.)

1098
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,370
My gosh.

1099
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,410
There's a lot of sauce.

1100
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,580
Your philtrum's soaked with sweat.

1101
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,680
Are you done? It's me now?

1102
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,880
- Tell me quick.
- I'll eat this too.

1103
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,550
- I'll eat this.
- Why?

1104
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,350
- You'll eat that too?
- You're doing good.

1105
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,150
It's rice, so it's not bad.

1106
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,420
- Maybe?
- Yes, rice might be easier to eat.

1107
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,760
Hey.

1108
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,160
That's seriously spicy.

1109
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,660
Kyu Hyun, we have
other things to do after this.

1110
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,260
- Yes.
- I must do this.

1111
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,830
Let's show Leeteuk go to Level 15.

1112
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,800
- Because you're a team?
- Yes.

1113
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,200
You got the first part,
so I'll take the last part.

1114
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,170
You stuck together
for 20 years for a reason.

1115
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,970
(It's a rare sight for Running Man.)

1116
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,010
- That's it.
- Now move on.

1117
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,480
Drink some water. You deserve it.

1118
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,910
- Have some water.
- You earned it.

1119
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,750
- It looks so spicy.
- The Food Fighter enters.

1120
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,650
- Let's watch the Food Fighter.
- Good luck.

1121
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,850
- It's the Food Fighter.
- Go, Ye Eun.

1122
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,920
(Another player
enters the arena for Level 9.)

1123
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,160
That's spicy.
The burger steak's really spicy.

1124
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,760
- Watch the sauce.
- Breathe as you eat.

1125
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
The Food Fighter.

1126
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,660
Don't eat it like that.

1127
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,400
- You're taking bites?
- That's it.

1128
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,030
She's good at this.
When it comes to food...

1129
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,930
- Is it tasty?
- How is it?

1130
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,070
- Are you okay?
- You're managing.

1131
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,070
It's fine.

1132
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,170
- For real?
- Good going.

1133
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,910
- Seriously. It's not bad.
- Are you okay?

1134
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,910
- It's not bad? Are you okay?
- She's okay?

1135
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,680
- It's okay at first.
- It's fine.

1136
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,140
It's not bad at first.

1137
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,380
Ye Eun looks fine.

1138
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,380
(It's the same thing Jae Seok ate.)

1139
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,580
Go right in.

1140
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,780
- How is it, Ye Eun?
- She's good.

1141
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,220
Gosh, Ye Eun.

1142
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,120
- It's just like tteokbokki.
- She's a true food fighter.

1143
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,560
- Look at her.
- She's good.

1144
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,060
Ye Eun's extra awesome
when she eats.

1145
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,390
- Yes, she is.
- Right?

1146
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,530
- She's cool.
- It's like watching a superhero.

1147
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,630
- She's like a superhero.
- She's not even flinching.

1148
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,900
You look normal.

1149
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,570
- Food Fighter!
- Are you okay, Food Fighter?

1150
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,570
It's spicy.

1151
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,470
- She looks a bit...
- You're awesome.

1152
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,510
- Look at her expression.
- "It's spicy."

1153
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,410
Look at her handle it.

1154
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,410
You...
(Plop)

1155
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,340
- I'll eat it.
- You have to.

1156
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,980
Food Fighter doesn't throw away food
because it fell on the table.

1157
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,180
(She speaks less and eats more.)

1158
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,690
You seem so calm.

1159
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,090
- Eat this now.
- Gosh, Ye Eun.

1160
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,560
- Another one?
- Ye Eun.

1161
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,560
- She's good.
- Are you okay?

1162
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,190
- She's good at this too.
- Are you okay, Ye Eun?

1163
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,830
The pork cutlet's okay so far.

1164
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,430
Weren't you just hungry?

1165
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,160
She is a true food fighter.

1166
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,360
Seriously.

1167
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,200
I think I can eat
the fire jjamppong.

1168
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,270
- The fire jjamppong.
- For real?

1169
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,870
- Bring in the rest.
- The jjamppong will make her cry.

1170
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,170
Look at Kyu Hyun while she's...

1171
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,380
Ye Eun looks so calm.

1172
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,780
(She rinses her palate
and goes for the Level 12 fire jjamppong.)

1173
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,150
- That's...
- Are you really okay?

1174
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,150
- Yes.
- A superhero...

1175
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,380
You can handle the heat.

1176
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,450
- She's really good at this.
- Why say you can't?

1177
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,990
It's spicy. This one is hot.

1178
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,360
The noodles are spicy.

1179
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,720
She's enjoying herself.

1180
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,760
What's up with her?

1181
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,290
- The old Ye Eun...
- It's an anniversary.

1182
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,390
- Okay.
- Ye Eun.

1183
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,900
Her lips are swollen.

1184
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,560
Your lips are swollen.

1185
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,870
(Plump lips)

1186
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,170
Yes, your lips are swollen.

1187
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,870
That's it. That's enough.

1188
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,140
You can stop now.

1189
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,770
Stop. I can manage.

1190
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,480
- Shall I eat this?
- I can do it.

1191
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,580
You did well enough.

1192
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,780
(The last remaining player)

1193
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,750
- I'll stop, then.
- Okay. Well done.

1194
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,220
(The man who said they must
risk their life for variety TV.)

1195
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,220
- Do it, Leeteuk.
- It's the Leeteuk Show.

1196
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,820
- The Leeteuk Show.
- Do it.

1197
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,160
(His body and mind are the same
as they were 20 years ago.)

1198
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,870
- Give me a spoon.
- A spoon.

1199
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,940
- You're awesome.
- A true leader!

1200
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,540
- Well done.
- It's the Leeteuk Show.

1201
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,380
(Eunhyuk's record was Level 14.)

1202
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,780
- Gosh.
- What is that? Rice?

1203
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,850
It's spicy.

1204
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,780
(If he eats Level 15,
Team Seok Jin wins.)

1205
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,180
(While the members
fill their bellies with water,)

1206
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,190
(Leeteuk fills his with spicy soup!)

1207
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,190
Leeteuk!

1208
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,420
- My gosh.
- How does he do that?

1209
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,260
- It's over.
- Leeteuk!

1210
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,830
(He successfully crushes
the spicy challenge.)

1211
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,100
- Are you all right?
- I don't need it.

1212
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,530
- Have some water.
- Are you really okay?

1213
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,700
- Are you really okay?
- For real?

1214
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,640
- It's spicy.
- It's not spicy.

1215
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,300
What? It's not spicy?

1216
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,840
- It was so tasty.
- Ye Eun.

1217
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,310
- Are you serious?
- Your face is getting redder.

1218
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,880
I'm not...

1219
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
- Can we drink the water?
- Yes.

1220
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,280
You completed all 15 levels,

1221
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,420
- so the team of six won.
- Are you okay?

1222
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,490
- We won!
- Hooray!

1223
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,390
The team of six won,

1224
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,890
so you get a total of 70 R coins.

1225
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,460
- We should've gone more.
- The losing team...

1226
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,630
will get 40 R coins.

1227
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,470
Discuss how much
each person contributed...

1228
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,570
and decide who gets how many coins.

1229
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,100
We got 40 coins.

1230
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,270
- Let's take eight each.
- Okay.

1231
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,410
We deserve a lot, honestly.

1232
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,410
You do.

1233
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,080
- I ate 3.
- I ate 4.

1234
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,650
You didn't eat three. Look.

1235
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,910
- Two plates of dumplings.
- Three pieces.

1236
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:58,980
- Se Chan.
- That's three.

1237
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,150
Look at our end.

1238
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,880
- I ate 3 plates.
- Yes, I ate 4 plates.

1239
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,090
- Seok Jin ate just one.
- Yes, wait.

1240
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,620
Just one but a killer one.

1241
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,660
- Seok Jin.
- This was tough.

1242
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,260
- The crispy chicken was tough too.
- Don't be silly.

1243
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,260
We'll head to another location...

1244
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,200
- for the next mission.
- Let's go!

1245
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,430
Okay.

1246
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,930
Look at her. What's wrong with her?

1247
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,470
- You're out of it.
- What happened to your lips?

1248
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,800
- Ye Eun. Your lips...
- That was delicious.

1249
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,970
- Ye Eun. Your lips...
- It was really spicy.

1250
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,180
Ye Eun. Eat something spicy
before the shoot.

1251
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,110
- Your lips are extra pretty.
- You look pretty and sexy.

1252
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,980
Eat something spicy
in the morning every week.

1253
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,380
(They board a van
to switch locations.)

1254
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,450
- He's amazing. Are you okay?
- He's a monster.

1255
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,260
Ye Eun said she was okay,
but she's eating a dozen candies.

1256
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,790
- She ate some chocolate earlier.
- This is strawberry candy.

1257
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,530
- My stomach...
- Ye Eun.

1258
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,960
- Your lips are returning.
- Are they?

1259
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,660
I think Leeteuk will come back
looking a little slim.

1260
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,600
- I think Ye Eun...
- He'll look gaunt.

1261
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,700
Leeteuk must be tired.

1262
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,270
- Here he comes.
- That's what I meant.

1263
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,840
- Leeteuk is here.
- How does Leeteuk look?

1264
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,910
He's probably going to act
like he's fine, right?

1265
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,210
- Yes, he will.
- Let's see.

1266
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,540
- What? Is that milk?
- He's bringing milk.

1267
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,840
- What is that?
- He has milk in one hand.

1268
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,480
(He returns as he preciously holds
a carton of milk.)

1269
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,580
- Leeteuk.
- That's funny.

1270
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,680
He's bringing milk.

1271
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,750
- Hey, you were acting all tough.
- You brought milk.

1272
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,120
- Leeteuk.
- You're holding that milk.

1273
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
I'm so happy.

1274
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,220
- Have a seat.
- I feel great.

1275
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,590
- Leeteuk, put your seatbelt on.
- Why do you feel great?

1276
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,620
- Your seatbelt.
- Are you okay?

1277
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,620
- I feel great.
- Leeteuk.

1278
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,660
- Gosh, that's so funny.
- I mean,

1279
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,860
why are you acting so tough?

1280
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,460
- Gosh, I feel so great.
- You're acting too tough.

1281
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,360
- I thought you had gone home.
- No.

1282
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,930
It's all good.
I'm fine right now. Why?

1283
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,400
- Is there a problem?
- Well...

1284
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,500
- What did you do in the restroom?
- What?

1285
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,200
- I got an important phone call.
- Oh, you got a phone call.

1286
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,740
(He responds jovially
with an old joke.)

1287
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,170
- I remember so clearly.
- Hey.

1288
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,840
- "Have some water. I'm fine."
- "I'm fine."

1289
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,110
"I don't need any. Water."

1290
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,780
(He even let others drink
his water earlier.)

1291
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,910
- I feel great.
- I'm fine.

1292
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,550
So why are you holding
that milk so tightly?

1293
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,650
In case anyone wants to drink it.

1294
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,950
- You're still acting tough.
- You seem to want it yourself.

1295
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,020
- He's acting tough.
- My gosh.

1296
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,790
Gosh, has SUPER JUNIOR been around
for 20 years? Unbelievable.

1297
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,690
Gosh, 20 years of SUPER JUNIOR?

1298
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,260
- That's incredible.
- It's a hard thing to do.

1299
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,460
- Without any member changes...
- Lasting 20 years isn't easy.

1300
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,830
- We did have some changes.
- Our members have changed.

1301
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,430
- Quite a few.
- Well, yes.

1302
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,900
Although there have been changes,

1303
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,470
there were so many of us
to begin with, so you can't tell.

1304
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,840
- Right. You can't tell.
- Right?

1305
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,510
- There are nine members now, right?
- Yes.

1306
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,340
- There are still so many of us.
- That's true.

1307
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,470
You guys don't fight anymore, right?

1308
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,880
- We still fight.
- You still do?

1309
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,250
- We still fight.
- But you don't have fistfights.

1310
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,180
- Same as Jae Seok and Seok Jin.
- They can't help but fight.

1311
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,250
That's right.

1312
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,620
But we can't fight...

1313
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,680
really energetically and physically
like before.

1314
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,920
- I'm sure.
- Yes.

1315
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,690
- The fights don't last long.
- You don't have the energy anymore.

1316
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,520
- Does it just fizzle out?
- Yes, it lasts a bit,

1317
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,660
but we get too exhausted to fight.

1318
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,830
Oh, we're already here.

1319
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,830
Oh, my. This must be it.

1320
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,130
We'll get off now.

1321
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,330
Gosh, what is this?

1322
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,400
- Gosh, what is all this?
- The set is so...

1323
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,500
- My gosh. What could this be?
- What is this?

1324
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,440
- Hey, we have to climb up.
- I smell something good.

1325
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,910
Gosh, what a nice set.

1326
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,070
This is like an old variety show.

1327
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,180
- Isn't it like an old variety show?
- Gosh, what is this?

1328
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,840
- It's really an old variety show.
- It's legit.

1329
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,810
- This is so slippery.
- It's been a while.

1330
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,410
- Didn't SUPER JUNIOR...
- My gosh.

1331
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,850
do lots of live broadcasts here?

1332
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,420
- Right.
- We debuted here.

1333
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,680
- You did?
- Yes, we did.

1334
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,950
- And our first win was here too.
- Oh, really?

1335
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,220
- Also...
- Do you mean way back when?

1336
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,860
- That's right.
- Back in 2005.

1337
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,260
- It was 2005.
- I know that too.

1338
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,890
Also, the waiting room
that the staff gave us...

1339
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,900
is the waiting room
where we had a fight.

1340
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,930
- Oh, the big room?
- Yes.

1341
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:02,930
- That's great.
- Where?

1342
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,130
- On the second floor here.
- They had a fight here.

1343
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,770
- With Hee Chul?
- It was on the second floor, right?

1344
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,600
It's the waiting room
where Eunhyuk, Kyu Hyun, and I...

1345
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,770
got into a fight.

1346
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,840
The three of you had a fight?

1347
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,070
To be exact, it wasn't a fight.

1348
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,610
That guy acted violently toward us.

1349
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,080
No, you can't say
that he was violent.

1350
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,050
- Leeteuk gave us a beating.
- Right, a beating.

1351
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,750
- Oh, a beating.
- It's where he gave us a beating.

1352
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,920
That's where Kyu Hyun threw water
on your face last, right?

1353
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,050
Yes, that's the place.

1354
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,420
- You threw water on his face?
- No, not on his face.

1355
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,450
It was on this blanket.

1356
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,660
The members were just joking around.

1357
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,790
And at the end,
I had come from praying at church.

1358
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,090
- Praying.
- From praying at church.

1359
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,700
- Everyone seemed so happy,
- Yes.

1360
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,830
so I just did it once at the end.

1361
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,170
- I joined in.
- Just a bit in the bottle cap.

1362
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,670
But then, he smacked in the back
of the head right away.

1363
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,670
(How the incident happened)

1364
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,070
- I saw stars.
- On top of that,

1365
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,610
I didn't do anything.
I was just standing there,

1366
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,070
but he said, "It was you, right?"
And he went like...

1367
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,480
- I was so upset.
- So, that happened here.

1368
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,880
- Leeteuk.
- I was like, "It wasn't me!"

1369
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,250
- As the leader,
- Yes.

1370
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,950
you don't seem to have
much restraint.

1371
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,680
My temper is like a car on a highway.
There's no stopping it.

1372
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,050
- You must've had a lot of rage.
- Yes.

1373
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,550
- So, that day,
- You must've had pent-up rage.

1374
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,520
we won the Mutizen Song award.

1375
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,390
- I handed Eunhyuk the mic.
- Yes.

1376
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,630
He didn't give an acceptance speech.

1377
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,930
- No, I did.
- He did.

1378
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,700
I did, but I looked like...

1379
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,430
I had a bad smell under my nose.

1380
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,770
Congratulations.

1381
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,540
(Smoky Eunhyuk takes the mic
with a frown on his face.)

1382
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,300
(You do it.)

1383
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,710
(Bitter)

1384
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,910
Please give us an acceptance speech.

1385
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,580
We will work harder
as SUPER JUNIOR from now on.

1386
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,610
(No smiles)

1387
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,680
(You should do it too.)

1388
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,950
(Kyu Hyun
doesn't look happy either.)

1389
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,380
That day,
the top trending search was...

1390
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,450
"Eunhyuk is being bullied."

1391
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,020
- There were rumors about that.
- A trending search?

1392
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,120
- I haven't heard that in a while.
- It was a huge deal.

1393
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,150
What was that thing...

1394
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,620
where you and Hee Chul were
facing opposite ways?

1395
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,960
- That was in Incheon.
- Was it in Incheon?

1396
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,060
It's called
the Great Battle of Incheon.

1397
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,460
- The Great Battle of Incheon.
- What was that about?

1398
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,530
- Was it a fistfight?
- In Incheon?

1399
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,530
- Hee Chul...
- Was it really a fistfight?

1400
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,500
Hee Chul and Leeteuk...

1401
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,830
- are the same age. But then,
- Yes.

1402
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,370
Leeteuk had some pent-up emotions
toward Hee Chul.

1403
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,900
- They're polar opposites.
- So,

1404
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,870
he pushed Hee Chul from behind.

1405
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,370
As he pushed him, he said,

1406
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,580
"It's been ten years."

1407
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,010
"I've been holding it in
for ten years."

1408
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,410
- He said that?
- "It's been ten years."

1409
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,550
- For real.
- "It's been ten years."

1410
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,380
- He was huffing and puffing.
- "Ten years!"

1411
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,980
- He even had his shirt off.
- Oh, really?

1412
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,050
With his shirt off,

1413
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,190
"It's been ten years."

1414
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,920
(It's been 10 years.)

1415
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,590
(Like a line from
a serious teen coming-of-age movie)

1416
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,620
No, really.

1417
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,490
I thought I was watching a movie.
For real.

1418
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:12,030
For real.

1419
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,030
- What was on your mind?
- Well, I thought,

1420
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,460
- "It's been ten years."
- "It's time to resolve things now."

1421
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,730
- "It's time to resolve things now?"
- So, he meant...

1422
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,430
- that he had been holding back...
- For ten years.

1423
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,470
"It's been ten years."

1424
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,500
- So, what happened after that?
- So,

1425
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,310
- they were going like this.
- And then...

1426
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,310
- Things got pretty physical.
- Oh, really?

1427
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,610
But, they couldn't make up,
and we went up on stage.

1428
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:28,910
- Again?
- Oh, really?

1429
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:30,350
- Which song was it?
- Gosh, really?

1430
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,410
- It's a song called "Bonamana."
- "Bonamana."

1431
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,950
The performance is
supposed to go like...

1432
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,420
- Leeteuk and Hee Chul...
- They have to go like this.

1433
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,650
- have their backs together.
- They have to go like this.

1434
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,020
- But that day, they were like this.
- That day, it was like this.

1435
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,090
(But that day, they were like this.)

1436
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:45,060
(The choreography should have them
warmly leaning on each other.)

1437
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,700
(But the day they fought,)

1438
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:50,400
(they were two steps apart
as they sang.)

1439
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,740
(That was how this performance
became proof of their discord.)

1440
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,870
- They were angry the whole time.
- People must've thought...

1441
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,040
Hey, it had been ten years.

1442
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,380
- It was ten years, Eunhyuk.
- But...

1443
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,280
people screenshot that scene on TV,

1444
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,410
and even I could tell.

1445
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,780
I'm 100 percent sure
they had a fight.

1446
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,180
The fans were cheering
and went like,

1447
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,720
"What's going on?"

1448
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,120
"Why did they fight again?"

1449
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,150
- But things are great now.
- I'm sure.

1450
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,720
- You last longer if you fight.
- Of course.

1451
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,290
- "It's been ten years."
- Ten years.

1452
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,490
- It's like, "Here comes my sword."
- So, this mission is...

1453
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:19,030
for Running Man's 15th anniversary.

1454
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,830
We've prepared Running Man games
that people want to see again.

1455
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,500
We've upgraded the soapy slope.

1456
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,000
This is Express Slippery Mode.

1457
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,440
- This looks so slippery.
- It's so slippery.

1458
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,040
You will get into groups of two,

1459
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,610
and three teams will participate
in each round.

1460
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,440
After getting to the top
of the slippery slope,

1461
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,980
you have to stick both
team members' name tags on the wall.

1462
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,380
According to your rank,

1463
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,520
you will get
a different amount of coins.

1464
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,350
- For 1st place, you get 40 coins.
- Gosh, 40?

1465
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:46,620
For 2nd place, you get 30 coins.

1466
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,890
And for 3rd place, you get 10 coins.

1467
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:50,260
But for the teams
with female members,

1468
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,860
as long as you don't come in
last place,

1469
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,130
- you'll get an extra ten coins.
- Really?

1470
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,300
(Teams with women members get
10 extra coins if they don't lose.)

1471
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,330
- So, since there are 11 of you,
- Yes.

1472
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,240
there will be a team
with only one person.

1473
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,540
That person will get to keep
all of the coins.

1474
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,870
- My goodness.
- You can go by yourself?

1475
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:04,940
- Alone?
- Yes.

1476
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,970
- That's nice.
- So...

1477
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:06,980
- Isn't that the best?
- By yourself?

1478
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,080
- You can buy a ticket...
- Can you do that?

1479
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,210
to be a solo team.

1480
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,110
- We'll reveal the menu now.
- Okay.

1481
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,110
(Solo team ticket, 5 coins,
Only 1 out of 11 can buy it!)

1482
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,720
- I see.
- Five coins.

1483
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,650
Only one person can buy
the solo team ticket.

1484
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,220
If Se Chan says...

1485
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,860
- he'll buy it for five coins,
- An auction?

1486
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,560
- but Leeteuk says...
- Six coins.

1487
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,630
he'll buy it for six coins,

1488
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,330
- it'll go to Leeteuk.
- Only one person can buy it?

1489
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:26,400
- Oh, really?
- First,

1490
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,500
before we get into teams,

1491
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,430
if anyone wants to buy
the solo team ticket...

1492
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:31,700
- Solo...
- Okay. Me.

1493
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:32,870
Actually, if you play on your own,

1494
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:34,440
- it's the easiest, isn't it?
- Five coins?

1495
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,640
It's the most advantageous.
Five coins.

1496
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,740
I mean, imagine if you become
a team with Ji Ye Eun.

1497
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,740
That would be a mess.

1498
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,240
Seriously?

1499
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:41,910
Gosh, then I want to try
being a solo team.

1500
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:42,910
I want to do it.

1501
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,210
Solo team ticket. Five coins.

1502
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,580
- Five, four...
- Six coins.

1503
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,220
- Seven coins.
- Seven coins.

1504
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,890
- Eight.
- Eight coins.

1505
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,550
- Ten!
- Ten coins.

1506
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,920
- Ten.
- Eleven.

1507
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,960
- Eleven?
- Eleven coins.

1508
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,390
He's acting tough again.

1509
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,560
Eleven.

1510
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,190
But is it more advantageous
to play by yourself?

1511
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,900
It is, definitely.

1512
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,230
- Right. How many did you say?
- It would be...

1513
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,630
- I said 11.
- It got up to 11 now.

1514
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:03,870
But Seok Jin, 12 coins...

1515
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,230
- That much is fine. I say 12.
- Then, go for it.

1516
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,300
- Twelve?
- Yes.

1517
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,470
- I say 12.
- Okay.

1518
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,740
- Okay. All together, now.
- Everyone. All right.

1519
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,110
- Everyone, let's think about this.
- Okay.

1520
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:13,740
- We have 12 coins.
- Let's think about it.

1521
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,180
- Wait a minute.
- All right.

1522
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,250
Hey, think about it.

1523
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,210
- Wouldn't it be easier...
- You can take all the coins.

1524
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,050
- to stop Seok Jin?
- That's right.

1525
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,450
- Okay. Let's bring him down!
- Let's do it!

1526
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:24,020
- He can spend 12 coins.
- Yes.

1527
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,750
- We'll take him down.
- We can take his money.

1528
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:26,860
Hey.

1529
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,590
It's been 15 years.

1530
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,190
(It's been 15 years.)

1531
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,660
Why, you little punk.
I've had enough!

1532
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,100
How many years has it been?

1533
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,330
Seok Jin, is your bid 12 coins?

1534
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,630
So, 12 coins.

1535
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,100
Seok Jin, for 12 coins,

1536
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,530
- you get the solo team ticket...
- Hang on a minute.

1537
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,700
Let him be by himself.

1538
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,370
- It's been 15 years!
- I won't do it.

1539
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:42,370
- No, but there's more.
- All right.

1540
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:43,540
- Isn't anyone else bidding?
- Five,

1541
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,640
- What about you guys?
- four,

1542
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,770
- three,
- Three,

1543
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:46,880
- two,
- two,

1544
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,480
- one. Yes, Seok Jin.
- one.

1545
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,910
- You can pay 12 coins.
- All right.

1546
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:51,110
What is going on?

1547
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,980
- But 12 coins to be on your own...
- Congratulations.

1548
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,150
The others...

1549
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:56,820
can get into teams...

1550
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,950
- of two.
- But is this really an advantage?

1551
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,250
- Let's go!
- Excuse me, Jong Kook!

1552
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,790
- No, I'm going to be on his team.
- No, please.

1553
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:01,990
- Go away!
- Ye Eun.

1554
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,760
Go away!

1555
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,090
- Ye Eun.
- Gosh, seriously.

1556
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,530
I'm sorry. I also...

1557
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:08,800
- Gosh, my back.
- Seriously?

1558
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,470
(Shouting)

1559
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,270
She's angry.

1560
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,500
It's been a year.

1561
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,370
- Who will take Ye Eun?
- I can't help it.

1562
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:17,170
- She should go with Jong Kook.
- Gosh, Ye Eun?

1563
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,710
- Ye Eun, what's wrong?
- Ye Eun.

1564
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,780
- I mean, if she's like that...
- Ye Eun.

1565
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,080
I heard a splat.

1566
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,840
You should just eat, okay?

1567
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:25,010
Then, let's do a random draw.

1568
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,010
- That sounds fun.
- Which one...

1569
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,580
- That would be better, right?
- Oh, random teams?

1570
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,180
In 1, 2, 3.

1571
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,220
- E.
- E.

1572
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,620
- C.
- C!

1573
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,650
Eunhyuk!

1574
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,760
(The friends who were born in 1986,
the Year of the Tiger)

1575
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,320
Hey, we wanted to be
on the same team anyway.

1576
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,730
(Laughing joyfully)

1577
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,730
(Ddochi and Anchovy)

1578
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,660
- Gosh, Ye Eun.
- Yu Jae Seok!

1579
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,560
- Leeteuk, you can do it, right?
- We can do it.

1580
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,130
Don't try to act tough.

1581
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,400
(The gym buddies)

1582
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,570
- Hey, the same gym...
- Star Gym.

1583
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,870
- Okay! Star Gym.
- Star Gym.

1584
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:48,940
What will she do?

1585
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,210
- They're the weakest.
- Okay, here.

1586
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,670
- Gosh, we're in big trouble.
- The weakest.

1587
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:53,840
- Gosh, we're done for!
- But still...

1588
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,480
- We're going to win!
- Yes!

1589
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,550
Our round is so easy!

1590
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,680
(Se Chan and Eunhyuk got matched up
with easy opponents.)

1591
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,080
- Gosh, are you that happy?
- They're so lucky.

1592
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,380
- Hey, Ye Eun.
- Come on.

1593
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,280
- We got lucky.
- Let's form an alliance.

1594
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,920
- Hey, we'll win for sure.
- The three of us.

1595
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,520
I don't think we can win,
even with the three of us.

1596
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,190
And you will be able to
purchase items...

1597
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,930
- that will be useful in the game.
- Oh, really?

1598
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,730
(Connect the opposing team members,
auction starts at 3 coins)

1599
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,400
(One anti-slip shoe,
auction starts at 3 coins)

1600
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,000
(Towel, 5 coins for small,
10 coins for large)

1601
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,070
"Connect the opposing team members."

1602
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,400
- "Auction starts at..."
- "Auction starts at..."

1603
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,200
You can connect the two members
on the opposing team.

1604
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,940
You should do that
for a strong team.

1605
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,170
It's a hindrance item.

1606
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,980
Oh, the anti-slip shoe...

1607
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,910
also starts at three coins
for the auction.

1608
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:30,050
Is there only one, though?

1609
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,080
Only one person
in that round can buy it.

1610
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,120
- One out of five?
- Really?

1611
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,880
- And 1 out of 6 for this round.
- Please let me use it.

1612
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,020
Let her have it.

1613
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,120
- Please let me have it.
- Are you sure?

1614
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,890
Towels. Five coins...

1615
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,890
- You can use the towels in any way.
- You could put it on the ground.

1616
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,120
Right, you could walk on top of it.

1617
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,890
- They'll connect us.
- Right.

1618
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:45,190
So, we should buy that one first.

1619
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,500
Excuse me.
We'll buy the connect item.

1620
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,560
- Connect.
- You want to buy the connect item.

1621
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,930
- So, you'll connect these two?
- Yes, we'll use it on them.

1622
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:50,700
- Look here, mister.
- Why?

1623
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,570
- Use it on the other team.
- Why would you use it on us?

1624
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,700
- Okay, fine.
- We get it.

1625
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,600
We'll buy the linking band.

1626
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,410
- And use it on the other team?
- Yes, the other team.

1627
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:59,140
- That'll be 3 coins.
- I'll spend 3 coins...

1628
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,140
- to buy the linking band.
- Sure.

1629
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,340
This is too slippery, though.

1630
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,110
The linking band costs 3 coins,
so give me 2.

1631
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,910
Jae Seok, I'd like
the anti-slip shoes.

1632
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:06,250
You have more coins.

1633
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,050
- I only have 30.
- But...

1634
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,280
I only have about a dozen or more.

1635
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,290
- As if. You obviously have more.
- I don't have a lot.

1636
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,190
- I don't.
- How stupid do you think I am?

1637
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,420
I really don't have much.

1638
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,860
I'll pay 2, while you pay 1.

1639
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,030
- Sure.
- Are you good with that?

1640
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,830
- Sure, okay.
- They're using one on us too.

1641
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:20,930
- Okay.
- What are you getting?

1642
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:22,700
- Link these two with a band.
- Would you like a linking band?

1643
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,930
- We'll both be...
- I'll buy the shoes.

1644
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,070
- I want the shoes too.
- The shoes.

1645
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:26,670
- I won't back out of this fight.
- Okay.

1646
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,140
- Go ahead.
- Just know...

1647
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,140
- you're bidding for one shoe.
- Just one?

1648
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,710
- Are you kidding me?
- Unbelievable.

1649
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,610
- Count me in.
- That's three coins per shoe.

1650
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:34,780
- Here you go.
- Four coins?

1651
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,480
- Here's four.
- Five.

1652
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,150
- I bid five.
- Six coins?

1653
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,410
- Seven.
- Eight.

1654
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:40,780
- Nine.
- Ten.

1655
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,720
- Ten.
- Eleven.

1656
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,550
- We won't stop. Twelve.
- Thirteen.

1657
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,990
- Fourteen.
- Fifteen.

1658
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,760
- Fifteen?
- Ye Eun won't back out either.

1659
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,690
- Sixteen.
- Seventeen.

1660
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,490
- You'll regret this. Eighteen.
- Nineteen.

1661
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,100
Twenty-two.

1662
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,300
(Se Chan: 22, Ye Eun: 19)

1663
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,370
Twenty-five.

1664
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:58,530
- Twenty-five?
- Whatever. I'm out.

1665
00:49:58,530 --> 00:49:59,770
(Se Chan gives up.)

1666
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:01,900
- Twenty-five.
- You can back out now.

1667
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,640
- Was this necessary?
- Twenty-five coins?

1668
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:05,440
She bought a shoe for 25 coins.

1669
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,480
Twenty-five?

1670
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,840
Who spent 25 coins?

1671
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,540
There's no way I'm paying 25 coins.

1672
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,280
- She bought a shoe for 25 coins.
- Hey.

1673
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,410
Twenty-five coins?

1674
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,950
You'll be broke
even if you win this round.

1675
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,380
- She spent 25 coins on a shoe?
- She spent 25 coins?

1676
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,150
- As long as she wins...
- Unless you win...

1677
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,320
For a shoe?

1678
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,490
- What happens if you don't win?
- How much does she even have?

1679
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,460
I'll buy towels.

1680
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,690
I'm sure they'll be of use.
I'll take five.

1681
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,090
- Towels?
- Can we buy more later?

1682
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,360
Let's put on our gear now.

1683
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,430
Eunhyuk, we need
to be linked by this.

1684
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,730
Is this our safety gear?

1685
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:31,900
- We should put these on.
- Our safety gear.

1686
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,140
- There's safety gear.
- Of course, we should wear them.

1687
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,500
Put that around your butt.

1688
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,840
Safety gear

1689
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,610
Do we have pads for our butts?

1690
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:42,180
This is what I wore
while I was snowboarding.

1691
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:43,580
All right.

1692
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,480
(Jae Seok tries to go up the steps.)

1693
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,720
This is no joke.

1694
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,780
He's good at this.

1695
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:49,520
It must be easy.

1696
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,350
(It's easier than they expected.)

1697
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,120
(He conducts
his own safety inspection.)

1698
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,130
(Giving his butt a massage)

1699
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,260
What's his deal?

1700
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,870
Does it hurt? Doesn't it?

1701
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:06,000
- It doesn't hurt.
- It looked cartoonish.

1702
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,470
(It passes the crybaby's test.)

1703
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:08,470
No way.

1704
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,740
(Daniel tries to climb
up the stairs too.)

1705
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,640
Daniel, try going up on your knees.

1706
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:14,010
Try sitting.

1707
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,380
Hey!

1708
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,710
This is how you play the game.

1709
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,180
- Got it?
- Sure.

1710
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,190
It doesn't hurt.
Anyway, that's how you play the game.

1711
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:26,890
The first team to stick
both name tags will win.

1712
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:28,520
That team will be in first place.

1713
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:30,730
This is...

1714
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,300
- He's showing his youthfulness.
- What was that for?

1715
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,060
- Who knows?
- What's he doing?

1716
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,970
Are you telling us
how we should knock you over?

1717
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:39,940
- All right.
- Hold on.

1718
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,700
- Let's play fair.
- Good luck.

1719
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,840
- We really should.
- Let's play fair.

1720
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,010
- No injuries.
- Let's not get hurt.

1721
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,010
Don't cheat.

1722
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:47,010
- One, two, three. Good luck.
- One, two, three. Good luck.

1723
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,040
- Play fair.
- No one should get hurt.
Exactly.

1724
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,780
Ready...

1725
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,450
(Start)

1726
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,690
(Of course, they start off
by blocking each other.)

1727
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:01,090
- Come on. Let's get up there.
- We should get on the stairs.

1728
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:03,090
Let's at least
get on the stairs first.

1729
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:05,460
Sure, let's go up.

1730
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,030
- Exactly.
- Jae Seok, slow down!

1731
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,830
- Go up.
- You're going too fast.

1732
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,370
(She drops
after only going up one step.)

1733
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,340
Ye Eun's on the floor.

1734
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,270
- You're going too fast.
- Ye Eun, why are you lying down?

1735
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,470
Slow down.

1736
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,010
- You're going up too fast.
- How is this fast?

1737
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,240
Get up here!

1738
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,080
- Hey.
- Wait.

1739
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,950
- You can't leave me behind.
- Ye Eun, come on.

1740
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:27,580
(Eventually)

1741
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,620
(Jae Seok ends up sliding down.)

1742
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,390
- They're so cute.
- This is funny.

1743
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,920
Seok Jin, push Se Chan.

1744
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,120
It's too slippery up here.

1745
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,790
- Seok Jin, push Se Chan.
- Ye Eun!

1746
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,060
(Kick!)

1747
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:38,130
(Seok Sam slides down as well.)

1748
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,760
- They're so cute.
- This is funny.

1749
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,530
- Eunhyuk!
- This is funny.

1750
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:43,870
(What?)

1751
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,270
- They're so cute.
- This is funny.

1752
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:47,970
(Eunhyuk falls down...)

1753
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,270
(and drags Se Chan down with him.)

1754
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:52,740
What on earth, guys?

1755
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:55,280
Get moving.

1756
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,050
- Grab Seok Jin.
- I can easily get up.

1757
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,510
- I can get up.
- Eunhyuk, come on!

1758
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,810
Eunhyuk, come on!

1759
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,380
(Seok Sam is soon caught.)

1760
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,250
Eunhyuk, come on!

1761
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,220
- No!
- Move it, will you?

1762
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,450
(Wailing no and then chuckling)

1763
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,560
- No! Not so fast.
- Jae Seok.

1764
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,730
Got it.

1765
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:11,730
No!

1766
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,160
(Getting ready
to push him off the cliff)

1767
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,460
Let's go!

1768
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,300
Go back down.

1769
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,870
(The amusement ride is just
about to start.)

1770
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,670
(Off you go.)

1771
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:22,870
Let's go!

1772
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:24,370
That's so cute.

1773
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:27,910
(Laughing)

1774
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,880
That looks fun.
Look how fun that is.

1775
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,310
This is fun for some reason.

1776
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,680
(While Seok Sam is reconnecting
with his childhood)

1777
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,880
This is surprisingly fun.

1778
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,420
- Ye Eun, hurry!
- Hold on.

1779
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,450
(The other two teams compete.)

1780
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,590
- Can you please slow down?
- Hurry, Ye Eun!

1781
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,060
Ye Eun, move it!

1782
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,460
Get up!

1783
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,560
(Se Chan and Eunhyuk shoot ahead.)

1784
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,730
- What... Get up!
- Hold on.

1785
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:46,360
(The shoe worth 25 coins
is worthless.)

1786
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,500
Hurry!

1787
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,230
Now's the time.

1788
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,970
Over there. We need to get up there.

1789
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:52,870
(They have a clear path
to the rope.)

1790
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:54,570
Come on. Get up already.

1791
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,970
We need to stop them. Hurry.

1792
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,710
One, two.

1793
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,010
(Ddochi finally comes
to her senses.)

1794
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,540
- One, two.
- One, two.

1795
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,140
(The two teams collide
at the slope.)

1796
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,050
- They're here.
- We need to get up there.

1797
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,120
- One, two.
- There goes Seok Jin.

1798
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,990
(A wildcat approaches from behind.)

1799
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:14,060
Let's try going up the other way.

1800
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,920
- We give up.
- You can go first.

1801
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,760
- Us?
- Someone's going to climb up.

1802
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,890
You go ahead first.

1803
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,530
- What?
- What just happened?

1804
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:26,000
(He slides down
after misplacing his foot.)

1805
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,800
- What was that?
- Seriously?

1806
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,140
- What was that?
- Come on.

1807
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,510
No one touched him.

1808
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:33,040
Come on. Is this Children's Day?

1809
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,140
- That's adorable.
- How adorable.

1810
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,450
Darn. I was almost there!

1811
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:40,250
And to think Seok Jin was born
in 1966.

1812
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,650
- Are you okay?
- He's 60.

1813
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,290
Let's rest for a bit.

1814
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,890
- Let's rest.
- What do you mean we'll rest?

1815
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,820
Let's rest for a bit.

1816
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,030
- Lie down on your back.
- On my back?

1817
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,630
- We'll do this.
- Like this.

1818
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,300
Seok Jin, wait.

1819
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:57,000
(That's when Seok Sam steals
Ye Eun's shoe.)

1820
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,570
- You weasel!
- Hold on.

1821
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,800
- He took her shoe.
- Why did he take her shoe?

1822
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,200
Seok Sam, that's mine.

1823
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,210
As if pleading
will get you anywhere in life.

1824
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,740
- The world is a cruel place.
- Dad!

1825
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:09,710
- Dad, please.
- Who's your dad?

1826
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:10,950
When did I become your parent?

1827
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,810
(The father and daughter duo
were only in it for the money.)

1828
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,680
Ye Eun, hang in there.

1829
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:16,850
(Right then,
Jae Seok gives it his all.)

1830
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,920
- Hurry.
- Give me a boost at the end.

1831
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,950
- Got it.
- All right.

1832
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,620
And... Now!

1833
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:24,230
- He grabbed it.
- He grabbed it.

1834
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:26,590
- And... Now!
- Let's not climb the wall.

1835
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,930
They won't make it up there.

1836
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:28,960
(They grab Ye Eun by the ankle.)

1837
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,270
You can't do this.

1838
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,370
There's no use grabbing the rope...

1839
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,170
because Ye Eun can't make it
up there anyway.

1840
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,600
Just leave her.

1841
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,500
- She can't get up there anyway.
- Please.

1842
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:37,770
We can leave her be.

1843
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,040
She can't get up there anyway.

1844
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:42,680
Seok Jin, you're so mean.

1845
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,550
- There you go. That's it.
- That's it.

1846
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:46,750
That's how you do it.

1847
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,780
Ye Eun.

1848
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,520
- Ye Eun, come up.
- I can't.

1849
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,190
You have to get up there
to be funny.

1850
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:55,490
Use this to climb up.

1851
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,090
(Eunhyuk makes an entrance.)

1852
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:58,930
Please help me out this once.

1853
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:00,130
Grab the rope.

1854
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:02,700
(Four are hanging
onto the red band.)

1855
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:05,370
The rope. Send down the rope.

1856
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,440
- Come on!
- Ye Eun, what are you doing?

1857
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,270
- Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun, get moving.

1858
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:10,470
What are you doing?

1859
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:12,040
(Panting and groaning)

1860
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,170
Ye Eun!

1861
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,510
This is like a movie.

1862
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,280
Isn't this a scene
from "The Himalayas?"

1863
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:18,750
This is like a movie.

1864
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,250
- This is a movie.
- Yes, "The Himalayas."

1865
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,650
That's the snow-covered Himalayas.

1866
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:24,320
- Ye Eun, climb up.
- I can't!

1867
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,660
(Climber Ji Ye Eun
is completely drained.)

1868
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,020
(Captain Yu is beginning
to lose his temper.)

1869
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:31,560
(Chuckling)

1870
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,590
Ye Eun!

1871
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,560
(Screaming)

1872
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,700
Seok Jin might make a play.

1873
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,430
- You need to run up there.
- Step on them.

1874
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:39,500
Step on them.

1875
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,270
- What's with the towel?
- Why does he need a towel?

1876
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:43,570
- What now?
- What's he doing with that?

1877
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,570
- What are you getting at?
- Why does he need that?

1878
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:46,940
To climb up while holding that?

1879
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,280
(Climbing the safety bar
with a towel dripping in soap)

1880
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,740
What on earth is that?

1881
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,550
Check out his behind!

1882
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:52,950
What on earth is that?

1883
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,920
I can believe
Jae Seok's still holding out.

1884
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,090
- I'm exhausted.
- Jae Seok's still holding on.

1885
00:56:58,490 --> 00:56:59,690
- I'm too exhausted.
- Ye Eun, hurry.

1886
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:01,560
- This won't snap, will it?
- It won't.

1887
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,060
Ye Eun!

1888
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,730
Eunhyuk, you need to grab that.

1889
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,200
- Jump and grab it.
- Se Chan.

1890
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,200
You have to jump or you'll fall.

1891
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:12,370
That's it. There you go. We're good.

1892
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:15,700
Why you...

1893
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,910
(Whimpering)

1894
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:18,170
Jae Seok's slipping down.

1895
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,210
(Are Jae Seok's hands
starting to give out?)

1896
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:20,240
We're good.

1897
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,780
Ye Eun, hurry up here!

1898
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:27,320
(Will he end up slipping down?)

1899
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,250
(He drops.)

1900
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,720
(Captain Yu is forced
down the hill.)

1901
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,120
- Ye Eun, are you kidding me?
- Is it over?

1902
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,330
I told you not to give up
and climb up the hill.

1903
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,660
I couldn't...

1904
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,990
Please.

1905
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:43,400
(Right then, the veteran mountaineer
climbs the unconquered slope.)

1906
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,470
Seok Jin.

1907
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,630
(Shouting)

1908
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:48,500
- Seok Jin.
- Hey.

1909
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,870
- Let's wait until he's tired.
- Gosh, it's slippery.

1910
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,240
I almost had the rope.

1911
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,270
- Seok Jin, wait.
- It's slippery.

1912
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:54,780
- Come back up from the bottom.
- Go and take a break.

1913
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,810
Seok Jin, go and get some rest.

1914
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,610
- Take a break.
- Relax.

1915
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,210
- Get some rest.
- He's so adorable.

1916
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,720
Take a break.

1917
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,380
- I'm a fan.
- "I'm a fan."

1918
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,450
Let's hurry.

1919
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,260
- I got it.
- Ye Eun, you have to go up.

1920
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,060
- I got it. Hurry up.
- All right.

1921
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,390
- Go up.
- You have to come up!

1922
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:11,960
- Eunhyuk.
- Go up now.

1923
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,230
- Hurry, Ye Eun.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1924
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:14,230
Wait, why are you over here?

1925
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:15,300
Just let Ye Eun go up.

1926
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,500
- Let me go up.
- Just Ye Eun.

1927
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,300
Hey, my pants.

1928
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,670
- Just let Ye Eun go.
- My pants!

1929
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,800
(Yelling)

1930
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,610
(The red rope is
in a dangerous spot.)

1931
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:26,980
Hey, are you okay, Se Chan?

1932
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,040
(Se Chan's private parts are
walking on a dangerous tightrope.)

1933
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,010
Ye Eun, hurry and get up there.

1934
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,620
- Ye Eun, grab the rope.
- Jae Seok, you can't let her.

1935
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,220
- Hurry up and grab the rope.
- Se Chan, please.

1936
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,790
- They're all the way up.
- They got it.

1937
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:39,520
- You got it.
- There. You could kick them.

1938
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,960
(Will Eunhyuk climb up first
just like that?)

1939
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,690
(They got to the top!)

1940
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,930
- They did it.
- Take the name tags off.

1941
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,800
- The name tag.
- Ye Eun, hurry up and climb.

1942
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,500
- We're in first place.
- We're almost there.

1943
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,970
(They will get 1st place if they stick
their name tags on the wall.)

1944
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,900
- Okay.
- Eunhyuk, come here.

1945
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,900
Hey!

1946
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,310
(The 86 Tigers get 1st place.)

1947
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:00,310
My goodness.

1948
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:02,710
- Hey, they did it.
- One team finished.

1949
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:03,710
You can get second place.

1950
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,880
(I'll help you for five coins.)

1951
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,280
(He starts trying to earn coins
right away.)

1952
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,280
We have to get up.

1953
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,490
Seok Jin, I'll take five coins.

1954
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,260
I'll help... Okay, for five coins.

1955
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,590
Why does he keep grabbing the towel?

1956
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:17,130
What is that towel for?

1957
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:19,660
- What's up with the towel?
- Why is he taking the towel?

1958
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,660
What does that mean?

1959
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,160
Why is he so obsessed with it?

1960
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,870
- Hey, Eunhyuk.
- Yes.

1961
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,400
- Come here, Seok Jin.
- I'll give you five coins.

1962
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,400
- All right.
- Okay.

1963
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,970
- He can't get it.
- The towel?

1964
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,070
- Hey, you go down.
- Okay.

1965
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,510
- Ye Eun, this is...
- What is that?

1966
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:36,510
- You owe us 5 coins.
- Okay, 5 coins.

1967
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:37,510
Come up.

1968
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:40,720
(Shouting)

1969
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,050
- Just let him go.
- I'll give you ten!

1970
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,250
- Hurry up and grab him.
- Ten.

1971
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,750
Seok Jin, step on him and go up!

1972
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,220
You should go up first.

1973
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,890
- Will I be able to go up?
- I can only go up if you do.

1974
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:49,960
Step on my shoulders.

1975
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,660
This way. Seok Jin,
grab this and this at the same time.

1976
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,430
I mean... Seok Jin.

1977
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,200
Seok Jin.

1978
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,070
All right. Go up. Here.

1979
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:03,170
- Hurry up.
- Jae Seok.

1980
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,810
- Hurry. You have to go!
- No, you should...

1981
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,210
- Just hurry up and do it!
- pull me up.

1982
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:07,680
- Just pull me up.
- Hurry!

1983
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,540
Hurry and go up.

1984
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,450
- Go up. Step on me.
- But you could...

1985
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:13,010
I told you to hurry
and get up there.

1986
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:14,050
- Hurry.
- Just...

1987
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,520
Hey, Seok Jin is going up.

1988
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:18,750
- Hurry. We'll lose to Seok Jin.
- But I can't...

1989
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:19,790
Seok Jin, you owe us ten coins.

1990
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,590
- Seok Jin, ten coins?
- They're almost there.

1991
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:23,660
(Ye Eun just has to stretch out
her hand to grab the rope too.)

1992
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,690
Pull yourself together. Stand up!

1993
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:28,800
- No, I can't go up.
- Gosh, Ji Ye Eun! Seriously?

1994
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,700
Seok Jin, you owe us ten, right?

1995
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,230
(Mountaineer Jee successfully climbs
the slope with 2 Sherpas.)

1996
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,430
Hey, Seok Jin!

1997
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,440
- Let's go.
- I put it on.

1998
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,910
- Okay!
- Okay.

1999
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,110
(Jae Seok and Ye Eun
are in last place.)

2000
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:42,240
Why won't you do anything?

2001
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:45,350
All you do is eat all the time!

2002
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,320
What in the world are you doing?

2003
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,620
- Don't get mad, Jae Seok!
- "All you do is eat."

2004
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,250
- Ye Eun!
- It's so hard.

2005
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:56,260
Gosh, Ji Ye Eun!
You should at least try to climb up!

2006
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,290
But I couldn't go up.

2007
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:01,030
I did my best too.

2008
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,870
Hey, this game is
just set up against me!

2009
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:05,970
- It's short, right?
- Teams A, B, and C.

2010
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:07,900
Please stand here.

2011
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,510
(Connect)

2012
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:12,140
(Haha's purchase connected
Jong Kook and Kyu Hyun together.)

2013
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:14,310
What? No, the length is...

2014
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:16,040
- Oh, did you buy the shoe too?
- Yes.

2015
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,610
Gosh, you've got all sorts of items.

2016
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,510
- What? Why?
- He even bought a shoe.

2017
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:21,150
(Leeteuk paid a whopping 21 coins
to connect Team Haha.)

2018
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:24,020
- Haha, we'll stop them, right?
- Of course.

2019
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:26,290
Leeteuk, you have to run
as soon as it starts.

2020
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:27,390
Yes, you're right.

2021
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:30,260
Okay, let's do this. Hey, Kyu Hyun.
We can do this!

2022
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,060
They're free to move over there.

2023
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:33,560
Oh, you're right.

2024
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,530
Okay, ready.

2025
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,100
(Round 2 begins.)

2026
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,740
- They're free to move.
- You can do it!

2027
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:43,270
They're free to move.

2028
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:45,510
Slowly. Okay.

2029
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:47,510
- They're not tied together.
- Oh, my.

2030
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:52,110
(Roaring)

2031
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,150
Hey.

2032
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,190
(Teleported)

2033
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:59,650
- He looks like a frozen tuna.
- Oh, no.

2034
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:01,960
(A quick delivery like with tuna)

2035
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,330
Hey, what's wrong with you?

2036
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:05,760
Hey.

2037
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,260
(The red tuna tumble down
all in a row as well.)

2038
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,040
- Hang on.
- Gosh, that was no joke.

2039
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,900
- It's so slippery!
- Let's go.

2040
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,570
Hey, what kind of game is this?
My goodness.

2041
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,310
- Hey, get them!
- They're going up.

2042
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,610
- Go up.
- Come on.

2043
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:22,780
We have to go up.

2044
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,280
(They move quickly
to try to catch Team Jong Kook.)

2045
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,050
- Get them.
- Get them.

2046
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,050
Who is it?
(Right then)

2047
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:29,120
(Leeteuk grabs hold
of Jong Kook's leg.)

2048
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,020
- Hey, they're going at it.
- Grab the other side.

2049
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:32,520
- Get him.
- Grab his leg.

2050
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,560
- All right.
- Drag him away.

2051
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:37,020
- Come here.
- It's like bobsleigh.

2052
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:39,190
- It's wild.
- They'll never be able to do it.

2053
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,560
They can't do anything
if Jong Kook grabs them.

2054
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:43,630
Come on.

2055
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,500
(The 5 toys in Jong Kook's hands)

2056
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:50,540
- Come on.
- Hey! Let me go!

2057
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:53,040
(One after the other)

2058
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:54,240
(A miracle where one man
pulls down five people)

2059
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,880
- Look at that.
- They can't do anything.

2060
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,880
(A miracle where one man
pulls down five people)

2061
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,880
(Happy)

2062
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,350
(Thoroughly enjoying this)

2063
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:01,450
- Okay!
- Gosh, this guy...

2064
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:04,320
- Gosh, this guy is seriously...
- He's just having fun right now!

2065
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:06,090
(Smacking)

2066
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,820
I mean... Hey, run!

2067
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,530
Ji Hyo, this is your chance! Go!

2068
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:13,530
Get her.

2069
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,060
Gosh, Jong Kook!

2070
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,030
(She tries to climb the slope
right away.)

2071
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,300
(Jong Kook would never
go easy on her.)

2072
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,770
- You have to get him.
- Leeteuk.

2073
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:24,910
Hey, it's so slippery.

2074
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:26,270
- You have to get him.
- Leeteuk.

2075
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:28,710
(He grabbed the rope in one try!)

2076
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,340
- What?
- Hey, he got up.

2077
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,950
- Oh, Leeteuk.
- Leeteuk got up there.

2078
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:34,050
- Leeteuk is strong too.
- My goodness.

2079
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:37,720
(Will he successfully get away from
Jong Kook and climb the slope?)

2080
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,160
- What's this?
- Hey, Leeteuk! You're fast.

2081
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,490
(He got up in one try!)

2082
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:43,960
(It's the truly strong Leeteuk,
not the one who just acts tough.)

2083
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,360
You should help Ji Hyo now.

2084
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:48,060
What's this?

2085
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,230
- Ji Hyo!
- It's okay.

2086
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,770
- Hey, stop Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo, come here.

2087
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:51,970
(He just needs his teammate Ji Hyo
to climb up.)

2088
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:53,770
- Hey, stop Ji Hyo.
- Get Ji Hyo.

2089
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,970
- Form an alliance!
- Get her off!

2090
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:57,640
- That's it.
- Hey, go away.

2091
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:59,210
Go away.

2092
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:02,180
- Ji Hyo! Show them what you've got!
- Grab her.

2093
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:05,010
- Look at that.
- Leeteuk, help her out.

2094
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,880
- You have to help Ji Hyo.
- Pull her up.

2095
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,150
Help Ji Hyo.

2096
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:10,180
Ji Hyo! I'm coming!

2097
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:12,850
- I'm coming from behind!
- Hey, grab her.

2098
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:14,490
(He attacks from behind
to try to help Ji Hyo.)

2099
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:16,220
Hey, grab her.

2100
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:20,130
(They won't budge at all.)

2101
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,200
My gosh.

2102
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,100
(Pushing)

2103
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,000
(He looks like a cat
kneading dough.)

2104
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,900
(Leeteuk was in such a hurry that
he didn't even put his name tag up.)

2105
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,970
Come on.

2106
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:32,170
(Right then)

2107
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:33,510
(Tearing)

2108
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,880
- My name tag! No!
- Tear it off!

2109
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,880
(He tore off Jong Kook's name tag?)

2110
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,510
My name tag! No!

2111
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:39,510
- My name tag.
- Tear it off.

2112
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:40,550
(The vibe of someone with 20 years
of experience on variety shows)

2113
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:41,780
Okay!

2114
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,250
(He gets rid of
Jong Kook's name tag.)

2115
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,720
Hey, it's a war of name tags.

2116
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,850
- My name tag.
- Tear it off. Okay!

2117
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:49,490
(Jong Kook is furious
over the name tag provocation.)

2118
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:51,690
- Wait.
- I can't...

2119
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:52,690
(Holding on tight)

2120
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:53,860
(Holding tight on this side as well)

2121
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,700
- Hey, be careful.
- Watch out.

2122
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,270
- Hey, no.
- Watch out.

2123
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:58,330
(Let's all go down together.)

2124
01:04:58,330 --> 01:04:59,770
They're all going down together.

2125
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:00,970
(They set off to find his name tag.)

2126
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,510
(The 2nd time sliding down in a row)

2127
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,910
(Jong Kook grabs his name tag
right away.)

2128
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:09,780
Hang on. Gosh, it hurts so much.

2129
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:12,450
(Haha's name tag is out.)

2130
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,450
I mean...

2131
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,820
(Ji Hyo's name tag is out.)

2132
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:17,150
Ji Hyo, your name tag.

2133
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:18,750
- No, it's over there.
- Where did it go?

2134
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:19,750
- What? Where?
- Here on the ground.

2135
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,260
- Find it.
- Be careful.

2136
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:23,790
They're going up.

2137
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,190
- Hurry up.
- They're going up.

2138
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,690
(Jong Kook tucks his name tag
into a private place.)

2139
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:31,130
- You have to run.
- Kyu Hyun, jump! Grab the rope!

2140
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,700
- Grab it.
- They got it.

2141
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,840
He got it. He's up. Hey.

2142
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:38,870
- That's it.
- He got it.

2143
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:41,810
(Jong Kook gets caught
by Leeteuk again.)

2144
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:43,180
- Grab him tight.
- Who is this?

2145
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:44,710
- Get that team.
- No, Ji Hyo.

2146
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:46,050
- Over here.
- I got him.

2147
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:47,050
- No, this side.
- Here.

2148
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:49,520
- It's not me.
- Hey.

2149
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,120
- It's not here.
- It's on the floor.

2150
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,750
(The rope is taut.)

2151
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,090
- Where is it?
- Be careful.

2152
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,260
Hey, it might snap. Be careful.

2153
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:02,400
I'll get you. I pulled him down.

2154
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,400
(He can't hold on
and ends up falling.)

2155
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,300
- Step on me and go up.
- Gosh, I'm so tired.

2156
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,530
Once more.

2157
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:07,540
Yes, go.

2158
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,540
(Haha takes this chance
to go up the side.)

2159
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,340
- Once more.
- Did you get it?

2160
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:13,210
Oh, look over there.
They might turn the tables.

2161
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:15,810
Try to hold on. I'll go.

2162
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,910
- Let me go up.
- Haha, climb up on my elbow.

2163
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:19,410
And shoulders. Climb up on me.

2164
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:21,580
- There they go.
- My gosh.

2165
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,690
- And go.
- I got it.

2166
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,250
- Did you get up?
- I got it.

2167
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,590
(Jong Kook grabbed the rope too.)

2168
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:31,960
Who's behind me?

2169
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:32,960
Who is it?

2170
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,600
- Hey, behind me... Who is that?
- Push me up.

2171
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:40,130
(An unexpected opponent appears.)

2172
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,800
(Ji Hyo climbs easily
up the human ladder.)

2173
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,970
- Who is it?
- I don't know. Who is it?

2174
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,510
Oh, she's going up so well.
It's Ji Hyo.

2175
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:48,810
Ji Hyo is going up so well.

2176
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:51,650
- That's it. See that?
- Ji Hyo is going up.

2177
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,880
Ye Eun,
that's what you should've done!

2178
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,880
(The vibe of the woman who's been
on Running Man for 15 years)

2179
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:00,690
(Even the staff are surprised
by Ji Hyo's feisty climb.)

2180
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:04,890
I got her!

2181
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,430
- I got her!
- Ji Hyo, let's go together.

2182
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:07,730
- Haha, go up!
- Okay?

2183
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,800
Haha, go!

2184
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,000
- Ji Hyo, please. Hurry.
- Haha, go.

2185
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,140
(Ji Hyo arrives at the top!)

2186
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,670
Ji Hyo, get your name tag up.
Quickly.

2187
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,080
She did it.

2188
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,410
Hey, even Jong Kook can't do it.

2189
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:27,010
- That's right. Ji Hyo is indeed...
- She's different.

2190
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,480
Now, Leeteuk just has to
put his name tag up.

2191
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,120
- Even if you grab the rope...
- Let's go.

2192
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,520
- You can't do that.
- No.

2193
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,890
- That doesn't count.
- Go up.

2194
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:37,530
- Just come up!
- You have to go up.

2195
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:38,590
Grab the rope and come up.

2196
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,460
- Jong Kook is tired too.
- That's cute.

2197
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:43,100
It's hard
when you're wearing a band.

2198
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,970
The band doesn't go that far.

2199
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:46,430
Haha, please lie down once.

2200
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:47,870
- Hold on.
- Please lie down once.

2201
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:48,970
Do you want me to lie down?

2202
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:50,070
- Hold on.
- I'll help you.

2203
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:55,180
(Kyu Hyun grabs the rope
instead of the exhausted Jong Kook!)

2204
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,340
I'll help you.

2205
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,650
No.

2206
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:58,750
Leeteuk!

2207
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,110
(If Team Jong Kook comes up 1st,
they'll lose 1st place.)

2208
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:03,520
(Jong Kook grabs Kyu Hyun's legs.)

2209
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,890
No.

2210
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:07,490
The band.

2211
01:08:07,490 --> 01:08:08,560
(Leeteuk goes for Jong Kook's foot.)

2212
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,760
Leeteuk, now is your chance.

2213
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,090
- The band.
- All set.

2214
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,600
(He misses!)

2215
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,560
- Team Jong Kook arrived first.
- What happened?

2216
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,300
No. Hold on.

2217
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,070
(Now, they just need to put
their name tags up.)

2218
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:21,500
No.

2219
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:22,670
(Ripping)

2220
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:25,010
(Kyu Hyun)

2221
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:27,240
- I won't do it.
- My goodness.

2222
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

2223
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,640
(Team Jong Kook placed 1st.)

2224
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:30,640
I'm exhausted.

2225
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,210
- My shoulder.
- Good.

2226
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:34,080
- Good.
- My shoulder. There you go.

2227
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,380
- Okay. Go.
- Good luck.

2228
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:36,550
Stretch your arms.

2229
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,290
- That's right. Go up.
- It nearly worked.

2230
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:39,690
- Hold on.
- Haha.

2231
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:40,720
Haha, you need to come.

2232
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:41,990
- Here.
- Step on me.

2233
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,990
(Meanwhile, Leeteuk)

2234
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:46,390
It came off. There you go.

2235
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,830
(He grabs the rope!)

2236
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:49,860
Grab me and go up.

2237
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:51,000
(Which team
will reach the top first?)

2238
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,500
- Go up.
- Leeteuk, go.

2239
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,270
- Leeteuk went up.
- He's here.

2240
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:56,470
I'm here.

2241
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,310
Okay.

2242
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:01,480
- Team Jong Kook placed 1st.
- We placed 1st.

2243
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,910
- How did you guys climb up here?
- Team Ji Hyo placed second.

2244
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:05,250
How did you guys climb up here?

2245
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,050
They're the true winners.

2246
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,380
You guys didn't even grab the rope.

2247
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,990
- How did you guys climb up here?
- Seriously.

2248
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:13,050
He stepped on me to climb up.

2249
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,260
- I know.
- I know.

2250
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:16,220
More than I thought,

2251
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:18,060
- He's sturdy.
- he has many spots to step on.

2252
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,590
I got stepped on.

2253
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,760
Thus, the teams that placed first
in the groups...

2254
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,100
are Team Se Chan and Eunhyuk...

2255
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,300
and Team Jong Kook and Kyu Hyun.

2256
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,640
- They'll get 40 coins each.
- Nice.

2257
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,170
Team Ji Hyo and Leeteuk...

2258
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:32,470
will get a total of 40 coins...

2259
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:34,680
due to ten bonus coins
for having a female member.

2260
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,740
- Nice.
- Seok Jin will get 30 coins alone.

2261
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:37,910
(Seok Jin will get 30 coins
for himself since he played alone.)

2262
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:39,650
We should've placed second
at the very least.

2263
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,480
- The teams that placed last,
- He's a lot of work.

2264
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,820
Team Jae Seok and Ye Eun
and Team Haha and Daniel...

2265
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:46,820
will get ten coins each.

2266
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:53,560
Jae Seok.

2267
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,730
- For goodness' sake.
- Seriously.

2268
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:56,060
- Right now...
- Be careful when you go down.

2269
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:57,460
- For goodness' sake.
- I...

2270
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:59,370
- This is a bit...
- Will we have a quiz?

2271
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:01,240
- A quiz for the empty heads?
- It looks like we'll have a quiz.

2272
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,440
We'll rise.

2273
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,700
Let's rise through this.

2274
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:05,270
For your information,

2275
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:07,610
only the last bet remains.

2276
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:09,980
I told you
that R coins were important today.

2277
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:11,310
- Yes.
- Thus, the winner...

2278
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:13,350
with the most R coins...

2279
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:14,780
will get a gold ring.

2280
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,250
He or she will automatically be
the winner.

2281
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,280
- That's incredible.
- Let's go.

2282
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,350
Among the top-ranking members,

2283
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,360
one who is picked at random...

2284
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,820
will win a gold ring.

2285
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,120
- That's a good deal.
- Seriously.

2286
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,530
Among the bottom-ranking members,

2287
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:28,030
three will receive a penalty.

2288
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:29,830
- I'll announce the number of coins.
- Okay.

2289
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,530
Leeteuk has 61.

2290
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:35,200
(Leeteuk, 61 R coins)

2291
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:36,540
Leeteuk?

2292
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:37,840
That makes sense.

2293
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:39,740
You took many coins from eating.

2294
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:42,580
Eunhyuk has 58.

2295
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:44,040
Gosh, Kyu Hyun and Se Chan have 52.

2296
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,250
How does everyone have
so many coins?

2297
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,980
- They didn't use them.
- Jong Kook has 48.

2298
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:49,220
- Everyone has so many coins.
- Daniel has 32.

2299
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,320
Jae Seok has 31.

2300
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:53,820
Haha has 30.

2301
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,660
Ye Eun has nine.

2302
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,890
- I played the games so diligently.
- When did you do that?

2303
01:10:57,890 --> 01:10:59,190
Ye Eun, are you collecting
the coins?

2304
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:00,560
It's because I bought the shoes.

2305
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:01,830
- Nine.
- Get real.

2306
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,500
- Ye Eun, why are you so poor?
- Nine.

2307
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,730
Ye Eun keeps saying...

2308
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:08,170
that she doesn't live up
to her potential...

2309
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:10,240
despite having the strength.

2310
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,910
I saw her for the first time today.

2311
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,910
- She isn't a tenacious type.
- Exactly.

2312
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:14,980
She might not have much strength.

2313
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,280
What do you know about me
when you've only met me today?

2314
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,550
(What do you know about me
when you've only met me today?)

2315
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:20,010
You've only met her today.

2316
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:22,420
Ye Eun just has a big appetite.

2317
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:24,390
She's from the Chungju Ji Clan.

2318
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:26,720
Now comes the last mission
to turn the tables,

2319
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,690
the Odd or Even Miracle.

2320
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:30,760
You'll place bets
using the R coins you own.

2321
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,760
If you succeed in betting,

2322
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,630
- you'll win R coins.
- That sounds nice.

2323
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:37,700
- You'll be divided into two groups.
- Okay.

2324
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,470
Group 1 will place a bet 1st.

2325
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:44,200
The first betting round is
the Odd or Even Get Up.

2326
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,010
The six of them
will either sit down or stand up...

2327
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:48,580
on a mark.

2328
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:49,740
It's like the Game of Wits.

2329
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:51,480
The members of the betting group...

2330
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:54,550
will make a bet on whether or not
the number of the standing ones...

2331
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:56,880
will be odd or even.

2332
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,720
- They can also bet...
- It'll be so hard.

2333
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,250
- on the exact number.
- It'll be hard.

2334
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,620
- If you guess either odd or even,
- But it'll be fun.

2335
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,720
- your coins will be doubled.
- It'll be fun.

2336
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,390
(If you guess either odd or even,
your coins will be doubled.)

2337
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:07,130
- You guess?
- I'm good at such games.

2338
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:09,230
- I love such games.
- If you guess the exact number,

2339
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:11,870
- your coins will be quintupled.
- Quintupled?

2340
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,570
- This is fun.
- You need to guess...

2341
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:14,900
- the exact number.
- The exact number?

2342
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:16,640
- Will our coins be quintupled then?
- Quintupled. That's insane.

2343
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:19,640
Hey, Seok Jin began to smile.

2344
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:21,980
- Seok Jin loves it.
- This is so much fun.

2345
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,240
It's what Seok Jin likes.

2346
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,950
Okay. How many rounds will there be?

2347
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:26,680
- To divide up the coins...
- You'll play three rounds.

2348
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,320
- Three rounds?
- Three rounds?

2349
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:29,920
- Three rounds.
- This will be so hard.

2350
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,050
In the last round,

2351
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:32,620
I'll bet all the coins.

2352
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,490
This is up to luck.

2353
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:38,160
Statistically speaking,
guessing odd or even is better.

2354
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:40,790
Shall I go
with the number of people or...

2355
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:42,630
Shall I go
with the number of people?

2356
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:44,500
- I don't know.
- The number of people.

2357
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:46,170
The number of people is
the way to go.

2358
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:48,040
(They need to guess the number
of people who'll stand up.)

2359
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,540
- What will you do?
- This is my specialty.

2360
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,140
- Zero or even.
- Zero?

2361
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:53,340
Zero is an odd number!

2362
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,640
(Zero is an odd number!)

2363
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,710
- It's even.
- The meeting is over.

2364
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:57,440
Zero is odd, right?

2365
01:12:57,710 --> 01:12:59,080
- Zero is even.
- Even.

2366
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,350
- Even.
- Is it even?

2367
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:02,250
How is zero odd?

2368
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,250
I'm sorry.

2369
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:04,890
It can't be even.

2370
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:06,620
- I'll get up.
- You know my style.

2371
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:08,690
- I want to keep sitting down.
- Yes.

2372
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:10,190
It'll be hard to guess
the number of people.

2373
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:11,690
Don't be confused.
I'll remain seated.

2374
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:12,830
He's trying to buy them off.

2375
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:14,260
- Will you sit down or get up?
- He's a salesman.

2376
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:15,330
I'll sit down.

2377
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:16,560
- Good.
- Thank you.

2378
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,600
Keep it a secret.
Don't let them hear you.

2379
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,670
He said that he'd sit down.

2380
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:19,700
He's trying to buy them off.

2381
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:20,800
He's a salesman.

2382
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,170
- He'll just lose six coins.
- Yes.

2383
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,440
Why is he doing that?

2384
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,770
Does he really think
that they'll listen?

2385
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:26,340
- Trust me.
- He's falling for it.

2386
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,910
(Seok Jin proceeds with his plan.)

2387
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,810
Will you sit down or stand up?

2388
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,040
- I'll sit down.
- You'll sit down?

2389
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,110
(Ji Hyo: Sit down)

2390
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:33,280
- Will you sit down or stand up?
- I'll stand up.

2391
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,480
- What? You'll stand up.
- I'll stand up.

2392
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,950
(Leeteuk: Stand up)

2393
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:37,180
- Will you sit down or stand up?
- I'll stand up.

2394
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,250
- You'll stand up.
- He'll lose his coins.

2395
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:39,490
- Three.
- He'll just lose six coins.

2396
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,990
- Will you sit down or stand up?
- I'll stand up.

2397
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:42,490
- Will you stand up? Okay.
- Yes.

2398
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:45,460
- Please keep your promise.
- Okay.

2399
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,090
- I'll keep my promise.
- Okay.

2400
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:49,500
It'll be funny if we do the opposite
and you still guess correctly.

2401
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,170
- Seriously.
- My goodness.

2402
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:52,300
I trust you guys.

2403
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,070
- Still...
- I trust you guys.

2404
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:56,940
Seok Jin has been falling
for that trick for 15 years.

2405
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:00,070
He has remained the same
in the past 15 years.

2406
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:02,610
- Fifteen years.
- Fifteen years, you punk.

2407
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:06,180
I was going to bet ten coins.

2408
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,850
I'll bet half of them.

2409
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:10,480
- I'll keep my promise. Seriously.
- Okay.

2410
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:11,920
Let's get this right.

2411
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:13,220
Please write it down.

2412
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,220
One shot.

2413
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,260
I'll bet five coins.

2414
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:16,890
- The exact number will be hard.
- I went with the exact number.

2415
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,230
Odd or even...

2416
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:19,230
(10 coins)

2417
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:21,930
(Se Chan bets 10 coins.)

2418
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:23,060
I'll bet ten coins.

2419
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:24,500
(Jae Seok and Se Chan bet 10 coins.)

2420
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:26,370
Twenty?

2421
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:28,500
You're giving it your all.

2422
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,500
- I don't have that many coins.
- It's the 20th anniversary.

2423
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:32,110
- You're right.
- It's the 20th anniversary.

2424
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:33,310
Can I give her some coins?

2425
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:35,680
Listen. If you do as you promised,

2426
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,710
(Seok Jin's order:
4 people standing up)

2427
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:38,380
- I'll give two more coins.
- I'm sorry,

2428
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:40,250
but was I supposed to stand up
or sit down?

2429
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:41,380
For goodness' sake.

2430
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,050
(Haha already forgot his order.)

2431
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:45,520
- You need to sit down.
- Okay.

2432
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:46,950
You need to stand up.

2433
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,090
- You need to sit down.
- The number of coins...

2434
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:49,590
You need to sit down,
stand up, and stand up.

2435
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:51,590
I was supposed to stand up.

2436
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:53,190
- No, you were supposed to sit down.
- Sit down?

2437
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,700
- I'm getting confused.
- I mean...

2438
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,470
(Leeteuk said that he'd stand up.)

2439
01:14:58,870 --> 01:14:59,970
I mean...

2440
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:01,540
He does what he wants.

2441
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,400
- Why did he ask anyway?
- He's gaslighting us.

2442
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:04,770
I'll give you two more coins each
if I get this right.

2443
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:06,670
Two more coins?
He'll give us two more coins each.

2444
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:08,540
I want to help Seok Jin this time.

2445
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:09,540
Shall we do that?
Me too.

2446
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,050
(Moved)

2447
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,110
The exact number will be hard.

2448
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:15,180
I went with the exact number.

2449
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,420
Don't change your answer.

2450
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:17,520
We'll do what we promised.

2451
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,720
(Thinking)

2452
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:20,990
Three rounds, right?

2453
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:23,260
(5 times the bet
for the exact number: 3 people)

2454
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:26,090
(Jae Seok reads the room
and writes down 3.)

2455
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:27,490
(Stand up, stand up, stand up)

2456
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,000
I really hope this works.

2457
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:30,060
- Go ahead.
- Not yet.

2458
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,300
(If they do as promised,
Jae Seok will succeed in a bet.)

2459
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:32,670
I bet ten coins.

2460
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:34,330
People who'll stand up...

2461
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:36,870
My legs hurt.

2462
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:37,910
Be quiet.

2463
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:40,170
(Eunhyuk uses his hunch
to bet on the number of people.)

2464
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:41,910
- Did you write it down?
- Yes.

2465
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:43,180
The number of people?

2466
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,540
You're something else.

2467
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:45,910
I'll go with the number of people.

2468
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:47,410
(Ye Eun has nothing to rely on
but a big break.)

2469
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,650
There are six people.

2470
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:51,720
(2 times the bet
for odd or even: Even)

2471
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,520
(Se Chan chooses odd or even
for the bigger possibility.)

2472
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,690
Did Ye Eun bet all of her coins?

2473
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:56,960
On the count of three, stand up...

2474
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,390
- or sit down.
- Okay.

2475
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:00,360
- One,
- What did I promise to do?

2476
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,460
- two, three.
- I...

2477
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,000
(Seok Jin used 6 coins
to plan for this round.)

2478
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,070
Please.

2479
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:08,170
(Jae Seok used his hunch
to bet on 3 people.)

2480
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:10,170
- One,
- What did I promise to do?

2481
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:11,510
- two,
- I...

2482
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,710
three.

2483
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:14,570
Hey, you were supposed to stand up.

2484
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,910
- You were supposed to stand up.
- Three.

2485
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:18,780
(Seok Jin's order: Jong Kook,
Kyu Hyun, and Daniel, stand up.)

2486
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:21,850
(Everyone kept their promise
with Seok Jin.)

2487
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:23,550
(Jae Seok succeeded in his bet
on the number of people.)

2488
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:25,120
- That's insane.
- Three people. Five times.

2489
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,790
You'll receive 50 coins.

2490
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,760
- Tell us.
- I did it.

2491
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:30,290
Seok Jin, what did you write?

2492
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,730
- To receive two more coins... Why?
- Why?

2493
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:33,790
Hey, Leeteuk.

2494
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:35,160
- You told me to sit down.
- You told him to sit down.

2495
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,800
- To receive two more coins... Why?
- Why?

2496
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:39,570
- Why?
- Why?

2497
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:41,340
Hey, Leeteuk.

2498
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:43,000
- You told me to sit down.
- You told him to sit down.

2499
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,710
When I told you that I'd stand up,

2500
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:46,140
- you told me to sit down.
- You told him to sit down.

2501
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,080
Really?

2502
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,480
You told me to sit down.

2503
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:53,450
(He definitely told Leeteuk
to sit down.)

2504
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:54,480
Why did you do that?

2505
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,880
I did it.

2506
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,520
Ji Hyo was supposed to stand up.

2507
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,050
I told you from the start
that I'd sit down.

2508
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:03,320
Will you sit down or stand up?

2509
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,360
- I'll sit down.
- You'll sit down?

2510
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:06,860
You asked each one of them.

2511
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,760
(Unsure)

2512
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,230
- You expected me to betray you.
- He planned so much.

2513
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,630
- Why didn't he get it right?
- We told you.

2514
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:13,670
(No one fooled him,
but Seok Jin got fooled again.)

2515
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:16,440
Even after 3 to 4 tries...

2516
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,700
- You asked each one of them.
- It's your fault.

2517
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,110
You kept saying
that you were confused.

2518
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:21,380
I got confused as a result.

2519
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:22,410
(He failed to succeed in a bet
due to his poor memory.)

2520
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:23,640
Okay. I did it.

2521
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,050
- It's too bad.
- How many did you bet?

2522
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,110
- Hey.
- I kept my promise.

2523
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:27,650
- Four people.
- Four people is incorrect.

2524
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,020
- Seok Jin.
- Haha.

2525
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:30,450
Only Jae Seok's bet...

2526
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:32,520
- will be quintupled.
- Fifty coins.

2527
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:34,520
All right. Thank you.

2528
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,890
(His R coins got quintupled.)

2529
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,660
Jae Seok is so lucky.

2530
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:41,230
My goodness. Three people.

2531
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:43,300
Jae Seok is good.

2532
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:46,130
Place your bet for the second round.

2533
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:47,300
- I'll lend you one coin.
- Even if Ye Eun's coins...

2534
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,900
(Ye Eun only has 4 coins,
so Jae Seok lends her 1 coin.)

2535
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,640
- It was 20.
- All right.

2536
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,270
I can bet all the coins, right?

2537
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:54,140
(She bets all 5 coins.)

2538
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:55,710
I'll bet five coins this time.

2539
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:56,710
(Jae Seok plays it safe
and bets 5 coins.)

2540
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:57,880
This is fun.

2541
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,250
This is fun for us too.

2542
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,880
- We aren't just watching.
- It's a psychological game.

2543
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:04,950
Gosh, did he bet 30 coins?

2544
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:06,020
(Eunhyuk attempts to get
his big break again.)

2545
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:08,260
Seriously. You're good.

2546
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,690
I'll be ambitious.

2547
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,860
- Try again.
- Shall I try again?

2548
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:13,490
Try again. We'll help you.

2549
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:14,490
If you do as you did earlier,

2550
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:15,500
- I'll give 2 coins each.
- I'll bet 10 coins.

2551
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,900
Two more coins each.

2552
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:19,400
One, two, three.

2553
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:23,700
(4 members stand up.)

2554
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:26,240
- Really?
- You answered correctly.

2555
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,840
(He finally succeeded in a bet.)

2556
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:29,410
- Really?
- You answered correctly.

2557
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:31,010
Two people are incorrect.

2558
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,810
Ye Eun, three people are incorrect.

2559
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:35,250
It's over for Ye Eun.

2560
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:37,220
- Even is correct.
- It's correct.

2561
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,520
- My goodness. Thirty coins?
- He bet a lot of coins.

2562
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:41,320
- Of course.
- He bet so many coins.

2563
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,660
We get three rounds anyway.

2564
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,590
- Four people.
- Four people are...

2565
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:45,690
(Se Chan correctly guessed
the number of people.)

2566
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:47,590
- Did you write down 4?
- I wrote down 4.

2567
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,360
(He made a successful bet
without using tricks like Seok Jin.)

2568
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,530
- I wrote down four.
- How did you know?

2569
01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:51,630
- I did it.
- My goodness.

2570
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:54,630
Seriously, you're good.

2571
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:56,100
(R coins for the bet)

2572
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,400
Ten?

2573
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:00,640
I'll bet more coins
in the next round.

2574
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,340
- Thank you, everyone.
- You need to bet.

2575
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:03,910
- Give us coins. Two coins each.
- Give us coins.

2576
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:05,810
- Seok Jin, give us two coins each.
- That's right.

2577
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:07,050
I'll give you one coin each.

2578
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:08,720
- You promised 2 coins.
- You promised 2 coins.

2579
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:11,990
- Don't change your word.
- Don't change your word.

2580
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:13,950
- Keep your word for the next round.
- That's right.

2581
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:15,820
- We did it for two rounds.
- That's right.

2582
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:17,020
I almost changed my mind.

2583
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,560
- If I give you guys two coins each,
- Two coins each.

2584
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,730
I'll end up using
12 out of the 15 coins I earned.

2585
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,400
- Give us 1 coin each.
- Give us 1 coin each then.

2586
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,370
- Give us 1 coin each.
- Give us 1 coin each.

2587
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:28,270
- Give it to us.
- You should've earned more.

2588
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:29,700
(Taking)

2589
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,670
- It's over.
- I'll give it to you this round.

2590
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:33,610
- Give us 1 coin each.
- Give us 1 coin each.

2591
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,310
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up and give it to us.

2592
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:36,440
You have coins.

2593
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,740
Who wants to give me coins?

2594
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:40,750
- What are you doing?
- What?

2595
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:42,080
- What kind of a deal is that?
- What...

2596
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,420
- I mean...
- What was that?

2597
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:44,920
What's up with her confidence?

2598
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:47,750
I attended Korea National University
of Arts, so...

2599
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,120
- Seok Jin, will you give me coins?
- Milkshake?

2600
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:53,730
(Will he give a helping hand
to a Chungju Ji Clan member?)

2601
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:54,830
I need to pay them.

2602
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,200
Everyone is in debt.

2603
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,600
Chungju Ji and Jee Clan members
are in debt.

2604
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:00,900
I need to pay them.

2605
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,600
Right now, milkshake...

2606
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,440
- Seok Jin, why won't you pay me?
- Mister.

2607
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,110
(He pays 1 coin each
before they complain further.)

2608
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:08,480
- Mister.
- I promised to pay them.

2609
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,410
You're on a show.
You should clean your feet.

2610
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:12,510
I wiped my feet,
but foam keeps coming out.

2611
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:14,610
- All right. Let's bet 19 coins now.
- All right.

2612
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:16,450
Please give me two coins.

2613
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:17,550
(Begging)

2614
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:18,620
- Ye Eun.
- Yes?

2615
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:20,690
If I lend you two coins and you win,
will you pay me twice the number?

2616
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:21,760
- Of course.
- Four coins?

2617
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,820
- I'll give you four coins.
- Okay.

2618
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,860
- In that case...
- I'll give you four coins.

2619
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:26,590
- Four coins?
- Four coins? Okay.

2620
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:27,730
I'll give you four coins.

2621
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,300
- It's an investment.
- Four coins.

2622
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,960
You'll take a loss if you win.

2623
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,470
- Okay.
- Two coins.

2624
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:33,670
Do you mean it?

2625
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:34,900
Yes. How about one?

2626
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,140
I think Jae Seok will play it safe.

2627
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,340
He should go with odd or even now.

2628
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,310
This is the last round.

2629
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,480
- Don't leave coins behind.
- The last round?

2630
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,840
It's time to ask,
"Will you try to place first?"

2631
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,080
- Then you should take risks.
- That's right.

2632
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,210
- This is...
- High risk, high return.

2633
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:48,480
Go with odd or even this time.

2634
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,750
(The current number of R coins)

2635
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,380
What's this?
Won't you bet all the coins?

2636
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:54,020
If I correctly guess
the number of people...

2637
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:56,160
- The coins will be quintupled.
- The coins will be quintupled.

2638
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,690
Jae Seok is playing it safe.

2639
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:59,430
(He plays it safe
and bets 10 coins.)

2640
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,730
Will you leave coins behind?

2641
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,100
No, I won't.

2642
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,360
- In any case...
- The number of people.

2643
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:05,270
Gosh, this is...

2644
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:06,900
You either place first or last.

2645
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,470
Gosh, that's nice.

2646
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:11,710
- No.
- I shouldn't do this.

2647
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:13,570
- Hey, will you bet all 66 coins?
- He wrote 66.

2648
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:16,680
- Eunhyuk, you're so cool.
- I need a big break.

2649
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:18,580
Eunhyuk, have you always been
like this?

2650
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:20,350
He's the type
to squander his fortune.

2651
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:21,350
Seriously.

2652
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:23,950
I'm playing this game anyway.

2653
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:25,190
I either go up or down.

2654
01:21:25,190 --> 01:21:26,820
He bet 66 coins.

2655
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:29,390
- I need to dedicate myself.
- You're cool. You're really cool.

2656
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:30,760
- Life is all about probability.
- Sixty-six?

2657
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:33,360
Life is all about
getting a big break.

2658
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:35,360
I'll bet 80 coins.

2659
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,360
- What?
- Eighty coins?

2660
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,430
- I'll go all in.
- Really?

2661
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:39,330
(Since it's the last round,
the scale becomes much bigger.)

2662
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:40,600
He'll go with odd or even again.

2663
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,740
Eighty coins?

2664
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:44,400
It's meaningless
to leave any coins behind.

2665
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,310
I'll use them all...

2666
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:48,340
since they'll spin the wheel anyway
unless you place first.

2667
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:51,280
- You're bad at calculations.
- Seriously.

2668
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,280
- There's a safe way.
- Is it a mistake?

2669
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,380
You think you messed up
with your calculations.

2670
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:56,520
(The tiger moth didn't think about
placing last with 0 coins.)

2671
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:00,220
(In the end, he bets all the coins
except for 1.)

2672
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,320
He wrote it down.

2673
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,920
(In the end, he bets all the coins
except for 1.)

2674
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:07,630
The thing is, people who stood up...

2675
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:08,760
- can't help themselves.
- That's right.

2676
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:09,760
- That's right.
- They can't help themselves.

2677
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,200
Raise your hand
if you stood up both times.

2678
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:14,230
- Those two will stand up.
- I stood up both times.

2679
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:16,140
- Since you said that,
- Three.

2680
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:17,640
- people might decide to mess it up.
- Right.

2681
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,810
- They might do that.
- I'm not like that.

2682
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,270
- We'll consider that as well.
- Will you consider that as well?

2683
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:21,510
- We'll make calculations.
- Knowing that,

2684
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:22,880
- I'll stand up.
- That's right.

2685
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,610
- Keeping that in mind,
- We'll make calculations.

2686
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:26,750
- we'll consider the possibilities.
- Will you go that far?

2687
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:30,350
If you want us to make a promise,
you need to give us a coin each.

2688
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:32,290
Will you make a promise?

2689
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:33,420
- Okay.
- Really?

2690
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:34,820
You need to give us a coin each.

2691
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:38,260
(After 2 rounds of success,
he starts it again.)

2692
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:40,490
I'll give you guys
three coins each this time.

2693
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,700
- Three coins each?
- The number is small.

2694
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:44,830
Five coins each.

2695
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,430
I'll give you guys five coins each.

2696
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:48,500
- Five?
- That's...

2697
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,840
- Really?
- Really?

2698
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,870
(5 coins?)

2699
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:53,510
(I'm in.)

2700
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,680
- Tell us what to do as you pass by.
- Seok Jin.

2701
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,380
We'll do as you say.

2702
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,180
This is for sitting down
and this is for standing up.

2703
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:00,880
In the two previous rounds,

2704
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,420
- did you guys do as he said?
- Yes.

2705
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:03,550
- Of course.
- We did that.

2706
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:05,150
- All six members?
- We seriously did that.

2707
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:06,490
(Sit down.)

2708
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:10,160
(Stand up.)

2709
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:11,520
(Stand up.)

2710
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:12,660
(Seok Jin's last order:
Rest, stand up. Haha, sit down.)

2711
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:14,330
- Okay.
- All right.

2712
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:16,930
(Seok Jin's last order:
Rest, stand up. Haha, sit down.)

2713
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:18,770
If you do as I say,
I'll give five coins each.

2714
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:19,970
- Okay.
- Okay.

2715
01:23:20,570 --> 01:23:22,440
- You promised to give five coins.
- Okay.

2716
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:23,740
Which number...

2717
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:24,840
Hold on. Which number...

2718
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:26,910
This is hard.

2719
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:28,340
This is so hard.

2720
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:29,680
- Go with your hunch.
- Okay.

2721
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,140
Seriously.

2722
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:32,580
Seok Jin.

2723
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:33,980
You remember, right?

2724
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,180
The order was very simple this time.

2725
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:39,090
I'll go with the number of people.

2726
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:43,520
(Thinking)

2727
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:45,430
This is insane.

2728
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:46,890
(Ye Eun goes all in
for the number of people.)

2729
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,330
You should go
with the number of people.

2730
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,000
This is driving me crazy.

2731
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,730
- Standing up... Okay.
- I don't know.

2732
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:53,770
(Eunhyuk also goes all in
for the number of people.)

2733
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:55,440
Did you go with odd or even
or the number of people?

2734
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:56,570
Me?

2735
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,300
- I went with odd or even.
- Odd or even?

2736
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,610
- I went with the number of people.
- Odd or even is better.

2737
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:02,140
Think about the possibility.

2738
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,510
In the count of three,

2739
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:06,550
- the last round will unfold.
- Okay.

2740
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:07,550
There's no other way.

2741
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:09,780
- One, two, three.
- There's no other way.

2742
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:12,090
One, two, three.

2743
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:15,520
(Three members followed
Seok Jin's order.)

2744
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:16,990
(If the other three stand up
as they promised,)

2745
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:18,360
(the bets of 5 people
will be successful.)

2746
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:20,530
Did you guys follow the order?

2747
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:24,600
(But Se Chan will go bankrupt.)

2748
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:28,570
(Seok Jin's order:
Everyone except for Haha, stand up.)

2749
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:30,800
(2 people stand up.)

2750
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:32,510
(Feigning ignorance)

2751
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:34,270
(R coins for the bet)

2752
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:35,280
Gosh.

2753
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:40,110
Two people stood up.

2754
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:46,320
(Se Chan's bet of 79 coins
was successful.)

2755
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:48,660
Se Chan guessed even,
so his coins got doubled.

2756
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:50,060
He gained 79 coins.

2757
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:52,530
- My goodness.
- That's incredible.

2758
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:54,160
Se Chan is number one.

2759
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:55,700
Se Chan is number one
by a landslide.

2760
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:56,830
Se Chan is number one.

2761
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:59,970
(What happened to Eunhyuk,
the one who went all in?)

2762
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,270
(R coins for the bet)

2763
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:03,500
I'm ruined. What am I going to do?

2764
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,870
(R coins for the bet)

2765
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,970
I don't have a single coin.

2766
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,310
This is bad.

2767
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:11,680
(Ye Eun went bankrupt as well.)

2768
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,180
We're both at the bottom.

2769
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:15,010
(The siblings with no coins
are both at the bottom.)

2770
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,650
It's too bad.

2771
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:18,650
(Jae Seok's bet failed as well.)

2772
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:21,090
I thought the number would be three.

2773
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:22,360
What?

2774
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:23,920
You told me to sit down.

2775
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,090
(Why is he blaming Haha
when he did as he was told?)

2776
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:27,030
- Are you a carp?
- He...

2777
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:28,900
He told me to sit down.

2778
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,870
- He told me to sit down, right?
- A carp!

2779
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:32,900
- A carp!
- He told you to sit down.

2780
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:35,240
- He told me to sit down.
- Yes.

2781
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:37,140
I did as I was told.

2782
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:38,610
- Check the camera.
- Seok Jin.

2783
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:40,110
Only Haha...

2784
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:43,110
- For goodness' sake.
- I did it all three times.

2785
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:44,310
Did you go all in?

2786
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:46,680
It's time for Group Two to bet.

2787
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,110
Please switch seats.

2788
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:49,180
I wanted a big break.

2789
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:51,180
I'll take Se Chan's seat
since he did well.

2790
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,890
I'm a game changer.

2791
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,920
It's time to play.

2792
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,360
- He went all in.
- A few people did.

2793
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,460
(The current number of R coins)

2794
01:25:58,460 --> 01:25:59,630
Eunhyuk went all in.

2795
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:02,030
You won't place last
if you leave one coin behind.

2796
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,900
Group Two will place a bet.

2797
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:05,470
The second betting round is...

2798
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:07,300
- the Betting Pirate Roulette.
- What?

2799
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,640
- What?
- What?

2800
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,100
(The Betting Pirate Roulette)

2801
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:11,670
- What?
- Are we doing something different?

2802
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,340
The five members
of the mission group...

2803
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:16,710
will take turns to insert a knife.

2804
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:19,150
The mission group members
will place a bet...

2805
01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:20,780
on whether the number of knives used
to make the pirate pop out...

2806
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,520
is odd or even.

2807
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:25,790
Otherwise, they can place a bet
on which member...

2808
01:26:25,790 --> 01:26:28,960
will make the pirate pop out.

2809
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:31,360
- Gosh, this is fun.
- This is fun.

2810
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,030
You can't even buy people off
for this one.

2811
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:35,730
- This is hard.
- If you guess correctly,

2812
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:37,530
you get double.
If you guess the name,

2813
01:26:37,530 --> 01:26:38,970
- you get five times as much.
- This is so hard.

2814
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:40,130
That's too hard.

2815
01:26:40,130 --> 01:26:41,970
It's difficult here...

2816
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:44,240
because there are so many people
who are normally unlucky.

2817
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,770
For your information,

2818
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:47,970
- it pops out with Jae Seok a lot,
- Okay.

2819
01:26:47,970 --> 01:26:49,580
and also with me.

2820
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,880
(Jae Seok gets the pirate
to jump at the first attempt.)

2821
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:57,680
(He picks his own name
among the penalty balls.)

2822
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:02,460
(He has the worst luck
and always picks the duds.)

2823
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:06,390
(Same goes with Seok Jin.)

2824
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:10,330
(The unlucky eldest brother
who's been after the duds...)

2825
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:12,670
(for 15 years.)

2826
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:15,070
Jae Seok would be popular.

2827
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:16,470
(How will it be
for the Unlucky Brothers today?)

2828
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:18,270
I'm very unlucky
within SUPER JUNIOR.

2829
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:19,270
- Really?
- Yes.

2830
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:21,270
- How unlucky are you, Eunhyuk?
- Really?

2831
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:25,180
Whenever we play
rock-paper-scissors...

2832
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,510
(He needs anything but 1,)

2833
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:29,180
(but he gets 1.)

2834
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:32,490
(He's a dud collector
who keeps picking the duds.)

2835
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:36,290
(He already proved his bad luck.)

2836
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:40,260
(Eunhyuk is the unlucky member
of SUPER JUNIOR.)

2837
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:43,160
I'm Jae Seok of SUPER JUNIOR.

2838
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:44,800
- Right.
- Yes.

2839
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:48,070
I should bet 10 over 3 rounds.
I'll bet 10 on the 1st round.

2840
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:50,400
Bet 10 on the first round.
I'll bet 15 again.

2841
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:53,340
We can't make a deal with this now.

2842
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:54,770
- Just go with it.
- We have to go.

2843
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,410
- Right.
- Thirteen.

2844
01:27:56,410 --> 01:27:59,750
Kyu Hyun will bet 40?
He'll go with odd or even.

2845
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,550
This normally goes to the person...

2846
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:03,250
whom the deity of variety show
goes to.

2847
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:04,520
- Right.
- Yes.

2848
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,590
(He bets on odd
which has a higher chance!)

2849
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:09,390
(Everyone bet on odd like Haha.)

2850
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:10,960
- Forty on odd or even.
- Leeteuk...

2851
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,690
- I did too much.
- I don't expect to be the first.

2852
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:14,390
It would be nice
if I were around the middle.

2853
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:15,700
- Safe.
- Really?

2854
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:16,700
Yes.

2855
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:19,400
Jong Kook, ten.

2856
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:21,130
(Daniel bet on Ye Eun.)

2857
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:23,470
Ji Ye Eun's energy is so drained.

2858
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:24,470
Strangely...

2859
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,770
It's the second round.

2860
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:27,340
- You've all written, right?
- Let's go.

2861
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:29,440
We'll start the game.

2862
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:31,080
This is a game of wits.

2863
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:33,310
- It's odd.
- Odd.

2864
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,050
Something should come out.

2865
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:38,650
(If it pops out now, everyone
except Daniel will succeed.)

2866
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:40,520
- It's odd.
- Odd.

2867
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:42,960
(It didn't come out.)

2868
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,390
- Next, two.
- Even.

2869
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:45,760
(Number 2: Eunhyuk)

2870
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:50,660
- She has the perfect energy.
- It's just that one.

2871
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:54,970
- Did anyone bet on me?
- What is it now?

2872
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:58,170
- Even.
- Even.

2873
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:01,440
(The pirate isn't coming out
so easily.)

2874
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,710
Next is odd.

2875
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:04,780
- It's odd.
- It's so scary.

2876
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:08,080
(It went through again.)

2877
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,520
- It was odd.
- It's even.

2878
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,520
- It's even.
- It's even.

2879
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:11,880
- No!
- It's even.

2880
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,320
- Even.
- No!

2881
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:17,220
(If it pops out now,
everyone fails in the bet.)

2882
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:18,860
Hold on.

2883
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:19,860
(No way...)

2884
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:21,790
- It's even.
- No!

2885
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:25,770
(It came out.)

2886
01:29:26,830 --> 01:29:29,070
Jae Seok! This is a jackpot!

2887
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:31,440
It's a jackpot
if he comes out three times.

2888
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,570
Seriously. Why didn't you bet on me?

2889
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:34,770
- Jackpot.
- It's strange.

2890
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:35,980
- This...
- Why...

2891
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:37,440
I killed them all.

2892
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,080
You all lost your bet.

2893
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:40,780
- At once.
- What is this?

2894
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:42,450
- He's amazing.
- All kill.

2895
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:43,720
- I wiped them at once.
- It was the worst.

2896
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:45,550
- All kill.
- Do I not get some?

2897
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:47,590
I thought I was unlucky...

2898
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:49,820
- You stand no chance.
- He's no joke.

2899
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:51,490
- How many do you have?
- If I lose...

2900
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:54,030
We have similar amounts.

2901
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:55,600
(Haha bets 17 on Jae Seok.)

2902
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,000
It's not easy.

2903
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,700
(Daniel chooses Ye Eun
2 times in a row.)

2904
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:01,830
- Odd is good.
- I got it.

2905
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:02,840
(The majority is betting on odd.)

2906
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,040
- It's difficult.
- It's difficult.

2907
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,070
(Leeteuk chose even.)

2908
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:09,010
- I wrote mine.
- I wrote it.

2909
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,540
- Odd.
- Odd.

2910
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,040
You have to stick it in properly.

2911
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,080
(It didn't pop out.)

2912
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,710
- Even.
- Even.

2913
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:16,220
He's here.

2914
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:19,190
(Number 3, Jae Seok, also passes.)

2915
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,550
- Odd.
- Why is this so scary?

2916
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:23,320
- Even.
- Even.

2917
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:25,390
- Seok Sam.
- Seok Sam.

2918
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:26,590
I think he'll get it.

2919
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:29,660
(It came out on odd.)

2920
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:31,460
- It's odd, right?
- Odd. Come on!

2921
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:33,570
Ji Hyo, Kyu Hyun,

2922
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:34,700
- and Jong Kook...
- I wanted to bet more.

2923
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:36,140
- won. The three of you.
- Look.

2924
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,770
(It's hard to multiply the R coins.)

2925
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:39,870
If you want to win big,

2926
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:41,370
- write the name of the person.
- Go for it.

2927
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:42,480
If you get it correct, you win.

2928
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,940
We have to get it correct? Okay.

2929
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:46,080
I've been going with odd or even,
but I failed every attempt.

2930
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:47,450
Since this is the last round...

2931
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,980
- It didn't work with you, right?
- I'll write the name too.

2932
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:51,080
- Really?
- Since it's the last round.

2933
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,150
You should go with the name.

2934
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:54,020
I'll bet all five.

2935
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:56,260
Why are you acting so cool
with just five coins?

2936
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,260
Just stay out of it.

2937
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,160
- Is that a partial wig?
- What?

2938
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,330
- Partial...
- No.

2939
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:02,460
It's attached to the hat.

2940
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:03,660
(He couldn't buy the whole wig
since he didn't have money.)

2941
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:05,830
I wrote Ye Eun both times,
but I didn't win.

2942
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:07,500
- I thought she would get it.
- You wrote her two times?

2943
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,940
- Yes.
- Ye Eun isn't unlucky.

2944
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:11,470
I'm not unlucky.
I'm just bad at games.

2945
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:13,510
- You always get the penalty.
- Ye Eun is bad at games.

2946
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,140
- She's not unlucky.
- Just the penalty...

2947
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:17,340
I want to bet on either Jee or Ji.
Who should I bet on?

2948
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:18,340
- What?
- Jee or Ji.

2949
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:20,050
She would have...

2950
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:21,710
- a higher chance.
- I would have a high chance.

2951
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:23,280
- This...
- She seems to have...

2952
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,980
- a high chance.
- In my opinion,

2953
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:26,790
- it came to me.
- Yes.

2954
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:27,950
I can feel it.

2955
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:29,160
- I...
- This is a game of wits.

2956
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,260
- It came to me.
- This is really difficult.

2957
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,260
Right.
- Kyu Hyun.
- I can feel it.

2958
01:31:33,430 --> 01:31:36,500
Eunhyuk is here
on your 20th anniversary.

2959
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,300
- You could write Eunhyuk.
- Right.

2960
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,070
- His energy...
- Write my name.

2961
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:42,370
- It's bad.
- No. Go with me.

2962
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:43,870
- It's bad.
- I have good energy these days.

2963
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:45,300
- Right.
- You came as a team.

2964
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:46,870
- We'd be loving members.
- Right.

2965
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:47,970
Yes. Go with that.

2966
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:50,680
Just imagine what it would look like
if this works.

2967
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:53,950
Only Leeteuk and Kyu Hyun
can win here.

2968
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:55,480
- You wrote names.
- Seok Jin.

2969
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,480
Do you think it's Ye Eun?

2970
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:59,750
- It feels like it will be her.
- It feels so.

2971
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:03,190
If I bet on her and it works,
I'd be winning.

2972
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,260
Go with it. Bet on Ye Eun.

2973
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:06,860
- Jae Seok.
- I have a strong feeling.

2974
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:08,430
I'll trust you.

2975
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:09,830
I have a feeling.

2976
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:11,760
- Ye Eun...
- I'll do it for the third time.

2977
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,500
Hold on.
Who is going with someone's name?

2978
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,140
- Me.
- Name.

2979
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:17,370
- I wrote the name too.
- Let's all go with names.

2980
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:18,400
Let's go with names.

2981
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,010
- One name for each.
- Look at her face.

2982
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:21,770
I'm done. I wrote it.

2983
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,010
Okay. I'm aiming for upper ranks.

2984
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,980
- What did you write?
- I wrote odd.

2985
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:30,320
- Come on.
- I wrote odd.

2986
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,420
(He bet on odd
that has a higher chance.)

2987
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:33,150
- Seriously.
- Really.

2988
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:34,950
- Jong Kook.
- Seriously.

2989
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:36,160
- Seriously.
- I said I was aiming...

2990
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,590
for the upper ranks.

2991
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:39,690
- What are you doing?
- You're playing too safely.

2992
01:32:39,690 --> 01:32:40,960
- I'm going for the top.
- Seriously.

2993
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,430
- Why are you so petty?
- He's stubborn.

2994
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:43,960
- Let's play together.
- I'm not petty.

2995
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:46,370
- It's been 15 years.
- Seriously.

2996
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:48,200
I should go for the upper ranks.

2997
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:51,840
- I can't win anyway.
- I feel empty.

2998
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,070
If Jae Seok gets it,
I'd be in the top rank.

2999
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:55,810
You'd all lose your coins.

3000
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,510
Many of you bet on Ye Eun.

3001
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:58,510
I'm going first.

3002
01:32:58,510 --> 01:33:04,380
(If the pirate pops out now,
Daniel, Leeteuk, and Jong Kook win.)

3003
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:06,750
I'm going first.

3004
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:08,550
Go!

3005
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:11,390
(It didn't come out.)

3006
01:33:11,390 --> 01:33:13,060
- Please.
- Eunhyuk.

3007
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:14,590
Seok Jin should go.

3008
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:15,730
- Right.
- I'll end it quickly.

3009
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:17,130
- I...
- Stab it at once.

3010
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:18,660
- It would be amazing if he gets it.
- Eunhyuk might get it.

3011
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,230
- It's their 20th anniversary.
- Their 20th anniversary.

3012
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:24,070
(Will SUPER JUNIOR's
unlucky member Eunhyuk get it?)

3013
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:25,870
- Stab it at once.
- Your album should be successful.

3014
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:26,870
The album...

3015
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:29,840
(It didn't come out.)

3016
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:32,850
- Who's next?
- It's not here yet.

3017
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:33,950
The All-Kill Man is here.

3018
01:33:33,950 --> 01:33:35,280
(Number 3: All-Kill Man)

3019
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,350
(If he gets it, Haha and Jong Kook
will succeed.)

3020
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,120
Here...

3021
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:41,950
(Jae Seok passes as well.)

3022
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:44,420
Seok Jin.

3023
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:47,430
I almost wrote Seok Jin's name
at the end.

3024
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:49,400
This is a nice color.

3025
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:51,130
That one.

3026
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,330
No.

3027
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:53,800
- Seok Sam.
- I think it will pop out.

3028
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:55,500
- No one wrote my name.
- Right.

3029
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,000
- I think it will pop out.
- I'll do it comfortably.

3030
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:00,870
(It didn't pop out
even with Seok Jin.)

3031
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:02,440
- Next.
- No one wrote my name, right?

3032
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:03,940
- Hold on.
- There is someone.

3033
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:05,510
- It's odd, right?
- Ji Hyo.

3034
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:07,980
(Will Ji Hyo and Jong Kook
win the bet?)

3035
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:09,850
- Jong Kook bet on odd.
- Jong Kook.

3036
01:34:10,350 --> 01:34:11,980
- Okay.
- Yang Se Chan.

3037
01:34:12,450 --> 01:34:15,760
(One round passed.)

3038
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,490
- Please.
- Is it Ye Eun?

3039
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:19,160
- Ye Eun is even.
- The majority wrote Ye Eun's name.

3040
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:20,660
- Even.
- So many people.

3041
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:22,500
- You were the top pick.
- Please!

3042
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,430
(There's a high chance this time.)

3043
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:26,700
- So many.
- Please!

3044
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:29,070
(It's a pass again.)

3045
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,140
- Ye Eun isn't...
- She's not unlucky.

3046
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:33,570
- Who wrote Eunhyuk?
- He's here.

3047
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:35,370
(Number 7, Eunhyuk's turn is back.)

3048
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:37,080
- Eunhyuk.
- He's here.

3049
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,080
- He's here. It's odd.
- Twentieth anniversary.

3050
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,380
Twentieth anniversary.

3051
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:41,980
- Stab it quickly.
- Eunhyuk.

3052
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:44,380
- Hold on. The feeling...
- It's here!

3053
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:45,750
- It's here.
- Upper rank.

3054
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:47,420
(He feels something?)

3055
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:48,590
- No way.
- Did it touch something?

3056
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:50,020
- Something is...
- Push it in.

3057
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:52,560
(If it comes out this time, he gets
5 times the reward, and he'll win.)

3058
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,460
(He gets 2 times the reward,
and he'll enter the upper ranks.)

3059
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:55,860
(The rest would lose again.)

3060
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:58,060
Just imagine what it would look like
if this works.

3061
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:59,900
- Some love members though.
- Right.

3062
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:05,070
(It came out.)

3063
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:07,870
Hey!

3064
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:09,580
(The unlucky member
of SUPER JUNIOR did it.)

3065
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:11,540
With this...

3066
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:13,080
Why is Jong Kook there?

3067
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,450
Odd?

3068
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:16,780
- Odd.
- He got an odd.

3069
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:20,050
Only Kyu Hyun and Jong Kook
will get the coins.

3070
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:21,090
Upper rank.

3071
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:22,720
It's amazing.

3072
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:24,920
- Odd? Really?
- It worked.

3073
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:25,960
Amazing.

3074
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:27,460
- It worked.
- Right?

3075
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:28,590
I told you to write my name.

3076
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:29,930
I should have done that.

3077
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:31,330
- Why you...
- He wrote Eunhyuk's name.

3078
01:35:31,330 --> 01:35:32,630
You should've trusted your member.

3079
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:34,330
- You should've trusted him.
- My gosh.

3080
01:35:34,330 --> 01:35:35,700
The winner is...

3081
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,770
- Kyu Hyun with 160 coins.
- My goodness.

3082
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:38,940
He will get the prize.

3083
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:40,140
- He's lucky.
- And...

3084
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:43,880
- we have one more prize.
- Right.

3085
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,180
We will decide who will get it
through a draw...

3086
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:47,910
- among the top ranks.
- I see.

3087
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:50,880
Kyu Hyun, the winner will choose it.

3088
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,220
- Good.
- Please, Kyu Hyun.

3089
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,550
The person to get the prize is...

3090
01:35:53,550 --> 01:35:55,250
- Who is it?
- The winner is...

3091
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,020
Pick my name, Kyu Hyun.

3092
01:35:57,090 --> 01:35:58,760
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

3093
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:00,390
We should set an example.

3094
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:02,230
Mr. Ji!

3095
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:04,660
This is unbelievable.

3096
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:06,400
(The gold rings
go to Kyu Hyun and Jong Kook.)

3097
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,530
He was in the middle, but...

3098
01:36:07,530 --> 01:36:09,030
Jong Kook, you're unbelievable.

3099
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:10,740
He got this too.

3100
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,670
Now we will pick the members
to get the penalty.

3101
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:15,510
Here's the final result.

3102
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:17,280
We have five members
who went all-in...

3103
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,180
- and lost all their coins.
- Oh, dear.

3104
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:22,620
- Unbelievable.
- So we will pick three...

3105
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:25,350
- out of those five.
- What a relief.

3106
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:26,550
- We should pick three people.
- Three?

3107
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:28,120
Let me pick those three.

3108
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:29,790
The All-Kill Man is coming.

3109
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:31,490
- But the three...
- Jae Seok.

3110
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:32,830
- Today...
- Only pick SUPER JUNIOR.

3111
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:34,630
Please.

3112
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:35,690
Leeteuk.

3113
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:40,430
(The All-Kill Man picked
Leeteuk of SUPER JUNIOR.)

3114
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:41,570
That's it, Jae Seok.

3115
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:42,600
Eunhyuk.

3116
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:45,370
(The All-Kill Man picked Leeteuk
and Eunhyuk of SUPER JUNIOR.)

3117
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,610
Seriously?

3118
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:47,810
I always get picked
at a time like this.

3119
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,110
- No.
- What?

3120
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:50,210
Ji Ye Eun.

3121
01:36:50,210 --> 01:36:53,110
(Ye Eun is picked as she said.)

3122
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:56,220
One, two, three.

3123
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:58,980
(The penalty for Eunhyuk, Leeteuk,
and Ye Eun is the Fresh Cream Bomb.)

3124
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,190
Leeteuk, you look great.

3125
01:37:06,290 --> 01:37:07,790
- Okay.
- Thank you for today.

3126
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:10,300
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

3127
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:13,170
(Gyeongju, the old capital city
and learning place for Empty Heads)

3128
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:14,400
(Saying the Great Dharani Sutra
in the student mode)

3129
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:16,340
(Now they appreciate the view
in tourist mode.)

3130
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:18,170
(They don't need
to study this time!)

3131
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:19,610
(The healing tour course
of Gyeongju)

3132
01:37:19,610 --> 01:37:20,970
(Even more colorful uniforms)

3133
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:23,240
(Why is it so tacky?)

3134
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:24,740
(Today's travel mate who will
blow away all their complaints)

3135
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,350
(MIYEON of i-dle)

3136
01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:27,410
(MIYEON is so pretty!)

3137
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:28,710
(With the guest
whose specialty is being pretty,)

3138
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:30,950
(they fully recharge
their Gen Z power.)

3139
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:32,080
(Somehow,
she gets the quizzes right...)

3140
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,420
(and comes back as an all-rounder.)

3141
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:34,850
(However)

3142
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,320
(The end of the healing tour
is announced,)

3143
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,420
(and the flare
to signal a war goes off.)

3144
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:39,090
(They start running
without knowing what's happening.)

3145
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:40,190
(It's a race!)

3146
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:41,430
(The real race begins.)

3147
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:42,460
(A battle of wits
that cannot be missed)

3148
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:43,460
(An idiom that means a pear drops
when a crow flies from the tree!)

3149
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:45,260
(Heeheenakrak!)

3150
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,400
(Using a secret weapon?)

3151
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:47,430
(Your feet look clammy.)

3152
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:48,470
(A funky CBR warfare)

3153
01:37:48,970 --> 01:37:51,470
(A showdown between the gamblers
that makes you cry!)

(Splitting Gamblers)
