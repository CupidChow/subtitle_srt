1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,440
(One early fall morning
with a shower)

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,550
(Office workers are leaving
their homes to make money.)

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,010
- What are we?
- So, our characters are...

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,750
- office workers?
- Office workers.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,650
- Office workers.
- New employees.

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,650
- Hello.
- Hello.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,690
Hello.

8
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,860
Gosh, my voice... Darn it.

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,060
Jong Kook's voice
is hoarse from a cold.

10
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,700
- Are we doing it here?
- Are we starting already?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,360
- Gosh, today...
- Hello.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,600
Hello.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,300
- Where are you going?
- Why?

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,440
- You can go later.
- I'm going to the restroom.

15
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,740
- Why?
- Just go later after you change.

16
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,510
- It can wait.
- I need to go to the restroom.

17
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,270
- We're office workers.
- Isn't he Detective Conan?

18
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,640
I'm an office worker,
but I'm a little clumsy.

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,840
- I'm a little clumsy...
- Aren't you a fool?

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,780
- I'm not a fool.
- He's really...

21
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,120
- I'm just a little slow.
- He looks very slow.

22
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,980
- By the way...
- What?

23
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,250
I'm a new employee
who's interested in fashion.

24
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,550
A new employee?

25
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,720
But his performance is poor.

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,090
Hey, your face
has gotten quite chubby.

27
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,630
Your face has gotten quite chubby.

28
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,900
- What...
- What are you doing?

29
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,300
- Why are you hitting him?
- Why are you hitting him?

30
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,300
What was that?

31
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,170
You should take care of your appearance.
You're a celebrity.

32
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,900
What about you?
Your chin has gotten chubby too.

33
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,810
- It's a good thing.
- He's gained some weight.

34
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,070
- He's a little chubby.
- He really is.

35
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,210
You too. Look at your cheeks.

36
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,710
You don't take care
of your appearance.

37
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,580
All right. You are office workers,

38
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,020
and you have
one more colleague today.

39
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,580
- What?
- Who is it?

40
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,780
- Why aren't Haha and Ji Hyo coming?
- Right. Haha and Ji Hyo.

41
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,090
Did the Mapo Bridge collapse?

42
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,050
- Ji Hyo and Haha aren't here.
- Right.

43
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,490
- The two from Mapo aren't here.
- What?

44
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,890
- Hello.
- Joohoney.

45
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,890
- You finished the military service?
- Hello.

46
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,300
- You finished the military service?
- Hey, Mr. Kyukyukaka.

47
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,060
- He was here before his enlistment.
- Salute.

48
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,900
- Salute!
- Salute!

49
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,870
- Joohoney was here...
- Right.

50
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,300
before his military service.

51
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,300
(Shouting)

52
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,640
(Pulling)

53
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,940
(Laughing)

54
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,940
(Pulling)

55
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,810
(With the physique that overpowered
Seok Sam in his 50s and 60s,)

56
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,710
(Joohoney even showed
his cute charms.)

57
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,350
(He made his comeback
with MONSTA X's new song, "N the Front.")

58
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,660
(The kkyu-kkyu-kka-kka. master
and a genius at his job, Joohoney)

59
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,430
He's been discharged?

60
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,230
- Hey.
- Welcome back.

61
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,700
- Hey.
- Sergeant Lee.

62
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,730
You're back
after your military service.

63
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,570
It's been a while
since his discharge.

64
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,830
- When did you get discharged?
- Your face hasn't changed.

65
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,900
Really?

66
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,840
- Hello.
- We did this thing together.

67
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,170
- That's right.
- Yes.

68
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,510
- Sergeant Lee.
- Yes.

69
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,940
It's been a month and a half
since his discharge.

70
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,940
- Really?
- No. It was last January.

71
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,380
- January?
- Yes.

72
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,910
- January?
- How did his hair grow so long...

73
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,910
in only one month?

74
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,220
You sent me a text.

75
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,720
- Was it January?
- Yes.

76
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,820
- How time flies.
- I thought...

77
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,150
it was a short time ago.

78
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,520
- A year and six months?
- I sent Joohoney a text message.

79
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,420
- You sent a text?
- I sent him a photo...

80
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,990
- of him being discharged.
- I see.

81
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,000
He looks like a celebrity now.

82
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,830
- Why?
- It was hilarious.

83
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,000
That's because he fulfilled
his military duty.

84
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,170
- He sent me this picture.
- Let me see.

85
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,910
- He always does that.
- Look.

86
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,740
Is this when he was discharged?

87
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,840
- My goodness.
- It doesn't look like me.

88
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,310
- What's with your hair?
- I still don't think it's me.

89
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,280
- You had long hair back then.
- Right.

90
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,650
- You looked cute.
- When he was discharged.

91
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,280
- This is Joohoney.
- That's cute.

92
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,680
Joohoney, you should always
get your hair and makeup done.

93
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,720
Okay.

94
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,420
- Now, Sergeant Lee,
- Yes.

95
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,190
- you're back.
- That's right.

96
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,460
- The celebrity is back.
- Yes. I'm back.

97
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,930
Is Joohoney joining us today?

98
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,930
Yes. Today, you guys are
prospective employees...

99
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,400
who are having
a job interview with the CEOs.

100
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,830
- An interview with the CEO?
- Really?

101
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,400
That means we passed
the document screening.

102
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,000
The three CEOs are waiting
in the interview room now.

103
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,170
- Ji Hyo?
- Ji Hyo and Haha are the CEOs.

104
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,740
Gosh, this is annoying...

105
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,510
There are the employees
whom I really hate.

106
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,710
I'm tired already.

107
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,820
I prefer working alone.

108
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,290
(They're waiting for Seok Sam,
who went to the restroom.)

109
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,660
Do we have to show our specialties
during the interview?

110
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,460
That might help you
impress the CEOs.

111
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,430
- Sergeant Lee, what...
- Will you do the kkyu-kkyu-kka-kka?

112
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,000
I did that too much.

113
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,060
- You have something else?
- Something else?

114
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,060
What's kkyu-kkyu-kka-kka?

115
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,300
Isn't this it?

116
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,970
Daniel, do you not know
what kkyu-kkyu-kka-kka is?

117
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,970
I don't know.

118
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,440
- Sergeant Lee.
- Yes.

119
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,840
We have someone
who doesn't know kkyu-kkyu-kka-kka.

120
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,810
- What's kkyu-kkyu-kka-kka?
- That's my signature move.

121
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,940
- Have you not seen it before?
- I've never seen it before.

122
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,680
- We want to see it again.
- Show us.

123
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,810
(Hesitant)

124
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,380
- Show us.
- Sergeant Lee.

125
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,520
You've become very manly.

126
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,320
Sergeant Lee.
You seem hesitant to do it,

127
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,490
unlike before.

128
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,590
(Busted)

129
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,220
- Sergeant Lee.
- I did it for too long a time.

130
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,160
- Sergeant Lee is...
- Soldiers...

131
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,390
- He's shy.
- He did that a lot before.

132
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,460
His juniors in the military
are watching.

133
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,660
- Hey, Sergeant Lee.
- They're watching.

134
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,260
I did it for a long time.

135
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,430
- Is that why?
- Yes.

136
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,830
I'll show you once.
It's been a long time.

137
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,800
- Show what?
- Kkyu-kkyu-kka-kka.

138
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,270
- I'll do the kkyu-kkyu-kka-kka.
- Kkyu-kkyu-kka-kka?

139
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,840
- I'm gathering my energy.
- All right. Go ahead.

140
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,970
Let's see how he does it.

141
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,280
(Trembling)

142
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,020
It's coming. The lips are working.

143
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,520
Kkyu-kkyu-kka-kka.

144
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,560
- Good job.
- You've still got it.

145
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,960
- It works.
- That's funny.

146
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,160
- You've still got it.
- Sergeant Lee.

147
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,200
- You've still got it.
- Kkyu-kkyu-kka-kka.

148
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,630
- Still?
- Sergeant Lee has still got it.

149
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,630
Thank you.

150
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,340
All right. Let's move...

151
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,900
- to the interview room now.
- Shall we go?

152
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,440
- Let's go.
- We got to see you again today.

153
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,470
I know.

154
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,470
(Work Schedule, Interview)
Let them in.

155
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,640
(Knocking)

156
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,650
- Go.
- Okay.

157
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,010
- My goodness.
- What is this?

158
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,210
- They're here.
- What?

159
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

160
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,050
- What?
- Wait.

161
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,290
Are these guys the CEOs?

162
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,420
- "These guys?"
- I mean...

163
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,190
What gives them
the right to hire us?

164
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,690
- What are they?
- "These guys?"

165
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,160
The CEOs are way too...

166
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,930
- Do you even know what F and B is?
- What is this?

167
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,600
What does F stand for?

168
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,200
- Just have a seat.
- What does B stand for?

169
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,730
Stop being rude and have a seat.

170
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,440
- Rude?
-They are too uneducated...

171
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,600
to become a CEO.

172
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,100
Eun Bi, what kind of CEO are you?

173
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,570
Have a seat. Do you not see this?

174
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,310
- Eun Visual?
- Is it a cafe?

175
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,640
- She owns a building.
- A cafe?

176
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,380
(Tsuki secretly put trash
into Eun Bi's bag.)

177
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,180
(Front leaning rest.)

178
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,950
(Buy one each for me.)

179
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,050
(I have no money to buy it.)

180
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,620
(Hang on.
Only the penniless ones are here.)

181
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,290
(I'm in love)

182
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,260
(A crazy sister who manipulates
the members of Running Man)

183
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,260
(The unstoppable guest
and Waterbomb Queen, Kwon Eun Bi)

184
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,600
Let's have a seat.

185
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,070
- Let's sit.
- I don't want to work for them.

186
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,300
- Joohoney, sit here.
- Okay.

187
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,500
I don't want to hire you.

188
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,940
Joohoney. It's been a while.

189
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,010
- Hello.
- Have a seat.

190
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,110
- He's Sergeant Lee.
- Right.

191
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,110
Have a seat.

192
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,210
- Do you know what a corporation is?
- There's no one I want to hire.

193
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,850
- Listen. Ms. CEO.
- "A corporation."

194
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,350
There's no one you want to hire?
How could you say that?

195
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,650
I need good-looking employees
at my cafe.

196
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,550
- Good looks?
- You're out.

197
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,820
- He's out?
- What? Me?

198
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,660
- I'm out because of my looks?
- Good looks.

199
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,790
- I don't like your hair today.
- The CEOs should be good.

200
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,090
Right. The CEOs...

201
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,200
- should be nice to us.
- That's the case now.

202
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,670
Please take turns
and introduce yourselves.

203
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,530
We need to know
what your companies are about.

204
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,070
- Introduce yourselves first.
- Tell us about your companies.

205
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,900
- Tell us about your companies.
- Should we go first?

206
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,270
Okay. Ms. Kwon, please.

207
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,810
Hello. It's been...

208
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,110
about six months
since I started my business.

209
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,110
- It hasn't been that long.
- Right.

210
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,150
It's very popular
and successful now.

211
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,120
- Is it?
- Yes. The strength...

212
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,480
of our company is good looks.
I need people...

213
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,790
- with good looks.
- It's about appearance?

214
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,660
- I bet she's a little picky.
- Right.

215
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,720
- She looks strict.
- Why do looks matter?

216
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,990
Do you offer a meal?

217
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,260
- We provide meals.
- You do?

218
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,800
Do you also provide cars?

219
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,160
No, we don't.

220
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,970
You can take the subway
for free anyway.

221
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,670
(Yes.)

222
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,700
- I'm grateful.
- He receives his pension too.

223
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,900
He still has a few years left.

224
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,210
I still have five years left.
I played along with the joke.

225
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,570
What aspects of appearance
do you consider important?

226
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,110
- He seems interested.
- Actually,

227
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,840
appearance is important,
but I also care about what's in it.

228
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,810
- You're lying.
- Don't lie to us.

229
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,920
- That's a lie.
- Will you hire Se Chan?

230
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,750
- He's out.
- I'm out right away.

231
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,980
I'll join your company.

232
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,790
No. Both your inside and outside
are disqualified.

233
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,820
- Really?
- Yes.

234
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,420
- My inside is fine.
- What do you not like about him?

235
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,530
When he opens it up, it should be...

236
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,730
Do I need abs?

237
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,900
I think it's unorganized.

238
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,160
- What's unorganized?
- So, the inside is...

239
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,900
- Inside the shirt?
- So you meant my body?

240
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,300
- That's what you're talking about?
- I see. What's inside his shirt?

241
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,500
You mean inside this outfit?

242
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,170
- That's the inside.
- I see.

243
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,910
We all... My goodness.

244
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,070
Shin Gi Ru, go ahead.

245
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,270
Hello. Nice to meet you.

246
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,510
- Ha Gi Ru.
- What company is that?

247
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,180
- Is that movie title?
- I'm Double H.

248
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,210
- Double H?
- What's Double H?

249
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,680
- I'm Double H.
- It's for "Haha."

250
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,710
And I'm from the States.

251
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,120
- Which city?
- Where in the States?

252
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,450
- San Francisco.
- San Francisco?

253
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,450
Yes.
Anyway, it's an F and B company.

254
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,520
Then what is the M?

255
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,790
- What does the M mean?
- M.

256
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,590
What's the M? Medium?

257
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,660
"Infinite Challenge?"

258
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,490
- Mother Father Brother.
- "Infinite Challenge?"

259
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,390
- Mother Father Birthday.
- Mother Father...

260
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,760
- Mother Father Birthday.
- Birthday.

261
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,860
- This is...
- A, b...

262
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,370
- That's the company.
- Right.

263
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,470
- Mother Father Birthday.
- Mother Father Birthday.

264
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,740
It's Birthday.

265
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,800
I can't work with people like them.

266
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,940
Do you not know
what an F and B company is?

267
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,470
- Mother Father Bakery?
- Bakery.

268
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,140
- That's right.
- Is it a bakery?

269
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,710
- Mapo-gu.
- I see.

270
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,710
Fork and beef.

271
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,750
(But pork starts with a "P.")

272
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,980
- I thought he was swearing.
- F and B.

273
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,390
- That's a BBQ restaurant.
- I thought he was swearing.

274
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,020
- Wait.
- That's it.

275
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,620
You mean pork and beef.
It starts with a "P."

276
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,760
- Is it P?
- Pork.

277
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,390
(Pork starts with a "P.")

278
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,690
(Humiliated)

279
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,730
It's P.

280
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,630
(They all laugh at him together.)

281
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,740
- Fork is this.
- Listen.

282
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,200
(She pretends that she knew it.)

283
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,440
- I see.
- This is crazy.

284
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,610
(Haha didn't know how to spell pork
while running a BBQ restaurant.)

285
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,170
- Haha, it's okay.
- This is crazy.

286
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,180
What are you doing?

287
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,610
CEO Ha.

288
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,010
You were talking
about a fork, right?

289
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,020
This is crazy. He's so ignorant.

290
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,050
- What are you doing?
- How would we join his company?

291
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,990
I really don't want
to join his company.

292
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,250
It will go under.

293
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,450
- The company will go under.
- You know what?

294
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,160
- I'm not going there.
- An F and B company...

295
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,290
You know what an F and B company is.

296
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,390
- That's what I'm doing.
- It should be fish then.

297
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,660
- Fish and beef. Yes.
- It's fish and beef.

298
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,630
- Yes. I sell fish.
- Fish and beef.

299
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,770
- I also sell meat.
- Meat?

300
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,500
Today, I just...

301
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,170
want you to work hard. That's it.

302
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,140
- You don't need any condition?
- With no cheap tricks.

303
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,210
Do you not care about our insides?

304
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,210
I don't care about what's inside.

305
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,480
I just want you to work well.

306
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,110
- All I want to do is make money.
- Okay.

307
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,850
Then we will go
our separate ways. Okay?

308
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,850
- Okay.
- Good.

309
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,380
- He's straightforward.
- I really don't want to go there.

310
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,780
My company is...

311
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,720
As you know, here...

312
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,750
- What is IUB?
- IUB?

313
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,950
- Do you see this?
- IUB?

314
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,060
What's that?

315
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,360
My and your bra?

316
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,890
(My and your bra?)

317
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,130
(What did you say?)

318
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,300
I, you.

319
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,800
- I, U, Bra.
- I and you.

320
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
- I think you're right.
- My and your bra?

321
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,370
- It's an underwear company?
- Brassiere.

322
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,700
I love that.

323
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,140
- Thank you.
- That's the worst.

324
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,210
IUB means...

325
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,740
"Try it on."

326
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,840
- Try it on?
- I see.

327
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,210
(A name
perfect for an underwear company)

328
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,480
- Try it on.
- IUB.

329
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,950
- IUB is...
- I don't care...

330
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,950
- about the inside or the outside.
- Okay.

331
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,250
As the name suggests,

332
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,420
I want people
who can try on underwear.

333
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,450
(Someone who can try on underwear)

334
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,690
- Please introduce yourselves then.
- Okay.

335
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,090
- Yes.
- He's a senior intern.

336
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,160
Okay. Senior.

337
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,430
I'm not a senior. I just...

338
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,060
- Sir.
- had something in mind.

339
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,360
That's why
I didn't go to other companies.

340
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,060
I wanted to join...

341
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,600
one of these three companies,

342
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,970
- so I studied for 30 years.
- Right.

343
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,200
- You were jobless the whole time?
- I was.

344
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,340
He got allowances
from his parents for 30 years.

345
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,680
I don't know
which company it would be.

346
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,680
The underwear company,
the F and B company, or the cafe.

347
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,250
- Seok Jin.
- Yes.

348
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,550
You talk too much.

349
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,020
- Will you please listen up first?
- My gosh.

350
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,690
- I don't think we're that close.
- Seok Jin.

351
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,320
My company cares
about what's inside,

352
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,590
so why don't you...

353
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,190
- Can you show her?
- Yes.

354
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,390
The inside?

355
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,930
- Do you want him to show his body?
- The inside...

356
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,930
- He's sweating a lot.
- The jacket is too heavy.

357
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,660
- Can you take it off?
- What?

358
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,630
- Take it off.
- But...

359
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,770
(What?)

360
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,670
(Seok Sam was hiding
his provocative inner self.)

361
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,840
- I can't take this off.
- Take it off.

362
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,940
- My goodness.
- Just take it off.

363
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,240
- I can't take this off.
- It's all right.

364
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,280
- This is unsightly.
- It's okay.

365
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,010
We have an underwear company here.

366
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,150
Stop it.

367
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,380
- I had no idea.
- Please take it off.

368
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,550
I really didn't know.

369
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,220
Stop it!

370
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,350
- You still have the BCG scar.
- Pardon me?

371
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,720
- This one?
- Did they sear it back then?

372
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,790
Yes.

373
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,960
- Were you tortured?
- It doesn't fade.

374
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,860
- That's not it. It's a slave mark.
- Slave?

375
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,060
(That's not it. It's a slave mark.)

376
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,770
(A major revelation
from a close associate)

377
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,730
Don't trust him.

378
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,370
Yes. It has nothing
to do with slavery.

379
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,770
- Were you a slave?
- I'm just...

380
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,740
(A heartbreaking story
about why he couldn't get a job)

381
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,270
- Not at all...
- He was a slave.

382
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,640
- Okay.
- Anyway...

383
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,640
- I'm at your service.
- Thank you.

384
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,410
- It wasn't so bad.
- I'm feeling the same way.

385
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,510
I like him.

386
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,750
I don't like the inside.

387
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,620
- This is really hot.
- Next.

388
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,990
- Sergeant Lee.
- Yes.

389
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,560
- Hello.
- Hello.

390
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,060
- Hello.
- Please introduce yourself.

391
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,190
I recently completed
my military service.

392
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,360
- Nice.
- I like that.

393
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
- He served in the military.
- In the military,

394
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,330
- I was an assistant instructor.
- He must be in great shape.

395
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,800
- I was an assistant instructor.
- An assistant instructor?

396
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
- Can you show us a little?
- Show what?

397
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,140
- As an assistant instructor.
- Assistant instructor.

398
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,740
I'll show you a military salute.

399
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,240
Yes, something like that.

400
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,410
Salute!

401
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,710
- Nice.
- You look disciplined.

402
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,140
His voice is too weak.

403
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,550
That's the trend these days.

404
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,610
- That's the trend?
- I see.

405
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,180
That's nice.

406
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,380
Let's say the company...

407
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,680
- isn't doing well.
- All right.

408
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,620
What do you think you can do
to make things better?

409
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,490
- I believe I have a cute charm.
- He's got something.

410
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,190
- Right.
- I see. He's cute.

411
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,230
- I can also dance.
- Dance? Go ahead.

412
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,290
- Dance.
- I'll show you.

413
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,330
- Show us your talents.
- After that, can you act cute?

414
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,400
- I can do that.
- Can you?

415
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,270
- I'll do that right after my dance.
- I saw that earlier,

416
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,700
- and he's still got it.
- I see.

417
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,730
I never hesitate.

418
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,000
He's perfect for Fish and Beef.

419
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,810
- I'm excited.
- He's good at this.

420
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,940
So, this is serious.

421
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,970
("N the Front" by MONSTA X
is playing.)

422
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,280
Is this your new song?

423
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,050
(A unique strategy where
he dances during a job interview)

424
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,820
That's so cool.

425
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,520
(Fortunately,
the CEOs seem to like it.)

426
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,790
(Assistant Instructor
Lee finishes it with a pistol.)

427
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,060
Now act cute.

428
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,770
Salute!

429
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,900
Salute!

430
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,170
(He's a vending machine
that provides a cute charm.)

431
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,440
There's nothing I can't do.

432
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,210
- Salute!
- I can do anything.

433
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,910
- He's great.
- He's cute.

434
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,610
- You can do anything.
- He's good.

435
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,750
- Kkyu-kkyu-kka-kka.
- I like him.

436
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,810
I do as I'm told.

437
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,150
It'd be great
if he did that at the entrance.

438
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,280
- Ms. Kwon.
- Look at Eun Bi.

439
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,690
- Ms. Kwon turned around.
- Ms. Kwon looks serious.

440
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,490
She looks totally different
from when she was looking at me.

441
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,820
I like him.

442
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,120
If you want me to act cute
at the entrance,

443
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,960
- I will do that like 5,000 times.
- He's so cute.

444
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,260
Welcome!

445
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,730
- How cute.
- That's great.

446
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,330
- I can do that.
- He's perfect for my business.

447
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,530
- That was good.
- Thank you.

448
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,800
I really like you.

449
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,830
Thank you.

450
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,540
(Unlike someone else,
Joohoney received praise.)

451
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,670
- Ye Eun.
- Yes?

452
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,740
- It's your turn.
- Okay.

453
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,110
Actually, I...

454
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,580
- Now,
- She has nothing.

455
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,040
- I'm the only office worker here.
- You don't have it.

456
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,250
I'm an office worker now.

457
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,450
- I hear you gossip a lot there.
- Me?

458
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,520
I do.

459
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
(Ji Ye Eun, the quirky Gen Z
employee from "Office Workers")

460
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,980
- I'm actually an office worker.
- Right.

461
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,320
Are you trying to move to a new job?

462
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,920
- Is that it?
- Yes, I'm.

463
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,290
Currently, I'm working
at an advertising firm,

464
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,690
but I'm trying to find another job.

465
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,260
Does your boss know about this?

466
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,690
- He does.
- Isn't it that you were fired?

467
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,490
How much was your previous pay?

468
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,500
- My previous job?
- Yes.

469
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,000
- I got 3,500 dollars.
- You got 3,500 dollars?

470
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,000
That's for real.

471
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,330
It sounds so realistic.

472
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,600
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

473
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,570
- You should tell the truth.
- Did you get 3,500 dollars?

474
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,770
Yes, I got 3,500 dollars.

475
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,740
Did you date someone at work?

476
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,010
I couldn't.

477
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,040
I see.

478
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,250
I date someone
only when I really like him.

479
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,120
- Do you not like Kang Hoon?
- No.

480
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,780
- There was something going on.
- No, there wasn't.

481
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,920
What if Kang Hoon has
feelings for you?

482
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,690
- What if he asks you out?
- I'll go out with him.

483
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,660
- I'll go out with him.
- What about Jang Dong Yoon?

484
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,820
- I like him.
- Do you?

485
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,260
Who do you like better?

486
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,360
Dong Yoon.

487
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,300
- It's Dong Yoon.
- The new one.

488
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,630
- She's honest.
- You fall in love easily.

489
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,600
- But I don't want my employees...
- Yes.

490
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,930
- date someone at work.
- Why not?

491
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,640
I'm afraid
it will spoil the atmosphere.

492
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,700
Fortunately, there's no one
I want to date here.

493
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,340
- There's no one here?
- No.

494
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,910
- What about Joohoney?
- What about Joohoney?

495
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,310
- Do you not like me?
- He's your age.

496
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,880
I don't like guys of my age.

497
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,510
And...

498
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,880
He's a little...

499
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,520
He has cat-like features.

500
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,990
I've never heard that before.

501
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,020
She's just rejecting you.

502
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,220
You have upturned eyes,
so you have cat-like features.

503
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,420
- He has cat-like features.
- She likes dog-faces.

504
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,560
- I like dog-faces.
- I see.

505
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,190
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

506
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,530
- She says she's sorry.
- Okay.

507
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,200
- You are charming, though.
- Sorry?

508
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,370
- Thank you.
- Ye Eun.

509
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,300
One thing I'm sure of
is that Joohoney is prettier.

510
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,540
I'm sure about that.

511
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,170
- Thank you.
- Ye Eun,

512
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,940
is there a CEO you like here?

513
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,870
To be honest...

514
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,780
- Can I tell you honestly?
- Yes.

515
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,880
Bra...

516
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,650
- IUB?
- Why?

517
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,250
- IUB.
- Why is that?

518
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,780
- Why?
- I also...

519
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,680
Well...

520
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,450
They're bigger than you think.

521
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,190
What?

522
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,060
They're bigger than you think.

523
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,460
What?

524
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,660
(Employee Ji suddenly claims
that something's big.)

525
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,730
What is she talking about?

526
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,990
You don't have to say that.

527
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,430
- What...
- I'll stay quiet.

528
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,930
- Why would you say that?
- Why?

529
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,200
- What is she talking about?
- Bigger than you think...

530
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,470
You like to eat, don't you?

531
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,630
I do like to eat.

532
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,000
- Then Fish and Beef...
- That's why I'm saying...

533
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,300
- that you should join my company.
- No.

534
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,770
I'm bigger than you think.

535
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,040
(I'm bigger than you think.)

536
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,080
- I...
- You may think they aren't big...

537
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,540
That's not what I'm saying.

538
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,110
(No one denied it, but she insists
that something is big.)

539
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,680
I just can't weigh in,
you silly thing.

540
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,320
- Thank you. Go back to your seat.
- Talk all you want.

541
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,450
- Thank you, Ye Eun.
- Next.

542
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,720
(Before she causes more trouble,
she's sent back to her seat.)

543
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,950
(The next interviewee is a man
with a center part.)

544
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,990
- Gosh.
- Seriously, he's...

545
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,190
- I like him.
- Hello.

546
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,930
- That's right.
- He's Conan.

547
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,160
We have a clumsy one.

548
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,630
- I'm a high school graduate.
- What?

549
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,600
I'm not well-educated.

550
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,470
But I'll work hard for the company.

551
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,770
(Laughing)

552
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,510
What was that?

553
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,740
- She's...
- Listen.

554
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,040
- She likes it.
- Eun Bi likes him a lot.

555
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,380
- Why is she so excited?
- She likes it.

556
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,050
You seem very excited.

557
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,050
What are you doing, Eun Visual?

558
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,920
The way he's standing is so funny.

559
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,950
(The way he's standing is so funny.)

560
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,720
- I'll just care about your faces.
- She likes him.

561
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,390
How long have you been
dating your current girlfriend?

562
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,960
(How long have you been
dating your current girlfriend?)

563
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,860
(She asks a pressing question,
as if she knew something.)

564
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,530
- Be honest.
- I don't have a girlfriend.

565
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,560
There's a rumor
that you're dating two women.

566
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,600
He's two-timing?

567
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,000
(CEO Kwon is making up
rumors again.)

568
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
That's not true.

569
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,470
- That's...
- Kwon Na Ra, Oh Na Ra...

570
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,670
That's not true. I'm not two-timing.

571
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,870
- This is really...
- I'm not lying.

572
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,970
- All the rumors going around...
- It's going viral.

573
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,610
- Ssaebssaeb...
- That's not true.

574
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,410
Why would idols date Ssaebssaeb?

575
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,110
I just feel bad
for all the people...

576
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,180
who're being mentioned with me.

577
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,580
Don't say anything.

578
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,420
Do you speak English?

579
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,820
Of course.

580
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,020
Do you have an English name?

581
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,390
Christian.

582
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,290
Christian?

583
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,460
What is your religion?

584
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,660
Buddhism.

585
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,190
When your English name is Christian?

586
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,560
Yes, I'm Christian.

587
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,230
- But I'm a Buddhist.
- His name is Christian.

588
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,730
- Christian.
- Christian.

589
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
- My name is Christian.
- Christian.

590
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,040
- I see.
- We hear you.

591
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,770
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you.

592
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,810
I hope you take an interest in me.

593
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,240
I'd like to greet you next.

594
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,540
- Sure, please introduce yourself.
- You look nice today.

595
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,180
- Is he next?
- I used to work...

596
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,180
- at a trading company.
- You worked in trades?

597
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,980
- I made it to general manager,
- He was involved in smuggling.

598
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,320
but I went to work
for an entertainment agency...

599
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,790
- What?
- to pursue my dream.

600
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,120
Hold on. Weren't you two
at the same company?

601
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,390
- The trading company?
- Hold on.

602
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,160
- No wonder he seemed familiar.
- You made it big since then.

603
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,090
General Manager Yu, is that you?

604
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,530
(Employees of M Trading Company
reunite after years.)

605
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,030
- Is this for real?
- So it's true.

606
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,630
- No way!
- I heard you opened...

607
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,130
- I mean...
- a Korean BBQ restaurant.

608
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,540
- What happened to you?
- It's not as bad as you think.

609
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,740
General Manager Yu, I...

610
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,910
- They're from the same universe.
- What's worse...

611
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,270
- Weren't you an assistant manager?
- I was a low-ranking employee.

612
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,340
- A low-ranking employee.
- Just a low-ranking employee.

613
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,210
- The tables have turned.
- He's now a CEO,

614
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,550
but he was passed over
for promotions back then.

615
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,710
That's right.

616
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,110
He couldn't be trusted
with any of the work.

617
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,280
What did you just say?

618
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,980
I'm just saying how it was.

619
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,690
What's your take on CEOs
who are younger than you?

620
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,820
I don't mind that at all.

621
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,860
Age has nothing to do
with someone's competence.

622
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,460
- There's something about you.
- Yes?

623
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,030
You seem picky and judgmental.

624
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,130
I've heard rumors.

625
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,500
He can be really strict.

626
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,330
By hiring him,

627
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,830
- He could walk all over us.
- he could try to lead us instead.

628
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,070
No way.

629
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,840
Is there a special talent you have?

630
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,170
I like taking the team out
for meals and drinks.

631
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,310
- A special talent?
- Yes.

632
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,540
- I...
- He can do the grasshopper dance.

633
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,980
Yes, I'm good at that.

634
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,580
I haven't seen that in a while.

635
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,810
- Is this for real?
- I haven't danced it in a while.

636
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,080
- I'd love to see it.
- The grasshopper dance.

637
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,280
Are you good at that?

638
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,620
- Could I see it?
- I've been doing this dance...

639
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,350
for 30 years now,

640
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,720
but I can still jump...

641
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,820
- as high as I used to.
- Let's see it.

642
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,360
You can compare me to my old videos.

643
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,360
You can compare me to my old videos.

644
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,600
(He actually jumps higher now.)

645
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,430
- That's my talent.
- I'm impressed.

646
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,670
- You actually jump higher now.
- Exactly.

647
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,400
I can stand on one leg too.

648
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,940
- I've still got it.
- But...

649
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,310
shouldn't anyone be able
to stand on one foot?

650
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,840
Can you float in the air?

651
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,580
- Here's the last question.
- Sure.

652
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,950
Whether you lie or not...

653
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,280
- is most important to me.
- Got it.

654
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,350
Do you think you're handsome?

655
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,350
(Are you good-looking or not?)

656
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,060
(Anyone can tell
Haha has an answer in mind!)

657
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,560
- My choice is...
- Yes?

658
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,190
- I can't say I'm good-looking.
- Be honest.

659
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,430
Why isn't there a middle option?

660
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,630
How can there be one?

661
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,830
Are you good-looking or not?

662
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,230
There's no middle ground for you.

663
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,270
(Seok Sam's sudden sharp remark)

664
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,770
What middle ground?

665
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,810
What are you saying?

666
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,040
I'm Choi Daniel.

667
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,340
(Following the liar is Choi Daniel.)

668
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,310
He looks like
he got good grades in school.

669
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,620
I'm academically driven.

670
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,350
- You're academically driven?
- Yes.

671
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,050
There's something off about him.
I bet he's an empty head.

672
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,090
(Daniel was quickly uncovered
as an empty head.)

673
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,920
My name is Kim Jong Kook.

674
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,560
He used to be in an organization.

675
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,260
He's a thug.

676
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,560
I can solve problems...

677
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,000
the law can't.

678
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,700
Got it. Congratulations.

679
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,030
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

680
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,500
Can we now hire who we want?

681
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,400
Yes, feel free to hire someone...

682
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,810
if you'd like.

683
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,210
- It's 1st come, 1st served.
- Isn't there an order to follow?

684
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,210
- Can anyone go first?
- Tell me about it.

685
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,640
- Mr. Jee Seok Jin.
- Yes?

686
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,350
- Is he turning Seok Jin down?
- Would you like to join us?

687
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,280
- Of course.
- Not so fast. Mr. Jee,

688
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,780
- Yes?
- I'd like to offer you a job.

689
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,480
(Why is Seok Sam wanted like this?)

690
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,620
- Seok Sam must be rich.
- Well...

691
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,090
- He must have a high salary.
- We...

692
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,520
(Before the job interview,)

693
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,960
(the job seekers chose a suitcase
with money inside.)

694
00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:00,300
(The money the employees have
will be the company's seed money.)

695
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,270
(Se Chan: 500 dollars)

696
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,600
(Joohoney: 800 dollars,
Jae Seok: 800 dollars)

697
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,670
(Daniel: 1,000 dollars,
Jong Kook: 1,000 dollars)

698
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,340
(Ye Eun: 1,200 dollars)

699
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,670
Is this considered a lot?

700
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,080
This isn't an amount
I've seen on Running Man before.

701
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,580
(Seok Sam: 1,500 dollars)

702
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,180
Even 100 dollars is a lot
on Running Man.

703
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,150
That's the equivalent
of 10,000 dollars in real life.

704
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,620
(Who will he choose?)

705
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,350
- I'll join you.
- Thank you!

706
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,020
- He chose the youngest CEO.
- The visuals!

707
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,020
Thank you.

708
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,660
- Mr. Yang.
- Yes?

709
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,460
I'll keep your secret.

710
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,390
I won't ever mention one of the two.

711
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,560
One of the two?

712
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,030
I'll go with her.

713
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,200
(Se Chan joins her company
with a nondisclosure clause added.)

714
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,830
- Congratulations.
- Right, thank you.

715
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,770
- I'll join Eun Bi's company.
- General Manager Yu, thank you.

716
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,040
Seok Sam, I hope we get along.

717
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,870
I wish for that too, but...

718
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,810
- I'll join this company.
- That was a wise choice!

719
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,140
We have a great team.

720
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,450
Ye Eun and Daniel...

721
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,750
- join Ji Hyo's company.
- You'll receive the penalty today.

722
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,950
We're doomed.

723
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,380
I'll now share how much...

724
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,190
- each company has.
- Right away?

725
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,660
Haha's company has 1,800 dollars.

726
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,660
Eun Bi's company has 2,800 dollars.

727
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,700
The money I had is a lot.

728
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,200
- Ji Hyo's company...
- It was quite a lot.

729
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,070
- has 2,200 dollars.
- What?

730
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,600
- That's amazing!
- Okay.

731
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,840
- Here's the name...
- Ye Eun, Ji Hyo, and me.

732
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,540
of today's race.

733
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,710
It's Dear CEO, Give Me the Salary.

734
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,180
After comparing your salaries,

735
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,680
the five people
with the highest salaries...

736
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,510
will receive prizes
fitting their ranks.

737
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,550
The other five
will receive a penalty.

738
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,490
Whenever a company makes a profit
through a game or mission,

739
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,190
the CEO will split it evenly...

740
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,520
with the employees.

741
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
I see, it's even.

742
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,090
However, the employees won't know...

743
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,730
how much they received.

744
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,400
- We'll be in the dark.
- After working...

745
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,600
for half a day, the employees get...

746
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,770
what's called a complaint ticket.

747
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,810
You can use it to report
to the Ministry of Labor.

748
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,580
If you trust your CEO
to the very end...

749
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,140
and don't report,

750
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,550
the money in your account...

751
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,880
will double.

752
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,490
(By not reporting their CEO,
they will double their money.)

753
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,150
- If we don't report them?
- That's right.

754
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,390
- You must trust us.
- This says a lot.

755
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,460
If you did report your CEO...

756
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,230
and the CEO embezzled money
rather than...

757
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,060
- distributing it evenly,
- Do we get caught?

758
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,200
that company will go bankrupt.

759
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,200
The CEO's money...

760
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,400
will be shared among the employees.

761
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,470
I doubt they'll embezzle.

762
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,340
- I wouldn't.
- We can report at the right time.

763
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,010
If you report your CEO,

764
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,910
but the CEO is innocent...

765
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,810
- and has shared the money evenly,
- I'd never.

766
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,250
the employees...

767
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,550
will not be able to report
the CEO again.

768
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,120
- That means...
- We're free to embezzle.

769
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,360
- You wouldn't be able...
- We'll be free to embezzle.

770
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,020
to report your CEO
even if they embezzle.

771
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,160
It's all about the timing.

772
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,790
- At the end...
- How many rounds are there?

773
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,160
We'll know
when we see them share the money.

774
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,600
- He'll embezzle for sure.
- You will distribute money...

775
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,560
over the course of four rounds.

776
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,530
If the CEO turns out
to be innocent...

777
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,070
after being reported
in the first round,

778
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,540
- Will it be over?
- you can't report them again.

779
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,540
- They'll do so in the end.
- Wait till the last round.

780
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,840
I might not embezzle
in the last round.

781
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,070
No way.

782
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,540
The two CEOs likely to embezzle...

783
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,880
- are Ms. Kwon and Mr. Ha.
- Exactly.

784
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,080
- Ms. Kwon's ability...
- They can be cunning.

785
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,350
Ms. Song isn't the type to embezzle.

786
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,690
You never know.

787
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,190
People like her could betray you.

788
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,720
I don't embezzle.

789
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,390
Exactly. She's not the type.

790
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,660
All right, then.
Your first salaries...

791
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,060
will be paid out.

792
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,600
- Share it evenly.
- The rule is to share it evenly.

793
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,460
You can report your CEO...

794
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,170
if you think they embezzled.

795
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,470
- Still,
- It's obvious to me.

796
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,170
- they can't confirm it yet.
- We have 2,800 dollars in total.

797
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,570
They wouldn't report us
right off the bat.

798
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,110
- I wouldn't.
- Ms. Kwon.

799
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,580
- Jae Seok.
- Don't you know us?

800
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,840
Report them right away.

801
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,880
You'd get double the money
if you don't.

802
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,980
- This is driving me crazy.
- Haha, go ahead...

803
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,320
- and split the money.
- Isn't it driving you crazy?

804
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,190
I'm doomed.

805
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,660
This is crazy.

806
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,960
(CEO Ha enters the bank first.)

807
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,690
I'm going crazy.
What am I supposed to do?

808
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,900
Jong Kook will know
if I do anything funny.

809
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,200
The profit your company made...

810
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,530
is 1,800 dollars.

811
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,200
Split the money
among the three of you.

812
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,410
Will he suspect me from the start?

813
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,970
If he thought I was chicken,

814
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,940
he'd think I wouldn't embezzle
in the first round.

815
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,180
What if I embezzled money...

816
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,780
in the first round...

817
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,210
and got reported right away?

818
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,080
I'll go bankrupt.

819
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,720
Darn.

820
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,850
Think how Jong Kook is.

821
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,260
"I should trust Haha."

822
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,690
"No way. There's no way
he'd play it fair."

823
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,960
Because I'm a cheater
and scammer on this show,

824
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,900
he'll assume...

825
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,830
that I'll embezzle
in the first round.

826
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,700
(He thinks Jong Kook will accuse him
of embezzling in the first round.)

827
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,370
We're not exactly a team, are we?

828
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,840
It all comes down to who has
the most money when the race ends.

829
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,650
Darn, the mind games.

830
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,320
A CEO must be transparent
for the company to stay strong.

831
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,520
We should stick together as a team.
This counts as credibility...

832
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,250
and trust.

833
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,820
It's a promise we made.

834
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,860
All done.

835
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,420
They'll suspect something's off
because I took too long.

836
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,160
(CEO Kwon enters next.)

837
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,730
Can I embezzle
from the company already?

838
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,130
(A lower number will save the team,)

839
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,800
(but a bigger number will save me.)

840
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,440
(She went...)

841
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,940
(all in.)

842
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,310
(Promise me
you won't be back on this show.)

843
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,180
(You're banned from SBS.)

844
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,480
(The tiger moth stabbed them
in the back...)

845
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,780
(the first time
she was on the show!)

846
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,850
We get three more chances
to do this, right?

847
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,320
For now...

848
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,350
(Eun Visual's profit: 2,800 dollars)

849
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,690
I'll start...

850
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,390
by embezzling.

851
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,360
I feel bad...

852
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,860
for Se Chan.

853
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,530
He can report me if he wants.

854
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,900
(How much of the 2,800 dollars
did she embezzle?)

855
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,400
CEO Song, the profit made
by your company, IUB,

856
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,970
is 2,200 dollars.

857
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,140
They can report me after lunch?

858
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,280
(IUB's profit: 2,200 dollars)

859
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,340
First,

860
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,950
since it's their first salary,

861
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,450
I'll share it evenly.

862
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,920
(The kind CEO chose to be loyal.)

863
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,620
I'll trust them for now.

864
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,750
(Business should be transparent.)

865
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,250
The first round of salaries
has been paid out.

866
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,420
- Is it done?
- Yes.

867
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,820
Ji Hyo, let's do our best today.

868
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,390
- Let's win today.
- I really want to win.

869
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,030
- I split the money evenly.
- Hold on.

870
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,500
- Really?
- Hear me out.

871
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,960
I didn't embezzle.

872
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,260
- I didn't.
- CEO Kwon, I'm trusting you.

873
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,700
All right!

874
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,600
You'll regroup
after changing clothes.

875
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,070
- Let's change clothes.
- Let's go!

876
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,540
You wouldn't report me
after the first round.

877
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,140
- You obviously don't know us.
- Just report them.

878
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,180
Where's Employee Jee?
Where's his head at?

879
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,350
Shouldn't the staffer be here first?

880
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,720
Ms. Kwon, how could you?

881
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,150
- Don't you know how old I am?
- You're a staffer.

882
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,520
- How can I be just a staffer?
- Employee Jee.

883
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,160
As if your age means a thing.
Just sit.

884
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,790
- Employee Jee...
- Just sit?

885
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,790
- I...
- Seriously?

886
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,200
I'm Manager Yang.

887
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,000
- I'm just saying that...
- Read the room, will you?

888
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,330
- He talks too loudly.
- He can't read the room.

889
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,870
The first month's salary
was given out.

890
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,440
It's time to do
your first work task.

891
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,710
- What's that?
- Okay.

892
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,510
Whatever it is, let's win first.

893
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,840
- Let's get to work.
- Let's go.

894
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,710
The first task is called
Up-and-down Desk Check.

895
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,620
- What's that?
- You must test the durability...

896
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,290
- of the desk you'll sell.
- The durability?

897
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,060
You start lying on top of the desk.

898
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,260
You must cling to the top side
as you do...

899
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,690
a full circle
without falling to the floor.

900
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,690
(They must circle the top
without falling off.)

901
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,060
Does that make sense?

902
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,330
- Gosh...
- Does that make sense?

903
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,600
- How?
- Each time someone succeeds,

904
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,500
that team wins 1,000 dollars...

905
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,470
- per successful attempt.
- And we split that.

906
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,510
- Hey, we need to win.
- Yes.

907
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,510
- We must.
- Gosh, this is...

908
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,510
The team of four
has to split the money equally,

909
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,880
- and that's unfair.
- Yes.

910
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,520
In this round, if all 4 succeed,
they can win 4,000 dollars.

911
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,220
- You must allow that.
- Yes.

912
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,890
We'll allow it this time because
you'll be disadvantaged later on.

913
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,160
- Jae Seok, Eun Bi's really fit.
- She is.

914
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,590
- Stuff like this...
- Our CEO's really athletic.

915
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,230
- Gosh.
- Ms. Kwon. You can run.

916
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,230
Do it for us.

917
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,400
Employee Jee.
You got better and brown-nosing.

918
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,200
- Yes.
- You must win.

919
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,400
Shall we play to decide
who goes first?

920
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,210
- Ms. Kwon.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

921
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,270
Come on up, CEOs.

922
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,270
Rock-paper-scissors.

923
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,410
We'll go last.

924
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,980
We have a slightly narrower table
for the women.

925
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,050
- Oh, really?
- The men will go first,

926
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,420
then we'll switch tables
so the women can have a go.

927
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,320
You can go one by one.

928
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,690
- Seok Sam, how about you?
- Me?

929
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,990
- How do I...
- You go up.

930
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,390
Good luck, Employee Jee.

931
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,030
I need to stretch out first.

932
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,330
That's right.

933
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,530
(The oldest employee shows
he still has it!)

934
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,770
How will you manage, Seok Jin?

935
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,900
I'll just give it a go.
There's not much to life.

936
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,670
- Why are you doing push-ups?
- Don't do it.

937
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,910
- Don't do that.
- How cool would it look...

938
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,210
- if I do it?
- Watch how you fall.

939
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,440
- He's wasting his energy.
- Don't try too hard.

940
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,540
- Do I reach over like this?
- Yes.

941
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,310
- Gosh.
- I feel bad for him.

942
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,980
Watch out when you fall.

943
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,820
- I won't fall.
- Take off your glasses.

944
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,490
My glasses. I could hurt my eyes.

945
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,520
- Take off your necklace.
- I don't have one on.

946
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,660
No, your staff ID.

947
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,960
Take off your pants.

948
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,160
Take off your shirt.

949
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,590
Do it in your underwear.
That might work better.

950
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,300
Take off your wig.

951
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,070
(Grunting)

952
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,230
How do you do this?

953
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,540
Is this how you do it?

954
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,070
Make your top go under first.
Keep your legs on the top.

955
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,710
- Like this?
- That's it.

956
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,910
Bend more.

957
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,840
- It's fine. You can go further.
- That's it.

958
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,710
You can go further. Don't be scared.

959
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,710
- No. Don't be scared.
- Your upper body...

960
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,580
He can't reach the underside at all.

961
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,420
Don't be scared.
Grab the other side.

962
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,690
(He's just looking at the floor.)

963
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,490
Don't be scared.
Grab the other side.

964
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,560
Your arm...

965
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,060
Don't be scared.
Employee Jee. Don't be scared.

966
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,360
I'm not scared, punk.

967
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,400
- Come on.
- Don't talk like that.

968
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,200
- Wait. I'll do my best.
- Employee Jee.

969
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,600
So will I.

970
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,400
I'll do my best.
I'll look cool if I do this.

971
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,600
- You'd be a real man.
- It would be so cool.

972
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,410
(The old man's attempt)

973
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,570
How cool would it be?

974
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,810
(He got a hold!)

975
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,010
(How cool would it be?)

976
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,780
(Failed)

977
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,190
(A miserable fall)

978
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,220
- He meant to grab hold and...
- Hey.

979
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,320
Did someone fling him down?

980
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,490
- Hey.
- I'm so embarrassed.

981
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,530
Why did you do so many push-ups?

982
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,360
- Oh, no.
- I'm so embarrassed.

983
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,360
That's so embarrassing.
I got a hold of the other side.

984
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,500
Niel's first.

985
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,930
- Assistant Manager Choi.
- Yes. Okay.

986
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,900
- I'll do it.
- How do you do this?

987
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,940
- Ms. Song. I'll win us a grand.
- Do it.

988
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,240
- Thank you.
- Sure.

989
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,370
I'm up.

990
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,340
You need strength to cling on.

991
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,480
Let's see.

992
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,210
It's a new method.

993
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,310
Hang on.

994
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,080
- Everyone has their own way.
- You took off your glasses too?

995
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,420
I think it's impossible. That's it.

996
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,050
- That's it.
- Yes!

997
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,060
- Yes, your leg.
- That's it.

998
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,320
- That's it.
- My gosh!

999
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,790
- That's it. Good.
- Yes!

1000
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,230
- He has such long legs.
- Yes.

1001
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,600
- This is key.
- This is the tough part.

1002
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,270
- This is key.
- Now it's hard.

1003
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,270
It's no joke.

1004
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,640
Yes, Daniel!

1005
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,170
You'll look charming if you succeed.

1006
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,570
- You can make it!
- Hang on.

1007
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,680
- Come on. That's it.
- Keep going.

1008
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,280
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

1009
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,610
- He'll manage.
- You can do it!

1010
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,710
You can do it!

1011
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,350
- You can do it!
- Come on.

1012
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,350
(He barely pulls up his upper body.)
Come on.

1013
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,620
You can do it!

1014
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,060
(He's back up!)

1015
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,890
- You can do it!
- I did it!

1016
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,430
I did it!

1017
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,260
- I did it!
- You did it!

1018
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,130
- My gosh.
- Niel, you did it.

1019
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,260
It's no joke.

1020
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,900
- Is this doable?
- Maybe everyone can do it.

1021
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,000
- Niel's good at something.
- He managed.

1022
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,500
He's good at climbing around desks.

1023
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,040
Niel, you're good at this.

1024
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,070
You have to lean under
and grab the other side.

1025
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,310
This is how you do it.

1026
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,410
Joohoney, you can do it, right?

1027
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,880
- Good luck. Warm up first.
- Thanks.

1028
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,350
My palms get really sweaty.

1029
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,320
This round...

1030
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,620
- He's built to do this.
- Sergeant Lee.

1031
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,950
(A core that brings him back up...)

1032
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,420
(and legs of a bull)

1033
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,330
(Sergeant Lee
just got discharged in January.)

1034
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,960
Sergeant Lee!

1035
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,500
- Sergeant Lee.
- You can do it.

1036
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,760
My doppelganger.

1037
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,400
Joohoney, you have to do it.

1038
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,000
- He can manage.
- Sergeant Lee.

1039
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,570
- He can manage.
- Are you doing it?

1040
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:46,870
Sergeant Lee.

1041
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,900
Hang on.

1042
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,540
- Sergeant Lee.
- Hang on.

1043
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,710
(He wobbles as soon as he starts.)

1044
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,210
- Sergeant Lee.
- Hang on.

1045
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,780
- Hang on.
- Are you doing it?

1046
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,450
- I'll start now.
- Sergeant Lee.

1047
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,120
- Wait.
- Seok Jin's hoping you'll fall.

1048
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,020
- Try hard.
- But...

1049
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,320
Your palms are sweaty, right?

1050
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,020
- Oh, gosh.
- Joohoney, you too...

1051
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,060
Keep your legs still
and reach over with just your arms.

1052
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,860
- I can't reach.
- Wait.

1053
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,190
- I can't reach.
- Sergeant Lee.

1054
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,400
- Yes?
- He's flustered.

1055
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,600
- Sergeant Lee.
- Don't do that.

1056
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,700
Keep your legs still and crawl under
with your upper body.

1057
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,800
- Like this?
- That's it.

1058
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,330
- Yes.
- Yes, do that.

1059
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,400
That's it.

1060
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
(He grabbed the other side.)

1061
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,670
- That's it.
- That's it.

1062
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,310
- You must crawl under.
- Yes, do that.

1063
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,170
That's it.

1064
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,210
- That's it.
- Yes, right.

1065
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,810
This is the hard part.

1066
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,350
Joohoney's incredible.

1067
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,550
(Lips pursed tight)

1068
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,920
- Sergeant Lee.
- Climb up top first.

1069
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,420
(He starts climbing
with pure willpower.)

1070
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,990
- Yes. Grab hold.
- Wait!

1071
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:40,420
- No, wait!
- Sergeant Lee.

1072
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,390
- Hang on!
- Sergeant Lee.

1073
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,190
- What now?
- What are you doing, Sergeant Lee?

1074
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,190
I want to get up too.

1075
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,800
- Sergeant Lee.
- Wait!

1076
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,900
It's normal, Joohoney.

1077
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,000
- Sergeant Lee.
- Grab hold right here.

1078
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,970
(Greatly disappointed)

1079
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,510
Climb up. It's now or never.

1080
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,310
Grab hold right here. That's it.

1081
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,340
- That's it.
- Gosh, what?

1082
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,910
- You must keep going.
- Now climb up.

1083
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,010
Grab hold.
Reach over and pull upward.

1084
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,280
That's it, okay! You're doing it.

1085
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,680
- Hold on.
- Grab hold.

1086
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,120
- Don't let go now.
- Sergeant Lee.

1087
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,890
I'm out of energy. I'm drained.

1088
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:12,990
No, wait.

1089
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,920
Don't give up. It's a waste.

1090
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,060
Ggyuggyukkakka. You can do it.

1091
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,060
- He got it.
- He's up.
He got it.

1092
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,600
Joohoney. You must do it now!

1093
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,230
- Do it.
- Ggyuggyukkakka.

1094
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,870
- Come on. Ggyuggyukkakka.
- Ggyuggyukkakka.

1095
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,970
- Hold on and keep going.
- Grab hold and pull up.

1096
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,510
- You're almost there. That's it.
- You got it.

1097
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,870
- Pull your leg through.
- You got it.

1098
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,880
- Go.
- You're almost there.

1099
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,310
Do we have to shoot like this?

1100
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,580
Do we have to shoot like this?

1101
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,450
Stop wailing and go.

1102
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:44,850
Sergeant Lee.
Let's go, Sergeant Lee.

1103
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,990
(He failed.)

1104
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,590
Sergeant Lee. It was fun.

1105
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,260
- You know...
- It was fun.

1106
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,800
Jae Seok, it would be amazing
if you were to do it.

1107
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,430
- How do you do this?
- This task...

1108
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:56,430
- I think Jae Seok will do it.
- It's not easy.

1109
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,400
- It's hard to climb back up.
- Niel...

1110
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,700
Good luck, Vice-CEO Yu.

1111
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,470
You know,
Jae Seok's built like Bruce Lee.

1112
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,910
He has a strong core.

1113
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,840
- This part...
- Jae Seok's built like Bruce Lee.

1114
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,310
- How do you do that?
- He's light.

1115
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,010
- You have to be careful.
- What... Are you a spider?

1116
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,850
Cheeky kids are good at this.

1117
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,020
(He pulls up
his upper body lightly.)

1118
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,090
What are you?
How are you doing this?

1119
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,790
- Watch out.
- Hang on.

1120
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,560
You just have to grab this side.

1121
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,290
(He's doing it just like this?)

1122
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,000
- You got it.
- This is so hard.

1123
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,260
This is the worst part.

1124
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,400
You need to manage this part.

1125
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,600
This is the worst part.

1126
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,800
Hang onto the desk
with your front teeth.

1127
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,900
- Use your front teeth. Yes.
- Don't move!

1128
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,400
- Hang on.
- Bite the table.

1129
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,870
- Use your teeth.
- Can he manage?

1130
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,770
Be quiet, Employee Jee!

1131
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,180
Hold on with your right hand.

1132
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,780
- Move.
- He got it.

1133
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,810
He got it.

1134
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,810
(He ignores them
and keeps climbing!)

1135
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,920
- Move.
- Gosh.

1136
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,080
- He got it.
- He got it.

1137
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,220
He got it.

1138
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,220
(Success!)

1139
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:53,390
(Jae Seok succeeds,
despite his teammate's sabotage!)

1140
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,490
(Bravo, Vice-CEO Yu.)

1141
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,730
It's so hard to get back up.

1142
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,060
How impressive is that?
That's amazing.

1143
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,270
How do you do that?

1144
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,270
Well done.

1145
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,700
It's exhausting.

1146
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,970
You're really something.

1147
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,440
- Jae Seok's incredible.
- That was crazy.

1148
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,010
Employee Jee.
Fill your own food bowl.

1149
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,210
- "Food bowl?"
- Make yourself worthwhile.

1150
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,110
We have other missions too.

1151
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,310
Haha, you're next.

1152
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,880
- Let's go.
- Shoot.

1153
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,680
- You must do it.
- Good luck, Mr. Ha.

1154
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,520
- Good luck.
- Okay.

1155
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,920
Let's go. Let's do this.

1156
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,320
Let's become a star.

1157
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,660
He has been working out,
and he has sturdy legs.

1158
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,200
- Hang on.
- His calves look like drumsticks.

1159
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,900
- Drumsticks?
- Gosh.

1160
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,770
- You need to reach.
- He's short.

1161
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,900
Haha has a long reach
or lynch or something.

1162
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,670
The drumsticks... He's done for.

1163
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,270
- He got a hold?
- You got it.

1164
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,340
Okay.

1165
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,910
- Hang on. This part right now...
- Okay.

1166
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,750
- Hey, don't fall asleep.
- It's caught.

1167
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,510
- What is?
- My penis is caught.

1168
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,120
(It's pinched.)

1169
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,150
(It effing hurts.)

1170
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,490
(He ends up falling.)

1171
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:05,660
(CEO Ha gave up on having
a fourth child for his company.)

1172
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,960
There's nothing to get caught.

1173
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,530
- Your little...
- What's wrong with you?

1174
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,500
- Don't lie.
- It got pinched.

1175
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,570
Reach with your right hand
and get the other side.

1176
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,300
That's it.
You can manage if you grab hold.

1177
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,610
You did it!

1178
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,440
- He's going upside-down?
- To do what?

1179
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,280
Hey...

1180
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,850
- You got it.
- You must do this for your wife.

1181
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,550
- Like that?
- That was easy.

1182
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,450
(It was as easy
as getting out of bed.)

1183
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,480
Like that?

1184
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,520
Like that?

1185
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
You can do that?

1186
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,390
- Is he even human?
- He made it look so easy.

1187
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,060
- It's 1,000 dollars.
- Only Jong Kook succeeded,

1188
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,690
so your company gets 1,000 dollars.

1189
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,460
Eun Bi, if you succeed,
then your company...

1190
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,000
- Then, it's 3,000 dollars.
- can get up to 3,000 dollars.

1191
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,940
Also, for Ji Hyo's company,
if both of you succeed,

1192
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,870
- you can earn up to 3,000 dollars.
- Okay.

1193
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,740
Now, the desk is narrower.

1194
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,810
There's a higher possibility.

1195
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,410
- You can do it.
- Should Eun Bi go first?

1196
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,910
- Okay.
- Eun Bi is so cool.

1197
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,650
- I think you can do this.
- Eun Bi is athletic too.

1198
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,480
- You're a good athlete.
- Do plenty of stretching.

1199
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,020
I think
Eun Bi will be able to do it.

1200
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,080
- She used to do track and field.
- She has long arms and legs.

1201
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,950
- She did track and field.
- She has long limbs.

1202
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,050
Ms. Kwon, do a good job.

1203
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,990
- She used to do track and field.
- She has long arms and legs.

1204
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,060
- I think she'll be able to do it.
- She has long limbs.

1205
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,190
She can do it.

1206
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,760
- Gosh, already... She's doing it.
- Hey, you've got this.

1207
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,360
You've got it.

1208
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,430
Gosh, no way.

1209
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:18,900
(She goes 270º around in no time.)

1210
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,500
- My gosh.
- Gosh, what?

1211
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,900
Okay, this is the hard part.

1212
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,370
- All right, Ms. Kwon.
- This is insane.

1213
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,570
- Eun Bi.
- Right, you have to get up.

1214
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,280
- You have to get over this part.
- I can't...

1215
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,640
No, you can do it, Eun Bi.

1216
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,680
Pull hard with this hand.

1217
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,710
- Tighten your core.
- That's right.

1218
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,050
No. That's it.

1219
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,080
- There you go.
- You've got it.

1220
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,450
- That's it.
- Gosh, what a shame.

1221
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,890
(Flipping over)

1222
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,520
(Kwon Eun Bi suddenly succeeds.)

1223
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,060
Hey, Eun Bi!

1224
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,960
- Eun Bi, you've succeeded.
- Hey, Eun Bi!

1225
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,560
So, you've earned 3,000 dollars.

1226
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,600
I feel dizzy myself.

1227
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,300
- Nice.
- Gosh, that was so cool.

1228
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,770
Hey, you're cool.

1229
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,000
- She's athletic.
- All right.

1230
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,770
(Ms. Kwon lived up to her title
of CEO.)

1231
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,170
- How did you do that?
- Hey, you figured out how to do it.

1232
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,240
(Next, it's Ms. Song's turn.)

1233
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,310
All right, Ms. Song.

1234
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,610
I think Ji Hyo will pull it off.

1235
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,710
- Be careful with your head.
- Yes, I think Ji Hyo will do it.

1236
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,310
- I think you'll be able to do it.
- Watch your head.

1237
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,450
All right, Ms. Song.

1238
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,820
But she has short arms.

1239
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,050
- Oh, nice.
- Hey, that's a good start.

1240
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,150
- Nice.
- Hey, you've got this.

1241
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,590
- She's incredible.
- Ji Hyo is really strong.

1242
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,260
(Lifting herself up)

1243
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,690
Gosh, she's so strong.

1244
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,790
There you go.

1245
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,390
- That's it.
- You've got it, Ji Hyo.

1246
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,490
- Yes, that's it.
- There you go.

1247
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,260
- You've got it, Ji Hyo.
- Yes, that's it.

1248
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,800
- There you go.
- You're almost there.

1249
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,830
(She got both legs up!)

1250
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,500
- Will you give my bottom a boost?
- Ji Hyo, use the rebound.

1251
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,840
(Will you give my bottom a boost?)

1252
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,370
We can't do that for you.

1253
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,580
Will you give my bottom a boost?

1254
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,140
- I wish I could.
- You can go straight up from there.

1255
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,980
This looks like a magic show
right now.

1256
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,580
Ji Hyo, you look like you're doing
a section illusion.

1257
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,020
It looks like magic.

1258
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,080
(Ta-da)

1259
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,890
It looks like your upper
and lower bodies are separated.

1260
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,350
Your upper and lower bodies
have been separated.

1261
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,790
Are you sure these are your legs?

1262
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,820
You ran out of strength.
You can't help it, though.

1263
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,960
- That was so close.
- You were nearly there.

1264
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,630
- Gosh, what a shame.
- You were our ace.

1265
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,330
- Who's next?
- Okay, Ddochi.

1266
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,700
- I'll bet all my money on Ddochi.
- Hey, Ddochi.

1267
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,970
- I bet she'll fail.
- But this is...

1268
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,130
Ddochi, I think you will...

1269
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,970
just flop right off from here. Flop!

1270
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,000
- Ddochi, try it.
- No, but really.

1271
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,870
Gosh,
I really don't have any strength.

1272
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,570
But you have long arms and legs.

1273
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,710
Ye Eun, you can do it.

1274
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,640
Her arms might go around like this
like a spider.

1275
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,810
Try it.

1276
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,080
(The pink spider sure is long.)

1277
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,210
Try it.

1278
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,050
- That's it.
- She's doing it.

1279
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,720
- Ye Eun.
- Try it.

1280
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,320
The viewers are all looking
at your bottom. What will you do?

1281
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,420
What do I do?

1282
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,760
"Don't look!"

1283
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,890
Just try it.

1284
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,960
You can do it
since you have long limbs.

1285
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,090
- Go underneath...
- I'm already tired at this point.

1286
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,900
Ye Eun, you can do it.

1287
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,330
Ye Eun.

1288
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,100
The two million members of
the Chungju Jee clan are watching.

1289
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,300
- Ddochi.
- Show them.

1290
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,170
- Then, bring that leg to this side.
- Your leg...

1291
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,470
- That's it.
- I can't...

1292
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,570
- get past this point.
- No, but...

1293
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,670
- Just try it.
- You can swing around now.

1294
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,310
Little by little. Oh, nice!

1295
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,380
Ddochi.

1296
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,080
- Hook your foot on there.
- That's it.

1297
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,680
(Flop)

1298
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,750
That's it.

1299
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:46,420
(Unable to hold her on weight up,
she falls down.)

1300
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,250
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

1301
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,350
- Gosh, you guys are so mean.
- You can't help it. It's too hard.

1302
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,790
I mean, I don't have any strength
in my arms.

1303
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,790
- This is way too hard.
- You did a good job.

1304
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,390
- The first task is finished.
- You did a good job.

1305
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,530
- So...
- This...

1306
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,430
- Yes, 3,000 dollars!
- Gosh, 3,000 dollars.

1307
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,230
- Gosh, our team is awesome.
- We got 3,000 dollars!

1308
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,430
Hey, thanks.

1309
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,500
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1310
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,600
- You should resign.
- From Haha's company...

1311
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,400
From Haha's company,
only one person succeeded,

1312
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,940
- so you made 1,000 dollars. Also,
- Gosh, Joohoney was so close too.

1313
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,740
Ji Hyo's company only had
one person succeed,

1314
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,740
- so you've made 1,000 dollars.
- This isn't easy.

1315
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,710
All right, then.
you will move one at a time...

1316
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,680
to receive your salary.

1317
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,220
Just to let you know,
half of the day hasn't gone by yet.

1318
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,820
- Still?
- You can start making complaints...

1319
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,420
after lunchtime.

1320
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,720
I'm working this hard,
but you're going to complain about me?

1321
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,960
- I won't.
- Ms. Kwon.

1322
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,220
- Then, Haha, you will go first.
- Okay.

1323
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,430
I'll just divide it evenly
for everyone.

1324
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,460
Oh, okay.

1325
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,160
Just trust me, Jong Kook.

1326
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,200
- Hey, I worked hard this time.
- All right. I will seriously...

1327
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,530
He'll give us equal amounts, right?

1328
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,800
I'm sure, since he's probably scared
not to do that right now.

1329
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,510
- So, I think he will.
- We have 3,000 dollars now.

1330
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,640
- Well, we didn't make much money.
- So, 4 times 7 is 28.

1331
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,880
Just until this round,

1332
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,210
I'll play defense.

1333
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,780
They will suspect me this time,

1334
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,750
so I have to make them
file a complaint against me.

1335
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,550
Please file a complaint.

1336
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,150
Please.

1337
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,450
Please.

1338
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,660
This time...

1339
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,920
(Next, CEO Song...)

1340
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,190
Gosh, Niel is better than I thought.

1341
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,590
I'll go with this for now.

1342
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,060
My poor employees.

1343
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,700
They're working so hard
with all their trust in me.

1344
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,900
I'll have to embezzle money
right away.

1345
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,000
(I'll have to embezzle money
right away.)

1346
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
(The Tiger Moth CEO chooses
to embezzle money, indeed.)

1347
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,270
That's it.

1348
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,210
- Eun Bi.
- Seriously.

1349
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,680
- It was so sweet, wasn't it?
- I really...

1350
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,210
- Honestly, it was sweet, right?
- I was really fair.

1351
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,310
- No, this was for our company.
- It's worth contemplating.

1352
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,210
- Hey, Ms. Kwon.
- Ms. Kwon, this...

1353
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,480
I'm the type
who's likely to complain.

1354
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,020
Gosh, you seriously can't complain.

1355
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,250
- If you...
- I'm going to, right after we eat.

1356
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,220
We can earn double, for real.

1357
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,960
I'm going to file a complaint
right after we eat.

1358
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
- We divided that up, right?
- Out of the 3,000 dollars,

1359
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,260
- I put 2,000 in.
- Then, she divided 3,000 dollars.

1360
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,630
- If you divide 5,800 dollars,
- So...

1361
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,030
- I should have about this much.
- Seriously, stop that.

1362
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,700
Stop talking such nonsense.

1363
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,700
Do you know what Ms. Kwon
just said to me over here?

1364
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,100
She said she gave me 2,000
out of 3,000 dollars.

1365
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,670
Gosh, I'm sure she did something.

1366
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:53,310
So, you've been given
your second salary payments.

1367
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,610
You may use
your complaint tickets...

1368
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,180
with the Ministry of Labor...

1369
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,710
- after lunch.
- Yes, I'll file one right away.

1370
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,520
Now, it's time for lunch,
which is what office workers...

1371
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,980
wait for the most.

1372
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,690
Since it's your first day at work,
you will go with your own company...

1373
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,820
- and enjoy your lunch...
- Oh, with the CEO?

1374
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,960
- with the CEO.
- With the CEO.

1375
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,490
- Nice.
- You can pay for your meals...

1376
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,460
according to each company's policy.

1377
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,030
Then, we'll calculate that
into your final remaining balance.

1378
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,530
Are there any restaurants in here?

1379
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,700
- The cafeteria.
- It's hot outside.

1380
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,400
It's hot outside.

1381
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,540
- Shall we go, then?
- According to company policy...

1382
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,840
- Yes, thank you!
- Let's go.

1383
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,840
- We have plenty of money right now.
- We do.

1384
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,340
- Gosh, right now, we are...
- Ms. Kwon.

1385
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,940
- Right now, I...
- I like pork cutlet.

1386
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,910
- You should starve.
- A thick piece of pork cutlet.

1387
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,350
What should we eat?

1388
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:32,680
The cafeteria has good food too.

1389
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,250
- That's good too.
- Oh, you're right.

1390
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,850
- Then, I want...
- Do we have the time?

1391
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,820
Where is it? Is there
a cafeteria in the basement here?

1392
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,460
- There isn't, is there?
- The cafeteria is upstairs.

1393
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,190
I'm okay with anything.

1394
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,260
- Or how about this?
- Since I'm the CEO,

1395
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,660
- I'll follow your opinion.
- Ms. Kwon.

1396
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,360
You know, Ms. Kwon,

1397
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,800
I know it may be awkward
to talk about money...

1398
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,900
- before our meal, but...
- Come on, Vice-CEO Yu.

1399
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,000
- You should be clear...
- Let's talk when we're on our own.

1400
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,500
- Do you want me to complain or not?
- But...

1401
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,800
we're going to file complaints
after we eat.

1402
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,440
- Do you want me to or not?
- I'll refuel and get right to it.

1403
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,610
Please tell us.

1404
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,640
Not now.

1405
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,680
- Now is not the time.
- But this is...

1406
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,540
But Ms. Kwon, why did you say
to Jae Seok earlier...

1407
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,510
- that you gave him 2,000 dollars?
- Well, honestly,

1408
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,650
I was going to pocket money.

1409
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,320
- Oh, really? Really?
- Yes.

1410
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,820
- She was going to pocket money?
- She's honest.

1411
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,290
But you said you'd give me 2,000
out of 3,000 dollars.

1412
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:11,750
Let me just ask you this.

1413
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,120
Do we have different salaries
based on our ranks or not?

1414
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,220
You have different salaries,
to be honest.

1415
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,830
You have different salaries,
to be honest.

1416
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,830
- Then, I have no choice...
- Well...

1417
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:20,660
- but to file a complaint.
- You can't do it by yourself.

1418
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,300
- Hey, but why...
- Sorry. Why not?

1419
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,000
- I mean, you keep talking about...
- You're threatening her.

1420
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,170
- filing a complaint against me.
- Yes?

1421
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,570
You really can't do this right now.

1422
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,240
Did you play the game?

1423
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,710
Did you succeed in the mission?
What on earth did you do?

1424
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,910
What have you done?

1425
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,410
What have you done?

1426
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,980
- She hit you close to the bone.
- I mean...

1427
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,450
- He also...
- We did all the work, you know?

1428
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,480
- Okay.
- Well, that's true.

1429
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,750
All you did was to sit there...

1430
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,250
and eat the crumbs
from all of our work.

1431
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,150
Can you really say that to me?

1432
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,750
- You mean he didn't deserve it?
- That's right.

1433
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,120
- You're a salary thief.
- He's totally a salary thief.

1434
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,890
- You're not wrong, but...
- I know.

1435
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,160
This employee talks too much.

1436
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,690
- Shall I throw him out?
- Yes.

1437
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,590
- Please leave.
- Let's have lunch first.

1438
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,630
- Let me eat, at least.
- Right now...

1439
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,400
- How does the cafeteria sound?
- That sounds good.

1440
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,670
- I like the sound of that.
- Let's go to the cafeteria.

1441
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,000
- Let's get going, then.
- Let's go.

1442
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,500
- Ms. Kwon sure knows what's up.
- My goodness.

1443
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,040
- They serve amazing Korean meals.
- It's nice to have...

1444
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,570
- a good Korean meal after a while.
- Let's go.

1445
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,470
- Sure, it is.
- If you go to the cafeteria,

1446
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,640
how will you pay for your meals?

1447
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,840
- Well, I...
- Let's have a seat for a minute.

1448
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,880
- Let's talk about this.
- No.

1449
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,310
- I've decided.
- Money is a sensitive issue.

1450
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,150
- But...
- I'll take it out of Mr. Yu's pay.

1451
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,480
I'll take it out of Mr. Yu's pay.

1452
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,550
Okay!

1453
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,620
- Great idea. Mr. Yu...
- She really must've paid you 2,000.

1454
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,550
- I gave you a bit more.
- I know.

1455
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,460
- You can take care of it.
- I haven't even seen this money.

1456
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,590
- I haven't even seen it.
- Come on, Mr. Yu.

1457
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,590
But if I say I'll take it
out of your pay,

1458
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,620
that means it really exists.

1459
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,660
- Well...
- I don't know if you're faking...

1460
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,690
- or not.
- Ms. Kwon wouldn't...

1461
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,700
Then, we can't eat.

1462
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,030
- lie to us.
- But Ms. Kwon.

1463
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:30,200
Hang on. It's our first day of work.

1464
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,170
Why aren't you buying us food
and making the Vice-CEO pay?

1465
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,270
- You must've paid him a lot.
- Well,

1466
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,900
I even gave you a high rank.

1467
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,440
I have to check
with my own two eyes...

1468
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,370
that I received 2,000 dollars
in my bank account.

1469
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,940
- Even if we eat this meal,
- I didn't even get to check.

1470
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,110
it'll cost less than 30 dollars.

1471
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,110
- That's right.
- Less than 30 dollars.

1472
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,710
- Why are you being so petty?
- Well, then.

1473
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:45,750
- You can pay, Mr. Jee.
- You pay.

1474
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,850
How about you pay,
Assistant Manager Yang?

1475
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:48,520
- I told you I was a manager.
- I mean, Manager Yang.

1476
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,790
- You keep bringing me down.
- No.

1477
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,820
- She really paid you.
- But she was going to pocket money.

1478
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,520
- Are you really sure, Ms. Kwon?
- I'm sure.

1479
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,720
- Did you really pay me?
- Yes.

1480
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,760
If the money isn't in your account,
we won't be able to eat.

1481
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,860
- My gosh.
- It only costs ten dollars each.

1482
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,560
- That's right.
- In that case, why don't we just...

1483
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,600
pay for ourselves today?

1484
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,830
- Gosh, why are you being so weak?
- Are you serious?

1485
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,230
Assistant Manager Kim. Employee Joo.
What do you think?

1486
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,440
- Is there anything you want to eat?
- Well...

1487
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,900
- Since we're at work,
- Yes?

1488
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,570
we should go to the cafeteria.

1489
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,440
To be honest, the cafeteria has...

1490
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,080
the most bang for its buck.

1491
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,140
- Right.
- The food is good too.

1492
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,510
Let's cut costs
and double our money.

1493
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:18,250
- Then, we can go home.
- Sounds good.

1494
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,920
- There's no need to talk more.
- Not at all.

1495
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,920
Let's go.

1496
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,180
- Things are simple for our team.
- Okay.

1497
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,250
- It's nice and neat.
- So,

1498
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,190
- a meal ticket costs seven dollars.
- Yes.

1499
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,760
This is our first meal together.
It'd be nice if you treated us.

1500
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,590
- Well...
- I also think...

1501
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,790
- you should treat us once...
- Well, I...

1502
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,600
- This one meal...
- I divided our salaries evenly,

1503
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,800
so I think we should split
the costs too.

1504
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,670
All right.
Let me ask you one more time.

1505
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,070
No, really. Just be honest.

1506
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,910
Will you treat us
to our first meal together?

1507
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:45,010
- Or will we split the costs?
- For a wise decision...

1508
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,610
But I don't have to pay, do I?

1509
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,240
What will you do about it?

1510
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,010
I'll kick you.

1511
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,910
(I'll kick you.)

1512
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:53,520
(Assistant Manager Kim hasn't gotten
rid of his gangster habits yet.)

1513
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,850
Hey, is this allowed?

1514
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,420
So, you'll kick me
if I don't buy you food?

1515
00:46:58,090 --> 00:46:59,250
I'll kick you.

1516
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,460
- I'll make it hurt. Yes.
- For real?

1517
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,720
I'll kick you painfully.

1518
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,030
- Then, you.
- Yes?

1519
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,760
- Pay for your own meal.
- Me?

1520
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,530
- You pay for your own meal.
- Why?

1521
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,500
Can't I kick you too?

1522
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,830
(Can't I kick you too?)

1523
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:11,900
You would win.

1524
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,170
- You...
- I could kick you too.

1525
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,470
- You would definitely win.
- In that case,

1526
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:15,670
I'll pay for you.

1527
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,340
- I'll pay. Okay.
- Thank you.

1528
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,710
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
- My goodness.

1529
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,880
Hello.

1530
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,310
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1531
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,280
- Welcome.
- Oh, what is this?

1532
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,320
- My gosh.
- Oh, it's gamjatang.

1533
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,620
You gave me so much meat.

1534
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,020
(Gamjatang with so many chunks
of meat on the bone)

1535
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,760
- Gosh, the buchimgae looks insane.
- Hello.

1536
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,160
- Gosh, this looks insanely good.
- All this costs seven dollars?

1537
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,130
- Gosh, this is a work of art.
- How is it so delicious?

1538
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,860
I haven't tried it yet,
but it's already delicious.

1539
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:44,270
No way. Check out this amazing view.

1540
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,100
(The SBS cafeteria is known
for its view.)

1541
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,240
(A refreshing view that eliminates
any work-related stress)

1542
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,540
This is insane.

1543
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,270
Is this 7 dollars?
How is this only 7 dollars?

1544
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,480
I'll enjoy.

1545
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,380
(A meal of the best value)

1546
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,950
(It tastes good as well!)

1547
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,920
- How can this be 7 dollars?
- How is this only 7 dollars?

1548
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:07,060
(CEO Kwon and her team arrive
at the cafeteria too.)

1549
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,890
- That team is here too.
- This is where they came.

1550
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:10,360
- No way.
- They're here too.

1551
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,890
- Unbelievable.
- They wanted the best value.

1552
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,700
- Please enjoy.
- Where do the meal tickets go?

1553
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,130
I'm sorry, but we close at 1 p.m.,

1554
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,730
- so we're done serving.
- What?

1555
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,840
- What did she say is over?
- For real?

1556
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,600
- No way.
- The galbi? I mean, gamjatang?

1557
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,510
- Do you close at 1 p.m.?
- I'm afraid so.

1558
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,610
(They came 10 minutes
past lunch hour.)

1559
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:27,710
Hold on a second.

1560
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,580
- No way.
- This can't be.

1561
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,710
What's the time?
Is it just past 1 p.m.?

1562
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,380
We should've hurried up here.

1563
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,480
We should've hurried.

1564
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,050
- We should've hurried up here.
- Employee Jee!

1565
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:38,290
You should've been on top of this.

1566
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,020
They serve the best food.

1567
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,360
I badly wanted
what they were serving today.

1568
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,560
What a bummer.

1569
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,760
- Ms. Kwon and her team...
- Yes?

1570
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,530
They couldn't eat here
because the serving ends at 1 p.m.

1571
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,800
- Really?
- Is that so?

1572
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,800
- We were right to get moving.
- What a bummer.

1573
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,700
We probably got in here
at the last minute.

1574
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,610
(CEO Ha and his team,
who got moving quickly,)

1575
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,370
(can eat their hearts out.)

1576
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:02,410
There's a surprising amount of meat
on these bones.

1577
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,520
Seriously.

1578
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,090
(Three male office workers
clean the bones in silence.)

1579
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:11,720
- It's really good.
- I know.

1580
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,320
(Three male office workers
clean the bones in silence.)

1581
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,820
(M F and B company review)

1582
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,290
(Seeking the best value,
prefers gukbap and stir-fried pork)

1583
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,660
(No talking)

1584
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,830
I should eat here when I can.

1585
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,630
- It's really good.
- When I want to eat, I mean.

1586
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,640
Even if we don't win
every game today,

1587
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,340
we can still double our money
if you don't report me.

1588
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,410
Since that's the case,
don't get any funny ideas.

1589
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,340
- Exactly.
- Let's double our money.

1590
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,180
- I'll put most of my trust in you.
- Sure.

1591
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:39,050
I'll repeat myself
since you say otherwise later on.

1592
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,280
I had us all pay for our meals.

1593
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,220
- What do you mean?
- This meal.

1594
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:45,250
(Creeping up)

1595
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,860
What the... I really thought
you were going to hit me.

1596
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:51,030
Why do I feel like...

1597
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,190
the assistant manager
is the CEO instead?

1598
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,600
I'm getting confused.

1599
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,730
(Assistant Manager Kim, CEO Ha)

1600
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,130
- This is a flat organization.
- I see.

1601
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,430
(M F and B company review:
Aiming for a flat organization)

1602
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:02,440
If so, clear my plates for me.

1603
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,610
- Mine too.
- Clear my plates for me.

1604
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,910
Employee Joo.

1605
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,510
- Employee Joo...
- You'll clear my plates.

1606
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,120
- Me?
- Yes.

1607
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,680
What you did upset me so much...

1608
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,420
that I want you to clear my plates.

1609
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,760
That's not tough to do.

1610
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,660
(Sliding)

1611
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,290
- You actually meant it. Sure.
- I did.

1612
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,760
Let's get going.

1613
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,160
Where do the trays go?

1614
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,970
- Employee Joo.
- Yes?

1615
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:31,870
Employee Joo?

1616
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:33,740
(He got caught
trying to leave his tray behind.)

1617
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:34,740
- Employee Joo.
- Yes?

1618
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,510
- Can you help?
- Sure thing.

1619
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:39,740
(Along with
Assistant Manager Kim's tray)

1620
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:40,910
(The figurehead CEO
clears both their trays.)

1621
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,480
Boss, let's grab a cup of coffee.

1622
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,080
Should we play a game
to see who's buying?

1623
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:48,150
No, the coffee's on you.

1624
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:49,180
He said no.

1625
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,320
Can we buy anything we want?

1626
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,920
Yes, anything you want.
Pick just one item each.

1627
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,220
- You said we had ramyeon.
- Choose anything you want.

1628
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,990
Yes, we have ramyeon and coffee.

1629
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,960
We need rice with ramyeon.

1630
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,300
Exactly. We need rice with ramyeon.

1631
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,660
- I'll have the tuna gimbap.
- Tuna mayo.

1632
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,400
Next... We'll have one gimbap each.

1633
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:07,070
- Next?
- Next,

1634
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:08,500
let's pick some more out.

1635
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,810
More?

1636
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,740
Yes. Can't we have some more?

1637
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:14,840
Can't I have a snack?

1638
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:17,810
A snack? Can we afford that?

1639
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:21,080
The combo I like is ramyeon,
gimbap, and a snack.

1640
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,290
Ms. Song!

1641
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,850
- Get over here already.
- I'm over here.

1642
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:26,150
- Unbelievable.
- I just spotted...

1643
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,420
some delicious ice cream.

1644
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,190
No way. No ice cream.

1645
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:31,430
- Kkyu-kkyu.
- Kka-kka.

1646
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,460
(They get their ice cream
by being cute.)

1647
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,400
- Where are we?
- Don't you know?

1648
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,470
I don't.

1649
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,570
This place.

1650
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:40,570
(Where are they headed
with all the food?)

1651
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,340
Is this place...

1652
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:45,070
- Is this your office?
- Is this IUB's office?

1653
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:47,110
- This is IUB's office.
- Is it?

1654
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,410
This is really Ms. Song's office.

1655
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,680
- It's not.
- This is for real.

1656
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,980
There aren't a lot of us,

1657
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,180
and we don't know
what game we'll play next.

1658
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,650
That's why I suggest
we eat lunch for free.

1659
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:58,850
- How can it be for free?
- What?

1660
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,090
- Well...
- How can food be free?

1661
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:02,290
It will be.

1662
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,460
I'll let you have
the tastiest ramyeon.

1663
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,490
(Where did she bring them
to have free ramyeon?)

1664
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:06,900
- They all went out for lunch.
- No way!

1665
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,660
- My gosh!
- It's my first time being here.

1666
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,200
It's a first for me too.

1667
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,230
This is the company's head office.

1668
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:12,400
(IUB office tour)

1669
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,940
It really is IUB's office.

1670
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,470
- Isn't this good?
- It is!

1671
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:18,740
Why are you looking at that?

1672
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,580
He's such a weirdo.

1673
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,780
- There's something wrong with him.
- I was only looking.

1674
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,410
- What's the harm in looking?
- He's looking at women's underwear.

1675
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,080
First of all, the ramyeon
is over there.

1676
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,680
Feel free to have the coffee.

1677
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,850
- This is what you meant.
- Have the coffee.

1678
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:33,050
(IUB: Saving money by utilizing
what the company has)

1679
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,990
(The employees aren't complaining
despite a cheap lunch.)

1680
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:36,360
I haven't had ramyeon in a while.

1681
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,160
- This is what my company offers.
- It's good.

1682
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,330
Manager Yang, let's get searching.

1683
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:41,400
We need to go this way.

1684
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,000
Why do we have to go outside
to have lunch?

1685
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,530
There's a pasta place over there.

1686
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,270
What a nuisance.

1687
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:47,840
How about this, then?

1688
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,040
Where's the Chinese place?

1689
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,170
- The Chinese place?
- Right around the corner.

1690
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,210
Okay, let's have Chinese.

1691
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,240
Jjamppong is always a good option.

1692
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,610
- I like it.
- Fine by me.

1693
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,780
Can we eat whatever dish we want?

1694
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,110
- Of course.
- We'll have a bowl each...

1695
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:58,380
and then order one to share.

1696
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,610
- Tangsuyuk.
- There we go.

1697
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,820
That's going to cost me though.

1698
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,220
- Come on.
- It's hardly a lot.

1699
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,990
- This much you can buy.
- Pork backbone hangover soup!

1700
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:06,190
Sundaeguk
and pork backbone hangover soup.

1701
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:07,920
- That's the place I mentioned.
- Should we go there instead?

1702
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,960
How about
pork backbone hangover soup?

1703
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,990
The noodle place
is right next to it.

1704
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:12,490
What about milmyeon?

1705
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:15,160
- Come on. That's not what I want.
- Milmyeon sounds good.

1706
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,670
Milmyeon's bland.

1707
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,970
That looks good with some makguksu.

1708
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,900
- Let's ask the CEO.
- They have makguksu.

1709
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,500
Makguksu sounds good.

1710
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,170
- That looks good.
- There's seolleongtang.

1711
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:26,340
Seolleongtang, short rib soup,
marinated rib, and Korean beef.

1712
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:27,840
This is the noodle place
I mentioned.

1713
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,410
- Hold on.
- There's pork cutlet.

1714
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:30,880
- Assistant Manager Yang.
- There's pork cutlet.

1715
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,010
- Here.
- Should we eat here?

1716
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:33,680
- They have janchi guksu.
- And spicy noodles.

1717
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,880
This is the noodle place
I mentioned.

1718
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,020
Only eight dollars? Hold on.

1719
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,720
This isn't the kind
of pork cutlet I like.

1720
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,120
(I'm sorry...)

1721
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,360
Come on, Employee Jee.

1722
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,660
- Why...
- I like the thicker ones.

1723
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,730
Are you kidding me?

1724
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:44,830
- Jjamppong?
- This place is popular.

1725
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:45,960
Check this out.

1726
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,000
(They see the Chinese place
Manager Yang recommended.)

1727
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:48,460
How much is the food?

1728
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,900
- About 13 dollars.
- Did you say 13?

1729
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,200
- That's pricey.
- That sounds good.

1730
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,100
- These days...
- CEO Kwon should decide for us.

1731
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,600
A meal here would cost
about 70 dollars in total.

1732
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,640
- So what?
- Ms. Kwon, we...

1733
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,110
- Let's go.
- We won 3,000 dollars earlier.

1734
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,140
Ms. Kwon, wait.

1735
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:03,650
(CEO Kwon quickly
confirms the meal.)

1736
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,280
This place...

1737
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,280
- Hello.
- How many?

1738
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,120
- We're a party of four.
- Can we film in here?

1739
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,190
- Are you going to eat here?
- Yes, right here.

1740
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:14,860
- In there?
- That sounds fine.

1741
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,660
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1742
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:19,030
- This is great.
- I love it.

1743
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:21,230
- It's nice and cool in here.
- This is great.

1744
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,370
You're excited
about having jjamppong.

1745
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,470
Employee Jee.

1746
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,100
- Yes?
- Hold on.

1747
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,970
There are spoons over there.

1748
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:30,140
- The cutlery is over here.
- Ms. Kwon, we have some over here.

1749
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,440
(The low-level staffer just sat
in his seat doing nothing.)

1750
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,440
Employee Jee.

1751
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,340
Ms. Kwon, here.
The table could be dirty.

1752
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,610
- Employee Jee.
- Yes?

1753
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:37,710
It takes you a while to get moving.

1754
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,110
The Yu Xiang eggplant is delicious.

1755
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,320
- Yu Xiang eggplant?
- That sounds delicious.

1756
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,180
- We should have some.
- That sounds good.

1757
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,350
- We...
- Instead of tangsuyuk,

1758
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,850
- let's have Yu Xiang eggplant.
- We need to win as a team.

1759
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:47,220
- We've earned a lot.
- We...

1760
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,490
Everyone earned 1,000 dollars
except for Employee Jee.

1761
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:50,930
Let's have a plate
of Yu Xiang eggplant.

1762
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:51,990
- Yes, a Yu Xiang eggplant.
- And a small plate of tangsuyuk.

1763
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,330
Yes, a small plate of tangsuyuk.

1764
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,060
I'll have gan-jjajangmyeon.

1765
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,100
- Gan-jjajangmyeon?
- Yes.

1766
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,270
- I'll have jjamppong.
- I'll have jjamppong.

1767
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,130
- What about you, Seok Jin?
- I'll have the premium...

1768
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,170
- What?
- What?

1769
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,670
- Jjamppong with seafood.
- Jjamppong with seafood?

1770
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,040
- Well...
- Just have the regular jjamppong.

1771
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,240
Keep it down.

1772
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:05,870
What do you mean
I should keep it down?

1773
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,340
Just have the regular jjamppong.

1774
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:10,610
- Is it a lot more expensive?
- They have...

1775
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:11,750
a delicious jjamppong option.

1776
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,850
Okay, I'll have that.

1777
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,650
Ma'am, we'll have
one gan-jjajangmyeon.

1778
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,520
- One gan-jjajangmyeon.
- Three seafood jjamppong.

1779
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,050
- We'll have a half-sized tangsuyuk.
- A half-sized tangsuyuk.

1780
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,360
Is the Yu Xiang eggplant better,
or the kkanpung eggplant?

1781
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,320
- The Yu Xiang eggplant is better.
- People usually have the former.

1782
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,760
- We'll take that.
- We'll have that, then.

1783
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,190
One Yu Xiang eggplant.

1784
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,400
- Thank you.
- Please serve each as it's done.

1785
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,400
This must be...

1786
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,760
- the Yu Xiang eggplant.
- This is the eggplant dish.

1787
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,430
This smells incredible.

1788
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:32,770
That looks good.

1789
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:34,270
There's our jjamppong.

1790
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,740
- Ms. Kwon, where's your plate?
- Here you go.

1791
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,970
Shouldn't we cut that?

1792
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,740
- Can we get some scissors?
- Thank you.

1793
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,240
There's a pair on your right.

1794
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,910
Let's try this.

1795
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:46,110
I was upset when we didn't
get to eat at the cafeteria,

1796
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,050
but it might've turned out
for the best.

1797
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:50,120
- I'll enjoy.
- I'll enjoy!

1798
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:56,290
(CEO Kwon, who worked hard
to earn a profit, takes a bite too.)

1799
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:03,330
(It tastes even better
after working hard.)

1800
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,500
The tangsuyuk is incredible.

1801
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,600
It's so crunchy.

1802
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,140
(Even Salary Thief Jee
is highly satisfied.)

1803
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,310
Who wants some of the jjajangmyeon?

1804
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,510
- Can I have some?
- Sure.

1805
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:16,340
- Don't give me too much.
- Got it.

1806
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,080
- Thanks.
- I can't believe it.

1807
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,010
Why are the noodles
broken into pieces?

1808
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,580
Even though you want to report her,
seeing her like this...

1809
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,650
You're right.

1810
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:24,950
- Ms. Kwon...
- Ms. Kwon...

1811
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:27,190
- cares about us a lot.
- I know.

1812
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,020
I care about all of you.

1813
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,830
(CEO Kwon even shares
a bowl of jjajangmyeon.)

1814
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:35,330
(It's been tough managing
an old and incompetent employee.)

1815
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,570
(She gave him an earful at times.)

1816
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:43,040
(He loses the will to report her
after seeing her kindness.)

1817
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,440
She's sweet.

1818
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:47,080
- Try some.
- Thank you.

1819
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,910
- Thanks.
- Don't give all of us a plate.

1820
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,010
You'll have nothing left.

1821
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:51,450
- Ms. Kwon.
- You should all get a bite.

1822
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,080
That's how a boss should be.

1823
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,650
- Have you had some?
- Gosh, thanks.

1824
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:56,420
Of course, I'm loving this.

1825
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,990
(She takes a bite after sharing some
with all her employees.)

1826
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,560
It's really good.

1827
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,720
(Was she this kind
with the money they earned?)

1828
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,730
It's good.

1829
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:07,300
- Your total is 105 dollars.
- What?

1830
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,700
- Seriously?
- Is it that much?

1831
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:12,900
We'll split the bill.
50, 30, 20, and 10 dollars each.

1832
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,600
Didn't Vice-CEO Yu
offer to treat us?

1833
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,070
- That's because...
- He's saying otherwise.

1834
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:19,710
The cafeteria was way cheaper.

1835
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,340
Let's play rock-paper-scissors
and have the loser pay.

1836
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:23,880
No way.

1837
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,820
(CEO Kwon suggests
that one person pay the bill.)

1838
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,750
- Ms. Kwon.
- Yes?

1839
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,190
- The four of us...
- Why is it...

1840
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:33,020
that you rattle us more
with games like this...

1841
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,990
than with the work
we actually have to do?

1842
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,430
Are you in?

1843
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,860
Will only one person have to pay?
That's brutal.

1844
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,800
- Okay, fine.
- Let's do it.

1845
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,960
Let's draw lots.

1846
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,830
Gosh, it'll be a critical blow
if your name is chosen.

1847
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:48,570
One of them says "Chosen,"
and the other three say "Pass."

1848
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:52,270
Aren't you being too harsh?
You're all my superiors at work.

1849
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,640
The CEO and Vice-CEO are both here.

1850
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,610
Everyone, trendy companies
do things like this nowadays.

1851
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,650
But I'm just a lowly employee.

1852
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:02,120
- You're making us draw lots?
- That's such an outdated thought.

1853
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,120
- My goodness.
- Please open your paper 1 by 1.

1854
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,920
All right.
I'm sure it'll be one of them.

1855
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,960
Did you get a dud?

1856
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,990
- Pass!
- Pass.

1857
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:09,990
(First, CEO Kwon gets a pass.)

1858
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,630
- Why do I feel like it'll be me?
- Should I go next?

1859
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,960
- You can go first.
- He'll be chosen.

1860
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,960
- It says "Chosen."
- Pass!

1861
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:16,160
Okay, pass.

1862
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,070
(Vice-CEO Yu gets a pass too.)

1863
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:21,270
(Cruelly, the two executives
escape having to pay.)

1864
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,270
- All right.
- What is this right now?

1865
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:25,170
(Only the two lowly employees
are left.)

1866
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:27,680
(Which of these two
will have to foot the whole bill?)

1867
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:31,250
(Employee Jee and Manager Yang.
Who will have to foot the whole bill?)

1868
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,580
- Pass!
- All right.

1869
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,780
(Employee Jee is chosen.)

1870
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:39,050
Employee Jee will pay
the entire bill of 105 dollars.

1871
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,290
Thank you for the meal.

1872
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:42,160
- Did you give me this on purpose?
- Thanks, Employee Jee.

1873
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,220
Did you know
before you gave me this?

1874
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,990
- Of course not.
- How could I get this one?

1875
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:46,130
I really didn't know.

1876
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,430
- Well...
- The food tastes great.

1877
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:49,800
You're just awfully unlucky, sir.

1878
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,530
- By the way,
- I can't believe this.

1879
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:52,600
Ms. Kwon.

1880
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,770
You sure know how to
infuriate people.

1881
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:58,140
- I'm seriously furious.
- She chooses certain words.

1882
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,970
Gosh, Mr. Grasshopper.
Why are you acting this way?

1883
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:03,040
- Mr. Grasshopper...
- Mr. Grasshopper? My gosh.

1884
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:05,050
Gosh, this is really infuriating.

1885
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:06,250
One hundred dollars is
a lot of money.

1886
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,220
Of course,
100 dollars is a huge amount for me.

1887
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,120
- If you do the math, though...
- What?

1888
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,420
- Well, then. Yes.
- Thank you for the meal.

1889
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,250
- Let's get going now.
- Ms. Kwon. Let's get going.

1890
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,260
- Okay.
- I enjoyed the meal.

1891
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,390
- The food was great.
- I really enjoyed the meal.

1892
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,690
- Have a good day.
- Could we get a picture with you?

1893
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,960
There's something here.

1894
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:22,930
Oh, there's a cafe right here.

1895
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,430
- Hey, Seok Sam.
- Oh, this place looks nice.

1896
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,230
- Yes?
- Will you pay for coffee too?

1897
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,070
- Or will you pay, Ms. Kwon?
- Of course, Ms. Kwon should pay.

1898
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:30,440
Okay, everyone. My dear employees.

1899
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,540
No, but...

1900
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,970
- But I... Hang on.
- Ms. Kwon.

1901
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:35,040
- You should leave me out.
- Hey, let's just revolt.

1902
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,740
I brought these for you,
my dear employees.

1903
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,510
- You should leave me out.
- If you're going to be like this,

1904
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,050
change the company name to
Drawing Lots, Inc.

1905
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,650
You should leave me out, at least.

1906
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:43,050
Do you perhaps
know which one is which already?

1907
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:45,850
Let's open them up. One, two, three!

1908
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,420
- Pass!
- Pass.

1909
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:49,060
- Pass.
- Chosen...

1910
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,960
- Let's go.
- Hey, let's order a bunch of stuff.

1911
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,960
- Let's order a lot.
- Oh, I should have some cake too.

1912
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,460
- Ms. Kwon.
- Let's order a lot.

1913
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,500
Gosh, seriously...
(While CEO Kwon spends
her employees' money like water...)

1914
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,000
Gosh, I'm seriously so furious.

1915
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
(While CEO Kwon spends
her employees' money like water...)

1916
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,670
Come on, Ms. Kwon.
Aren't you being too mean?

1917
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,970
Gosh, is there anything we can do?

1918
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:05,040
What could there be?

1919
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,240
All right. Let's sit.

1920
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,780
(Plopping down)

1921
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,980
(Assistant Manager Kim
just sits at the head of the table.)

1922
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,850
(Reading his face)

1923
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,560
(CEO Ha simply knows
to take an empty seat.)

1924
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:26,290
I don't know why,
but I feel kind of glum.

1925
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,030
(CEO Ha's timid rebellion)

1926
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:32,270
I mean, I have no idea why,
but I just feel a bit...

1927
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:34,000
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

1928
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,600
I gave you the seat with more space,

1929
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,340
- befitting the CEO.
- Oh, I see.

1930
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,440
- Thanks.
- Sure thing.

1931
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,940
Let's go!

1932
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,380
Okay. The next task is...

1933
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,680
Employee Egg Rescue Team.

1934
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,080
Later on, we'll give each company
a large block of ice.

1935
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,020
In the middle of the ice,
you'll find an egg.

1936
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,660
Within the time limit of 15 minutes,

1937
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,090
you must rescue the egg.

1938
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:59,890
The team that
rescues their egg first...

1939
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:01,460
and in good condition will win.

1940
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,900
So, you will need tools
to break the ice.

1941
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:07,870
You will purchase your own tools
and come back to the office.

1942
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,370
Then, what should we buy?

1943
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:11,540
We should try to buy
as few tools as possible.

1944
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,370
- We don't know what there might be.
- There could be a saw.

1945
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:15,440
Usually, you take a chisel
and pound on it...

1946
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,580
- That's right. It would crack open.
- to crack the ice.

1947
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,950
- A hammer would be best.
- That's the best.

1948
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,020
- But a hammer will be expensive.
- Yes.

1949
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,450
Would there be any way
to do this without buying tools?

1950
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:26,650
- Something just came to mind.
- What is it?

1951
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,560
I can't say it
with all the cameras present.

1952
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,760
- It'd be best not to do that, then.
- Right.

1953
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,260
I am really curious, though.

1954
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,100
- What is it?
- Well...

1955
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:37,470
(Hesitant)

1956
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:38,930
I hope they don't...

1957
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:40,640
- air this on TV, but...
- Put it in our underpants?

1958
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,970
Oh, peeing on the ice?

1959
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:43,240
How did you get it right?

1960
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,740
(Correct)

1961
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:48,680
(Such an original idea)

1962
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,880
The three of us would stand
in a triangle formation.

1963
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,350
(CEO Ha loves
the youngest employee's plan.)

1964
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:55,350
- Like "Power Rangers."
- Like the Bermuda Triangle.

1965
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:57,590
- You're allowed to say that on TV.
- Okay.

1966
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:59,190
- It's fine to say that.
- I see.

1967
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:01,860
- Take it to the restroom and...
- Scientifically. Yes.

1968
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,890
Shall we get going first?
I don't think we have much time.

1969
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,160
- Let's check out the prop room.
- Okay.

1970
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,360
A pair of scissors might be helpful.

1971
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,170
Sir, could we have a hammer, please?

1972
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:13,870
Oh, Ji Hyo. A torch.

1973
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:15,840
- No, this is better.
- That one?

1974
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,540
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

1975
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:18,540
Let's try it.

1976
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,480
We're only in it to win it.
You know that.

1977
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,080
Starting now, you will break
the ice for 15 minutes...

1978
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,950
and rescue your egg.

1979
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:25,950
- This is crazy.
- Okay.

1980
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,180
- Let's be calm.
- If that works, Jae Seok, just...

1981
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,180
(They begin rescuing Employee Egg
for 15 minutes.)

1982
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,350
(Pounding)

1983
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:31,450
Gosh, the ice is flying everywhere.

1984
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:32,590
Hey, look at Jae Seok go.

1985
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:35,090
- He's quite masculine in a way.
- That hurts!

1986
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:36,920
- Quite masculine in a way.
- That hurts!

1987
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,090
- Gosh, that hurts!
- He's just going at it.

1988
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,100
- Hey, Jae Seok. That hurts.
- Stop that.

1989
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,100
(Testosterone Jae Seok goes crazy
as Egen Jong Kook fights back.)

1990
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,170
- This side.
- Should we switch?

1991
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,100
It's hard to see this.

1992
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,100
(They start using the scissors
for more detailed work.)

1993
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,940
- Hey, we got it. This is better.
- It is. Move over.

1994
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,310
This is good.
You broke it down a lot.

1995
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:55,040
Like that? Are you sure, Ji Hyo?
Is this right?

1996
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,980
Hey, they're putting on a fire show.

1997
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:58,650
(The fire show begins.)

1998
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,880
They haven't even split
their ice yet.

1999
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:03,180
- Wait a minute. Hey.
- Go this way.

2000
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,750
- Oh, nice. Melt it.
- Melt it.

2001
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:08,490
- Ji Hyo, this isn't good enough.
- No, but...

2002
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,590
Keep going.

2003
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:12,690
- Darn it. What do we do?
- My gosh!

2004
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:14,060
(The head of the hammer breaks off.)

2005
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:15,900
- Darn it.
- No!

2006
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,530
It broke.

2007
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:19,170
- Oh, no.
- Their egg broke.

2008
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:22,670
One side of your egg is
completely broken.

2009
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:24,270
- Yes, there.
- Okay!

2010
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:25,770
We got it. It worked.

2011
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:26,940
- The scissors.
- That was so awesome.

2012
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,080
- Hey, the scissors.
- That was amazing.

2013
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,080
(They successfully rescue it
in perfect shape.)

2014
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,210
- All right.
- I can see the head!

2015
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,450
- Melt it a bit more.
- You're going to burn the egg!

2016
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:35,250
The egg is burning!
Hang on. To the side.

2017
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,720
Hey, the head is burning!

2018
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:38,190
Hey, I can smell it burning.

2019
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,690
- That's it.
- Here's our egg.

2020
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,290
- What is this?
- My goodness.

2021
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:42,390
- Hey, it smells burnt.
- Hey, man.

2022
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:44,360
Here is the result of the mission.
In first place,

2023
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,530
with the egg in the best shape,

2024
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,200
- it's Haha's company.
- Yes.

2025
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,360
You've earned 3,000 dollars.

2026
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:52,930
- We're back in the game.
- In second place,

2027
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:55,340
they were the fastest to crack
the ice,

2028
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:58,710
but their egg was slightly broken.
It's Eun Bi's company.

2029
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,780
- You've earned 2,000 dollars.
- Okay.

2030
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:02,180
- That's not bad.
- In third place,

2031
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,810
it's Ji Hyo's company that hasn't
been able to take their egg out yet.

2032
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:07,150
- You've won 1,000 dollars.
- Yes.

2033
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,180
What good is that?

2034
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:09,720
- We should get an even share.
- What a bummer.

2035
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,220
What matters is whether or not
the CEO gives us a share of the money.

2036
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,120
- The CEO doesn't spend a penny.
- Okay, now,

2037
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,790
it's time for the CEOs...

2038
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:18,730
to give out
the third salary payments.

2039
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:19,730
They won 2,000 dollars, right?

2040
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,360
We can only beat them
if we go double.

2041
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,230
Okay, trust me.

2042
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,970
- I'm not going to embezzle money.
- What a shame.

2043
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:25,970
(Chuckling)

2044
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:28,800
- Seriously, I won't. Trust me.
- Okay,

2045
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:29,870
- I really won't.
- now,

2046
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:31,270
- It could still be on your mind.
- it's time for the CEOs...

2047
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:33,710
- Of course.
- No, trust me.

2048
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:36,880
Then, which CEO will go first
to give out the salary?

2049
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,880
- I'll go. I'll be back in a flash.
- Okay, Haha is first.

2050
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,650
- You may go.
- Seriously, trust me.

2051
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:44,120
Since we won 3,000 dollars,
it'll be quick and easy to split it.

2052
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,490
(M F and B's profit: 3,000 dollars)

2053
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,420
They're about to file a complaint
against me.

2054
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:50,860
I just led them
into filing a complaint.

2055
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:52,160
So, I'm going to share.

2056
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:55,430
- How will you share the money?
- I'm 100 percent sure.

2057
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:56,460
(Haha says he won't embezzle funds
as he predicts a complaint.)

2058
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:58,730
I'll go in a minute.

2059
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:00,740
I'm 100 percent sure.

2060
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:03,540
After all, this is an individual match,
not a team game.

2061
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,340
(Will Haha be hit with a complaint
as he believes?)

2062
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:07,980
(IUB's profit: 1,000 dollars)

2063
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,210
I'll give everyone the same amount.

2064
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:10,540
(CEO Song divides the money
equally this time as well.)

2065
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,580
So, you gave everyone
330 dollars each?

2066
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:15,280
I think my teammates
don't trust me at all.

2067
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,090
(Eun Visual's profit: 2,000 dollars)

2068
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:20,490
I can't trust anyone.
You're all alone in life,

2069
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:22,190
and you do business by yourself too.

2070
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:25,360
People say not to trust others,
not even your friends.

2071
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:28,430
(How much did she take?)

2072
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:31,600
Seok Jin, look at Ms. Kwon's face.

2073
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:33,870
(A piercing stare)

2074
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:35,740
Hey, why can't you look at us?

2075
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:39,010
- We won 2,000 dollars this time.
- What?

2076
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:40,170
I divided it equally.

2077
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:42,180
- Can you divide that equally?
- It's 500 dollars each.

2078
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:45,010
The third salary distribution
is now finished.

2079
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:46,680
Hey, this part is really important.

2080
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,950
Half of the workday has gone by,

2081
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:51,190
so you can file a complaint
with the Ministry of Labor.

2082
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:53,720
So, for those of you
who wish to file a complaint,

2083
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,690
you can all go to the Ministry of Labor
and decide whether or not...

2084
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:57,990
to file a complaint.

2085
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,990
Oh, the Ministry of Labor.

2086
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:00,460
For your information, the company...

2087
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:01,930
that doesn't have a complaint
until the end...

2088
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:04,270
will get double the balance
for everyone.

2089
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:05,800
If you successfully file
a complaint,

2090
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,770
the CEO's money will be divided
only among the employees.

2091
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:10,070
The company will go under,

2092
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,440
- Please.
- and you will be dispatched...

2093
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,010
to other companies and work there.

2094
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:14,380
We get to take the money, right?

2095
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:16,280
- Yes.
- It's double the money.

2096
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,980
- What do you think...
- If you fail to file a complaint,

2097
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:21,080
the company will remain standing,

2098
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,680
but you won't have the chance
to file another complaint.

2099
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,920
Right. We only get one chance.

2100
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,090
- Yes, so you won't have...
- If you file it now,

2101
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:26,290
- any way...
- I'll get all the money.

2102
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:28,190
to stop the tyranny of the CEO.

2103
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:29,420
And if we successfully file
a complaint?

2104
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,730
Ms. Kwon does have a track record,
though.

2105
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:33,890
- I'm telling you, she does.
- She was acting weird.

2106
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,260
I only did that to survive.

2107
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:36,260
I know that, but today,

2108
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:37,630
- that wasn't the case.
- Were you trying to survive today?

2109
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:38,830
- Not today?
- Today,

2110
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:40,600
- I...
- She knows how variety shows work.

2111
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:43,070
Let's trust the CEO until the end.

2112
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:44,410
(IUB's employees
don't intend to file a complaint.)

2113
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:46,940
The two of us should trust
the CEO until the very end.

2114
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,980
We earned a lot of money this time.

2115
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,480
- We earned 3,000 dollars.
- He must be regretting...

2116
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,650
the earlier embezzlement.

2117
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:52,980
- But I...
- Yes.

2118
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,420
He must be regretting...

2119
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,020
the earlier embezzlement.

2120
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:58,020
- "Had I expected to earn a lot..."
- Listen.

2121
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,220
- Think about it.
- He's pretending to be flustered.

2122
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,760
- No.
- He's acting strange, right?

2123
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,490
- We won't place last.
- He's pretending to be flustered.

2124
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:05,130
- We won't place last.
- Look at him.

2125
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:06,760
- Okay.
- The way he pretends is strange.

2126
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,030
Okay. Don't do it.

2127
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:10,000
- Firstly...
- How much did you embezzle?

2128
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,570
Why would I answer that?
I didn't embezzle money.

2129
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,540
- Haha.
- You know,

2130
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,100
I have a feeling...

2131
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:18,840
If it isn't too much,
I'll let it slide. I'm serious.

2132
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:20,540
Twice the amount is good, right?

2133
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:21,940
He's acting strange.

2134
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,310
- Seriously.
- Twice the amount is good, right?

2135
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:24,680
- Hey.
- I have a feeling...

2136
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:25,980
What will happen?

2137
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,720
(Will Jong Kook and Joohoney file
a complaint against Haha?)

2138
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:29,250
- I...
- Will you file a complaint?

2139
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,420
I think we should do it.

2140
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,050
- File a complaint?
- Yes.

2141
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:34,490
Do you think it's right to do it?

2142
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:36,420
- I feel like...
- I know that it's going to happen.

2143
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,360
he's urging us to file a complaint.

2144
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,460
(Which decision did everyone make?)

2145
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,800
- All right.
- Let's see the results.

2146
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,960
- I believe in my teammates.
- Right?

2147
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,130
- You didn't do it.
- Let's start...

2148
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:48,340
with Ji Hyo's company.

2149
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,400
- Did they file a complaint?
- Don't.

2150
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,440
A complaint...

2151
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:52,940
wasn't filed.

2152
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:54,070
(They didn't file a complaint.)

2153
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,780
Thus,
the passbook won't be revealed.

2154
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,710
They'll trust the CEO
and keep going.

2155
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:00,750
We decided to trust you.

2156
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,280
- Up next is Eun Bi's company.
- Okay.

2157
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,690
(Up next is Eun Visual.)

2158
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:05,890
A complaint...

2159
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:07,220
- They filed a complaint.
- I bet they did.

2160
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:08,620
- Seriously.
- I bet they filed a complaint.

2161
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,690
- I bet they did.
- They did.

2162
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:11,830
(They can catch embezzlements
only if they file a complaint.)

2163
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:13,390
- A complaint...
- I bet they filed a complaint.

2164
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:14,700
- wasn't filed.
- I bet...

2165
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,900
(They didn't file a complaint.)

2166
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,200
- Wasn't filed.
- I bet...

2167
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,370
(Didn't the employees file
a complaint?)

2168
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:19,430
We suppressed the urge.

2169
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:20,730
- Who?
- We did.

2170
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:22,070
We gave it considerable thought.

2171
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:23,140
I know.

2172
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,940
She knew that we could file it.

2173
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:26,040
- That's right.
- Would she have stolen money?

2174
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,210
She could stab us in the back.

2175
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:30,340
I think she'll do it once
at the end.

2176
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,380
- That's right.
- Seriously.

2177
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,350
I think she'll do it once
at the end, not now.

2178
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:34,680
- That's the reasonable thing to do.
- If we aren't careful,

2179
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,820
we'll go bankrupt.

2180
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,320
Then things will get tough for us
toward the end.

2181
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,520
- Okay.
- All right.

2182
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,120
- We suppressed the urge.
- Who?

2183
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,760
- We did.
- The passbook won't be revealed.

2184
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,190
- We gave it considerable thought.
- I know.

2185
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:45,360
- I know.
- The last one is...

2186
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,460
- All right.
- They should've done it.

2187
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,200
- Haha's company.
- They didn't file a complaint.

2188
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,360
(What was the decision
of Haha's employees?)

2189
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,130
The last one is Haha's company.

2190
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:53,230
They didn't file a complaint.

2191
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:55,270
- They...
- A complaint was filed.

2192
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:56,370
For goodness' sake.

2193
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,140
(Haha's strategy worked!)

2194
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:00,340
I told you that I didn't do it.

2195
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,010
- No, you did it.
- I didn't do it!

2196
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:03,380
How many times
do I need to tell you?

2197
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,710
- You should be happy now.
- I'll give you...

2198
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:08,120
- your passbook.
- Check the passbook.

2199
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,750
- Please check.
- Let's check the passbook.

2200
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:10,890
- I really didn't do it.
- Think about it.

2201
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,750
- What's wrong with them?
- Please check for embezzlement.

2202
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,220
- Okay.
- If the amount is the same...

2203
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,260
I really didn't do it.

2204
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,620
- Then he didn't embezzle money.
- Are you showing them now?

2205
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:17,930
Yes. Please check.

2206
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,260
- All right. We worked very hard.
- Hurry up.

2207
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:21,430
- Go ahead and check.
- Seriously,

2208
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:23,960
I've earned the company
a lot of money.

2209
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:26,170
Had Jong Kook been in my team,

2210
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:27,870
he would've filed a complaint.

2211
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:29,700
Jong Kook's decision is mostly based
on first impressions.

2212
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:31,810
Let's see how much we got.

2213
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,270
It's 600 dollars.

2214
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:35,480
What? It's 930 dollars.

2215
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,050
- What?
- What is it?

2216
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,380
- The amount is the same.
- They got played.

2217
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:43,380
I told you
that I didn't embezzle money.

2218
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:46,120
- What?
- Why didn't you trust me?

2219
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,890
- Didn't he embezzle money?
- I shared with you guys.

2220
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,430
- What?
- Why didn't you trust me?

2221
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:54,090
I shared money with you guys.

2222
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:57,500
- Why did you make things confusing?
- Why... When did I do that?

2223
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:00,570
I'm not that kind of person.

2224
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,770
I had my suspicion.

2225
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,700
Why didn't you trust me?

2226
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:05,270
(Haha's strategy: Dropping hints
as if he has embezzled money)

2227
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:06,940
I'll make you a general manager.

2228
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:07,980
(Haha's strategy: Dropping hints
as if he has embezzled money)

2229
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,010
I'll make you a manager.

2230
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:10,010
I'll pay if you don't file
a complaint.
What?

2231
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:12,510
I'll pay if you don't file
a complaint.

2232
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:15,080
The things you say are a bit...

2233
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,580
- He didn't split the money evenly.
- Then...

2234
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:17,620
- what should we do?
- He didn't do it.

2235
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:19,820
Haha's company
failed to file a complaint...

2236
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:20,990
against the CEO.

2237
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:22,890
- There are no more chances,
- He'll hoard all the money.

2238
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:25,560
so you must deal
with the CEO's tyranny.

2239
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,500
- Why didn't you trust me?
- Now, he'll hoard all the money.

2240
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,030
He'll keep everything to himself.

2241
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:31,200
He'll hoard all the money next time.

2242
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,270
Now, he'll hoard all the money.

2243
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,230
Let's quickly move on...

2244
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,900
- to the last task.
- Okay. Let's go.

2245
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,010
(What will be the last task?)

2246
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:40,070
I told you that I didn't do it.

2247
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:41,740
What? What's this?

2248
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:42,840
(What's the pull-up bar set?)

2249
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,950
We'll be wet when we go home
for the first time in a while.

2250
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,410
I think we'll get wet.

2251
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,880
- Will we get wet?
- Yes. I think we'll get wet.

2252
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,920
Really?

2253
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,720
- That's right.
- We'll get wet.

2254
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:53,490
- Can you tell by looking?
- Of course.

2255
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:54,560
Doesn't it have that vibe?

2256
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,760
- See? It's a water balloon.
- There it comes.

2257
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:57,260
- That's what it is.
- Take a seat.

2258
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:58,330
- That's what it is.
- I guess they get a hunch.

2259
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:59,790
- Take a seat.
- Okay.

2260
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:00,860
- That's what it is.
- This is incredible.

2261
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:03,260
- What should we do?
- I don't know.

2262
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,130
- It's cool.
- The last task involves...

2263
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:07,600
a must-have quality
for the office workers, quick wits.

2264
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,400
It's the Best Employee of Wits.

2265
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,540
You'll wear a blindfold
and a hat that's lined with sandpaper...

2266
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,380
and begin in a sitting position.

2267
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,210
A representative of the company
will enter...

2268
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:19,150
- A representative.
- and dodge the water balloon.

2269
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,280
They earn a point...

2270
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,050
- every time they get up.
- They should get up many times.

2271
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,490
If a player gets hit
with the water balloon,

2272
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:27,020
their accumulated points
go back to zero.

2273
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,560
We'll have a total of four rounds.

2274
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,360
The number of points...

2275
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,160
- will determine the rankings.
- Okay.

2276
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:34,960
You need to get up
before the water balloon comes.

2277
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,560
We shouldn't get up
when the timing is bad.

2278
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,000
We should get up quickly.

2279
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,270
The 1st-place company
will receive 5,000 dollars.

2280
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,170
That's incredible.

2281
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:43,370
(5,000 dollars)

2282
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,270
The 2nd-place company
will receive 4,000 dollars.

2283
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:46,970
The 3rd-place company
will receive 3,000 dollars...

2284
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:49,280
as a prize.

2285
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:50,680
Even if we earn...

2286
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:53,680
a lot of money,
Haha will take everything.

2287
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:54,780
Haha will place first.

2288
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,120
No way. We'll share.

2289
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:57,990
We need to wear the hat sideways
like a mischievous boy.

2290
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:59,220
Let's go.

2291
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:00,620
It's like Turbo's fashion.

2292
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:01,720
The bill should be
on the right side.

2293
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,320
Please decide on
one representative...

2294
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,430
- for Round 1.
- It'll be better to go 1st.

2295
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,160
Then Eun Bi should go.

2296
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:10,400
- You should go first.
- Me?

2297
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:12,700
- Yes.
- Really? Okay.

2298
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:13,900
(Young blood versus Young blood
Joohoney goes first.)

2299
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,170
- I think I'll get hit.
- Get up many times.

2300
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,040
Me?

2301
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,840
But I'm the tallest.

2302
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,940
Daniel has
the tallest sitting height.

2303
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,040
My goodness.

2304
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:24,380
- Ms. Kwon, get up bravely, okay?
- Okay.

2305
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:27,380
- Daniel, did you get the rules?
- Let's go.

2306
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:28,720
Get ready.

2307
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,580
- Good luck.
- Let's go.

2308
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:34,360
(The first balloon sets off!)

2309
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,690
- Why is no one getting up?
- Why is no one getting up?

2310
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:39,830
You need to get up.

2311
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,330
(Do I need to get up?)

2312
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:45,530
- What?
- What?

2313
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:46,600
Ms. Kwon!

2314
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,170
(Ms. Kwon was as slow as a sloth.)

2315
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:49,640
(Daniel got splashed suddenly.)

2316
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,800
What?

2317
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:53,770
Ms. Kwon!

2318
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:56,110
You should sit down
after getting up.

2319
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:57,750
- Sit down quickly.
- Sit down quickly.

2320
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,850
(The first balloon burst
in a lackluster way.)

2321
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:00,980
What was that?

2322
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:03,120
- What was that?
- If you burst the balloon,

2323
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,350
you go back to zero points.

2324
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:06,150
- Since Eun Bi burst it right away,
- What was that?

2325
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:07,860
- everyone's score is zero points.
- It's meaningless.

2326
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:09,990
- Ms. Kwon, what are you doing?
- Hurry up.

2327
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:11,160
Cover your eyes.

2328
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,260
Get ready.

2329
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:13,660
Get up and sit down quickly.

2330
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:15,400
Do it right away.

2331
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,860
That was good.

2332
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,430
(Joohoney scores a point
in the beginning.)

2333
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,300
That was good.

2334
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:23,270
(Joohoney: 2, Eun Bi: 1, Daniel: 1)

2335
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,400
Get up.

2336
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,670
Do it quickly.

2337
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:29,080
(Joohoney keeps going.
Will he do it 4 consecutive times?)

2338
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:32,750
(It hits him in the face.)

2339
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:34,620
What?

2340
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:35,850
- What?
- I mean...

2341
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,590
- What?
- Hold on. He's on my team.

2342
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:40,090
Joohoney got hit this time.

2343
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:41,390
Joohoney was doing well.

2344
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:42,990
Employees, root for me.

2345
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:44,190
Okay. Good luck.

2346
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:47,030
How does Ms. Kwon run a business?

2347
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:49,060
Is she a spy or something?

2348
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,560
Ms. Kwon, what are you doing?

2349
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,830
How are you so bad at it?

2350
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:53,470
- I got up once.
- We know that.

2351
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,040
- You need to keep getting up.
- I see.

2352
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,400
It's not about getting up once,
Eun Bi.

2353
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,370
You need to get up many times
in order to win.

2354
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:00,210
- Okay.
- Move a lot.

2355
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:01,840
Ms. Kwon.

2356
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,340
(The 3rd balloon gets launched.)

2357
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,680
If you get up at the right time...

2358
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,410
Is she a spy or something?

2359
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:08,820
Ms. Kwon, what are you doing?

2360
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:10,080
How are you so bad at it?

2361
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,290
(Ms. Kwon plucks up her courage
to satisfy her employees.)

2362
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:14,420
What? Did it burst?

2363
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,120
(It hit her in the ear.)

2364
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:18,860
Did it burst already?

2365
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:20,830
(Laughing)

2366
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:22,260
Did it burst already?

2367
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:23,400
- Mr. Ha.
- Oh, no.

2368
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,570
This won't do.

2369
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,470
Ms. Kwon!

2370
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:28,870
How is Ms. Kwon so bad at it?

2371
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:30,140
This is driving me crazy.

2372
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,070
Oh, no.

2373
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:33,310
Did it burst already?

2374
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:34,310
(Asking a belated question)

2375
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:36,280
- How is Ms. Kwon so bad at it?
- The third balloon burst.

2376
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,280
- This is driving me crazy.
- Eun Bi got hit again.

2377
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,310
What? I mean...

2378
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:41,480
(The original klutz
is doing worse than anyone.)

2379
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,820
The back seat gives you
an advantage.

2380
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:44,050
- It gives you an advantage.
- After all,

2381
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:45,590
you can get up
when you hear the whistle.

2382
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:46,750
That's...

2383
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,120
- It gives you an advantage.
- Here comes...

2384
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,420
- the last balloon.
- That's...

2385
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:52,030
- Get ready.
- Let's win.

2386
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:56,730
You can get up
when you hear the whistle.

2387
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,300
Ms. Kwon.

2388
01:14:58,300 --> 01:14:59,330
(Ms. Kwon gets up
upon hearing the whistle.)

2389
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,500
What?

2390
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,340
(It hits her
in the back of her head.)

2391
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:11,580
(A refreshing ending that suits
the Waterbomb Queen)

2392
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,310
- I can't believe it.
- Hey.

2393
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:14,850
- Why...
- What was that?

2394
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:16,320
- Why did you go right away?
- What was that?

2395
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:17,650
Couldn't you calculate the time?

2396
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:19,120
- Oh, no.
- Ms. Kwon!

2397
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,990
You should've waited a bit
after the whistle.

2398
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:22,660
- Now...
- Am I doing...

2399
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:23,820
- well?
- I'm completely soaked.

2400
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:26,090
- You're doing well.
- Please take off your blindfolds.

2401
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:27,260
- You should've calculated the time.
- For goodness' sake.

2402
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:29,030
- Is there someone you like?
- How is she so funny?

2403
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,760
Daniel didn't get hit once.

2404
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,900
Daniel acquired two points.

2405
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,170
(The less slow member,
Daniel did well.)

2406
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:36,270
- He's soaked.
- Daniel, you did well.

2407
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,970
- Well done.
- He didn't do anything.

2408
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:39,370
- My goodness.
- He just sat there.

2409
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:40,510
I got up.

2410
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:43,010
It was impossible to tell
when the balloon was coming.

2411
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:44,440
I had no idea.

2412
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:47,550
For goodness' sake, Ms. Kwon.
What was that?

2413
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:50,320
I'll need to see
who comes out first.

2414
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,320
- Do you want to go last?
- I can take the middle seat.

2415
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,490
(Ms. Song enters the round!)

2416
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:54,490
Okay. You should go.

2417
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,360
- Ji Hyo, take the middle seat.
- What?

2418
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,930
- Me?
- Okay. You should go.

2419
01:15:57,930 --> 01:15:59,530
- The middle seat is the worst.
- Go.

2420
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:01,860
The middle seat.

2421
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:06,230
- You need to get up all the way.
- Where are you? You're right here.

2422
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:07,370
Get ready.

2423
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:10,170
(The first balloon)

2424
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:14,470
By the whistle...

2425
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,340
(Haha scores first.)

2426
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,750
(Ji Hyo begins to get up!)

2427
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:19,850
By the whistle, you can calculate...

2428
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:21,210
No, Ji Hyo!

2429
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:24,580
(It barely misses
the sandpaper hat.)

2430
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,920
(Haha: 1, Ji Hyo: 0, Se Chan: 0)

2431
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:30,120
(The rally continues!)

2432
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,760
(Haha, Ji Hyo, Se Chan)

2433
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,230
(Haha: 0, Ji Hyo: 2, Se Chan: 2)

2434
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:35,360
(Haha's score gets reset.)

2435
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,430
- Who got hit?
- Was it me?

2436
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:38,730
- Haha got hit.
- I did well, right?

2437
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:41,000
(He laughed at other people,
but got his score reset first.)

2438
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,400
- It was you.
- That serves him right.

2439
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,740
- That serves him right.
- I did well, right?

2440
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,710
- That serves him right.
- It was you.

2441
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:47,010
Let's switch the seats.

2442
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:48,580
- Let's switch the seats.
- Let's switch the seats.

2443
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:51,480
(What?)

2444
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,580
(Glaring)

2445
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:57,920
What was that?

2446
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:58,920
(He runs away.)

2447
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,420
Mister! Right now...

2448
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:01,620
What was that? Gosh, it's cold!

2449
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:02,920
We were arranging the seats!

2450
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:06,490
(A sudden Ice Bucket Challenge)

2451
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,100
- That was great.
- What was that?

2452
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:09,900
- Nice seat.
- Let's switch the seats.

2453
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,370
- Let's switch the seats.
- Nice timing.

2454
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:12,370
I'll take the back seat.

2455
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:13,930
- Take the back seat.
- The back seat is the best.

2456
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:14,940
Should I sit here?

2457
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:18,270
(The seats are switched.)

2458
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:19,470
Get ready.

2459
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:21,740
- Their heights are the same.
- The middle seat is the hardest.

2460
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:22,840
Their heights are the same.

2461
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:23,940
- What? It touched the hat.
- Be careful.

2462
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,610
(Se Chan: 2, Haha: 0, Ji Hyo: 2)

2463
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:26,680
- It touched the hat.
- Be careful.

2464
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,880
(Splashing)

2465
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:30,620
- Nice.
- What happened?

2466
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:33,720
Haha, you keep getting up
at the right time for the front seat.

2467
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,760
You know what I mean, right?

2468
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,060
Wait a bit longer.

2469
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,360
(He tries again
after listening to advice.)

2470
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,030
(Splashing)

2471
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,060
For goodness' sake.

2472
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,500
I told you!

2473
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:46,800
(Haha bursts the last balloon
with the back of his head.)

2474
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,100
- Was it me?
- Yes.

2475
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,140
(CEO Ha fails to score
a single point.)

2476
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:50,970
- I burst it zero times, right?
- Yes.

2477
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:53,840
(M F and B is at the bottom.)

2478
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,880
- Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?
- Yes.

2479
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,010
What is going on?

2480
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:57,580
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2481
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:58,710
Ye Eun, good luck.

2482
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:00,650
- Seok Jin, do you want to go?
- Shall I go?

2483
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:01,950
You should play rock-paper-scissors.

2484
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,680
Maybe you should play it
for each round.

2485
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,550
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Shall we play it...

2486
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:06,720
- for each round?
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2487
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,020
- Let's go.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2488
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:09,020
- Which seat is bad?
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2489
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,090
I'll take the back seat.

2490
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:11,930
- The middle seat.
- I'll take the front seat.

2491
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:13,230
Is the front seat bad?

2492
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:15,300
No, I think the middle seat is bad.

2493
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,200
- For goodness' sake.
- I think the middle seat is bad.

2494
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,430
Seok Jin, good luck!

2495
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:21,500
- Okay, Seok Jin!
- Watch me.

2496
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:23,540
- Watch me get up.
- Good luck.

2497
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,210
- Get ready.
- Okay.

2498
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:29,310
(The first balloon is launched.)

2499
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:30,910
Just let go.

2500
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:33,810
(Jong Kook, Seok Jin, Ye Eun)

2501
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:36,320
(However,)

2502
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,590
(Seok Jin does well!)

2503
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:40,750
- What?
- How is he good at it?

2504
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,120
- What?
- What?

2505
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:47,790
(Sitting in the middle,
he shows incredible talent.)

2506
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:51,330
- What?
- How is he good at it?

2507
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:52,970
- What?
- What?

2508
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:54,300
- What?
- What?

2509
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,170
(I'm excited!)

2510
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:00,440
(The rediscovery of Intern Jee,
the clumsy employee)

2511
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,080
(Ye Eun is doing well too.)

2512
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:05,450
- How is he good at it?
- What?

2513
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:07,580
- What?
- What?

2514
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,750
(Jong Kook bursts the balloon!)

2515
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:10,880
- They're good.
- Who was it?

2516
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,120
Jong Kook got hit.

2517
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,290
- What?
- Okay.

2518
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,090
What?

2519
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:18,860
(Jong Kook burst the balloon,
but Seok Jin got soaked.)

2520
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:20,130
They're good.

2521
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,900
Gosh, what a shame.

2522
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,560
(He's in a funny shape,
but he has earned 5 points!)

2523
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,930
It was Jong Kook.

2524
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:27,630
It was Jong Kook. Okay.

2525
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:29,100
- What?
- It's okay.

2526
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:31,270
- It wasn't me, right?
- It wasn't you.

2527
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,740
Then why am I soaked?

2528
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:35,080
- Shall we switch seats?
- Shall we switch seats?

2529
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,240
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- Why am I soaked?

2530
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,210
- Let's rotate.
- It wasn't me, right?

2531
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:39,750
- Let's rotate.
- Go to the front.

2532
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,480
Get ready.

2533
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:42,520
(Seok Jin is at the back this time.)

2534
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,620
(Ye Eun: 5, Jong Kook: 0,
Seok Jin: 5)

2535
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:44,920
- There you go.
- Good.

2536
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,050
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

2537
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:47,520
Gosh.

2538
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:51,420
(He works his knees
from the very start.)

2539
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:56,000
(Ye Eun and Seok Jin alternate!)

2540
01:19:57,130 --> 01:20:00,630
(Between experience and youth,
what will prevail?)

2541
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,510
(The Gen Z employee catches up.)

2542
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:10,140
(Ye Eun: 8, Jong Kook: 0,
Seok Jin: 8)

2543
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:12,450
(Collapsing)

2544
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:13,480
Ddochi.

2545
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,980
(Ddochi lost 6 points at once.)

2546
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,680
- Ddochi, you're good.
- You're good.

2547
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:19,450
- Ddochi, you're good.
- She's really good.

2548
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:20,620
Seriously.

2549
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:23,860
(Meanwhile, Intern Jee
has earned 8 points.)

2550
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:24,890
Ddochi.

2551
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:26,890
- Ddochi.
- Oh, no.

2552
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:27,930
Ddochi, you're good.

2553
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:29,360
- Get ready.
- Okay.

2554
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,000
(The next balloon gets launched.)

2555
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,130
Go.

2556
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:35,740
Go.

2557
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,010
- Who was it?
- I got splashed.

2558
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:42,180
- It was a home run!
- Who was it?

2559
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,280
- Ddochi.
- It hit her hard, right?

2560
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,480
- That was incredible.
- That was cool.

2561
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,580
One. Two.

2562
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:48,850
(Ye Eun: 2, Jong Kook: 9,
Seok Jin: 0)

2563
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:50,920
(Seok Jin has earned 9 points.)

2564
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,490
- Who was it? You?
- It was a home run.

2565
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:54,820
- What a way to get hit!
- It was incredible.

2566
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:57,020
- Okay.
- Get up.

2567
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,330
(The last balloon appears.)

2568
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:02,000
I think this is
the perfect game for me.

2569
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:04,100
You'll get many commercial deals.

2570
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,470
Seok Jin, you'll be a star.

2571
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:07,300
This is the last balloon. Get ready.

2572
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:09,700
(Will Intern Jee get
his happy ending?)

2573
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:10,870
It's raining.

2574
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,410
- There you go.
- My goodness.

2575
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:18,110
(A crisis occurs
as soon as the round begins.)

2576
01:21:20,650 --> 01:21:22,650
(Jong Kook: 3, Seok Jin: 10,
Ye Eun: 1)

2577
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,580
(He survives.)

2578
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:27,220
(Intern Jee moves
at the speed of lightning.)

2579
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:31,360
(If he pulls through,
he'll get a happy ending!)

2580
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:39,400
(He's back to the original state.)

2581
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,400
Seok Jin got hit.

2582
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,800
(Seok Jin's 11 points disappear.)

2583
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:49,010
(The smallest praise
made him as happy as a child.)

2584
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:51,880
(Proud)

2585
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:53,010
I'm scared.

2586
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:57,280
(His 11 points are gone.)

2587
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,620
(Intern Jee,)

2588
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:02,060
(you were absolutely perfect! Yes!)

2589
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:04,260
Oh, no. He was nearly done.

2590
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:05,990
- It's raining.
- It's raining.

2591
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,890
- It's raining.
- Okay.

2592
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:09,100
There's a hole in the sky.

2593
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:10,800
I think I've gotten up four times.

2594
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:12,800
You did really well.

2595
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:15,340
(Seok Jin's team is
back to the beginning.)

2596
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:17,600
- It's raining.
- It's time for the last round.

2597
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,810
- The last round.
- One more time.

2598
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,070
- Good.
- Good.

2599
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:21,780
(Agile)

2600
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:26,380
(Amidst the employees
with no wits whatsoever,)

2601
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:28,380
(Jae Seok catches up.)

2602
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,220
This is the last balloon.

2603
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:32,250
(Only one balloon remains.)

2604
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,390
I'm scared.

2605
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:34,590
Okay.

2606
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:36,160
(Jae Seok succeeds in
turning the tables.)

2607
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,590
(He just needs to avoid
getting hit!)

2608
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:39,790
- Okay.
- I'm scared.

2609
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:40,860
Okay.

2610
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,430
- It's over.
- Joohoney.

2611
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,660
- It's over.
- Is it over?

2612
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,130
(After a close match,
Jae Seok comes in 1st.)

2613
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:47,200
(Vice-CEO Yu came from behind
and won.)

2614
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,440
- Is it over?
- Well done.

2615
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,070
We got lucky today.

2616
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,640
Here come the final results.

2617
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,340
Joohoney's team...

2618
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:56,080
acquired five points.

2619
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:58,610
Ji Hyo's team acquired seven points.

2620
01:22:58,610 --> 01:22:59,980
Seven points.

2621
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:01,950
- That's right.
- Eun Bi's team...

2622
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:03,680
- acquired eight points.
- Okay.

2623
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,750
Eight points?

2624
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:05,790
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2625
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,620
Ms. Kwon, how is it going to be?

2626
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,990
- Shall we revolt?
- I'll double the amount.

2627
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:11,960
Let's have a beautiful ending.

2628
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:15,430
The first-place company's Eun Bi
should go...

2629
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:17,430
and distribute the last salary.

2630
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:18,430
Okay.

2631
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:20,400
- Hey, Ms. Kwon.
- We believe in you.

2632
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,270
I won't sit still.

2633
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:24,500
Don't discriminate
based on the position.

2634
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,870
Divide it up evenly.

2635
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,670
(Eun Visual's profit: 5,000 dollars)

2636
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:28,740
Sir.

2637
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,610
(Ms. Kwon has embezzled money
all along.)

2638
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:31,950
(What will be her last choice?)

2639
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,520
(Embezzlement, of course.)

2640
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:40,950
(How much did she take this time?)

2641
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:42,820
Jae Seok, Eun Bi is smiling.

2642
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,220
- He's smiling.
- Eun Bi...

2643
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,330
I think she has backstabbed us.

2644
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:48,260
- Eun Bi.
- Ms. Kwon, please.

2645
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:49,930
- Why can you look us in the eye?
- Acting like everything is fine...

2646
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:51,000
Ms. Kwon.

2647
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,330
Hey.

2648
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:54,500
Ms. Kwon, why can you look us
in the eye?

2649
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,170
Ms. Kwon, you'll suffer
the consequences.

2650
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:58,810
- Ms. Kwon,
- At this rate,

2651
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:00,070
- we're older than you.
- the company will go under.

2652
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:01,910
To earn twice the money,

2653
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:04,940
you shouldn't file a complaint
against me.

2654
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,310
I'll be back.

2655
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,980
- Ji Hyo. Ms. Song.
- Tiffany's eye smile.

2656
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,880
(IUB's profit: 4,000 dollars)

2657
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,120
(CEO Song has distributed
the profit evenly so far.)

2658
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,190
Is it 4,000 dollars?

2659
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:14,490
(CEO Song has distributed
the profit evenly so far.)

2660
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:16,360
I'll do it this time.

2661
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:18,190
I've done the groundwork.

2662
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:20,160
(Will Ji Hyo do things differently
this time?)

2663
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:21,460
I can't predict the result.

2664
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:22,530
(Employee Ji has no worries.)

2665
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:24,160
- What?
- Tiffany's eye smile.

2666
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,400
Haha.

2667
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:26,900
It's amazing
that the complaint against Haha...

2668
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,200
- has failed.
- This time,

2669
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,000
- he'll hoard the money.
- He'll hoard the money.

2670
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,470
Why? Why would I do that?

2671
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:32,510
You'll hoard the money.

2672
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:33,740
No one will check.

2673
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:35,240
Why would I hoard the money?

2674
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:37,580
You aren't the type
to care about the team.

2675
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,180
- I care about the team.
- He'll hoard the money.

2676
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:40,180
- Right?
- No way.

2677
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:41,310
- Right.
- Fish and Beef.

2678
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:43,880
You can give them
another complaint ticket.

2679
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,520
It doesn't matter.

2680
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,090
- Really?
- Give it to them.

2681
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:48,150
Give them a complaint ticket.

2682
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,990
But rules are rules.

2683
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:52,930
- He'll hoard the money.
- No.

2684
01:24:53,530 --> 01:24:55,300
- He'll do it for sure.
- No.

2685
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,400
Why would I do that?

2686
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:57,830
- I care about the team.
- He'll hoard the money.

2687
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,000
- No.
- He'll do it for sure.

2688
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,270
- No.
- You'd be a fool not to do that.

2689
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:02,070
- Why would I do that?
- He's a tiger moth.

2690
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:03,770
- Me?
- Haha, you're last.

2691
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:04,770
CEO Ha, go.

2692
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:06,540
- How tasty!
- It can't be helped.

2693
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:09,040
Given his DNA,
he'll hoard the money.

2694
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:11,610
Trust me.

2695
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,110
- Trust me.
- That's what I hate about him.

2696
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,650
"Trust me."

2697
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:16,880
- The last one.
- Seriously.

2698
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,280
(M F and B's profit: 3,000 dollars)

2699
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,550
Okay. Please do that.

2700
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:22,320
Finally, my time has come.

2701
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,090
What's this?
Why did you give it to me?

2702
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:27,030
You know what I'll do.

2703
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,460
(Haha: 3,000 dollars,
Jong Kook and Joohoney: 0 dollars)

2704
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:30,460
(He embezzles everything.)

2705
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:31,660
It's so simple.

2706
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:34,070
I'm sorry.

2707
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:36,670
I'm sorry. I'll redo it.

2708
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:42,080
(He's suddenly adjusting
the salary.)

2709
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:43,810
Why are you adjusting it?

2710
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:44,840
Pardon?

2711
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:48,550
Affection,

2712
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,280
loyalty,

2713
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:51,550
and trust.

2714
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:55,760
(The employees worked hard
the whole day for the company.)

2715
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,560
(Perhaps CEO Ha didn't forget
those memories.)

2716
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:03,000
(How would he have split
the amount?)

2717
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,330
(Haha: 2,800, Jong Kook: 100,
Joohoney: 100)

2718
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:07,070
(He gave them only 100 dollars.)

2719
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:08,600
I was greedy for a moment.

2720
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,270
I was greedy for a moment,

2721
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:12,470
- Well done.
- but I stopped myself.

2722
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:13,570
Well done.

2723
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:14,940
(All companies have completed
their salary distributions.)

2724
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:18,510
Now, Haha's company
can't file any more complaints.

2725
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:20,010
- Yes.
- For your information,

2726
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:23,050
if the team doesn't file a complaint
until the end, that team...

2727
01:26:23,050 --> 01:26:24,580
- Double.
- will receive...

2728
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:25,650
- double the amount...
- That's crazy.

2729
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:27,320
- in their account.
- We can't trust her.

2730
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,090
- Because I...
- If it were Kwon Eun Bi,

2731
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,190
she would have embezzled
even ten cents.

2732
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:34,530
I have a feeling the money
wasn't divided equally.

2733
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:35,630
- It wasn't.
- It wasn't.

2734
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:37,330
- It wasn't.
- She'd have taken even a bit.

2735
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:38,600
- She took it.
- Right?

2736
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,370
The two employees
of Song Ji Hyo's company...

2737
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:44,300
will go and decide
if they will file the final complaint.

2738
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,840
We'll be back, Ms. Song.

2739
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:48,740
You have to file a complaint,
Ye Eun.

2740
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:50,840
- Haha...
- Are you going alone?

2741
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:52,010
We have to go together.

2742
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:54,010
Why are you avoiding our eyes?

2743
01:26:54,010 --> 01:26:56,280
I really have a child's heart.

2744
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:59,190
Let's trust her until the end.

2745
01:26:59,190 --> 01:27:02,290
If we go with trust and we're right,
it would be amazing.

2746
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:04,490
- Isn't it right?
- What is?

2747
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:05,530
It would be amazing
if we were right.

2748
01:27:05,530 --> 01:27:07,860
- Really?
- Since we said we'll trust her,

2749
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:09,030
we should keep the trust
and go with that.

2750
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:12,600
I think that would be better
for the children as well.

2751
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:14,070
Let's go first.

2752
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:15,070
(It's Eun Visual's turn.)

2753
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:16,900
They shouldn't report me.

2754
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,340
- Today, Ms. Kwon...
- Yes.

2755
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,110
Ms. Kwon. She...

2756
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:22,810
- She did take some money.
- She's seriously...

2757
01:27:22,810 --> 01:27:24,210
- Making double the money...
- Hey.

2758
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:25,210
- and being on top is better.
- She could have...

2759
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:27,050
given us 200 dollars each.

2760
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:28,880
Like 50 dollars for the 1st round,
100 dollars for the 2nd,

2761
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:29,880
and 50 dollars this time.

2762
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,480
If we double 200 dollars,
it's still only 400 dollars.

2763
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,350
But we earned
several thousand dollars.

2764
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:34,350
We earned almost 10,000 dollars.

2765
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:36,360
- But that's...
- That doesn't make sense.

2766
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,360
Do you trust her?

2767
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,030
- Like I said, I think...
- It's 1 of the 2.

2768
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:40,730
Ms. Kwon took some money
for herself.

2769
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:43,530
But if she didn't take a big amount,
letting it be is better.

2770
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:46,400
That's right. If she gave us
at least 2,000 dollars...

2771
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,000
Of course. If it's double
that amount, it's 4,000 dollars.

2772
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,200
- It's 4,000 dollars.
- That's nice, but I think...

2773
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,640
- I think she gave us that amount.
- She did,

2774
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,640
- because...
- I think she gave us 200 dollars.

2775
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:54,610
- we earned 10,000 dollars.
- Right.

2776
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:56,380
- We earned 10,000 dollars.
- She wouldn't give us 10 dollars.

2777
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:58,540
- She can't do that.
- I think...

2778
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,550
- we should keep it like this.
- We'll fill it.

2779
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:01,550
- Okay.
- Let's fill it.

2780
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:02,580
- Let's go.
- It's...

2781
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:04,550
- We'll do it like that.
- We'll do it like that.

2782
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,920
I won't forgive her
if she gives us 10 or 50 dollars.

2783
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,420
- Then we'd be total fools.
- Of course.

2784
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:12,190
The salaries have been distributed,

2785
01:28:12,190 --> 01:28:13,590
and decisions were made...

2786
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:15,230
- to file complaints or not.
- Yes.

2787
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:19,000
Haha's company
gained an additional...

2788
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,070
three thousand dollars this time.

2789
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:24,000
Haha took 2,800 dollars.

2790
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,810
- They're not even surprised.
- Look at his expression.

2791
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:30,180
Look at his expression.
He's making a pitiful expression.

2792
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,640
Why are you making
a pitiful expression?

2793
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,710
- It's even more annoying.
- So the final amount...

2794
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:36,550
is 4,717.9 dollars for Haha.

2795
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:38,080
He was given that much?

2796
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:41,490
As for Kim Jong Kook and Joohoney,

2797
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:42,920
they have 2,017.9 dollars...

2798
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,460
- They still have a lot.
- as their final amount.

2799
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:45,560
- Why do they have so much?
- They have 2,000 dollars?

2800
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:47,790
They have 2,000 dollars?

2801
01:28:47,830 --> 01:28:49,000
- You have a lot.
- How do they have 2,000 dollars?

2802
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,200
He had been dividing the money
equally until now.

2803
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,530
- From the beginning.
- We worked hard.

2804
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:53,970
He's a nice CEO.

2805
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,570
Ji Hyo's team...

2806
01:28:56,570 --> 01:28:58,710
didn't file a complaint.

2807
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:00,710
(The employees trusted CEO Song
until the end!)

2808
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:02,110
- And?
- Please, I hope she took the money.

2809
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,510
She wouldn't.

2810
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:04,540
- So...
- Seriously.

2811
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:08,380
- I hope she did.
- for the final salary, Ji Hyo...

2812
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:10,380
(Ji Hyo has a strange expression.
Would she have embezzled it?)

2813
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:12,650
- shared the amount...
- Please, I hope she took it all.

2814
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:14,620
equally.

2815
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:16,660
Ji Hyo!

2816
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:18,190
(Ji Hyo shared the money equally
from the beginning to the end.)

2817
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:19,530
What is this?

2818
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:21,430
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

2819
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:22,600
Ji Hyo.

2820
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,130
(IUB's profit)

2821
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,200
(CEO Song ran her business
with transparency...)

2822
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,400
(like see-through lingerie
until the very end.)

2823
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,570
Ji Hyo.

2824
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:35,610
Since the three didn't file
a complaint until the end,

2825
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:39,580
you will get double
the shared amount.

2826
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:42,010
(Net amount
excluding other expenses)

2827
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:46,120
Daniel and Ye Eun get
5,422.8 dollars.

2828
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:48,220
- Five thousand?
- Song Ji Hyo...

2829
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:52,530
- gets 5,414 dollars.
- You're a really good person.

2830
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:55,390
- Really.
- Seriously.

2831
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,360
(She is awarded
the Good Businessperson prize.)

2832
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,730
As for Kwon Eun Bi's company,

2833
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:01,500
- the employees...
- We couldn't do it because of him.

2834
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,840
- didn't use the complaint ticket.
- Right.

2835
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,440
- They didn't file a complaint.
- We...

2836
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,340
- We have to trust her.
- Thanks to that,

2837
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:09,080
- you get double the amount.
- Right.

2838
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,340
Everyone receives double the amount.

2839
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:12,080
- I'll be getting the penalty.
- So?

2840
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:13,580
First,

2841
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:16,920
(The amount the employees earned
today: 12,800 dollars)

2842
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,390
Yu Jae Seok's final amount...

2843
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:21,390
It's been doubled.

2844
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:22,490
- Right.
- It's the doubled amount?

2845
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:25,420
It's 1,117 dollars.

2846
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:27,530
It's 1,117 dollars.

2847
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:30,130
(It's 1,110 dollars?)

2848
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,530
(That means Eun Bi gave him
only 500 dollars.)

2849
01:30:31,530 --> 01:30:33,170
She gave him a lot.

2850
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,540
- She gave him a lot.
- She gave him a lot.

2851
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,170
(The prediction by the employees
failed completely.)

2852
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:42,640
(CEO Kwon gave them
way less than they predicted.)

2853
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,180
I told you we should get her.

2854
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:46,610
- Then...
- It's an amount...

2855
01:30:46,610 --> 01:30:47,910
you can't laugh about.

2856
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:51,450
Yang Se Chan's amount doubled.

2857
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:53,650
- You bought coffee and bread.
- Yes.

2858
01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:56,220
I'll tell you the amount you got,
excluding those expenses.

2859
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:57,920
- The coffee was around 20 dollars.
- The doubled amount...

2860
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,730
is two cents.

2861
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:01,530
- What?
- Two cents.

2862
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:04,800
(Two cents)

2863
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,630
- I got two cents.
- Two cents?

2864
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:08,200
(Eun Bi gave Se Chan 1 cent
after earning over 10,000 dollars.)

2865
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,700
- How much?
- Two cents.

2866
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,170
- Two cents?
- Two cents?

2867
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:14,570
(He has experience
being betrayed by Eun Bi.)

2868
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:17,910
- How could she even think that?
- How much?

2869
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:19,610
(Denying the reality)

2870
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:22,650
(A thanking ceremony)

2871
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:24,780
You can't laugh about the amount.

2872
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,390
She gave Jae Seok a lot.

2873
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:28,720
She gave Jae Seok a lot.

2874
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:31,790
Jee Seok Jin's amount also doubled.

2875
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:33,030
Seok Jin...

2876
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:35,290
received 0.2 cents in total.

2877
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:42,000
(It's an amount
that's even hard to give in cash.)

2878
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,170
Seriously.

2879
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:46,510
- I told you about Kwon Eun Bi.
- She gave Jae Seok...

2880
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:47,770
- a huge amount.
- So,

2881
01:31:48,210 --> 01:31:49,740
- There's no doubt.
- Kwon Eun Bi...

2882
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:53,880
- gets 24,482.97 dollars.
- Twenty thousand dollars!

2883
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:57,520
(She gets 24,482.97 dollars.)

2884
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:03,420
From the beginning,
I'll go with embezzlement.

2885
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:05,760
(Profit: 2,800 dollars)

2886
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,790
(Profit: 0, Eun Bi: 2,800 dollars)

2887
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:08,960
(She embezzled the entire amount
right from the very beginning.)

2888
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:13,200
Our poor employees
are working hard, trusting only me.

2889
01:32:14,130 --> 01:32:15,570
I should embezzle the money
right away.

2890
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:19,340
Since our Vice-CEO has a title,
I'll give him 500 dollars.

2891
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:22,040
(Profit: 0, Eun Bi: 5,300 dollars,
Jae Seok: 500 dollars)

2892
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,910
(She gives the Vice-CEO
preferential treatment.)

2893
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:28,280
(She embezzled the entire amount
during the third settlement.)

2894
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,220
- I'll deduct it from your salary.
- Okay!

2895
01:32:30,650 --> 01:32:32,120
(She uses the employees' money
to pay for meals,)

2896
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,590
(pretending she gave them
a lot of money.)

2897
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:35,350
Let's play rock-paper-scissors
and have the loser pay.

2898
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:37,220
What kind of company is this?

2899
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:40,530
(She has to keep a shameless face.)

2900
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:44,160
(The final salary settlement)

2901
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:47,100
(These were the amounts
she first gave.)

2902
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:50,500
(Jae Seok bought coffee earlier.
How much was that?)

2903
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,770
(She at least gives him the amount
for the coffee.)

2904
01:32:54,910 --> 01:32:58,480
(She took 12,240 dollars
out of 12,800 dollars.)

2905
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,280
She will get off work
with that amount.

2906
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:03,720
- Amazing.
- The employees worked like dogs.

2907
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,050
We just worked like dogs.

2908
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:07,950
- I told you.
- We just worked like dogs.

2909
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:10,190
What are you doing tomorrow?

2910
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:12,690
Let's go protest
in front of her building.

2911
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:15,160
Protest.

2912
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,830
- We'll hold up placards.
- Come out, Kwon Eun Bi!

2913
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:19,930
(A tearful struggle
against the ruthless employer)

2914
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:22,030
- Kwon Eun Bi.
- I told you so.

2915
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:24,640
- What did I tell you over there?
- This is unacceptable.

2916
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,310
- Seriously.
- We said we'd give gifts...

2917
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:27,940
- to the employees...
- I gave you the most.

2918
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:30,840
ranked 1st to 5th,
appropriate to their positions.

2919
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:33,180
The three CEOs...

2920
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:36,920
will get Onnuri gift certificates
worth 300 dollars.

2921
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:38,380
That's really nice.

2922
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:40,720
Daniel will get a fruit set...

2923
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,690
suitable for his position
as manager.

2924
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:43,920
- That's so nice.
- Ye Eun...

2925
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:44,920
That's amazing.

2926
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,730
- Ye Eun...
- A part-timer.

2927
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:48,430
was a part-timer. The part-timer...

2928
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:50,430
will get a cooking oil set.

2929
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:52,530
(The part-timer gets cooking oil.)

2930
01:33:53,630 --> 01:33:54,700
That's nice.

2931
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,200
Cooking oil.

2932
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:57,240
(The prizes are strictly distributed
according to position.)

2933
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,710
The penalty given
to the five penalty receivers...

2934
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:02,410
who have tasted
the bitter side of society...

2935
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:06,150
is a drink which is healthy
but extremely bitter.

2936
01:34:06,150 --> 01:34:07,150
Sophora root tea.

2937
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:09,080
- That's great.
- That's nice.

2938
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,820
- The ginger juice is the worst.
- Ginger...

2939
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,520
- Goodness.
- Please drink it.

2940
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,590
This is a bit...

2941
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:15,690
(Broccoli, bitter melon and cabbage,
ginger and turmeric,)

2942
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:16,790
(ginseng, coriander)

2943
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:17,790
- Nice.
- Nice.

2944
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:21,130
(Everyone tastes the bitter side
of society and the penalty!)

2945
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:22,760
- He did he not know the taste?
- How do you eat ginger?

2946
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:24,530
Kwon Eun Bi!

2947
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,130
- You're amazing, Eun Bi.
- It was fun.

2948
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:29,400
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

2949

Why are you wearing a topknot?

2954
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:41,010
I look pretty.

to variety shows)

2964

- Yes.
