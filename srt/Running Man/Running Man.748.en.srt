1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,770
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,310
(The spring breeze announces
the start of a new season.)

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,740
- The weather is a lot warmer now.
- It is.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,010
- Why is it just the three of us?
- I know.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,550
- Why is that?
- It's been a long time.

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,150
I guess we're divided into groups.

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,750
Are we a team?

8
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,550
- Are we in groups?
- Hello.

9
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,390
- Hello.
- Hi.

10
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,590
Why are we divided?

11
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,830
Right.
Why did you split us into teams?

12
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,630
We're so close to each other.

13
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,030
- Only the annoying ones are there.
- Right.

14
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,430
- Se Chan, Haha, and...
- We are...

15
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,100
- Only the good ones are here.
- The nice ones.

16
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,100
And Jae Seok.

17
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,440
You know
what day it is today, right?

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,870
- Yes. A day with fine dust.
- Ultrafine dust.

19
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,140
It's a warm day.

20
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,650
Today, our new rented member,
Choi Daniel is joining us today.

21
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,250
- Daniel? It's today.
- I see. Daniel.

22
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,720
(The soul of a middle-aged man
trapped in a smart appearance)

23
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,590
(A strange friend brought by So Bal)

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,560
(Call Daniel over one more time.
He's clumsy and funny.)

25
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,130
(Make Choi Daniel a rented member.
He's hilarious.)

26
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,730
(I hope Choi Daniel will be
a new rented member.)

27
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,560
You're very tall.

28
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,130
(The long-legged man
who's after long-legged Ye Eun)

29
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,970
(A clumsy guy
who looks like Kwang Soo)

30
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,010
(The new rented member, Choi Daniel)

31
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,180
Daniel was told that
the shoot would start at 2 p.m. today,

32
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,180
- so he's still at home.
- Okay.

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,550
(Daniel's manager was told
about the schedule separately.)

34
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,390
(The shoot will begin
at 2 p.m. this week.)

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,120
The three of you will have Daniel
get ready when he has no idea.

36
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,860
The time you bring him to the place
for his welcoming party...

37
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,130
will determine the amount of money
you get for today's episode.

38
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,360
- What? Only the three of us?
- Yes. You will go and...

39
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,830
You want us to go to his place
and bring him here?

40
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,640
Yes. If you bring him in 30 minutes,

41
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,540
- you will get 500 dollars.
- Okay.

42
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,370
If he gets there in 1 hour,
you get 300 dollars.

43
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,580
If you bring him in an hour
and a half, you get 200 dollars.

44
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,640
(If it takes more than that,
they get only 50 dollars.)

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,850
If you spend all your money
and go into the red,

46
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,450
some of you will get a penalty.

47
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,980
- By the way...
- The time...

48
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,080
You want us to get him
washed up now?

49
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,020
We are great at parenting, you know.

50
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,290
For your information,
you can't force him to hurry...

51
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,090
by saying things like, "We're late."
"The shoot doesn't start at 2 p.m."

52
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,660
- "This is about money."
- What do we do then?

53
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,500
If Daniel notices something...

54
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,530
and says things like,
"What's the rush,"

55
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,840
you will lose 10 dollars each time.

56
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,170
- That's ridiculous.
- That doesn't make sense.

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,370
How would we get him to move
without saying things like that?

58
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,940
It's not like we're having
a housewarming party there.

59
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,150
In order to have Daniel
get ready spontaneously,

60
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,150
you can tell him that
you are there to film...

61
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,190
the vlog of our rented member's
first day...

62
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,020
on Running Man.

63
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,560
- His vlog?
- Yes.

64
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,920
We will fail for sure.

65
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,330
- And...
- He'd want to show us around.

66
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,730
- Daniel is a nutcase.
- Yes.

67
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,100
- That's true.
- Right.

68
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,430
He's not an ordinary man.

69
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,730
- He's a calm nutcase.
- He is.

70
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,940
- And...
- Then why don't we talk to him...

71
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,140
at the front door
without taking off our shoes?

72
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,640
- How?
- That's not rushing him.

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,140
- It would be weird though.
- It's strange.

74
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,580
- We're at his place.
- He'd say, "Is something going on?"

75
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,350
- "What is this? Is this a mission?"
- Then...

76
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,920
- So we should hurry and bring him.
- Yes.

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,820
Aren't the rest of the members
coming to the shoot?

78
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,990
- They'll prepare a welcoming party.
- A welcoming party for him.

79
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,120
They're getting ready for the party.

80
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,090
- Okay. Gosh, this is...
- All right.

81
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,460
- not easy.
- It's hard.

82
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,130
"New rented member, Choi Daniel."
Daniel is really...

83
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,730
He became our rented member
after coming here twice.

84
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,000
Why is the cake so...

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,240
(She's looking at the bread
holding a balloon in her hands.)

86
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,770
I'm on a diet now,
so I have no appetite.

87
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,040
I'll just look around.

88
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,580
- Are you hungry, Seok Jin?
- What?

89
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,050
- Are you hungry?
- I want bread.

90
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,410
- I'm hungry.
- You should have breakfast.

91
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,420
She wants to buy some bread
because she's hungry.

92
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,690
That's not true, Ji Hyo.
Are you hungry?

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,750
- Just order some.
- Order some?

94
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,190
The bread is good here.

95
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,390
An egg tart.

96
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,360
It's hard to stick
to my character as a food fighter.

97
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,930
(She's trying to buy
a moderate amount of bread.)

98
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,470
This is for my character
as a food fighter.

99
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,030
About this much?

100
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,840
This is it.

101
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,540
- Thank you.
- Are we having a lunch break?

102
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,140
It looks delicious.

103
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,550
(While trying to satisfy her hunger
instead of preparing for a party...)

104
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,680
We should bring him out anyway.

105
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,320
It won't be easy.

106
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,220
(The countdown begins
the moment they ring the doorbell.)

107
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,720
- Let's go. What is this?
- We got prepared.

108
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,020
- Gosh, what is this?
- What did he buy?

109
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,230
- I guess it's for his dog.
- I see.

110
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,390
Is it a dryer?

111
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,500
It washes your dog
and dries it in it.

112
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,400
I didn't know
they had things like that.

113
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,500
- Does it begin as soon as we go in?
- Yes.

114
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,670
- All right. I'll do it.
- Go ahead.

115
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,240
- Press it.
- We should let him wash up.

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,040
You should press it. Then it begins.

117
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
(The time attack for the money
starts now.)

118
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,940
- We shouldn't rush him.
- No.

119
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,050
This is...

120
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,650
Why don't we just tell him
to come out right away?

121
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,450
Let's see what it is like
when he opens the door.

122
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,020
We don't know what it would be like.

123
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,020
Is he still asleep?

124
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,090
Is he trying to hide his girlfriend?

125
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,260
"Hurry and hide! What's going on?"

126
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,670
It's been 20 seconds.

127
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,670
- Come on.
- It begins after he comes out.

128
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,300
We should start...

129
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,640
- once the door opens.
- What?

130
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,370
- Daniel.
- Once the door opens.

131
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,470
(The new rented member
reveals his identity.)

132
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,510
- Daniel.
- Gosh, Daniel.

133
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,910
- Oh, dear.
- What's all this?

134
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,310
Once the door opens.

135
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,510
- Daniel.
- Oh, gosh.

136
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,050
(Who is he?)

137
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,080
- Oh, dear.
- Hi.

138
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,990
- What?
- What's all this?

139
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,450
- What's with him?
- What?

140
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,920
- Hey.
- What's with your beard?

141
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,860
- He's...
- Are you wearing makeup or what?

142
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,030
His eyes are gone.

143
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,260
- What's with him?
- He looks horrible.

144
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,930
- Hey.
- Come on in.

145
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,470
- Why are you...
- Where are your eyes?

146
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,230
- Are you wearing makeup?
- No.

147
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,240
- Have you been confined?
- Your face...

148
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,700
- What's with his beard?
- What happened to your face?

149
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,840
What is the movie
where a man escapes Bam Islet?

150
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,940
- It features Jung Jae Young.
- The castaway.

151
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,940
Yes. He looks like a castaway.

152
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,250
- We should stay quiet here.
- Let's just go in.

153
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,550
- Come on in first.
- Why are you here?

154
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,750
- What?
- Why are you here?

155
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,290
- We're having the shoot today.
- This is for your vlog.

156
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,020
- What vlog?
- By the way,

157
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,660
your dog looks like me.

158
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,090
We will put the microphone
on Daniel first.

159
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,330
Okay. Put on the microphone, Daniel.

160
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,990
- What's your dog's name?
- The thing is...

161
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,130
- Kong.
- Kong.

162
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,000
- Kong, I'm sorry. I love you.
- Kong, I'm sorry.

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,770
- The thing is...
- You can film the vlog outside.

164
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,370
Why are we doing it here?

165
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,370
- Have you been confined?
- I...

166
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,240
(The close-up vlog begins.)

167
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,140
- What's with your face?
- You two look alike.

168
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,410
Well... I had...

169
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,680
no schedule yesterday. What?

170
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,010
- By the way...
- It's been two days...

171
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,380
- since I shaved.
- Is this a documentary...

172
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,380
where we arrest him?

173
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,120
- My gosh.
- Where did your eyes go?

174
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,220
This is just...

175
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,920
This is like a show
where we meet stars from long ago.

176
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,090
Is this what you did
on "Omniscient Interfering View?"

177
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,130
"Omniscient Interfering View?"

178
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,460
- What is going on?
- Do you gamble?

179
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,530
- Did you lose all your money?
- By the way...

180
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,930
- Do I look that bad?
- What happened?

181
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,770
(He introduced his clean place
with a much neater appearance.)

182
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,840
(He looked fashionable
even at home back then.)

183
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,510
It's so nice to live alone.
Look how freewheeling you are.

184
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,380
You still have the Christmas tree.

185
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,650
- He's crazy about Running Man.
- What?

186
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,720
He still has this jacket.

187
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,850
We should tell him
how to get rid of the name tag.

188
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,620
I should tell him
how to take it off.

189
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,190
- Look at this. He loves it.
- Right.

190
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,230
Of course. I was on the show twice.

191
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,760
You have two.

192
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,870
Why does he have
so many plans for meals?

193
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,040
- Because he's single.
- Right.

194
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,900
You're busy.

195
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,770
You have a lot of plans.

196
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,640
- It's 2 p.m.
- What's 2 p.m.?

197
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,650
(Daniel thinks
the shoot begins at 2 p.m.)

198
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,680
- But today...
- This is what we do.

199
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,980
- It's like a hazing ritual.
- Now that we're here...

200
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,480
It begins at 2 p.m.

201
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,390
- It's 2 p.m.
- Yes.

202
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,490
- What were you doing?
- I was sleeping.

203
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,290
- Were you sleeping?
- Yes.

204
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,330
- Why were you still sleeping?
- What time did you go to bed?

205
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,130
- By the way, Daniel.
- Yes.

206
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,600
We have a high level
of fine dust today.

207
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,860
- Fine dust?
- Keep the windows closed.

208
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,330
I slept with the windows
open last night.

209
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,770
It was a little hot.

210
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,140
- Right.
- You can't...

211
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,600
- keep them open.
- I should close them.

212
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,870
(He doesn't care about fine dust.)

213
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,110
(He closes them for him.)

214
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,440
Daniel, this is...

215
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,380
It was right here,
so I thought it was an air purifier.

216
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,610
- It's a suitcase.
- My suitcase...

217
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,350
I'm doing a travel show...

218
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,090
on another channel,
and I just got back.

219
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,120
- I went to Argentina.
- I see.

220
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,530
I like your unshaven face better.

221
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,830
I'm serious.
Did you shower yesterday?

222
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,860
I did.

223
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,460
Then you don't need to shower.

224
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,100
- You look cool.
- You're really cool.

225
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,100
Why don't you look natural
like this today?

226
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,240
I think you look better this way.

227
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,070
- You look great.
- Why don't you shave?

228
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,940
- What...
- We're having the shoot today.

229
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,440
- I know, but...
- He's good at shaving.

230
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,310
Why are you here?

231
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,680
Where's your razor?

232
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,620
It's in my room.
Do you want me to shave?

233
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,320
- Wash up first.
- The thing is...

234
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,420
- So you...
- I have an electric shaver.

235
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,990
We should go now.

236
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,050
Let's go out and eat.

237
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,520
Where are we going now?

238
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,790
The camera...

239
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,560
- This is your vlog.
- Vlog.

240
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,690
- But...
- So you...

241
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,100
- Okay.
- What's that thing?

242
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,100
You're joining us
as our rented member.

243
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,830
This is a hazing ritual.

244
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,670
(Daniel suddenly starts moving.)

245
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,200
- This is a hazing ritual.
- Hang on.

246
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,070
Put on some slippers here.

247
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,670
- It's okay.
- Slippers.

248
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,580
- I have slippers here.
- Why should we wear them?

249
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,010
Se Chan, you should put these on.
These are...

250
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,680
Why are you giving me
only one slipper?

251
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,450
I can't find the other one.
Just put it on for now.

252
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,650
- Is this it?
- Yes. Just for now.

253
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,190
- Daniel, these are really thin.
- Yes. They are thin.

254
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,390
- Just wear them.
- Good.

255
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,520
- Hey, first...
- All right.

256
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,860
Jae Seok is good at shaving.

257
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,030
So you... Hang on.

258
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,990
- Shave? But...
- Or...

259
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,600
It will be fun if Jae Seok...

260
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,800
- You should shave.
- No.

261
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,870
- Wait. That's not the problem.
- Okay.

262
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,200
I should drink some water.

263
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,340
Have some water.
I'll give you water.

264
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,870
- No. It's okay.
- Still,

265
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,940
you're visiting my place.

266
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,370
- No.
- I'll give you some water.

267
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,370
- No.
- Let's drink this.

268
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,210
- This is...
- Hang on.

269
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,340
- You...
- You just drank it.

270
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,050
Are you trying to give it to us
after you drank it?

271
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,280
Are you giving us
what you were drinking?

272
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,480
No. This is...

273
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,120
- oriental raisin tea.
- I see.

274
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,450
- It's good, right?
- No.

275
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,590
- No.
- It's okay.

276
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,750
- It's oriental raisin tea.
- You should drink it.

277
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,960
Do you not like it?

278
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
All right then.

279
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,030
- Let's just go out.
- But...

280
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,590
- Let's go out and eat.
- Water.

281
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,560
(Minus 10 dollars)

282
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,430
(The money was deducted right away
as he forced him to go out.)

283
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,570
We can't force him.

284
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,370
- Let's just go out.
- But...

285
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,670
Water.

286
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,900
Why are you giving us water?

287
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,910
You're here as guests.

288
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,040
I'm not drinking water.

289
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,310
Have some water.

290
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,480
I don't need water.

291
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,410
Se Chan, have some water.

292
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,950
- All right.
- This is "Cyrano Agency."

293
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,780
- When did you get this?
- That?

294
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,780
- I got it from a fan.
- Cheers.

295
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,420
- All right.
- Congratulations.

296
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,450
(They drink together for no reason.)

297
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,660
(Gulping down)

298
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,330
Hey. This water...

299
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,660
(Hey. This water...)

300
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,300
You...

301
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,200
- You drink it from the bottle.
- No.

302
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't do that. I'm serious.

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,130
- I really don't.
- But I just saw you drink it...

304
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,640
- from the bottle.
- No. I did this.

305
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,270
I didn't touch the bottle.

306
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,470
I don't drink from the bottle.

307
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,440
Let's go out and have breakfast.

308
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,380
- All right.
- Right.

309
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,180
- You should shave first.
- Right.

310
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,380
Shave?

311
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,910
I should shave, but...

312
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,320
You have to go to the shoot anyway.

313
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,380
But it starts at 2 p.m.

314
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,950
- But we're here.
- Come on.

315
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,520
Hey, have some manners.

316
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,960
- But...
- Why are you being like this?

317
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,090
We're wearing makeup now.

318
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,060
Okay. Then I will...

319
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,030
(Is he going to wash up now?)

320
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,930
Actually, I'm really good
at washing my kids.

321
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,000
Do you want my help?

322
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,600
Did you eat? You didn't, right?

323
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,740
- We ate.
- We ate.

324
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,140
- You ate?
- I had a big breakfast.

325
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,410
That can't be true.

326
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,570
I ate.

327
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,080
- You don't have to give us food.
- What now?

328
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,610
- I'll give you some lemons.
- Lemons?

329
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,980
Why would we eat lemons?

330
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,410
- Because...
- Lemons in the morning?

331
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,580
- That's not a good idea.
- lemons in the morning are good.

332
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,350
- No.
- I know it is good.

333
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,750
You don't have to do this.

334
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,050
Just wait. I'll do this.

335
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,690
You just wait. Come here.

336
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,960
Let's wash his hair there.

337
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,620
You should just wash up.

338
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,430
This is what I eat for breakfast.

339
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,990
We said we didn't need to eat.

340
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,160
I washed my hands
while washing the lemons.

341
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,300
Don't get me wrong.

342
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,670
Eating a lemon in the morning...

343
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,600
This is what I eat in the morning.

344
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,710
It's good to eat it
on an empty stomach.

345
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,680
Who says that?

346
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,550
The brand names shouldn't be on TV.

347
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,080
It's a gift from fans.

348
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,680
- I see.
- On my birthday.

349
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,050
- By the way, Daniel,
- Yes?

350
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,520
why don't you shave your face?

351
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,720
Okay.

352
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,460
I'll get your lemon ready. Hang on.

353
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,160
We don't eat lemons.

354
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,260
- Why aren't you listening to us?
- What?

355
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,390
Just shave your face, you brat.

356
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,700
- Why aren't you listening to us?
- Why aren't you listening to us?

357
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,170
Shave your face.

358
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,430
Shave!

359
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,700
- Shave.
- Wash your hair!

360
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,300
- Now.
- Okay?

361
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,570
I can't take this anymore.
Take off your pants first.

362
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:15,740
Just hurry.

363
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,540
Why are you squeezing lemons here?

364
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,780
This is for you. Hang on.

365
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,680
- No. We don't want it!
- We don't want it!

366
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,150
- This is really good.
- That's enough.

367
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,910
- Here...
- I know that.

368
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,120
I take out the seeds now.

369
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,780
Put on some lotion.

370
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,290
- Wash your face.
- Lotion.

371
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,750
You don't want to eat seeds.

372
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,220
(Daniel carefully
takes out the seeds.)

373
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,390
- Daniel. Well...
- It's all kimchi.

374
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,430
I can tell you live alone.

375
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,830
This is really nice.

376
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,930
By the way, Kong seems to be cold.

377
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,570
No. She always shakes like that.

378
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,010
- Really?
- Yes. She always shakes.

379
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,770
- Hey, Jae Seok.
- Seriously,

380
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,980
(Kong wouldn't like it,
but they do look alike.)

381
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,340
she really looks like you.

382
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,250
- She looks like you.
- She looks a little...

383
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,680
This area of her face
looks like Jae Seok.

384
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,720
She is...

385
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,120
- She looks a lot like me.
- Yes.

386
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,850
I got her from another family.

387
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,120
She was the youngest one
among the five dogs.

388
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,990
- Okay.
- I get it.

389
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,130
- She's low in the pecking order.
- So...

390
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,560
- you should shave your face.
- Why are you...

391
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
- shaving your face?
- Wash up.

392
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,860
Will you go to the shoot like that?

393
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,770
- Why won't you listen to us?
- Shave...

394
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,470
We still have some time.

395
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,270
- What are you talking about?
- That's not true.

396
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,800
- The traffic is bad.
- No.

397
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,140
The water... All right.

398
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,310
Give me that.

399
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,240
Lemon.
Let's just get this over with.

400
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,780
It won't be over
unless we finish it.

401
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,280
- That's enough.
- Lemon.

402
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,650
- Jae Seok, lemon.
- So why...

403
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,950
do we have to eat this?

404
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,350
- Heartburn...
- And I'll drink this.

405
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,380
Start.

406
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,020
Congratulations!

407
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,160
Why are you drinking it like that?

408
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,160
- I have heartburn.
- This is for me,

409
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,830
so I don't need a cup.

410
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,560
Isn't it nice?

411
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,130
It's refreshing, isn't it?

412
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,360
(They just drink it up
to make him wash up.)

413
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,970
- I have heartburn.
- Hey.

414
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,640
Stop opening the fridge.

415
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,940
Have some water if it's too sour.

416
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,570
- It's okay.
- Why do we keep drinking water?

417
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,810
Just wash your hair.

418
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,540
- Hey, hurry and shave.
- Don't worry about us.

419
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,980
- Okay.
- Hurry and shave your face so...

420
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,550
Hurry and shave your face so...

421
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,350
- Jae Seok.
- I mean, what's that thing?

422
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,590
- Don't tell him to hurry.
- We should eat.

423
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,690
- Don't say that.
- Right.

424
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,850
We ate.

425
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,320
- You didn't eat, did you?
- We ate.

426
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,620
We ate. Let's eat outside.

427
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,460
Let's go out
and have some gukbap, you brat!

428
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,290
- Let's eat outside.
- Eat outside?

429
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,130
- Yes.
- I can make fried eggs...

430
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,600
- No.
- No.

431
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,370
- Fried eggs...
- I had two eggs in the morning.

432
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,140
Okay. I get it.

433
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,670
I have honey tea. The thing is...

434
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,710
- Good. I want some.
- I'll give you honey tea.

435
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,680
- Why are you drinking it?
- Why?

436
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,340
- I'll give you honey tea.
- I like honey tea.

437
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,510
I recently went to Africa.

438
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,650
For a TV show.

439
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,050
- Hey, we will do it.
- Rwanda...

440
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,050
- In Rwanda...
- That's right.
- We will do it.
- You should wash up.

441
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,650
We will make it. Move over.

442
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,990
- We will do it.
- Why?

443
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,360
I'll make the honey tea.
Just go wash up.

444
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,660
- Why?
- Go and wash up.

445
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,730
- I'll do it.
- I want to see you wash up.

446
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,660
- We will do it.
- Hang on.

447
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,600
- You suddenly barge in here and...
- Hey.

448
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,330
You know what? Daniel...

449
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,300
- doesn't have bags like Jong Kook.
- Right.

450
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,570
He's a minimalist.

451
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,370
- That's nice.
- It's just a laundry room.

452
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,010
- This is it.
- Just go.

453
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,710
Take a shower with the camera on.

454
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,010
- This is the Rwandan money.
- I see.

455
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,480
- Congratulations.
- I get it.

456
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,850
- Just go.
- It's Rwandan francs.

457
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,910
- Shave already.
- Okay.

458
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,580
- This is nice.
- Just shave your face.

459
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,320
- Go.
- Wait. Jae Seok.

460
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,290
- What is Jae Seok doing?
- Leave him alone.

461
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,350
- He's doing chin-ups.
- Just wash up.

462
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,060
Oh, right. Chin-ups.

463
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,020
- That's right.
- This is nice.

464
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,560
- Chin-ups.
- I like it.

465
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,990
It's nice, isn't it?

466
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,300
- This is nice.
- This is where I work out...

467
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,460
while looking out.

468
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,170
- Chin-ups.
- Darn it.

469
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,400
Leave him be.

470
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,970
- We're doomed.
- It's over.

471
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,200
Here.

472
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,470
(It's so hard to look after him.)

473
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,410
What are you doing?

474
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,440
My goodness.

475
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,310
Why are you groaning
after doing two chin-ups?

476
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,580
Do you know this?

477
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,880
- Abs.
- I work on my abs like this.

478
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,250
- Abs.
- Hey.

479
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,520
Let's go.

480
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,390
- You should wash up.
- Okay.

481
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,620
- Just wash up. You should go.
- Okay.

482
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,160
Wash up first.

483
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,290
Good.

484
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,560
- I think we can do that.
- Good.

485
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,630
- Good.
- Let's do this and that.

486
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,900
- All right.
- I'll put on my shoes then.

487
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,200
Hang on, Haha.

488
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,370
- I...
- I'll put on my shoes.

489
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,600
Haha, wait.

490
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,970
- First...
- I'll make honey tea.

491
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,910
- No.
- I'll do it.

492
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,340
- Just come here.
- Wash up.

493
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,670
- Come here.
- Can you make honey tea?

494
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,480
- Of course.
- Daniel,

495
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,110
have you been beaten up
by someone younger than you?

496
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,480
I'm serious.

497
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,150
Come here. Just once.

498
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,420
Come on out.

499
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
- Come here.
- Where's the bathroom?

500
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,790
- Where's the bathroom?
- It's in the bedroom.

501
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,120
There's one here too.

502
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,920
- No, go to the bedroom.
- Is it here?

503
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,990
- Here and in the bedroom.
- Use the one in the bedroom.

504
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,660
- Go and wash up.
- You should go and wash up.

505
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,930
- Go.
- My goodness.

506
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,500
(The camera stand was hit
by the ceiling fan.)

507
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,800
- Are you okay?
- It's the ceiling fan.

508
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,230
- Let Jae Seok do it.
- Wait.

509
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,500
I'm sorry, but why do you keep
putting up a pole in his place?

510
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,370
I thought
you were an interior designer.

511
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,440
(When he goes to the kitchen,)

512
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,910
(they moved the camera
following him.)

513
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,010
(When he goes to the balcony,)

514
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,620
(they moved it again.)

515
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,650
(The camera can't take a break
as he keeps moving around.)

516
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,860
I thought
you were an interior designer.

517
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,360
- All right.
- Why are you putting it up?

518
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,390
(While they are talking
about the interior design...)

519
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,330
Why are you putting up a pole
all of a sudden?

520
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,600
It will be funny
if you start pole dancing now.

521
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,730
I have this thing.

522
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,760
(I have this thing.)

523
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,330
- I got this on the plane.
- Okay.

524
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,770
Shaving foam.

525
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,900
- Go ahead.
- Jae Seok is good at it.

526
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,740
(The opportunity is
coming close at the moment.)

527
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,110
Do you want honey tea?

528
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,180
(He sprays it right away.)

529
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,840
Just go now.

530
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,450
Go ahead and shave.

531
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,380
- Go and shave your face.
- Just go.

532
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,580
- I have a razor.
- Okay.

533
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,750
Don't do it here.
Do it in the bathroom.

534
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,850
Why?

535
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,020
You should do it in the bathroom.

536
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,720
- You sprayed it here.
- By the way,

537
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,390
- you have a thick beard.
- I do.

538
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,060
- I know.
- It's all over my face.

539
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,560
- You're really...
- So they call me John Wick.

540
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,130
- Daniel, do it in the bathroom.
- What?

541
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,400
- Are you doing it here?
- No. What do I do with this?

542
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,300
- Is it new?
- It's new.

543
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,770
I got it on the plane.

544
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,070
I will...

545
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,670
This is the only way.

546
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,170
- Into the room...
- Shampoo...

547
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,170
I know.

548
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,710
We should put shampoo on his head.

549
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,580
Hang on a second.

550
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,750
(The father of three kids
employs his last resort.)

551
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,850
- Dubai....
- Darn it.

552
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,650
- I went to the airport in Dubai.
- Okay.

553
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,390
- They offer a lot of nice stuff.
- Right. They do.

554
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,360
- There's deodorant too.
- By the way...

555
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,620
Hey, come here.

556
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,030
My goodness. Haha!

557
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,030
(Pumping)

558
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,500
- By the way...
- Hey, come here.

559
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,530
(He still has the skills
from washing his three kids.)

560
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,670
- My gosh.
- Just do it.

561
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,770
- Why are you doing this?
- Go and wash your hair.

562
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,130
- It's shampoo.
- Just go.

563
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,240
- Why did you put shampoo on me?
- We will do this. Just go.

564
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,370
- But why...
- Just wash your hair.

565
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,510
Honey tea.

566
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,570
- Honey tea.
- Okay. Just go in.

567
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,610
- My goodness. Wait.
- Hurry.

568
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,380
- Hang on.
- Just go in.

569
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,510
Go ahead.

570
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,750
- Hurry and do it.
- All right.

571
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,150
(He even washes his hair.)

572
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,250
Just go.

573
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,250
Hey, Daniel.

574
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,490
- Would you like us to wash you?
- Gosh, no.

575
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,520
- Should we wash you?
- Hurry, then.

576
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,620
Hurry in there.

577
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,590
(He can't seem to get moving.)

578
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,330
- That's natural honey.
- Okay, we get it.

579
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,760
- We know it's good.
- No sugar was added.

580
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,300
- You...
- Remove his pants.

581
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,870
- Just hurry.
- No, not my pants.

582
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,970
Hurry on in there, then.

583
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,170
Hurry up.

584
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,040
- Get washing.
- Okay, I'll wash up.

585
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,110
- Good.
- Yes, hurry.

586
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,370
- Okay, I'll wash up.
- Yes, hurry.

587
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,580
(He's finally washing up!)

588
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,710
(It took them 25 minutes to get
the problem child to wash up.)

589
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,150
Aren't you taking
the shampoo bottle?

590
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,910
He has enough.
I pumped it four times.

591
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,950
You're right.

592
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,320
What on earth?

593
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,120
Come on.

594
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,490
(He only rinses his face
without shaving.)

595
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,560
What...

596
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,700
What the...

597
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,570
Hold on. To wash my hair,

598
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,070
I need to take this off.
Is this allowed?

599
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,710
(Taking off his shirt)

600
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,640
(A true man of nature)

601
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,110
There's too much shampoo in my hair.

602
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,650
What on earth?
Why are they even here?

603
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,680
(Finally, he washes away
the 9 to 1 parting of his hair.)

604
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,920
I was going to have breakfast.

605
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,690
- This is fancy honey.
- Goodness.

606
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,690
- It'll be nice to have on toast.
- Is this honey?

607
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,490
- Yes, it's honey.
- Why don't we have it on toast?

608
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,530
- Maybe we should.
- Let's have some.

609
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,660
Where's the bread?

610
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,430
How about a fried egg?

611
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,530
Should we fry an egg?

612
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,930
Do you want a fried egg?

613
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,570
- We should. Come on.
- Do you want one?

614
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,800
Let's do this.

615
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,170
- We'll spread honey on a bun...
- Right.

616
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,940
- and stick a fried egg in it.
- We'll top it with an egg.

617
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,440
Those together would be delicious.

618
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,380
- Where's the cooking oil?
- I don't see any.

619
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,710
Of course there's cooking oil.
I saw it earlier.

620
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,810
- Where?
- Down below.

621
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,850
That's vinegar.

622
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,980
You'll find it
in one of the drawers.

623
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,520
- Daniel.
- Yes?

624
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,850
I don't see any cooking oil.

625
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,850
- Cooking oil?
- We don't need any.

626
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,920
Cooking oil?

627
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,360
- Hold on. Cooking oil...
- No, don't.

628
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,120
- Don't come out here.
- Where's the oil?

629
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,990
- Cooking oil...
- Here it is.

630
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,030
- He found one.
- I found canola oil.

631
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,500
Why are you shirtless?

632
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,030
- I had to wash my hair.
- Why...

633
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,730
I usually wash up
without any clothes on,

634
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,130
but I couldn't
because of all the people here.

635
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,370
Hold on.

636
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,840
Why didn't you shave?

637
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,910
What? Gosh, I forgot.
I'll shave right now.

638
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,610
Rather than cooking oil,
use the butter I already cut.

639
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,910
- Fry it in butter.
- Right.

640
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,740
- It's fine.
- We're good with this.

641
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,480
- Get in there.
- Put some clothes on.

642
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,650
- But I have cut-up butter.
- But...

643
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,850
(Yelling)

644
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,920
(Got you, you menace.)

645
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,490
Can't I pluck one of them?

646
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,890
- Just one.
- Don't.

647
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,220
Not this one. I've been purposely...

648
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,730
- Are you keeping that?
- I've been growing it.

649
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,030
- Wash up, already.
- Got it.

650
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,560
- Shave.
- All right.

651
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,960
Don't walk around shirtless.

652
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,470
- I should wash up but...
- You're not easily embarrassed.

653
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,470
Right.

654
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,270
You on variety shows...

655
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,600
- My gosh.
- Are you all right?

656
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
You on variety shows...

657
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,970
(Old Daniel can't go to his room
without causing a scene.)

658
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,380
I can't believe him.

659
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,210
- Being tall, he...
- Are you okay?

660
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,050
Why would you put this up here?

661
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,680
Daniel, are you all right?

662
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,780
- What's this?
- Let me see.

663
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,650
I never had this
around my house before.

664
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,490
- Are you all right?
- It was only a bump on the head.

665
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,260
(He goes to shave.)

666
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,130
It'll be best to boil some water
and have ramyeon.

667
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,330
Yes, boil some water.

668
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,690
Boil the water in there.

669
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,530
- That'd be perfect.
- But ramyeon...

670
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,660
would only slow us down.

671
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,270
We can at least have one
while waiting for him to get dressed.

672
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,530
- Aren't you going to have any?
- No.

673
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,900
- Just a bite.
- Of course he'll have some.

674
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,140
- Cook some ramyeon.
- But I had breakfast today.

675
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,110
Ramyeon's great to have
with a fried egg.

676
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,710
Are you trying to eat
everything he has?

677
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,720
(Jae Seok eventually joins them.)

678
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,520
This is fancy jam.

679
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,890
That honey must be expensive.

680
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,390
The honey is of good quality.

681
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,260
This with a fried egg?

682
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,660
The sweet and savory combo
is to die for.

683
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,130
- Hey.
- Daniel.

684
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,660
- This is perfect.
- Get dressed!

685
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,630
- You can have that one.
- Here you go.

686
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,370
Try this. Have it right away.

687
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,470
Right away.

688
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,970
(A bite while it's warm)

689
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,810
How is it? I bet it's good.

690
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,380
- No way, Jae Seok.
- Isn't it delicious?

691
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,680
- My gosh.
- This is...

692
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,880
a simple dish to enjoy at home.

693
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,250
It's good.

694
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,150
- Here you go.
- It's so good.

695
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,250
- It's really good.
- This is insane.

696
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:33,660
(Savory and sweet,
Chef Locust's honey and egg bun)

697
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,660
(Curious)

698
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,560
- This could be sold.
- Right?

699
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,100
Let Daniel have some. Daniel!

700
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,460
- Yes?
- Eat this while you get ready.

701
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,430
- Sure.
- Eat while you get ready.

702
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,470
No way.

703
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,500
(The shirtless man
shoves it in his mouth.)

704
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,170
Wait, I'm shirtless.

705
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,240
Gosh, the mic.

706
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,110
(After making sure
the man of nature ate)

707
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,310
- It's really good.
- Isn't it?

708
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,540
- Yes.
- How long has it been?

709
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,050
How long have we been here?

710
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,950
- You just passed 30 minutes.
- What?

711
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,020
Is it over?

712
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,520
(Within 30 minutes:
500 dollars, Fail)

713
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,250
- We'll bring him out in an hour.
- Yes, an hour.

714
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,650
(Within 30 minutes:
500 dollars, Fail)

715
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,390
(Within 1 hour: 300 dollars)

716
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,790
(Will they be able
to arrive with him within 1 hour...)

717
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,160
(and receive 300 dollars to spend?)

718
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,060
It's so good.

719
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,170
You're having an actual meal.

720
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,170
- Sorry?
- You're having an actual meal.

721
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,500
Come on. We're here waiting.

722
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,870
- Se Chan, get me some kimchi.
- Kimchi?

723
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,870
(While the three fill their stomachs
as they wait for Daniel)

724
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,340
- He doesn't have any kimchi.
- I see.

725
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,940
Are we supposed to assemble a cake?

726
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,680
Does "welcome" start with W, E, L?

727
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,780
- Do you know how to do that?
- I don't.

728
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,480
The cake is on the bigger side.

729
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,690
I've never done this before.

730
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,190
Of course. Strawberry cakes
are all the rage right now.

731
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,660
Why are you
not putting in the effort?

732
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,260
That's hardly the case. Look.

733
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,860
See what I end up with.

734
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,030
That should be spread out evenly.

735
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,030
- Later on...
- The layers are wobbly.

736
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,030
I'll make it look decent later on.

737
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,870
That's how it is.
It's supposed to be thick.

738
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,610
This is how it is.

739
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,710
- At the end...
- Now,

740
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,680
- you cover it with cream.
- Have some coffee.

741
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,080
- Cover the whole thing.
- Exactly.

742
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,550
- Cover it with cream.
- Yes, all of it.

743
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,080
The cream should cover
the top and the side.

744
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,420
And the side.

745
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,720
You're good at this.

746
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,050
- It needs a layer on the side.
- Right here. On the side.

747
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,460
No, wait.
The cream should go on the side.

748
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,220
- On the side.
- I know that.

749
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,760
- Spin it as you work.
- Spread it on the side.

750
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,390
You're getting most of it
on the bottom.

751
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,360
- But this...
- Seok Jin.

752
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,130
The cream drops to the bottom.

753
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,170
That's it.

754
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,140
(The assistant chef
is only making things harder.)

755
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,700
But this...

756
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,240
This needs to be filled in.

757
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,170
Go ahead. Fill the gaps on the side.

758
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,610
Once you get going,
you want to do a good job.

759
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,680
You want to do better.

760
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,680
(A clean finish)

761
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,450
Hold on. I'm good at this.

762
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,550
(Kook just discovered
another cute hobby.)

763
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:46,120
Hold on. You're good at this.

764
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,230
(The one who couldn't be bothered
is working the hardest.)

765
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,760
Shouldn't all the gaps be filled in?

766
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,960
- It should.
- It should be filled with cream.

767
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,400
Make sure there aren't any gaps.

768
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,830
Things like this... Jong Kook.

769
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,500
You're good at tasks
that require detail.

770
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,840
- That's who I am.
- What?

771
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,140
I pay attention to detail.

772
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,240
You should cover the cake
so that what's underneath...

773
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,870
doesn't show.

774
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,010
(Seok Sam tries
to decorate the cake.)

775
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,480
- Ji Hyo, this won't work.
- No, don't.

776
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,810
(Deleted)

777
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,410
No, don't.

778
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,150
- I was decorating the cake.
- It needs more cream.

779
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,350
It's not enough.

780
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,890
When are we going
to cover all of it?

781
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,320
Keep working at it. Add more cream.

782
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,520
- I want to decorate.
- I'm decorating it.

783
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,490
Add more cream.

784
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,260
- The cream is dropping.
- I'm decorating it.

785
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,860
Who decorates a cake like that?

786
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,100
Don't.

787
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,170
(Deleted for the 2nd time)

788
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,870
- Don't do it.
- Hey!

789
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,380
- I was decorating the cake.
- Don't.

790
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,810
Don't decorate it.

791
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,410
Now's not the time for that.

792
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,680
- Do the basics first.
- Seriously?

793
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,180
The cake needs a base
for you to decorate.

794
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,850
How much more
are you going to work on this?

795
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,750
- Work only on the front.
- The sheets can't show.

796
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,920
That's not it.

797
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,960
When will I have the time
to decorate?

798
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,630
It needs to be topped
with strawberries.

799
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,990
I'll place them one by one
as I go around.

800
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,400
Here.

801
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,860
Strawberry cakes
are all the rage right now.

802
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,600
Seok Jin, make it look pretty.

803
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,800
Make sure they look even
on the side.

804
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,870
- How much better can I do?
- Have it look even.

805
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,770
The strawberries are tilted.

806
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,740
- These...
- Hear me out.

807
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,340
- I'm worried it might fall.
- Lift it up.

808
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,010
Lift it up.
You should place the strawberries...

809
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,550
- on top of some cream.
- I see.

810
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,550
- Aren't I right?
- You are.

811
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,650
- Are you entering a contest?
- Here.

812
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,850
I'm only doing this
because the strawberries differ in size.

813
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,990
- Are we good?
- We're good.

814
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,760
- Okay. This looks nice.
- Good.

815
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,960
This looks good.

816
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,290
Next...

817
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,630
(Chocolate syrup)

818
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,700
Hold on.

819
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,570
Wait a second.

820
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,840
(Seok Sam smears the side with
chocolate that looks like dung.)

821
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,470
- What are you doing?
- That doesn't look right.

822
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,740
Hold on a second.

823
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,680
(He smears some more,
not being sure of himself.)

824
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,650
Seok Jin, move.

825
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,450
Gosh, no way.

826
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,590
That looks pretty.

827
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,620
(Decorating it nicely)

828
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,250
He could've run a bakery.

829
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,260
(High praise)

830
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,260
(You can't help but kiss up to him.)

831
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,230
You see this on the side of a cake.

832
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,460
Like that.

833
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,760
That's pretty.

834
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,260
- And here.
- Good.

835
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,670
(Even the food fighter approves
of the tasty decoration.)

836
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,830
- It also goes on the bottom.
- That's right.

837
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,670
Can I try?

838
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,970
- I like this on the side.
- Can I try?

839
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,270
(Sighing)

840
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,740
Gosh, I'm dizzy.

841
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,450
- I wasn't done with the chocolate.
- Really?

842
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,580
(Park Ji Song with the two hearts
is now helping with the cake.)

843
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,910
What else do we have?

844
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,020
Something like this.

845
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,750
(Adding colorful balloons)

846
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,790
Look at those cute candles.

847
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,790
- Should we add some yellow cream?
- Yes, to the middle.

848
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,320
- Sure.
- Here's yellow cream.

849
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,390
This is good enough to eat.

850
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,960
(Ye Eun adds more chocolate sauce.)

851
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,960
- With chocolate? Okay, nice.
- Yes, to make it look nice.

852
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,870
- Good.
- You did great.

853
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,200
- Messy plating has been trending.
- That's good enough.

854
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,800
(Scoffing)

855
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,270
(MZ Queen Ji Ye Eun
finishes it in a messy style.)

856
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,270
- We even have this.
- What's that?

857
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,140
Star-shaped candy.

858
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,410
(Adding star-shaped candy)

859
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,540
That's delicious.

860
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,510
(The cake only gets messier.)

861
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,450
- Sometimes, less is more.
- What are you doing?

862
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,580
Don't go overboard.

863
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,120
- He's right.
- Let's keep going.

864
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,550
- Food Fighter, here you go.
- It's okay.

865
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,720
Have it first.

866
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,920
Elders first.

867
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,960
That was a smart thing to say.

868
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,430
(The MZ Queen knows
her Chinese idioms.)

869
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,560
Why? What did she say?

870
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,760
"Elders first."

871
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,430
- Shouldn't you go first?
- It's fine.

872
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,430
Is it okay?

873
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,370
Just so you know,

874
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,800
even at home, I don't like...

875
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,040
- having a lot of things.
- I chase minimalism too.

876
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,740
- That's also what I prefer.
- My place is neat and pretty.

877
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,240
It's outdated though.

878
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,780
- But this fits perfectly...
- Right?

879
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,110
with the recent messy plating trend.

880
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,980
Seok Jin, she says
this style is trending.

881
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,510
My house is also just as messy.

882
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,680
- You're right.
- Right.

883
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,020
Plating featuring plastic bags.

884
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,620
- You're Bag Man.
- It's like...

885
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,620
My home is disorganized but still...

886
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,290
- It's cool.
- Plastic plating. That's fine.

887
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,060
- It's a new type of interior.
- Yes.

888
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,700
(Ji Hyo wants to put up
the balloons.)

889
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,530
It tastes so good.

890
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,600
- Stick that here. Yes.
- Here?

891
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,000
That'll do.
Ji Hyo, isn't that upside-down?

892
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,240
What? It's fine.

893
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,170
- This isn't good.
- It's fine.

894
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,380
The feelers on top...
Oh, it's upside-down?

895
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,780
This is a bow.

896
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,310
- It should be like this.
- Who stuck it like this?

897
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,010
It's not a butterfly?

898
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,520
- It's not a butterfly?
- This is...

899
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,050
Ji Hyo stuck the bow like this.

900
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,820
- I thought it was a butterfly.
- It's a bow.

901
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,190
You thought it was a butterfly?
They're all upside-down.

902
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,130
We can't stand photos like this.
We have to do something to it.

903
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,190
We can't pass this by.

904
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,830
(Chuckling)

905
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,400
My gosh.

906
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,630
(A village idiot)

907
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,700
You like that so much.

908
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,800
I have to doodle
on photos like that.

909
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,300
- You're like my uncle.
- Good.

910
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,070
(These three are still eating.)

911
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:33,780
We're like robbers.
We broke into someone's house...

912
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,450
Eat up before the homeowner returns.

913
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,280
We must shut it and eat.

914
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,480
Are we parasites or what?

915
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,460
- Let's go. You look good enough.
- No, my clothes...

916
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,060
(Is Daniel dressed and ready?)

917
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,990
- No, my clothes are over there.
- Go as is.

918
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,990
- You look fine.
- I do not. Wait.

919
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,560
How can you say this looks fine?

920
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,370
- You look cool, like Tarzan.
- Yes.

921
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,200
Here, Se Chan. Take this.

922
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,400
- What's this?
- You know this, right?

923
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,540
(He brought something...)

924
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,870
Look. Do you remember this?
I told you to buy them.

925
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,840
- Yes.
- The soda from that time?

926
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,540
- Can you take ten home?
- Yes.

927
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,980
(Last March, in episode 742,
they had to spend money.)

928
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,980
(They'd bought bags of soda.)

929
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,790
- The soda from that time?
- The soda.

930
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,420
- You drink them one day.
- I had...

931
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,990
- We bought this last time.
- What's this?

932
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,290
- The soda.
- It's the soda.

933
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,330
The sundaeguk restaurant.

934
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,830
- The sundaeguk place.
- Yes.

935
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,900
- Good for you.
- Get dressed.

936
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,200
You know you're topless, don't you?

937
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,300
Yes. That's so tasty.

938
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,900
You seem to enjoy this a great deal.

939
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,900
No.

940
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,510
(Tarzan's trying to
avoid the cameras.)

941
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,680
He's hilarious.

942
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,450
- Variety shows need guys like him.
- Yes.

943
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,350
We should wash some dishes.

944
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,480
- Let's wash the dishes.
- I'll do that.

945
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,450
- I'll do that.
- I'll get the trash.

946
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,750
It's just a few plates.
It won't take long.

947
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,690
- Clean that up.
- Okay.

948
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,690
He has his own routine,
so we can't do too much.

949
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,900
- That goes in the general trash.
- Okay.

950
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,660
Where are the wet wipes?
It's really clean.

951
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,530
I think we're done for.

952
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,670
We just have to get him out the door
within an hour.

953
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,270
Hey, Daniel.

954
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,910
- Will this work?
- Daniel.

955
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,240
You look good.

956
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,040
- You look nice.
- You look nice.

957
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,280
- Daniel.
- They didn't even look.

958
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,080
- I looked.
- You didn't even look.

959
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,520
I think we're done.

960
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,690
I'll do the washing up.

961
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,820
- It's done.
- Leave it.

962
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,360
- Where's your phone?
- Right here.

963
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,660
Good. Put it in your pocket.

964
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,590
- We're done.
- The honey tea.

965
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,060
(Daniel looks for the honey tea.)

966
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,260
- It's here.
- We drank it all.

967
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,160
I want some.

968
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,570
- No.
- We drank it all.

969
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,100
- It's done.
- Haha.

970
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,700
We drank it. Have some later.

971
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,200
- Later?
- Yes.

972
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,570
Are you in a rush?

973
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,470
- No.
- Are you in a rush?

974
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,470
(They lost ten dollars.)

975
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,180
- Are you mad? We're relaxed.
- What's wrong with you?

976
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,680
Don't be such an amateur.

977
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,410
- Let's hang out.
- Is this...

978
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,720
- a mission?
- It's not.

979
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,580
(Another loss)

980
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,320
Are you kidding?

981
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,690
- Why are you looking over there?
- What?

982
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,720
- Instead of looking at me...
- What?

983
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,290
Don't aggravate me.

984
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,500
We could even play yutnori here.

985
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,030
- Don't talk. Get your socks.
- Yes. I need socks.

986
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,330
Should I wear these?
I wore these yesterday.

987
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,740
If you wore them yesterday,
that's two days in a row.

988
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,240
Can you wear them standing up?

989
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,340
Those are yesterday's socks?

990
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,370
- Yes, but it's fine.
- They're clean.

991
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,810
- They're clean, right?
- You can wear them standing up.

992
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,140
This is how I do it.

993
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,980
Really? Can you wear your shoes
standing up too?

994
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,450
My shoes...
I can put them on standing up too.

995
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,550
- Hey, how about...
- What about clipping your toenails?

996
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,320
You look great.
Why don't you wear a cap?

997
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,760
- Yes, I'll wear a cap. Anything...
- Good.

998
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,620
- My caps...
- There's one over there.

999
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,990
- Hey, I have a Running Man outfit.
- Great.

1000
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,200
Shall we get a bag?

1001
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,730
Get a bag and a cap. Put that down.

1002
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,200
- Put this down?
- Yes. Where's your cap?

1003
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,500
- Wear a cap.
- That suits you. Put that on.

1004
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Shall I wear this?
My fans gifted it to me.

1005
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,070
- That looks great.
- We're done.

1006
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,810
- Nice.
- It's perfect.

1007
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,240
- You're ready.
- It's from my fans.

1008
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,950
- We're done. Let's go.
- Let's go.

1009
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,810
- You need your wallet.
- My wallet.

1010
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,520
- It's perfect.
- Haha, this is yours.

1011
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,980
- Okay. Thank you.
- We're done.

1012
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,990
- Let's go.
- We're leaving like this?

1013
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,590
- It's fine.
- No, but...

1014
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,820
How about I get you...

1015
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,690
- It's fine.
- No.

1016
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,790
- That's enough.
- No, wait.

1017
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,460
- Let me give you this.
- What?

1018
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,860
- Take one each.
- What's this?

1019
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,800
I got these to hand out
to my fans at my fan meet.

1020
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
- Soap?
- It's soap.

1021
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,640
- Soap's good. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1022
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,640
It's a nice soap.

1023
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,570
- It's cheese soap.
- Here.

1024
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,810
Here you go. Take some soap home.

1025
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,980
- Pass them around.
- Cheese soap?

1026
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,080
- You can have this.
- Thanks.

1027
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,150
Don't give Ye Eun any.
She'll eat it.

1028
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,280
She can't have this.

1029
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,420
Ye Eun? She eats soap too?

1030
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,620
- Yes. It's shaped like cheese.
- Really?

1031
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,460
She bites into everything first.

1032
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,160
It's soap. Take a box.

1033
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,560
It's like you're giving us
what would become trash.

1034
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,730
- Here. Take some soap home.
- It's cheese soap.

1035
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:51,370
I ordered them to give to my fans
at my fan meet.

1036
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:54,600
It's soap. I designed it myself.

1037
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,810
- It's pretty.
- Yes.

1038
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,270
- It's cheese-shaped.
- Yes.

1039
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,780
- We're done.
- Let's go.

1040
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,240
(Can they escape at last?)

1041
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,150
That'll do. Let's get going.

1042
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,580
Oh, wait.
I got these from somewhere too.

1043
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,990
I can't show the brand,
but let's see if he likes it.

1044
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,990
(It's a dog treat.)

1045
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,190
It didn't finish its food.

1046
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,220
There's some leftover food,
but I'll make sure there's enough.

1047
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,430
Kong.

1048
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,590
(He feeds Kong
while the others are desperate.)

1049
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,590
Come here.

1050
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,200
Eat all you want, Jae Seok.

1051
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,730
(I'm not hungry.)

1052
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,970
- Oh, dear.
- That's normal.

1053
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:28,170
- Daniel.
- Oh, right.

1054
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,310
I made some merch
just for my fan meet.

1055
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,610
- That's...
- Will you stop it?

1056
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,780
- They're...
- Give them to your fans.

1057
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,980
They're...

1058
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,580
You're sweating a lot.

1059
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,450
- Let's go.
- Cool yourself down outside.

1060
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,320
- It'll be cool. Let's go.
- Yes.

1061
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,590
- Come on.
- For your vlog.

1062
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,890
- Take a camera.
- One's for me?

1063
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,520
- You're off to work.
- Kong. Bye.

1064
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,460
- I love you, Kong.
- Bye.

1065
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,160
- Let's go. Yes.
- Is this for real?

1066
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,330
- For real?
- Yes.

1067
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,360
- Let me get my glasses.
- Get them.

1068
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,630
Sorry.

1069
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,670
(He goes back in for his glasses.)

1070
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,800
This is how it's done. It's no joke.

1071
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,670
My cap... This is so silly.

1072
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,140
- Let's go.
- We must go now.

1073
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,570
(The end is near!)

1074
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,780
- We were in there for an hour.
- Yes.

1075
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,410
- We finished within an hour, right?
- Hold this for me.

1076
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,410
It's including the travel time.

1077
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,380
- Are you serious?
- Don't be like this.

1078
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,050
- You're so tough.
- It's too tough.

1079
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,690
If you hurry...

1080
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,590
You said we can't urge or push him.

1081
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,790
Can't I take my car?

1082
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,690
(They must arrive within 30 minutes
to get at least 200 dollars.)

1083
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,500
If I can't, I might as well...

1084
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,700
(Clueless Daniel's taking his time.)

1085
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,400
I mean...

1086
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,200
I don't know what to do
with the mic that fell off.

1087
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,240
He's so frustrating.

1088
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,810
- Daniel?
- Yes, Jae Seok.

1089
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,610
- It's time.
- The elevator's here.

1090
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,280
I'm getting my mic fixed.

1091
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,280
You can do that outside.

1092
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,150
The staffer... The technician...

1093
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:51,390
Keep it away from my nipple.
My nipple's very sensitive.

1094
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,520
(He has sensitive nipples.)

1095
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,820
Daniel?

1096
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:57,630
- It's time.
- Can we stop now?

1097
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,000
(They wait
for Mr. Sensitive Nipples.)

1098
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,160
(The elevator leaves.)

1099
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,630
He can do that on the way.

1100
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,440
(Sighing)

1101
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,970
Can't I leave this in the car?
I'll take a car anyway.

1102
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,470
(Daniel saunters around,
not knowing their frustration.)

1103
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,680
(Inhaling through teeth)

1104
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,680
(He pauses to put on lip balm.)

1105
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,120
He has no plan on leaving.

1106
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,260
- Daniel.
- Yes.

1107
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,890
- I'm ready to go.
- Let's go.

1108
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,990
- I'm done.
- I'm done.

1109
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,100
I just need to put on...
The black...

1110
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,570
What could be the matter
with our Daniel?

1111
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,100
I don't like that
my socks are white.

1112
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,100
It looks fine.

1113
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,200
- What?
- We're all wearing white socks.

1114
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,540
- Me too.
- Where are your glasses?

1115
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,710
They're in my bag.

1116
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,810
- Okay, good.
- Let's go.

1117
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,780
- Are we really leaving like...
- Oh, my gosh.

1118
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,950
- It's all fine.
- What's going on?

1119
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,480
Let's get inside.

1120
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,550
We missed it again.

1121
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,490
- Oh, dear.
- You were late, and we missed it.

1122
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,920
- Well...
- We must wait again.

1123
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,330
What on earth is going on?
We're supposed to meet at 2 p.m.

1124
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,990
What on earth is going on?
We're supposed to meet at 2 p.m.

1125
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,900
(More suspicion means
they lose 50 dollars.)

1126
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,260
Don't you wear sunscreen?

1127
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,800
I don't need sunscreen.

1128
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,670
- I watch Running Man sometimes.
- I see.

1129
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,970
You're all liars.

1130
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,270
- My gosh.
- What would we lie about?

1131
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,810
- When you say you'll eat...
- We don't lie.

1132
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,810
Everything's a lie.
All the nice comments are lies.

1133
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,810
Let's hurry.

1134
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,380
Get in the car, Daniel.

1135
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,320
- It's a lovely day.
- Wait.

1136
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,420
What... Where...
My manager's not here?

1137
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,820
- We share a car.
- We take the same car?

1138
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,590
- Yes.
- This is Running Man.

1139
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,090
- This is Running Man.
- Wait. Can I get in?

1140
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,200
- You have to get in.
- Can you not do that?

1141
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,160
This is a trap, isn't it?

1142
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,270
- Hey.
- You're such an amateur.

1143
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,530
- If I get in...
- Daniel.

1144
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,400
- Will you take me elsewhere?
- No.

1145
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,640
- "You're not going to work."
- We're just taking the car.

1146
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,870
So Min told me
never to trust anyone.

1147
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,940
- Don't trust So Min.
- Ignore her.

1148
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,980
(Don't trust anyone.)

1149
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,580
- Do I get in?
- Yes.

1150
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,180
- Is this safe?
- Wear your seat belt.

1151
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,750
Oh, dear.

1152
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,190
Oh, come on.

1153
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,420
(They have a way to go,
and the slow-poke's taking so long.)

1154
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,260
My gosh...

1155
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,860
Goodness.

1156
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,060
- Why did you all come here?
- Don't trust anyone.

1157
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,800
- We're welcoming you.
- It's to welcome you.

1158
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,370
- It's nice to come in together.
- Yes.

1159
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,200
- But...
- How is that weird?

1160
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,510
We always gather at some place.

1161
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,240
This is a special day.

1162
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,980
- It's your official...
- Yes.

1163
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,180
The others
haven't clocked in yet, then?

1164
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,350
- They have.
- They have?

1165
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,510
- They're...
- They're waiting for you.

1166
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,780
They're setting things up
for the party.

1167
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,150
We'll move to the location...

1168
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,090
where the other members are waiting.

1169
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,590
But before that,
there was a hidden mission...

1170
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,420
- that Daniel didn't know about.
- Yes?

1171
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,560
The time that it takes
for you to get ready to leave...

1172
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,400
and arrive at the next location...

1173
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,600
decides how much money you get
for today's race.

1174
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,040
- Seriously, you...
- If you had only cooperated...

1175
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,800
How much money you get
for today's race.

1176
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,640
- Seriously, you...
- If you had only cooperated...

1177
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,210
If you had only shaved faster...

1178
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,740
Oh, really? Then,

1179
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,410
what happens?
Do we not get any money?

1180
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,150
We'll tell you when we arrive.

1181
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,180
- Gosh, seriously.
- The later you arrive,

1182
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,210
the less money you get.

1183
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,750
(They can get 200 dollars only
if they arrive within 1.5 hours.)

1184
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,280
- Gosh, you...
- Then you should've told me sooner!

1185
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,450
- How can we tell you?
- We can't say that.

1186
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,650
- It's cheating if we tell you.
- It was a mission.

1187
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,690
You should've given me a signal.

1188
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,820
- Like this. A signal.
- Even a signal is cheating.

1189
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,690
- We couldn't. They would've...
- They would take points away.

1190
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,060
Why were you squeezing lemons
and giving them to us?

1191
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,400
- I mean, I get how you feel, but...
- But still,

1192
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,830
having vitamin C in the morning
recharges your energy.

1193
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,630
Hey, but you literally didn't even
shave or anything...

1194
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,470
- for two whole days, did you?
- Oh, no.

1195
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,340
I had personal appointments
for two days,

1196
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,340
like dinner appointments and stuff.

1197
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,150
But your house was pretty tidy.

1198
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,280
- You remodeled it yourself, right?
- Yes.

1199
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,520
- Se Chan, where do you live?
- I live in Itaewon.

1200
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,020
Oh, you live in a nice area.

1201
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,150
Do you live with your brother?

1202
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,020
No, Se Hyeong lives
in Hapjeong-dong.

1203
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,720
It's been about three years
since I've lived with Se Hyeong.

1204
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,360
Why, did you guys fight?

1205
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,030
- Oh, we didn't...
- They both liked the same woman...

1206
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,960
- at the same time.
- Oh, really?

1207
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,930
- So, I lost her.
- Oh, dear.

1208
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:56,000
- So, I had to leave that house.
- Goodness.

1209
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,200
So, my brother is living with her
in that house.

1210
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,300
I think...

1211
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,300
- They might get married next year.
- What do you think?

1212
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,070
- Do you like that storyline?
- That was...

1213
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,310
Wasn't that amazing?

1214
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,780
- That was seriously...
- It's like an American story.

1215
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,740
- It's impressive, isn't it?
- Isn't it amazing?

1216
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,010
But that girl is Na Rae.

1217
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,150
(Laughing)

1218
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,410
Fine, let's go with
all the tabloid stories.

1219
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,520
(A spoonful of reality added to
the ridiculous rumor)

1220
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,050
That's how our family turned out.

1221
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,850
(They're in full-on gossip mode.)

1222
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,050
Gosh, this place looks
just like Ilsan.

1223
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,290
- Right, it's totally...
- Well...

1224
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,130
When I filmed a sitcom
in Ilsan back in the day,

1225
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,600
- MBC used to be in Ilsan.
- Yes, we ran into each other then.

1226
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,760
Yes, right.

1227
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,030
We met when we were shooting
"Infinite Challenge."

1228
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,730
- That's right. On the second floor.
- Back then,

1229
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,740
- we met with Kwang Soo...
- Right.

1230
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,870
There was In Na and everyone there.

1231
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,140
- Right, we met in the bathroom too.
- Yes.

1232
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,770
- And in the hallways.
- That's right.

1233
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,740
- Oh, you remember.
- I do.

1234
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,550
- I saw Bbangkku Ttongkku too.
- Right.

1235
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,410
- I told her, "I'm your fan."
- Right.

1236
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,880
- Ji Hee.
- And Ji Hee remembers that too.

1237
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,520
- I'm your fan.
- Haha, have you seen Ji Hee lately?

1238
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,620
She came on Running Man.

1239
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,620
- Ji Hee...
- Oh, really?

1240
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,820
- She's very mature now.
- Ji Hee is now totally...

1241
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,020
She's an adult.

1242
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,930
I think she's in her mid-20s now.

1243
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,490
I know. Ji Hee... So,

1244
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,660
- I started an Instagram a year ago.
- Yes.

1245
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,100
- So, I followed her.
- Yes?

1246
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,600
(So, I followed her.)

1247
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,700
But she didn't follow me back.

1248
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,870
(Laughing)

1249
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,070
(Uncle Daniel was rather hoping
she'd follow him back.)

1250
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,770
- Didn't Ji Hee follow you back?
- I mean,

1251
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:12,170
- I'm sure she doesn't know.
- Gosh, that's funny.

1252
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,610
You should've sent her a DM.

1253
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,780
But that's embarrassing.

1254
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,010
Let's follow each other too.

1255
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,580
Oh, that sounds nice. I will...

1256
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,110
- follow you.
- That's hilarious.

1257
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,280
I'll follow you too.

1258
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,790
Gosh, I hope Ji Hee sees this on TV
and follows you back.

1259
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,420
But where are we going right now?

1260
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,120
This is... Oh, what?

1261
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,090
- Hey, Daniel.
- Yes?

1262
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,760
- Why are you so suspicious?
- I mean...

1263
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,000
- Enjoy it.
- Today is so...

1264
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,200
It's your welcoming party.

1265
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,970
- So Min said not to trust anyone.
- Oh, this is the welcoming party.

1266
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,830
- We've been here before.
- She said not to trust anyone.

1267
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,470
- Oh, this is it.
- Hey, I know this place.

1268
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,440
We've filmed Running Man here a lot.

1269
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,810
- Let's go.
- Is this it?

1270
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,680
I'm so curious what he'll look like.

1271
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,810
Hey, he's not your average guy.

1272
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,480
- Oh, hey. What's this?
- Okay!

1273
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,620
Look around at the whole thing.

1274
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,550
(Fancy, colorful decorations with
Seok Sam's over-the-top doodles)

1275
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:00,220
Oh, hey. What's this?

1276
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,920
- Why does he look so normal?
- He looks normal.

1277
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,260
- He looks normal.
- Why are you so normal-looking?

1278
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,760
- Why is he so normal?
- Hello.

1279
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,600
- It suits you.
- Congratulations, Daniel!

1280
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,960
(They even throw
handmade streamers.)

1281
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,060
We had to wash him up and bring him.

1282
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,370
- Oh, you had to wash him?
- Wash him?

1283
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,870
- From home?
- That's right.

1284
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:12,970
- Oh, from home?
- Yes.

1285
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,700
- Yes, from my house.
- I had to shave his beard.

1286
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,040
- Hello, Seok Jin.
- Gosh, hey.

1287
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,540
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1288
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,980
- Hi.
- Hey, Ye Eun.

1289
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,040
- Gosh, this propeller.
- Oh, yes.

1290
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,450
- Tell them. Gosh, you're tall.
- I know, right?

1291
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,350
- He's so tall.
- You're tall too.

1292
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:30,290
I mean, well... Oh, yes.

1293
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,720
- Oh, yes.
- He's tall.

1294
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,890
- Why, what?
- What were you going to say?

1295
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,290
- Why?
- She is...

1296
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,360
Hey, you lost weight.

1297
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,890
- Of course.
- Yes, that's right.

1298
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,330
- Why did you lose weight?
- I went on a diet.

1299
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,660
- She got a shot.
- A diet.

1300
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,900
- It was a shot.
- Hey, come on.

1301
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,700
- She got a shot.
- No, I went on a diet.

1302
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,800
- Really, why did you lose so much?
- Oh, did I?

1303
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,800
I went on a diet.

1304
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,440
You're not sick or anything, right?

1305
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,710
Oh, what? I'm not sick.

1306
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,210
People think she's sick.

1307
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,540
You have to watch out.
If you lose too much at once,

1308
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,710
you have to be suspicious.

1309
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,880
Hey, these guys...

1310
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,380
Right, if you lose too much at once,

1311
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,620
- it could be bad for your health.
- Right? Aren't I right?

1312
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,880
- Gosh, that's insulting.
- All of a sudden.

1313
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,690
Hey, that's insulting.

1314
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,150
(We look forward to the chemistry
between the tall ones.)

1315
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,290
All right. Our new rental member.

1316
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,990
- Choi Daniel!
- Yes!

1317
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,460
- Daniel!
- Let's go!

1318
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,060
Let's cut the cake now.

1319
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,430
- Cut the cake.
- My gosh.

1320
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,560
- Did you guys make this yourselves?
- Yes.

1321
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,730
- Did you really make this?
- We really did.

1322
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:18,970
- Take a look at it.
- That looks awesome.

1323
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,500
- Watch how we made it on TV.
- We made it.

1324
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,270
He heard the wrong information
from So Min.

1325
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,540
- He kept saying it was a trap.
- He doubted everything.

1326
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,570
He suspected everything.

1327
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,740
Hey, no one would welcome you
like this.

1328
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,880
- Right.
- I know. I was so surprised.

1329
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,480
- What should we do?
- All right. Daniel.

1330
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,020
- Blow them out.
- All right.

1331
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,350
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1332
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,550
- Can I blow them out first?
- Make a wish.

1333
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,790
- In 1, 2, 3.
- All right.

1334
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,220
Ready, go.

1335
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,630
- Okay!
- Nice.

1336
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,890
- Okay.
- Hey.

1337
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,860
Who blows out the candles
after saying "Ready, go?"

1338
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,860
- "Ready, go."
- What was that?

1339
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,530
- What a clumsy dude.
- Hey, take out the candles first.

1340
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:52,600
- Take out the candles.
- Oh, right.

1341
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,400
- Gosh, you're so high maintenance.
- He is.

1342
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,510
I think he's more high maintenance
than I am.

1343
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,540
The candle is cute.
It's a pink sunflower.

1344
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,840
Right, I said we had to include
something pink for sure.

1345
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,380
- All right. I'll cut it.
- That's it.

1346
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,020
- There you go.
- Okay.

1347
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,320
Hey, you did a great job.

1348
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,320
- Nice.
- You're good at cutting cakes.

1349
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,090
- The cake will taste really good.
- Let's try it.

1350
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,350
- Try a piece.
- I'm sure it's good.

1351
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,720
Hey, you're destroying
the whole thing.

1352
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,090
- What did I destroy?
- The cake.

1353
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:17,160
- The cake is...
- Why? I'm cutting it just fine.

1354
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,230
- Why cut the strawberry in half?
- What? Why?

1355
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,800
- Hey, just...
- What?

1356
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,370
- Why?
- Gosh, seriously?

1357
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,430
Why are you doing that?

1358
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,870
- Why?
- Gosh, seriously?

1359
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,240
Why are you doing that?

1360
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,040
- We worked so hard on it!
- Come on, Jae Seok!

1361
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,440
We have to put
the strawberries on top.

1362
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,140
- Gosh, this is...
- Hey, let go of that. Pick it up.

1363
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,710
- In case it falls.
- Pick this up.

1364
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,180
Just do it 1 by 1.

1365
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,850
- Just put them around.
- Come on, Seok Jin.

1366
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,450
- Do it 1 by 1.
- Just go...

1367
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,050
Oh, we made it look so pretty.

1368
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,790
(Being smooshed)

1369
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,260
- Why? What's the problem?
- It's not that.

1370
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,790
You should've cut
in between the strawberries.

1371
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,200
- Oh, did you do the strawberries?
- Look at this.

1372
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,260
- That's pretty.
- Hey.

1373
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,700
- The strawberries are legit. Go on.
- We really made it.

1374
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,030
- The strawberries.
- Try it.

1375
00:44:58,370 --> 00:44:59,870
- That's right.
- Ye Eun, you should eat this.

1376
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,140
- This strawberry cake is...
- No, I'm fine.

1377
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,840
- Why not? Are you on a diet?
- I had some.

1378
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,240
- I had some already.
- Try it.

1379
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,940
- But still, try it.
- We went to Daniel's house...

1380
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,680
- Why not?
- Did you eat something?

1381
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,180
- Why? Did you spit on it?
- We were literally...

1382
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,810
He's getting suspicious again.

1383
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,050
You're suspecting
that it will be weird.

1384
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:13,380
- No, it's nothing weird.
- No.

1385
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,880
- We made it properly.
- We don't play around with food.

1386
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,950
- It's for real. We're not joking.
- I'll try it.

1387
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:18,950
(He tries a bite
after taking back his suspicions.)

1388
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,390
- It's good, right?
- Isn't it good?

1389
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,420
- It's so tasty.
- Why aren't you eating?

1390
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,060
We're not joking.

1391
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,390
Oh, this is good.

1392
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,660
- Isn't it good?
- I told you it was good.

1393
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,070
All right, so today,
our new rental member has joined us.

1394
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,940
We'll have
the Let There Be a New Family Race.

1395
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,770
As the schedule we discussed
with Daniel beforehand,

1396
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:39,340
you will be spending the money
you earned.

1397
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,640
We'll tell you the amount of money
you have left.

1398
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,250
- How much? We got here fast.
- Oh, right.

1399
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,280
- We did a lot too.
- All right.

1400
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,050
Jae Seok, Haha, and Se Chan.

1401
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:49,520
To get Daniel ready
and here to the cafe,

1402
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,490
it took you over an hour.

1403
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,690
(It took over 1 hour to get
Daniel ready and to work.)

1404
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,460
- What?
- That's not right.

1405
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,530
- So, you earned 200 dollars.
- It took quite a lot...

1406
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,230
- It wasn't an hour.
- No, it wasn't.

1407
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,930
- It took over an hour. Yes.
- Really?

1408
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:01,860
- Let's go.
- Are we here?

1409
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:04,870
Thank you.

1410
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:06,300
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1411
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,570
(They barely earned 200 dollars
with 2 minutes left.)

1412
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,170
- Where do I put my bag?
- Just carry it with you.

1413
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,240
- Just carry it around?
- Yes.

1414
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,210
And because of rushing
and suspicions,

1415
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,780
you lost 50 dollars.

1416
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,450
- So, you have 150 dollars total.
- Why did you get so suspicious?

1417
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,880
(They lost 50 dollars because of
5 counts of rushing or suspicions.)

1418
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,880
I see.

1419
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,590
(Rushing)

1420
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,690
(Suspicious)

1421
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,920
- Is this a mission of some sort?
- No.

1422
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,930
But what is this?
What's going on today?

1423
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,190
Then, how much would we have
if we didn't have deductions?

1424
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,360
- We would've had 50 dollars more.
- What, 50 dollars?

1425
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,530
Jae Seok, then you should've
brought me here faster.

1426
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:37,570
If I rushed you...

1427
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:39,200
You were the one
who didn't come along.

1428
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,170
- No, but you should've just...
- You didn't get washed up.

1429
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,540
- I didn't have to wash up.
- Why did you keep trying to...

1430
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,970
- It's okay not to wash up.
- In that situation,

1431
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,640
you should've knocked him out
with a chokehold,

1432
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,380
dressed him, and carried him here.

1433
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,380
- Like this?
- And for your information,

1434
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,010
the welcoming party
preparation team...

1435
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,750
spent 66.5 dollars at the cafe
on snacks.

1436
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,450
So, currently, you have...

1437
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,920
- a total of 83.5 dollars left.
- That's why you said you ate a lot.

1438
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,290
- You bought snacks?
- That's what we have left?

1439
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:01,020
- We only have that much left?
- They bought snacks?

1440
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,030
It's hard to maintain
my character as Food Fighter.

1441
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,990
We'll have four glasses
of iced Americanos.

1442
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,500
So, 4 total and 1 strawberry latte.

1443
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,230
The scone is good too.

1444
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,030
(They had 5 drinks for 4 people.)

1445
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,600
Do we get lunch later too?

1446
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,000
I should only eat a little.

1447
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,610
What will we have for lunch today?

1448
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:18,810
(She thinks about lunch
while buying bread.)

1449
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,910
A scone and an egg tart.

1450
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:21,940
(She delivers the 1st batch before
the other ones get heated up.)

1451
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,850
I bought just enough.

1452
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:27,350
(That's when she began
to devour the bread and buns.)

1453
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,820
The flavors are clean.

1454
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,250
- What is this called? Ciabutter?
- No, ciabatta.

1455
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,520
(She was impressed
with everything she ate.)

1456
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,000
(The bread and buns
left Food Fighter in a trance.)

1457
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,560
- How can someone...
- Are you kidding me?

1458
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,730
- spend 66.5 dollars at a cafe?
- We were out there earning money.

1459
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,470
- She ordered it all.
- How is this possible?

1460
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,640
- She made all the orders.
- Ye Eun, what's wrong with you?

1461
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,440
No wonder she didn't accept
any of the cake when I offered it.

1462
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,580
- Did you say 60 dollars?
- Ye Eun, what's wrong with you?

1463
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,740
We should spend money
to boost the economy.

1464
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,080
You're right, but...

1465
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,580
- She's right about that.
- We should help boost the economy.

1466
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,850
That's good and all,

1467
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,550
- but our expense...
- We have a mission to complete.

1468
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,190
How can you eat 60 dollars' worth
of cakes and buns?

1469
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,620
- And coffee.
- And coffee.

1470
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:09,590
Your current amount is 83.5 dollars.

1471
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,130
If you end up spending
more than you have,

1472
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,360
- four will receive the penalty.
- Four of us?

1473
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,600
- That isn't enough for a meal.
- Tell me about it.

1474
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,470
If you spend less
than what you have,

1475
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,440
one of you will receive a prize.

1476
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,540
- Let's not eat.
- Whatever. Let's eat while we can.

1477
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,370
- Let's not eat anything more.
- Says the one who already ate.

1478
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,510
We'll move downstairs...

1479
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,180
- and begin with our first mission.
- Sure!

1480
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,350
(The first mission will take place
at another location.)

1481
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,880
- Ye Eun, why do you eat so much?
- Yes, thank you.

1482
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,880
- You wouldn't believe it.
- I didn't want to eat that much.

1483
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,720
- She ate it all.
- No way.

1484
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,990
I didn't have that much.

1485
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,360
- You're here as a rented member.
- Right.

1486
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,830
I had my juniors...

1487
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,830
- hit the clapperboard,
- Ciabatta.

1488
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:47,200
- but not many got it done.
- Right.

1489
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,600
This is me arranging it yet again.

1490
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,630
- Think of this as a transition.
- The clapperboard?

1491
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:53,440
(1st rented member, Kang Hoon)

1492
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,870
- Go ahead.
- I'll hit the clapperboard.

1493
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:58,170
(He said he'd do it
in the way he was taught.)

1494
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:01,040
(Retorter got an earful
for making a sound with his mouth.)

1495
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,540
- The clapperboard?
- Face the front...

1496
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,610
and inform the staff that
you're hitting the clapperboard.

1497
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,320
- Do it on the count of three.
- Okay.

1498
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,550
Do it when the others...

1499
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,780
- Got it.
- are off-camera.

1500
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,420
- All right. Let's see it.
- Did you teach him how it's done?

1501
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,420
Sure. Go ahead.

1502
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,690
I'll hit the clapperboard.
Here I go.

1503
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:14,760
- Daniel.
- One...

1504
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,690
Don't be rude
by leaning on one foot.

1505
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,330
- Stand straight, all right?
- Sure.

1506
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,030
- That's it. And smile.
- Pass down the role.

1507
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,400
(Bowing)

1508
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,630
Just do it.

1509
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:25,200
- Cameramen....
- What's he doing?

1510
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,500
- Everyone including the writers.
- Just hit it already!

1511
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,840
- What are you doing?
- Well...

1512
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:33,140
- Please.
- I'll hit the clapperboard.

1513
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,650
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
and three Mississippi.

1514
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:39,850
He never does anything as is.

1515
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,950
I made sure to be polite.

1516
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,520
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

1517
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,950
Here we go!

1518
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,260
Do you want to have something?
Come here.

1519
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,020
It'll be on me.

1520
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,560
Ssabssab!
Daniel, would you like something?

1521
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,560
Have a beverage.

1522
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,230
I'll have
one grapefruit tomato juice.

1523
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,260
I'll have one iced coffee.

1524
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,270
I'll have one too.

1525
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:58,970
- I'll have an iced latte.
- Sure.

1526
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,440
(Jae Seok pays.)

1527
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,070
Insert your card.

1528
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,140
- Are we good?
- Yes.

1529
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,110
- Thank you.
- I'll enjoy.

1530
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:07,610
- To the first floor.
- Is that so?

1531
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,140
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook step outside
before the beverages are ready.)

1532
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,780
The weather's quite toasty.

1533
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,510
This is where we played soccer.

1534
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,890
With HOSHI and DK of SEVENTEEN.

1535
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:17,990
That's right.

1536
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:19,890
We engaged in physical activities.

1537
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:23,960
(The others aren't even close
to joining them.)

1538
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,290
Seok Jin!

1539
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,700
I can't believe him.

1540
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,070
The strawberry cake
should've turned out like this.

1541
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,070
- Right?
- You're right.

1542
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,440
(Everyone's here,
but Prankster Yu only asks for Seok Jin.)

1543
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,370
What's the matter with him?

1544
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:38,870
- It's so good.
- Who is it?

1545
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,240
Why is he calling me?

1546
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,610
Unbelievable.

1547
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,310
Seok Sam,
over 50 members of the staff...

1548
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,720
including cameraman Kang Chan Hee...

1549
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,020
- is waiting out here for you.
- But...

1550
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,790
I heard you
and will head down right away.

1551
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,960
You're the one
who went down there by yourself.

1552
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,430
Shouldn't you act more your age?

1553
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,660
You're the one who went down there
ahead of schedule.

1554
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,830
Why aren't you hurrying down here?

1555
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:04,330
Was it necessary to make
a video call to me?

1556
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:07,170
Why are you the only one
sipping a beverage?

1557
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,070
You got me this upstairs.

1558
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,610
Stop facing me
when we're on a video call.

1559
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,780
Why... I can't believe you.

1560
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,710
- A video call?
- Hurry on over here.

1561
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:16,980
- Jae Seok.
- Yes?

1562
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,310
- Okay.
- Here's your tomato juice.

1563
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:19,450
- Thanks.
- Of course.

1564
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:20,920
- Tomato juice.
- Thanks.

1565
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,950
- I knew it.
- I'm the one who bought this.

1566
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,660
- Did you buy this yourself?
- Yes.

1567
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,690
The beverages are on me.

1568
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,190
She only brought it to you.

1569
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:33,800
You were given money
to spend as a group today,

1570
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,330
- so you can't use your money.
- Is that so?

1571
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:39,530
Just now, you spent
31.6 dollars on beverages.

1572
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:42,070
- That came out of my pocket.
- He paid for that himself.

1573
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,570
- That's not allowed today.
- But the rule...

1574
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,210
(The expenses include
what they spend personally.)

1575
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:48,280
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

1576
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,450
- Why did you get us drinks?
- Why did you offer?

1577
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:51,810
You just had to offer!

1578
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,850
- Why did you offer?
- I paid for it myself.

1579
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,550
We could've just had some water.

1580
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,050
Exactly. Why did you offer
to buy coffee?

1581
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,420
You should've told me.

1582
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,990
I said I didn't want any.

1583
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,920
- Exactly.
- Stick to water.

1584
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,630
- Can you see me drinking water?
- Jae Seok, come on.

1585
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:04,760
- I also had water.
- Whatever, Bag Man.

1586
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,430
- I had water too.
- Unbelievable.

1587
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:08,130
- No way.
- Why skip on water?

1588
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:09,830
- Where's your proof?
- We caught it on camera.

1589
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:12,270
- I saw someone filming it.
- They filmed it.

1590
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,770
(When he paid for the coffee)

1591
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,400
(The youngest director
filmed him out in the open.)

1592
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:18,370
(Se Chan saw that Jae Seok
was being filmed.)

1593
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:20,480
(Filmed by a staff member)

1594
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,540
(Being polite)

1595
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,310
(He took the beverage
without suspecting anything.)

1596
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:26,280
- I was being filmed.
- You should've known!

1597
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,380
I thought it was to prove
how nice Jae Seok was.

1598
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,920
That's why I politely said thanks.

1599
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,020
I can't believe it.

1600
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,390
I can't believe you filmed it.

1601
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:34,420
Why would you...

1602
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,960
- If we subtract the amount,
- Wasn't it 30 dollars?

1603
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,230
- Can't we get a discount?
- you'll be left with 51.9 dollars.

1604
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,660
- We're sorry.
- Come on.

1605
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,960
- You're being cruel.
- So much for lunch.

1606
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,000
We had no idea.

1607
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,330
That money has
to cover everything today...

1608
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,500
- including your meal.
- That's impossible.

1609
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,470
Since that's the case,
you'll play a game...

1610
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:52,410
that could rid you
of the 31.6 dollars.

1611
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:53,540
Okay, good.

1612
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,810
All this for beverages
we didn't need?

1613
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,510
- Daniel.
- Yes?

1614
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,650
That hat doesn't fit...

1615
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,120
- the mood right now.
- Well...

1616
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:01,950
(Colorful)

1617
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,150
Well, Se Chan chose it for me.

1618
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,190
Keep it on. You should.

1619
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:06,320
We...

1620
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,560
- It could send you flying.
- We...

1621
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,690
Keep it on for now.

1622
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,190
Shouldn't one wear that
when things are going well?

1623
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,060
Read the room, Niel.

1624
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,190
- Sure thing.
- Good.

1625
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,560
- Don't go flying by yourself.
- Read the room.

1626
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,730
You seem to be
in a different space on your own.

1627
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,370
- Read the room.
- Got it.

1628
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:20,370
Here's a game you'll play
to be rid of that extra money spent.

1629
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:22,500
Running Man, Fly Like a Butterfly.

1630
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,540
- Fly like a butterfly.
- What's that?

1631
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,770
Three members
will toss a fourth member...

1632
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,940
into the air for 30 seconds...

1633
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,280
- and make them fly.
- How is that possible?

1634
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,350
- Into the air?
- The flying member...

1635
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:34,480
will memorize the 20 words
on the opposite side...

1636
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,390
of the whiteboard
and say what they remember.

1637
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:39,650
- We've got this.
- Jae Seok, you do it.

1638
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:40,660
- Jae Seok.
- Yes, you.

1639
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,420
- You...
- We'll toss you up.

1640
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,660
We have Ye Eun and also Ji Hyo.

1641
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:48,500
- You're better.
- You're lighter than them.

1642
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,560
- Let them try.
- Don't.

1643
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,470
- I'm good.
- Jae Seok.

1644
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,770
Jae Seok, as you know,
they're a train wreck.

1645
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:56,000
- But she lost weight.
- I'm heavy.

1646
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,540
- They're a train wreck.
- Here's why.

1647
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,310
- She bulked up.
- These two...

1648
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,180
can't memorize the words.

1649
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,680
- That's also a reason.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1650
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,050
- We can do this.
- You're better.

1651
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,850
Four of you will get the chance.

1652
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:07,880
If you manage to get all 20 words...

1653
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,280
- Four of us?
- Twenty words?

1654
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,650
- You'll succeed.
- Four of us?

1655
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,190
Yes, but in turns.

1656
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:14,120
Four people
will get tossed into the air.

1657
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,720
Exactly. Four of us?

1658
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,260
The two have to be tossed
into the air.

1659
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,390
- Goodness.
- As they should be.

1660
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:19,490
They have to do it.

1661
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:20,700
(Concerned)

1662
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,760
Who's lightest after those three?

1663
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,400
Ye Eun's 72kg,
so she weighs the same as me.

1664
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,430
Whisper the number in my ear.

1665
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,200
Ye Eun's at 69kg.

1666
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,210
- Then...
- I'm heavier...

1667
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,470
- than Ji Hyo.
- Is that so?

1668
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:32,940
- Tell him.
- Is it 69kg?

1669
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,710
- My mic is here.
- It's okay.

1670
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:35,780
It'll be beeped out.

1671
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,810
I'm 45kg.

1672
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,250
- Are you kidding me?
- Don't you lie.

1673
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,250
I'm 45kg.

1674
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,920
- Are you kidding me?
- Don't you lie.

1675
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,650
- Come on.
- How can you be 45kg?

1676
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,450
- Did you say 45kg?
- She's 65kg.

1677
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:45,520
- How?
- Just the upper body?

1678
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,190
Add the weight of your lower body.

1679
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,220
She's 65kg.

1680
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,690
An honest answer from her
will be a disaster.

1681
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:51,190
How tall is she?

1682
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:53,430
- She's 172cm.
- If she's 172cm...

1683
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:54,800
- I'm 171cm.
- She weighs over 60kg.

1684
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,060
- She's 58 to 59kg.
- She's heavier than that.

1685
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,870
Are you kidding me?
I don't weight 58kg.

1686
00:54:58,870 --> 00:54:59,970
Do you weigh more?

1687
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:02,700
(Production supported
by Mega Ddochi)

1688
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,340
- Do you weigh more?
- "Do you weigh more?"

1689
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,340
(Production supported
by I Weigh More)

1690
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,510
He didn't say she weighed less.

1691
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:07,510
Do you weigh more?

1692
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,910
(He's serious.)

1693
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:10,310
(A gentleman's deadly blow)

1694
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:11,980
- Do you weigh more?
- "Do you weigh more?"

1695
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:14,080
- He sounded like a gentleman.
- He didn't say she weighed less.

1696
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,080
"Do you weigh more?"

1697
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,150
- I kept it in the 50kg range.
- "Do you weigh more?"

1698
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,420
I kept it in the 50kg range.

1699
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,060
He didn't say she weighed less.
"Do you weigh more?"

1700
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,890
- That was great.
- Come on.

1701
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:25,230
You think in a way
that doesn't match how we think.

1702
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,560
- That was funny.
- I know.

1703
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,630
- Did you see how he looked at her?
- "Do you weigh more?"

1704
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,960
- That was like a comedy show.
- He sounded so serious...

1705
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,230
- That was hilarious.
- which left an impact.

1706
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,570
("Do you weigh more?")

1707
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:34,740
It was in a different tone.

1708
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,940
He toyed with her by
delivering it in a different tone.

1709
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,070
That's because he knows
how to do serious acting.

1710
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,210
This is why actors
are on another level.

1711
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,680
- That was great.
- I loved it.

1712
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,210
(We wish for the two giants
to reach an amicable settlement.)

1713
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,980
Who will go first?

1714
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,680
Let's warm up
with whoever's the lightest.

1715
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,580
Ji Hyo's lighter than me.

1716
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,090
Ji Hyo, go first.

1717
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,350
What's the matter?

1718
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:53,420
Ji Hyo, go first.

1719
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,420
(Falling hard)

1720
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:56,930
What the...

1721
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,030
(New Long Legs won't give them
a chance to catch their breaths.)

1722
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,030
- Seriously.
- Come on!

1723
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,570
- Don't you dare lie to us.
- Don't fake it.

1724
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,970
- Don't fake it.
- How does that make sense?

1725
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:07,000
How is that possible?

1726
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,540
Please be understanding.

1727
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,040
- You...
- Seriously.

1728
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,710
- He's...
- Don't you dare fake it.

1729
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:12,740
Please be understanding.

1730
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,410
What...

1731
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,480
- This...
- That's not possible.

1732
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,610
- That's...
- That's just wrong.

1733
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:20,080
I was only trying
to take off my shoes.

1734
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,520
You made it look natural.

1735
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,320
That's not what Running Man
is about.

1736
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,720
I get that you want to make it big.

1737
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,090
Be funny with your words.

1738
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:27,920
I have bad knees
and don't do things like this.

1739
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,160
- I don't like this kind of comedy.
- Be understanding of him...

1740
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,160
at least for today.

1741
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,730
- Do you mean that?
- Of course.

1742
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,630
- I tripped.
- But that...

1743
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:35,760
- We could easily do that too.
- I was taking off my shoes...

1744
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,630
It's not because
we can't do that ourselves.

1745
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,170
- That...
- That's cheating.

1746
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:41,270
We make people laugh
with our witty remarks.

1747
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:43,340
This show is about
being funny with words.

1748
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,740
- Use your words.
- Got it.

1749
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,410
- Okay, let's continue.
- My gosh.

1750
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,480
Okay, here we go.

1751
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,110
You'll have 30 seconds...

1752
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:50,650
- to memorize the words.
- Thirty seconds.

1753
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,380
Yes. And then
say the words from memory.

1754
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,020
The 4 of you must get all 20 words.

1755
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,180
Jong Kook, how should we do this?

1756
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,020
Should you take the upper body
while I take the lower body?

1757
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,190
Two for the lower body
and one for the upper body.

1758
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:01,320
- Like this?
- Yes.

1759
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,720
This won't be easy.

1760
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,090
- Shouldn't four toss me in the air?
- Let's give it a try.

1761
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,730
- Try throwing him up.
- Give it a try.

1762
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,660
- Don't be chicken.
- Look over there.

1763
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,460
- Where should we stand?
- I should look over there.

1764
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,770
- Shouldn't we get closer?
- Yes.

1765
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:12,100
- Like this?
- Hold on.

1766
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,800
- Not necessarily.
- You must look to the side.

1767
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,140
I think four of you
should be throwing me up.

1768
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:19,070
(How many words
will he be able to see?)

1769
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:20,110
Wait. Hold on.

1770
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:21,410
- Let's go.
- Get ready.

1771
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,510
- Okay. One, two, three.
- Three.

1772
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,150
- Can you see it?
- In 1, 2...

1773
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,120
(Stuttering)

1774
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,750
- Three.
- I'll take his upper body.

1775
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:30,850
(Jae Seok's point of view)

1776
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,150
- Can you see it?
- Vanilla milkshake.

1777
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,590
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Nice.

1778
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,890
- Honey fig tart.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1779
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,030
- Yellow cheese yogurt.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1780
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:40,160
- Apple kale juice.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1781
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,260
Grilled lamb chop.

1782
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,630
- Salt-roasted shrimp.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1783
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,530
- Vanilla milkshake.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1784
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:45,530
Spicy kkakdugi fried rice.

1785
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,870
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1786
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,440
- Seafood jjajangmyeon.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1787
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,470
In 1, 2, 3.

1788
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,470
- Apple kale juice.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1789
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:52,910
- You already memorized that one.
- In 1, 2...

1790
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:53,910
(And the tossing team is dying.)

1791
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:55,110
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1792
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:56,850
- Seafood jjajangmyeon.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1793
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,750
- Hang on.
- He's spitting on us so much!

1794
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,450
- Hang on! Are you enjoying this?
- Hey.

1795
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:02,020
- Did you memorize it?
- I'm good.

1796
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,120
In 1, 2, 3.

1797
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:05,720
- Chili tuna fried rice.
- Time is up.

1798
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,260
- Did you memorize a lot?
- This is driving me crazy.

1799
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,290
- Memorize it.
- Tell us what you've memorized.

1800
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:11,530
- Tell us what you've memorized.
- Gosh, that was tough.

1801
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,560
(How many words
did Jae Seok memorize?)

1802
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,560
- Oh, no.
- Let's go.

1803
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,960
(How many words
did Jae Seok memorize?)

1804
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,130
- Hang on.
- That was tiring.

1805
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:19,130
It was, wasn't it?

1806
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:21,570
- It's hard to memorize them.
- Seafood jjajang fried rice.

1807
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,940
Seafood jjajang fried rice?
That wasn't on the board.

1808
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,340
- What was that?
- Hey, what are you doing?

1809
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:30,350
Even if we toss him a little,
I have to toss his upper body a lot.

1810
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,550
His face has to go up higher.

1811
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,610
Milkshake.

1812
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:35,150
Milkshake? That's incorrect.

1813
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:38,190
- What are you doing?
- Wasn't it like an apple milkshake?

1814
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:41,720
(Spicy kkakdugi fried rice,
vanilla milkshake, honey fig tart)

1815
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,020
Apple kale juice.

1816
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,460
Apple kale juice is correct.
You memorized one.

1817
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,100
- There are a few.
- But they are confusing.

1818
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,030
- Didn't they say there were 20?
- This is unbelievable.

1819
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,770
- You should get at least 5.
- Right, at least 5.

1820
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,270
You only got one so far.

1821
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,940
- But that was so much fun.
- It was fun?

1822
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,870
(It was fun.)

1823
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,340
- Oh, this?
- The tossing was so much fun.

1824
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,280
- What were you doing that...
- Why? Did you get them wrong?

1825
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,550
- Jae Seok. Come on.
- Oh, I got it.

1826
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:07,120
- Your tone. Say it like before.
- Try it.

1827
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,450
(Being goofy)

1828
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:11,520
- You said it like that.
- Right.

1829
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:12,920
- Can't you remember?
- Apple kale juice.

1830
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,890
- He only got one so far.
- Can't you remember?

1831
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,790
- I mean...
- Did you forget?

1832
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:19,090
Jae Seok! What did you do?

1833
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,260
I'm sure I saw it.
But I forgot them on the way down.

1834
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,630
Try to remember them.
You said them out loud earlier.

1835
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:25,530
- Try to remember it with the tone.
- It was like...

1836
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,100
- Seafood jjajang fried rice.
- It was like...

1837
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,470
- There was something with banana.
- Something like...

1838
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,970
- Are they unusual?
- They're unusual and mixed with...

1839
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,440
- something else.
- What kind of fried rice was it?

1840
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,610
- Try it. Hurry up.
- Fried rice.

1841
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:35,140
Was it jumbo shrimp fried rice?

1842
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,380
- That wasn't on the board.
- It wasn't that.

1843
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,580
- Can you really not remember?
- Vanilla milkshake.

1844
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,250
- Yes, that's on the board.

1846
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,250

00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,290

00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,360
- Incorrect.

1849
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,060
- What kkakdugi was it?
- What are you doing?

1850
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,460
Do you think we just gave you
a ride for fun?

1851
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:53,360
- What did you do?
- You should've memorized them!

1852
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,660
- He just said it was fun.
- It was really fun.

1853
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:56,860
- But still...
- It was fun to have someone...

1854
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,070
toss me for the first time
in a while.

1855
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,830
So, does he have to see something
that's behind here?

1856
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,740
- Yes, he has to memorize 20.
- He has to memorize them.

1857
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:02,800
Gosh, 20 of them?

1858
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,370
(The tosser didn't even know
why he was tossing someone.)

1859
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:06,340
- We'll give you five seconds.
- He has to memorize them.

1860
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,010
Five, four...

1861
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:09,540
- Tuna fried rice.
- That's not on the board.

1862
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,250
- Stop making them up.
- Why are you doing this?

1863
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,210
- It was on there, but...
- There was something with jjajang.

1864
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,750
- Seafood jjajang fried rice.
- That's not on the board.

1865
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,250
- Darn it.
- Only two.

1866
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,450
- Did he get one? Two?
- Next.

1867
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,890
- How many? Two?
- Gosh, it was too hard.

1868
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:23,260
You memorized a total of two.

1869
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,130
- Gosh, Jae Seok? Only two?
- Darn it!

1870
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:27,430
- Hey, how could you only get two?
- Seriously.

1871
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:30,300
- Gosh, what do we do?
- Then, I'll go up and do it.

1872
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:32,200
- You will? Do what?
- Take the legs...

1873
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,840
Get out!
Where do you think you're going?

1874
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,640
- How dare you come here with shoes?
- What do you think you're doing?

1875
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,110
- You want to go on a ride again.
- But it was so much fun.

1876
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:41,880
- Gosh, seriously.
- I can't believe him.

1877
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,110
Ji Hyo should go, then.

1878
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:44,710
- Ji Hyo?
- Hey.

1879
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:46,710
Oh, right. Ji Hyo is good
at memorizing her lines.

1880
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,020
Come over here.

1881
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,650
- No, try it.
- Ji Hyo can do it.

1882
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:51,050
Try it. You can do it.

1883
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:52,250
- Will you go in?
- Because the upper body...

1884
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:54,360
- We have to toss your upper body.
- You can just go...

1885
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,260
- In 1, 2, 3.
- I can lift her legs.

1886
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:57,460
- Don't lift her legs too high.
- Get her waist.

1887
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,260
- Don't lift her legs too high.
- Then, Ji Hyo will try this time.

1888
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:02,160

1889
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,670
- Ji Hyo!

1890
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:07,170
This isn't a ride, Ji Hyo!
You have to memorize them.

1891
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:09,440
- Turn your head to the right.
- All right. Ready, go.

01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:40,170
Gosh, that's a tough
shoulder workout.

1909
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,170
- Did you get them?
- Gosh, that's a tough...

1910
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:43,770
You can't give her any hints.

1911
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,240
- You got it.
- Gosh, this is a tough...

1912
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,740
(How many will Ji Hyo get right?)

1913
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:49,440

01:01:57,150 --> 01:02:00,190

1918
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:02,520
- What do we do?
- It was something yogurt.

1919
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,760
Honey fig yogurt.

1920
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,290

Yes, you got one correct.

1925
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,130
- It's hard.
- And...

1926
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,140
You have five seconds.

1927
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:15,600
- Is it hard? Can't you remember?
- Can't you get that right?

1928
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,540
- You can't get two correct?
- It must be hard.

1929
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:19,240
- You can't get 2 or 3?

1930

- Is it hard, Ji Hyo?
- I mean...

1935
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,350
- No, this is...
- It's like honey fig something...

1936
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,060
- You have to memorize them.
- It's honey fig something tart...

1937
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,660
- It's confusing.
- Honey fig tart. Just memorize it.

1938
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,460
- No, it's...
- It's not regular jjajangmyeon.

1939
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,260
- Are they unusual?
- They're unusual.

1940
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:41,100
Then, how many do
the other two have to memorize?

1941
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,400
- The other 2 have to get 17.
- Just do it.

1942
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,400
- Hey, 2 people have to get 17.
- I mean...

1943
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,170
- How can 2 people get 17?
- It's me.

1944
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:48,540
- Food Fighter can't do it.
- I don't think I can do it.

1945
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,270
Just give us however much money
for what we get right.

1946
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:53,370
- For what you memorize?
- Yes, however much we memorize.

1947
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:55,540
- Count them up. Okay, 5 dollars.

1948
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:57,650
- Then, do we have 10 dollars now?
- You have 15 dollars.

1949
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:59,680
Hey, five dollars is a lot.

1950
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:01,150
- You should memorize them all.
- Ye Eun will do well.

1951
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:02,920
- Food Fighter will know.
- Good, Food Fighter.

1952
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,150
I have really great memory.

1953
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:05,550
- Food Fighter.
- That's right.

1954
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:06,890
- How much does she weigh?
- I'm pretty heavy, though.

1955
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:08,860
- No, she lost weight.
- Ji Hyo is...

1956
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,360
- I did.
- Ye Eun, you were on a diet.

1957
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,160
- Yes, I was on a diet.
- Right, you lost weight.

1958
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,200
- No, but I'm heavy!
- I just saw it.

1959
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:15,630
- No.
- No, it's fine.

1960
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:17,000
- You were on a diet.
- I've lifted...

1961
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,370
- Jae Seok and Ji Hyo.
- Hey.

1962
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:20,970
- You have to use your arm strength.
- Okay.

1963
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:22,100
- Ji Hyo is light, though.
- No.

1964
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,100
- Your arms...
- Let's try it.

1965
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,540
- All right.
- Ready.

1966
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:27,610
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Goodness. Wait.

1967
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:29,080
- Goodness. Wait.
- Oh, my. Stop.

1968
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,550
- Hang on.
- Hey.

1969
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:33,550
- Oh, my. Stop.
- Hang on.

1970
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:35,820
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Goodness. Wait.

1971
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:37,350
(They give up
as soon as they pick her up.)

1972
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:39,750
- Hang on.
- Wait. Don't stiffen up.

1973
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:41,920
- Wait a minute.
- My goodness.

1974
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,460
- This won't do.
- Don't let her...

1975
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,960
- Why did you plop down?
- No, but...

1976
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,130
- Hey, come on. You've worked out.
- I mean...

1977
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:49,360
- That felt a little different.
- We can't toss her.

1978
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,770
- We just have to lift her.
- It's not that.

1979
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:52,500
- You said you lost weight.
- No, but...

1980
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:55,100
- Don't stiffen up. Loosen yourself.
- Jae Seok.

1981
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:58,040
- It's so different from Ji Hyo.
- No, I mean...

1982
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,740
Why are you saying that?
No, it's not that. I'm quite bony.

1983
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,510
- That's it, isn't it?
- Who doesn't have bones, though?

1984
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:04,750
- But...
- My clothes... I mean, my mic.

1985
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:05,780
- All right.
- Why are you wearing...

1986
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:06,810
Inspector Gadget's outfit?

1987
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:08,450
- She's from a family of strongmen.
- That's right.

1988
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:10,850
- A long line of strongmen...
- She does have big bones.

1989
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,390
- I'm big-boned.
- That's right.

1990
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,060
- All right. Ready.
- Okay, here.

1991
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,160
- Hey!
- One second!

1992
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:16,820
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Hang on!

1993
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:19,230
- One second!
- Why won't she go up?

1994
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:20,800
- Straighten your upper body!
- I've got it.

1995
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,860
- Straighten your upper body, kid!
- All right. We're good.

1996
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,600
- Okay.
- Gosh, she is really big.

1997
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,870
Gosh, her body is so long.

1998
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:28,000
- Turn your face to the right. Good.
- All right.

1999
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,140
(The strong girl's flight begins.)

2000
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:30,500
- Oh, wait.
- I can't see it.

2001
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:33,670
- Darn it!
- Yellow cheese...

2002
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:34,680
(Groaning)

2003
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,640
- Let's go!
- Darn it!

2004
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:39,310
- Salt-roasted shrimp.
- Go!

2005
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:40,410
- Grilled lamb chop.
- Go!

2006
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:44,590
(Gravity looks different
from Jae Seok's turn.)

2007
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:47,120
Ye Eun, don't mind them.
Just memorize the words.

2008
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,490
Salt-roasted shrimp.
Grilled lamb chop.

2009
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:51,560
Spicy kkakdugi fried rice.
Honey fig tart.

2010
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,060
- Just memorize 3 or 4.
- Darn it!

2011
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,930
Gosh, you're heavy. My eyes...

2012
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:56,300
- The sun is shining on me.
- My gosh.

2013
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,870
(Even Kim Muscles is groaning.)

2014
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,530
- Grilled lamb chop.
- Darn it!

2015
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:01,070
Chili tuna...

2016
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:02,270
(The 30 seconds that felt like
an eternity ends.)

2017
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,570
- Gosh, that was...
- Why are you the most worn out?

2018
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:06,140
- Hey, didn't you guys work out?
- Why are you the most worn out?

2019
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:07,480
- What's up with these guys...
- My gosh!

2020
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,780
Gosh, it was a gradual overload.

2021
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,180
(Exclaiming)

2022
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,010
(Groaning)

2023
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,050
- That was no joke.
- I feel like I'm going to puke.

2024
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,720
That was...

2025
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:18,290
- I can feel that.
- My gosh.

2026
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:19,290
(Food Fighter brought two grown men
to their knees.)

2027
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,960
(She's tough!)

2028
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,190
Our Ji Ye Eun!

2029
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:24,960
- Gosh, it was a gradual overload.
- You're so cool.

2030
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:28,530
Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, and Ye Eun.
That was a total workout.

2031
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,300
- This was so...
- Hurry up and memorize them.

2032
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,300
- Spicy kkakdugi fried rice.
- Correct.

2033
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,200
- Honey fig tart.
- Correct.

2034
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,040
- Yellow cheese yogurt.
- Correct.

2035
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,370
(Correct, correct,
and correct again!)

2036
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:39,640
(She spits out the dishes
without any hesitation.)

2037
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,410
- She's a food fighter, indeed.
- Indeed, Food Fighter.

2038
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:42,580
Grilled lamb chop.

2039
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,150
- Correct.
- Oh, nice.

2040
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:46,380
Salt-roasted...

2041
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:50,580
- My gosh.
- Salt-roasted shrimp.

2042
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:51,790
- Correct.
- Nice!

2043
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:53,050
(Their mouths drop open.)

2044
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:54,290
- Food Fighter!
- Indeed.

2045
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:55,920
(Food Fighter has a powerful brain
when it comes to food.)

2046
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,120
- You're the food fighter, indeed.
- Indeed.

2047
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,160
- Food Fighter, you're awesome.
- Indeed, Food Fighter.

2048
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,430
- You're so cool right now.
- You got five right.

2049
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:02,030
- You got five right.
- She's the food fighter, indeed.

2050
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,400
Chili tuna bibimbap?

2051
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,500
Chili tuna bibimbap is
not on the board.

2052
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,270
- Chili tuna fried rice.
- Incorrect.

2053
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:08,670
Chili tuna...

2054
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:10,340
- It was on there.
- Try it slowly.

2055
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,870
- We'll give you five seconds.
- Chili tuna...

2056
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:13,510
- Four, three,
- It's okay. You got a lot right.

2057
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:14,540
- Chili tuna fried...
- two...

2058
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:15,610
Food Fighter.

2059
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:19,510
- Well done.
- You memorized five in total.

2060
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:20,550
(She got 5 correct answers.)

2061
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:22,520
- Food Fighter!
- Food Fighter!

2062
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,090
(We're proud of you, Food Fighter!)

2063
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:26,020
- Gosh, Ye Eun.
- You memorized five.

2064
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,490
She shouted, "Food Fighter."

2065
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:29,160
- She shouted, "Food Fighter."
- Well done.

2066
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,530
- You did as well as your weight.
- Well done.

2067
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:32,860
Food Fighter, you were the best.

2068
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,360
- You were the best.
- Daniel should go up next.

2069
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,930
- Okay. Daniel should go.
- How many people can toss him?

2070
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,400
- It's the last try.
- How many people for a man?

2071
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:39,700
- Four.
- Four.

2072
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,970
- Hold the underarms and lift him.
- Okay.

2073
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:44,240
- Don't toss him. Just lift him up.
- Seok Jin, shall I do it?

2074
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,370
- No, it's okay.
- Is your back okay?

2075
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:46,410
- Lift me up.
- One, two, three.

2076
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:47,610
- All right.
- Put your hand under his back.

2077
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:49,140
- Hold on.
- Under his back, Seok Jin.

2078
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:50,640
- Put your hand under his back.
- Seok Jin...

2079
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,480
- volunteered for a shot.
- Yes.

2080
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,180
- Put him down.
- Seriously.

2081
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,950
- You have a bad back.
- You have a bad back.

2082
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:57,550
- Seriously.
- I'm okay.

2083
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:59,250
- Seok Jin, youngsters will do it.
- Come here.

2084
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,420
- You have a bad back.
- All right.

2085
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,660
- Haha.
- I'll put my hand under his butt.

2086
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:02,920
Put your hand under his back.

2087
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,490
- Support his back.
- Hold on.

2088
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,460
- Let's do this.
- Get ready.

2089
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:07,660
- It's fun.
- Memorize the phrases.

2090
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:08,830
- I'll do that.
- All right.

2091
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:10,260
- One, two...
- One...

2092
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,200
(How many
will Daniel answer correctly?)

2093
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,240
- One, two, three.
- One...

2094
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:17,240
- One, two, three.
- I can't see them.

2095
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:20,640
(The height is definitely low.)

2096
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:22,510
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2097
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,680
(They use all their might
to toss the giant in the air.)

2098
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,720
- He's going up. Good.
- Memorize them.

2099
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,080
(Now, the height is adequate.)

2100
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,750
(He just needs to memorize
the phrases.)

2101
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,690
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2102
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:36,420
(Laughing)

2103
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,560
(Daniel is enjoying himself.)

2104
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,500
(Giggling)

2105
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,900
(This is fun!)

2106
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:48,270
(They're giving a proper welcome
to the new family member.)

2107
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:52,740
(Happy)

2108
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:55,710
(The happy Daniel's flight ends.)

2109
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:56,740
- He's heavy.
- He's heavy.

2110
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:57,980
- Did you memorize them?
- He's the heaviest.

2111
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:59,250
- I memorized them.
- Let's go.

2112
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,020
Let's go.

2113
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:02,550
(How many
did the happy Daniel memorize?)

2114
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:03,950
- Shout them out.
- Don't joke around.

2115
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:05,190
Chili tuna and japchae rice.

2116
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:06,350
- Correct.
- Is it correct?

2117
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:08,320
Sweet apple pie.

2118
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,790
- Correct.
- Two.

2119
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:10,930
- There was something...
- Just two?

2120
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:12,930
- about the mountain herbs.
- Shout it out

2121
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:15,030
- Hold on.
- Just two?

2122
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,800
- Keep going.
- Are you done?

2123
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,600
You know, this is...

2124
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,800
- Time out.
- You have three seconds.

2125
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,200
- Three,
- Yes?

2126
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,300
two...

2127
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:23,640
Time out. Listen.

2128
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,270
- Hold on. Stop.
- Take a wild guess.

2129
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:27,440
You know, the phrases are...

2130
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,340
too far down. I couldn't see them.

2131
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,850
People who went before you
succeeded in the top ones.

2132
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:34,650
- I see.
- Is that so?

2133
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:35,650
Really?

2134
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,220
Take a wild guess.

2135
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:38,850
Maesaengi and oyster gukbap.

2136
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:41,120
Maesaengi and oyster gukbap.

2137
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,660
- Yes. Correct.
- That's it.

2138
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,760
- You knew another one.
- Three.

2139
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,890
- Thank goodness.
- You got...

2140
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:45,990
- three correct answers.
- Well done.

2141
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:48,000
- Three isn't half bad.
- That's a lot. Three.

2142
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,560
- Not bad.
- Three is a lot.

2143
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:50,930
- You did better than Jae Seok.
- Good.

2144
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,970
- Jae Seok got two.
- Yes.

2145
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:55,870
- Ji Hyo got 1.
- I got 1.

2146
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:58,310
- Ye Eun got 5 and Daniel got 3.
- My goodness.

2147
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:01,240
- You acquired 55 dollars.
- Not bad.

2148
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,680
Five correct answers
were incredible.

2149
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,650
- You were really cool.
- Food Fighter doesn't disappoint.

2150
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:07,920
- Food Fighter!
- Food Fighter!

2151
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,620
She shouted, "Food Fighter."

2152
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,690
Thus, the amount of money
you can use from now on...

2153
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,660
- is 106.90 dollars.
- All right.

2154
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:17,190
- We have enough money for a meal.
- Good.

2155
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:18,660
- Let's have a meal.
- Okay.

2156
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:22,630
- Let's go to the next location.
- Let's go.

2157
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:23,960
- Yes.
- Let's go.

2158
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,470
Food Fighter was incredible.

2159
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:28,000
- Food Fighter!
- Food Fighter!

2160
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,070
- Which car is it?
- It's this one.

2161
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:30,370
- What are we taking?
- This one?

2162
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:31,440
Are we going in this one?

2163
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:34,610
- This is...
- So this is what it looks like.

2164
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,080
It'll be cramped.

2165
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:40,280
(How will 8 people fit here?)

2166
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,880
(Cramped)

2167
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,080
- I'll sit at the very back.
- You can't sit at the back.

2168
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,720
- You can't sit at the back.
- I'll sit at the very back.

2169
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,260
- No, Food Fighter. You can't.
- You can't. The space is too small.

2170
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,120
- I'll sit at the back.
- Jae Seok will drive.

2171
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,130
Seok Jin, sit at the front.

2172
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:52,290
- Shall I sit at the front?
- Sit at the front.

2173
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:53,760
- Thank you.
- Daniel, why don't you sit there?

2174
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,560
- Seok Jin, sit at the front.
- Daniel should sit at the front.

2175
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:58,330
- Do you want to sit at the front?
- Seok Jin, sit at the front.

2176
01:09:58,330 --> 01:09:59,570
Seok Jin,
Daniel should sit at the front.

2177
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,600
- I...
- Okay. Sit at the front, Daniel.

2178
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,840
I'll let you take the passenger seat
since it's your first day.

2179
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:07,070
- You look unhappy.
- It isn't true.

2180
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:08,680
- You should shine today.
- He's very unhappy about it,

2181
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,080
- but it can't be helped.
- Seriously.

2182
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,410
He looked at me intently...

2183
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:13,110
as he asked,
"Do you want to sit at the front?"

2184
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,550
Sit at the front.

2185
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:16,720
(Seok Jin lets the new member take
the spacious front seat.)

2186
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,020
We traveled like this
back in the day...

2187
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,650
- to go to the countryside.
- We really traveled like this.

2188
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:20,990
We had no complaints.

2189
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:22,790
Gosh, eight people.

2190
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:24,220
(Complaining)

2191
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,230
So Daniel sat at the front.

2192
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:27,390
- Yes, Seok Jin.
- Okay.

2193
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:30,100
- I'll sit at the back next time.
- Sit at the front.

2194
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,730
Today, you're
the center of attention.

2195
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:33,930
(Today, you're
the center of attention.)

2196
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:35,800
- So you sat at the front.
- You know,

2197
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,770
I can't believe that we need
an air conditioner right away.

2198
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:40,040
- It's unbelievable.
- It suddenly turned very hot.

2199
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,580
- It's hot.
- Seriously.

2200
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:43,310
- Air conditioner.
- I turned it on at the back.

2201
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:44,310
- Okay.
- Okay.

2202
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:45,780
The weather had turned hot
very suddenly...

2203
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:47,250
when I came back from Argentina.
I was so surprised.

2204
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:48,480
Did you visit Argentina?

2205
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,420
- Yes. It was for a shoot.
- It must've been nice.

2206
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,590
Beef is tasty in Argentina.
Did you try it?

2207
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:53,620
Beef is cheap there, right?

2208
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:55,160
- Yes. Beef...
- It's cheap there, right?

2209
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:57,660
Excuse me! Hey!

2210
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:58,660
Beef is cheap there, right?

2211
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,190
- Yes. Beef...
- It's cheap there, right?

2212
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:02,200
Excuse me! Hey!

2213
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,300
- Hey!
- My goodness.

2214
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,770
- Mister.
- What?

2215
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,600
- You almost broke my knees.
- I'm sorry.

2216
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,870
This can lead to a big fight.

2217
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:10,070
- I'm sorry.
- Mister.

2218
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:11,340
For goodness' sake.

2219
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:13,010
- So you were behind me.
- Yes.

2220
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:15,240
- I see. All right.
- Be careful.

2221
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,110
I'm the type
to keep the driver's seat spacious.

2222
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:18,310
- Isn't it too spacious?
- A moment ago,

2223
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:19,750
- my heart ached.
- Why?

2224
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,520
- Jae Seok...
- Okay.

2225
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,250
- called you, right?
- Right.

2226
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,390
You headed out so hurriedly.

2227
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,350
You were saying,

2228
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:28,990
"Why are you ordering me around?"

2229
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:30,320
- But your legs moved so fast.
- That's right.

2230
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,160
Are you actually a subordinate?

2231
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,400
(Are you actually a subordinate?)

2232
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,560
(Are you a subordinate?)

2233
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,830
- You jerk.
- Yes, he is.

2234
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:40,230
- Your words are too harsh.
- Hey.

2235
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,600
- Hey.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

2236
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,540
- Hey.
- He's my colleague.

2237
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:45,640
- A subordinate?
- He's an underling.

2238
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,440
- Jae Seok is younger than me.
- I...

2239
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,080
- You can't say that...
- I'm younger than him.

2240
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,250
- You can't say that...
- I'm not.

2241
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:52,710
- because you answered like this.
- I'm his junior.

2242
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:53,780
No.

2243
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:56,880
Ye Eun, you lost so much weight.

2244
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,550
- You said it so many times.
- Thank you.

2245
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,190
You talked about her losing weight
all day long.

2246
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:02,490
- Her jawline changed.
- That's right.

2247
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:04,320
- Can't you see what he's doing?
- What?

2248
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,160
Next week, he's going to go,
"You gained weight."

2249
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,300
He said that you lost weight
in order to do that.

2250
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:09,330
I'll be skinnier next week.

2251
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:11,400
- Don't be so happy.
- You did lose a lot of weight.

2252
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,070
- You know, here's what I think.
- She was cute when she was chubby.

2253
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:16,270
I like seeing Ye Eun cute
than pretty.

2254
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:17,400
- That's right.
- Same here.

2255
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,710
- I'm still cute.
- She was cute when she was chubby.

2256
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:20,210
I've always been cute.

2257
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,810
- For goodness' sake.
- You were so cute.

2258
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:22,940
I've always been cute.

2259
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:23,940
I was born with cuteness.

2260
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:27,080
I love it when you show your gums
while laughing.

2261
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:32,490
I can't live that way
for your happiness, Daniel.

2262
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:34,390
- I know that you can't.
- Seriously.

2263
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:36,460
- "When you show your gums."
- I'm sorry.

2264
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:37,990
- "When you show your gums."
- Ye Eun.

2265
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:39,560
- You're a bit cold.
- No.

2266
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:41,830
- There's no need to stop her.
- You're cold.

2267
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:43,430
- I'm sorry.
- It isn't easy to lose weight,

2268
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:44,870
- so it's okay.
- Maintain your character.

2269
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,070
No one will pick a fight
with Ye Eun.

2270
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:49,740
- As for Ye Eun...
- I got beaten up in childhood.

2271
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:50,740
"I got beaten up."

2272
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:52,770
Ah Young quit "SNL Korea" as well.

2273
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:53,870
Ah Young is so pretty.

2274
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,440
- That's right.
- I saw her at a wedding.

2275
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,480
- A wedding?
- Ah Young...

2276
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,510
Has she become pretty?

2277
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:58,550
- She has become so pretty.
- She's pretty these days.

2278
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:00,250
- I was so surprised.
- Ah Young lost a lot of weight.

2279
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,620
I have this story about Ah Young.

2280
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,080
- I don't know if I've shared it.
- What?

2281
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,020
- After the shoot of Running Man,
- Okay.

2282
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:08,290
- I called her on my way to the car.
- Okay.

2283
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:11,960
(When they visited the show
together,)

2284
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:15,930
(Ah Young exchanged numbers
with her ideal type, Daniel.)

2285
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,660
Do you really like
a beanpole like him?

2286
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:20,070
(Do you really like
a beanpole like him?)

2287
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:22,600
(Catfish was jealous
of the romantic vibe between them.)

2288
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,400
- After the shoot of Running Man,
- Okay.

2289
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,640
- I called her on my way to the car.
- Okay.

2290
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,940
We had exchanged our numbers.

2291
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:30,380
But her phone was turned off.

2292
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:32,680
- What? Wasn't it an invalid number?
- It was turned off.

2293
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,950
I thought she'd call me back,

2294
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:35,180
- but she didn't.
- I see.

2295
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:38,750
Much later,
she sent me photos of the shoot.

2296
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:41,160
- She didn't call you back.
- No.

2297
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,760
- How strange.
- Wasn't the phone turned off...

2298
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:44,320
- How strange.
- Wasn't the phone turned off...

2299
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,230
- since she wanted you to get lost?
- Seriously.

2300
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:49,000
- I thought, "Was it for the show?"
- You know...

2301
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,700
You know, you should ask Haha.

2302
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,970
Haha has so much interest in love.

2303
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,500
He loves setting up...

2304
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,200
- his acquaintances.
- That's right.

2305
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,640
- I love it when they kiss.
- But the people he roots for...

2306
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,280
- never become a couple.
- They became a couple.

2307
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,480
- Who?
- Who?

2308
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:03,840
- Who?
- Who?

2309
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:05,650
People who are dating officially?

2310
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,650
(Giving real names)

2311
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,080
People who are dating officially?

2312
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:12,020
(Shocked by the real names)

2313
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:13,950
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I'm serious.

2314
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:17,020
I helped them meet up
at the Haengjusanseong Fortress.

2315
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,830
Hey, I'm the one
who has set up so many people.

2316
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,860
- When have you done that?
- Jee Seok Jin, Ryu Su Jung!

2317
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:23,160
That's right.

2318
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,500
- Jee Seok Jin, Ryu Su Jung!
- That's right.

2319
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,670
- It was the real deal.
- Seriously.

2320
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:29,340
(15 years from now)

2321
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,610
You introduced me to my wife.

2322
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:32,870
Why did you do that?

2323
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:35,810
(Why did you do that?)

2324
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:39,610
(Seok Jin's question
led to a legendary meme.)

2325
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:43,280
(Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong's past)

2326
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,590
- Jee Seok Jin, Ryu Su Jung!
- That's right.

2327
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:47,590
- It was the real deal.
- Seriously.

2328
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:48,820
- It was the real deal.
- They got married.

2329
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:51,830
- It's the biggest achievement.
- Their love came to fruition.

2330
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:53,430
If it weren't for Jae Seok,
marriage might not...

2331
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:58,030
- It's sundaeguk!
- It's sundaeguk!

2332
01:14:58,030 --> 01:14:59,200
- Sundaeguk.
- Really?

2333
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,430
- This is incredible.
- Not all of us can eat.

2334
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,600
- Let's just eat.
- All of us should eat.

2335
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,600
All of us can eat...

2336
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,040
- since we have over 100 dollars.
- Let's use 10 dollars each.

2337
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,640
- Let's eat.
- It sounds delicious.

2338
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,670
One for everyone.

2339
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:07,910
- Let's order it.
- Let's order it.

2340
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:10,040
- Yes. All of us can eat.
- Let's order boiled pork slices.

2341
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,080
Let's just carry out the penalty.

2342
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,380
- Yes.
- Let's go.

2343
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:13,710
Go!

2344
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:17,620
- All right.
- Daniel likes sundaeguk,

2345
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,390
- so we came to this restaurant.
- You'll get along with us.

2346
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,450
I like sundaeguk.

2347
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:23,860
- You have 106.90 dollars.
- Okay.

2348
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:27,190
Order food within the amount.
If the balance becomes negative,

2349
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:30,460
four members will receive
the penalty.

2350
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:32,770
Let's use ten dollars each.

2351
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,300
All right. Ten dollars.

2352
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,940
- The money...
- Extra-large sundaeguk, 12 dollars.

2353
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,240
I want meat only.

2354
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:41,240
- I want a mix.
- I want a mix too.

2355
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:43,410
- One with sundae only.
- Okay.

2356
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:45,080
I want the extra-large
with meat only.

2357
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,450
Are all of us
ordering the extra-large?

2358
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:47,950
- I want a regular size.
- I want a regular size.

2359
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:49,080
- I want a regular size.
- A regular size.

2360
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,350
- Extra-large.
- No.

2361
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:54,320
We need to figure this out then.
I can't believe you guys.

2362
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,790
- Extra-large, meat only.
- No sundae.

2363
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:56,890
- Extra-large.
- Extra-large, mixed.

2364
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:58,090
- Extra-large, no sundae.
- Hold on.

2365
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,430
(They order extra-large
just like Jong Kook.)

2366
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:00,730
Hold on. Why are you guys ordering
extra-large sundaeguk?

2367
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:02,060
Isn't mixed...

2368
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:04,930
- Hey, we don't have much money.
- We don't have much money.

2369
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:07,470
- Wait. Why... Wait. I'm sorry,
- Hold on.

2370
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,800
but we don't have money.

2371
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,570
- Wait. I'm sorry,
- Hold on.

2372
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:12,170
- but we don't have money.
- No one else but Jong Kook...

2373
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:13,610
- should order the extra-large.
- Let us eat extra-large sundaeguk.

2374
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,110
- Hey.
- Let us eat it.

2375
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:16,910
- It's only two dollars more.
- Hey.

2376
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:18,480
- Jae Seok.
- Let us order an extra-large.

2377
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,250
- Only Jong Kook should eat it.
- Let us eat it. I need meat.

2378
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,620
Wait. Jae Seok.

2379
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:25,120
Why does Jong Kook get to order it?
It's unreasonable.

2380
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,950
- He used a lot of strength earlier.
- That's right.

2381
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,220
I use a lot of energy...

2382
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,620
- in daily life.
- He did everything in the back.

2383
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,060
I always order extra-large.

2384
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:32,590
- The two of them...
- I want the extra-large too.

2385
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:33,890
There must be a connection.

2386
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:36,300
- Don't be absurd. There isn't one.
- You can't order it.

2387
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,800
Besides, what have you done today?

2388
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:39,500
- What kind of a question is that?
- What have you done?

2389
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,700
- What have you done today?
- I went to Daniel's house.

2390
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:43,940
What have you done to deserve
the extra-large sundaeguk?

2391
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:46,040
Haha must be upset.

2392
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,740
- "What have you done today?"
- Seriously.

2393
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:50,080
Only Jong Kook can get extra-large.

2394
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:52,610
- Everyone else should get regular.
- Okay. That sounds good.

2395
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,920
- If I have some leftover...
- Are you his henchman?

2396
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:57,550
- I mean...
- Are you Jong Kook's henchman?

2397
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,490
- No. Jae Seok cherishes me.
- Listen.

2398
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:00,620
- Jae Seok cherishes me.
- It's reasonable.

2399
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:02,620
- He used a lot of strength.
- Yes. He cherishes me.

2400
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:04,390
- Everyone will get regular.
- Okay.

2401
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:05,530
- Jong Kook will get extra-large.
- Extra-large.

2402
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:07,060
- Is everyone okay with that?
- Yes.

2403
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:09,230
- How are we supposed to say no?
- Why is Jong Kook an exception?

2404
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:11,100
I always eat the extra-large.

2405
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,830
In that case, Haha is the dad...

2406
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:15,440
of three children.

2407
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:17,640
Let's order an extra-large
for Haha as well.

2408
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,840
- Haha will get extra-large.
- Thank you.

2409
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,340
Okay. Get extra-large.

2410
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,480
- Jong Kook said, "Get extra-large."
- That's right.

2411
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,610
- Haha.
- He has three children.

2412
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:25,210
Can we order Coca-Cola?

2413
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:26,680
- Coca-Cola.
- We can't order Coca-Cola.

2414
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,050
Did you order Ye Eun's?

2415
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,480
- We can't order Coca-Cola.
- Make one...

2416
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:30,720
- the sundaeguk set.
- Did you order Ye Eun's?

2417
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:32,220
The sundae set.

2418
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:33,720
(Sundaeguk: 10 dollars
Sundaeguk set: 14 dollars)

2419
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,020
(He secretly orders something
that's 4 dollars more expensive.)

2420
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:37,060
- No. Seok Jin can't do that.
- Jong Kook.

2421
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:38,130
The normal one...

2422
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,860
- What did he ask for?
- The sundaeguk set.

2423
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,730
Hold on.

2424
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,430
I'm so angry.

2425
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:45,500
- Why?
- Why?

2426
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:46,870
Someone ordered the sundaeguk set.

2427
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,170
Come on. Who did that?

2428
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:49,400
- Come to your senses.
- Who did that?

2429
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,570
- Why order the sundaeguk set?
- Come to your senses.

2430
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:51,740
- Seok Jin.
- Who did that?

2431
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:54,340
- The set is 14 dollars.
- The set is too much.

2432
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:56,240
- Seok Jin.
- Come on, Seok Jin.

2433
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:57,640
(He just fidgets
without making a retort.)

2434
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,550
- He's too much.
- Seriously.

2435
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,210
- Seok Jin.
- Eat nice food after the shoot.

2436
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,680
- Get on the floor for 30 seconds.
- Hey.

2437
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,620
The set is six dollars
more expensive.

2438
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:07,320
- Seok Jin.
- I'm close to 60.

2439
01:18:08,290 --> 01:18:10,120
I'm close to 60.

2440
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:11,760
(He uses the Korean age
only at times like this.)

2441
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,390
- That's right.
- I can't say anything to that.

2442
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:15,930
- Then...
- All my friends are CEOs...

2443
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:17,360
- That's right.
- and directors of big companies.

2444
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,470
- Go ahead and eat it.
- No.

2445
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:20,570
- I can eat that much.
- Eat it after the shoot.

2446
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:21,640
Let him eat it.

2447
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,800
- We can't allow the set.
- All right.

2448
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,870
We can't allow the set.

2449
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,480
You've ordered 88 dollars worth
of food.

2450
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,640
Did you say 88 dollars?

2451
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,010
- Yes. The remaining total...
- Don't give him the set.

2452
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:33,650
- Shall we take out the set?
- Take it out.

2453
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:35,520
- Why would you take it out?
- You can't order it.

2454
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,550
We can share.

2455
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:37,920
Instead of the set,
he'll have regular sundaeguk.

2456
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:38,920
Regular sundaeguk.

2457
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:42,320
Then the total will be 84 dollars.

2458
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,420
The remaining total...

2459
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:46,690
- is 22.90 dollars.
- Listen.

2460
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:50,130
We aren't done for the day.
How will we live on 22.90 dollars?

2461
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:51,730
Once we're done with the meal...

2462
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:52,900
- here,
- That's right.

2463
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:55,070
- we won't use more money.
- We won't be able to get coffee.

2464
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:56,600
- We don't have enough money.
- We won't be able to get coffee.

2465
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:57,640
(They need to stop spending more
to avoid the penalty.)

2466
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,010
Pork stomach is quite tasty.

2467
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:02,110
- Pork stomach. Boiled pork slices.
- It's a must.

2468
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:03,810
- Extra-large.
- Thank you.

2469
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:05,750
- Is it extra-large?
- Is it done already?

2470
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:06,880
(Daniel's sundaeguk
comes out first.)

2471
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,010
- Regular, meat only?
- It looks tasty.

2472
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:09,280
- Regular.
- Regular, meat only.

2473
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,720
- Even the regular size is hearty.
- Regular.

2474
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:13,590
Sundaeguk sounds delicious.

2475
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:15,220
(A hearty bowl of sundaeguk
that has been freshly boiled)

2476
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:16,690
Sundaeguk is nice.

2477
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:18,960
- Sundaeguk is very nice.
- It looks delicious.

2478
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:19,960
Extra-large.

2479
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,160
(The extra-large brothers get
the extra-large sundaeguk.)

2480
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,500
- Thank you.
- Is it extra-large?

2481
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,060
Gosh, I feel bad.

2482
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,630
- You know,
- Here.

2483
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,270
Seok Jin should get
his sundaeguk first.

2484
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:30,470
- It's the one with meat only.
- It's extra-large.

2485
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:32,210
- Meat only?
- It's the one with meat only.

2486
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:33,940
- The set hasn't come out yet.
- Ours is mixed.

2487
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:35,480
- Look at this.
- Give me anything.

2488
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,410
Sundaeguk will be tasty.

2489
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:38,880
Gosh.

2490
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:40,950
There's so much food.

2491
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,120
- It's stimulating my appetite.
- It's hot.

2492
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,390
- Let's finish it.
- This place is no joke.

2493
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:49,060
(He tries the soup first.)

2494
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:51,530
Gosh.

2495
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:53,230
It's so tasty.

2496
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:55,400
Is it tasty?

2497
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,100
- I haven't eaten it yet.
- Eat up.

2498
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:58,230
It's just plain rice.

2499
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:01,000
But the soup is refreshing.

2500
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,070
- Is it refreshing?
- Yes.

2501
01:20:02,770 --> 01:20:05,240
(He slurps the refreshing soup.)

2502
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:09,180
- At my place, we ate bread.
- Yes.

2503
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:11,750
- This dish cuts down the grease.
- Of course.

2504
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:14,280
- Daniel is similar to us.
- It's so tasty.

2505
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,820
We love sundaeguk.

2506
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:16,920
- Gosh.
- Is it tasty?

2507
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,250
- It's amazing.
- Is it incredible?

2508
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:21,020
Gosh, look at this.

2509
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,620
(Jong Kook's dish is heartier
since it's extra-large.)

2510
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:25,090
Would you give me one more?

2511
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:27,290
(Impressed)

2512
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:29,160
Gosh, it's tasty.

2513
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:31,330
- Is it tasty?
- It's so tasty.

2514
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:32,570
(Mr. Free Meals is overjoyed
to eat his favorite dish.)

2515
01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:34,730
- Is it tasty? It's good, right?
- It's nice.

2516
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:36,800
- Gosh.
- Is it tasty?

2517
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,240
- It's amazing.
- Is it incredible?

2518
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:40,540
The intestines are so savory.

2519
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,540
Gosh.

2520
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:44,740
Jong Kook loves eating.

2521
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,380
I love sundaeguk so much.

2522
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,710
(Mr. Gukbap enjoys the dish
properly.)

2523
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:50,420
I'll add rice to the soup.

2524
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:51,420
(He loves gukbap
as much as Jong Kook.)

2525
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:52,990
Is ssamjang for the meat?

2526
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:54,050
Your dish is here.

2527
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:57,220
(Even though it's hot,
Daniel enjoys eating.)

2528
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:58,460
You know...

2529
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:00,990
- Did you order the set or not?
- If I get a meal like this...

2530
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,460
(We didn't order it.)

2531
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:03,460
Order it.

2532
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:04,860
Don't order the set.

2533
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,400
Give it to me.
I'll take responsibility.

2534
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,500
I won't sit still
if you order the set.

2535
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,440
Who's still talking about the set?

2536
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,910
- Our food is here.
- It's here.

2537
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:13,470
Is it sundae only?

2538
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:16,040
- Thank you.
- Sundae only.

2539
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,410
(Full of sundae)

2540
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:21,010
Gosh, look at this.

2541
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:27,150
That's it. It gets a pass.

2542
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:33,890
- Let me eat one. I'll pay it back.
- Why did you take a piece?

2543
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,160
I'll pay it back.

2544
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,430
I'll pay it back when I get my dish.

2545
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:38,830
- Give me 2 then.
- I'll give you 1.

2546
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,500
You should've gotten
my permission first.

2547
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,800
I'll pay it back.

2548
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,740
- Ye Eun, borrow a piece.
- No.

2549
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:45,970
- No?
- No.

2550
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:48,040
I'll have to give him two then.

2551
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,380
(She really is a food fighter.)

2552
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,280
Sundae is tasty.

2553
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,880
(While Seok Jin borrows
a piece of sundae)

2554
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,850
- The mixed ones are here.
- Spicy.

2555
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:58,350
- Nice.
- Thank you.

2556
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:00,190
- Didn't Seok Jin order the set?
- Give it to Seok Jin.

2557
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:01,390
(The mixed sundaeguk gets served.)

2558
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:02,390
Give it to Seok Jin.

2559
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:03,420
- It's the mixed one, not the set.
- Seok Jin.

2560
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:04,820
Did someone order the set?

2561
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:06,330
- Is it mixed?
- Didn't you order the set?

2562
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:07,460
He didn't order the set.

2563
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,130
(I ordered the set!)

2564
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:11,900
- Listen.
- Will he get the set?

2565
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,000
- Someone ordered the set.
- I wouldn't sit still if he did.

2566
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,170
He ordered the set.

2567
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:16,740
I wouldn't sit still if he did.

2568
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,870
- Did you order the set?
- Is it the set or not?

2569
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:20,440
- It isn't the set.
- It's the set.

2570
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,510
No.

2571
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:23,510
Since you didn't make up your mind,
the order didn't go in.

2572
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:25,850
- What will he get?
- Just the regular mixed sundaeguk.

2573
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:27,850
- Mixed.
- The set.

2574
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,120
Who ordered the set?

2575
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:30,420
- Are you serious?
- If you order the set...

2576
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:31,820
- Did you order the set?
- Seok Jin.

2577
01:22:34,090 --> 01:22:37,060
(Se Chan enjoys the food properly
today as always.)

2578
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,260
My goodness.

2579
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:39,860
- Eat it.
- Afterward...

2580
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:41,930
- It's tasty.
- Se Chan.

2581
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:43,300
(He dips a piece of onion
in ssamjang.)

2582
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,930
Why don't you eat onion only...

2583
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:46,630
and forego garlic today?

2584
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
- Did you eat it already?
- Yes.

2585
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,270
I see. Okay.

2586
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,610
Why? Will we kiss later?

2587
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,370
- No.
- Daniel asked,

2588
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,210
"Will we kiss later?"

2589
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:58,580
Haha told him not to eat garlic.

2590
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,310
It's hot.

2591
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:02,520
- It's hot.
- It's so tasty.

2592
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:03,880
It's tasty.

2593
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,120
- It's so tasty.
- Hold on.

2594
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,550
Did I not get any food...

2595
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:09,860
- Gosh.
- because we haven't decided...

2596
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,360
whether or not I should get the set?

2597
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,130
The set comes...

2598
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,430
with sundaeguk.

2599
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:17,700
- Seok Jin.
- Can't we discuss it later?

2600
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:18,900
We'll leave after we're done.

2601
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,000
- I mean...
- We'll leave after Ye Eun is done.

2602
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,030
Think about it.

2603
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:22,970
Sundaeguk is included in the set.

2604
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:24,340
(He's forced to watch them eat
in 4D.)

2605
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:26,210
No, Seok Jin.
The size must be different in a set.

2606
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,910
- Is it different?
- Of course.

2607
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:30,040
- It's so tasty.
- The size is different.

2608
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,080
(Everyone is absorbed in the food.)

2609
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,250
- It's so tasty.
- Gosh.

2610
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:33,250
It's so tasty.

2611
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:35,050
(Everyone enjoys eating
other than Seok Jin.)

2612
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:36,850
- It's tasty.
- Gosh.

2613
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:38,520
Why haven't I gotten any food?

2614
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,550
(One person eats especially well.)

2615
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:42,420
It's okay.
Hurry up and give it to me.

2616
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:45,290
Just eat anything.
The food is tasty.

2617
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:48,400
(While Se Chan eats a spoonful)

2618
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,400
(One spoonful)

2619
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,500
(Two spoonfuls)

2620
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,500
(Three spoonfuls)

2621
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,530
(Four spoonfuls)

2622
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,670
Please give us more kkakdugi.

2623
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:57,200
Thank you.

2624
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:59,010
It's tasty.

2625
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:01,670
Daniel will get along with us.

2626
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:03,380
- Here it comes.
- It's so tasty.

2627
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,410
It's tasty.

2628
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:06,550
(Anxious)

2629
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:11,120
- Here it comes.
- It's so tasty.

2630
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:12,850
That's it.

2631
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:14,920
- Seok Jin.
- It's the set.

2632
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:17,060
There's sundae inside the soup.

2633
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:18,260
(A hearty meal
makes the wait worthwhile.)

2634
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:19,760
Did you really give me the set?

2635
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:21,390
My goodness.

2636
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:22,800
I said it in jest.

2637
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,800
(It's too late to say that now.)

2638
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:24,900
Hurry up and eat.

2639
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,630
You didn't say it in jest.
You said it repeatedly.

2640
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:27,630
It's tasty.

2641
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:30,140
(He finally takes
the first spoonful.)

2642
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:34,040
(Whistling)

2643
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:36,880
- What?
- Now,

2644
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:38,710
- Choi Daniel...
- What?

2645
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:40,280
- has finished eating.
- No!

2646
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:42,880
So the mealtime for everyone
will stop here.

2647
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,020
- Choi Daniel...
- What?

2648
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,490
- has finished eating.
- No!

2649
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:48,190
So the mealtime for everyone
will stop here.

2650
01:24:48,290 --> 01:24:49,290
What?

2651
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,190
What are you doing?

2652
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:52,930
- I had one spoonful!
- I mean...

2653
01:24:53,290 --> 01:24:55,130
(Just when Seok Jin was
about to have the first spoonful,)

2654
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:58,670
(Daniel put down his spoon.)

2655
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,800
(A hidden rule
not even Daniel knew about)

2656
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,800
(The moment Daniel finishes eating,
everyone's mealtime ends.)

2657
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,340
(Resume eating)

2658
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:07,570
- What?
- What?

2659
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:08,580
- Hey!
- What...

2660
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:10,140
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

2661
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:12,550
- Hold on.
- Put down your spoons.

2662
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,180
(Rushing)

2663
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:16,250
What... What are you trying to do?

2664
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:19,920
(They try to eat the last piece
before the food gets taken away.)

2665
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:24,890
- Now...
- Eat more! You have some soup left.

2666
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:27,060
- Tell them you're not done.
- Put down your spoons.

2667
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,130
Quickly tell them you're not done.

2668
01:25:28,130 --> 01:25:29,660
- Today's schedule...
- What is it?

2669
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:31,930
will proceed
according to what Daniel says.

2670
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:34,930
The meal time will end...

2671
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:36,170
- He's still eating.
- when Daniel stops eating.

2672
01:25:36,170 --> 01:25:37,840
Really? Will it end
when I'm done eating?

2673
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,110
- Yes. He put down his spoon.
- I just...

2674
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:41,210
- I just started eating.
- Give us some more time.

2675
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,810
- Mine just came out.
- Put down your spoons.

2676
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:45,110
- Stop eating.
- I just put rice in it...

2677
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:46,680
and started eating
because it was too hot.

2678
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:47,880
- Put them down.
- Goodness.

2679
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,280
- I only ate two pieces of sundae.
- Put them down.

2680
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,720
But I'm hungry.

2681
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:54,020
- What is this?
- It's hot.

2682
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:55,150
- I only ate two pieces.
- I was the king today.

2683
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,920
- This isn't fair.
- Are you done eating, Daniel?

2684
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,090
- Already?
- He eats really quickly.

2685
01:25:58,090 --> 01:25:59,630
- Why do you eat so quickly?
- Seriously.

2686
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:00,630
- It was so good.
- Why...

2687
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:02,360
Come on.
You should finish the soup too.

2688
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:06,570
If there are members
who want to keep eating,

2689
01:26:06,570 --> 01:26:09,270
you can pay 50 dollars
for an additional time...

2690
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:10,300
- of ten minutes.
- What?

2691
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:12,370
(50 dollars for an additional time
of 10 minutes)

2692
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:13,440
That's so expensive.

2693
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,640
- That's...
- He just started eating.

2694
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:17,280
- Hey.
- Let's pay 50 dollars.

2695
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:18,680
- We can't help it.
- This...

2696
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,710
- We can't leave this.
- Pay 50 dollars. It's a waste.

2697
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:22,580
We'll pay the 50 dollars.
Give us 10 minutes more to eat.

2698
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,380
- Pay 50 dollars.
- We'll give you 10 more minutes.

2699
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:26,550
- Right.
- In addition to the 50 dollars,

2700
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:28,390
- four people will get the penalty.
- Okay.

2701
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:30,020
(4 people will get the penalty.)

2702
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,620
- Okay.
- Four people?

2703
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:33,090
- We shouldn't leave food.
- That's too many.

2704
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:34,660
Wait and see.

2705
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:36,830
- It would be better to eat first.
- I think I would be getting it.

2706
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,330
We'll start timing ten minutes
from now on.

2707
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:39,630
Okay. Give us more kkakdugi.

2708
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:41,400
- I didn't know. I...
- Let's get...

2709
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:43,870
Let's keep in sync, Daniel.

2710
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:46,370
I didn't know.
I really didn't know.

2711
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:48,110
- Daniel.
- Why do you eat so quickly?

2712
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:50,010
It would be better
to keep in sync...

2713
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:51,710
- no matter what we do.
- You're right. I didn't know.

2714
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:53,550
The newest member shouldn't say
"I ate so well" so loudly.

2715
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:54,610
Right.

2716
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:56,480
- You should say it to yourself.
- Right.

2717
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,590
Why would you say,
"I had a good meal?"

2718
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,290
- That's...
- This is your last chance.

2719
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:01,390
- Last chance.
- Okay.

2720
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:02,760
We're really sensitive
when it comes to food.

2721
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:03,820
Understood.

2722
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:06,230
We should eat quickly.
There's not much time left.

2723
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,930
(Seok Sam finally starts eating.)

2724
01:27:09,930 --> 01:27:11,430
Goodness. It's so hot.

2725
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:17,070
Slow down.

2726
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:18,100
Eat slowly.
You'll get an indigestion.

2727
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:19,410
How can I eat slowly?

2728
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:21,510
- I...
- It's so nice.

2729
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:24,540
I've seen Seok Jin
for more than 30 years.

2730
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:27,110
I've never seen
his jaws move so quickly.

2731
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:32,090
His jaws are moving like Usain Bolt.

2732
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:33,950
- It's hot.
- He...

2733
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:36,390
- It's nice.
- Seriously.

2734
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:38,190
- The ratio...
- I emptied the bowl.

2735
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:39,790
This restaurant...

2736
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:42,800
Am I hungry, or is it good?
It's really delicious.

2737
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,200
You're hungry, and it's good.

2738
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,400
(Hungry Seok Sam eats peacefully.)

2739
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:48,330
Se Chan's bowl is clean.

2740
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,940
It's clean.

2741
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:52,740
(He even finished the soup.)

2742
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:54,840
I emptied the bowl.

2743
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,980
You're all done eating.

2744
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:59,250
We asked Daniel
what he wanted to do...

2745
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:02,450
with the members
as the last schedule.

2746
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:04,720
- Yes.
- He said he wanted to go...

2747
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,820
to the suburbs and have a picnic.

2748
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:08,990
(Have a picnic with the members
in the suburbs)

2749
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:11,320
- You picked a bothersome one.
- We will go to Dumulmeori...

2750
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:14,460
We will go to Dumulmeori
to enjoy the picnic.

2751
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:16,030
- Where?
- Dumulmeori.

2752
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:17,030
(Dumulmeori
is quite a distance away by car.)

2753
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:18,500
The Dumulmeori hot dogs are so good.

2754
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:19,530
- Oh, that place?
- The hot dogs are so good.

2755
01:28:19,530 --> 01:28:20,630
(Sparkling)

2756
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:22,570
Did you see her eyes get so round?

2757
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:23,870
The hot dogs there are famous.

2758
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:26,310
- The Dumulmeori hot dogs.
- Right.

2759
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:27,610
- Really?
- She memorized it.

2760
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:29,740
- Really?
- I put the hot dogs on January 1.

2761
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:31,180
- You ate it?
- You put it?

2762
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:33,110
- I ate it.
- You put it?

2763
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:34,110
- She ate it.
- Yes.

2764
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:36,180
Daniel used to enjoy...

2765
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:38,350
- Yes.
- driving out of town.

2766
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:39,820
But he recently doesn't do that...

2767
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:41,850
- because he's tired of driving.
- Really?

2768
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:44,060
So we could use this chance
to let Ye Eun...

2769
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:45,290
- who isn't used to driving...
- What?

2770
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:47,760
- No. We can't do this.
- get some training.

2771
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,300
(Will Senior Ji drive
for Daniel, her junior?)

2772
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:51,200
- No. We can't do this.
- get some training.

2773
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,400
- Director.
- We'll let her drive...

2774
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,600
- No.
- Director, this...

2775
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,770
- to Dumulmeori.
- We can't do this, Director.

2776
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,870
(In the car while coming here)

2777
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:00,270
- You don't drive?
- I don't.

2778
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:02,380
How many times did you fail
the written exam?

2779
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:04,180
- The written exam? Once.
- Yes.

2780
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:05,910
- You failed it?
- You failed?

2781
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:09,480
(Ye Eun was strangely confident
despite her bad driving skills.)

2782
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:13,350
The navigation says
it takes 18 minutes to Dumulmeori.

2783
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:15,720
(It takes 18 minutes by car.)

2784
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:17,990
Do you really have a license?

2785
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:19,660
- I do have a license.
- Have you ever driven before?

2786
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:21,730
- No. I have a license, though.
- You've never driven before?

2787
01:29:21,730 --> 01:29:23,500
- Have you ever driven before?
- No.

2788
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,900
(Coughing)

2789
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:27,430
What are you doing?

2790
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,240
- She can't drive.
- What are you saying?

2791
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:31,800
Are you okay?

2792
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,440
- We can't do this.
- Ji Hyo.

2793
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:34,870
It went down the wrong pipe.

2794
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,410
- We really can't do this.
- Seriously.

2795
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:39,010
Where should you put the gear
when you move forward?

2796
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:41,380
- P?
- "P?"

2797
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:42,850
(You put it on P?)

2798
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:45,550
- She said she drove in P!
- This won't work.

2799
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:47,250
- It's N, right?
- What?

2800
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:48,620
- "N?"
- It's not N.

2801
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:50,090
- We can't do this.
- This won't work.

2802
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:52,460
Don't you know how much we're worth?

2803
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:53,660
We will give her a chance.

2804
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:55,630
Jae Seok can sit in
the passenger seat as she drives.

2805
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:57,500
No! That's even worse.

2806
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,800
I would be the first to die.

2807
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:03,470
- Ji Ye Eun...
- Where were the brakes again?

2808
01:30:03,470 --> 01:30:05,570
Hey. The left one is the brake.
The right one...

2809
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:07,370
- This can't happen.
- is the gas pedal.

2810
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:08,840
- Please.
- She can't do it.

2811
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,480
- This...
- Let's just try going 10m.

2812
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,610
- Let's just go 10m.
- So,

2813
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:14,150
- I'll sit in the passenger seat.
- Yes. Sit in the passenger seat.

2814
01:30:14,150 --> 01:30:15,380
I'll check if she can drive...

2815
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:16,680
- Right.
- with people.

2816
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:19,290
- Just a bit.
- Let her drive back and forth here.

2817
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:20,490
Back?
(They go to a nearby parking lot
to check her driving skills.)

2818
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:23,590
- We can use the parking lot.
- Okay.

2819
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:26,290
- We can try it here.
- We can try.

2820
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:27,860
I'll take the wheel from you
right away if you can't drive.

2821
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:30,860
I have a sense of driving.
What do I do?

2822
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:34,270
You know what you're doing, right?

2823
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:37,070
What is this? The gas pedal?

2824
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:41,070
You shouldn't be driving
if you ask me that.

2825
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:42,340
I...

2826
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:44,380
- Step on the pedal on the right.
- Here.

2827
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:45,810
- I'm stepping on it.
- That's the gas pedal.

2828
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:47,010
- The car will move.
- This is crazy.

2829
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:48,280
- And that one.
- This is the brake.

2830
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:49,480
That's the brake.

2831
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:51,880
I have to press it slowly.
The car isn't moving now, right?

2832
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,490
It won't move because it's in P.

2833
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:57,190
- Parking.
- I'm a beginner.

2834
01:30:57,190 --> 01:30:58,860
Okay. Try driving.

2835
01:30:59,090 --> 01:31:00,160
- Now?
- Yes.

2836
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,230
What do I do?

2837
01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:03,100
You have to move this
while stepping on the brake.

2838
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:05,500
- Really?
- Yes.

2839
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,500
- The brake...
- It would just move...
if you don't step on it.

2840
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,770
- It's the one in the middle, right?
- Yes.

2841
01:31:08,770 --> 01:31:12,270
You have to step on it
so it moves from P.

2842
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:14,370
Try that.

2843
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:15,910
N.

2844
01:31:15,910 --> 01:31:17,340
(Confidently)

2845
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:20,480
N is a neutral.
The car just rolls freely.

2846
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,950
- It's D.
- D.

2847
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:26,390
(She moved the gear to D.)

2848
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:28,890
(She's making a fuss
after changing the gear.)

2849
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:31,190
It's moving.

2850
01:31:31,190 --> 01:31:32,960
I'll go. It will move.

2851
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:34,260
Okay.
(She barely manages
to start moving.)

2852
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:36,460
I think I'm doing it well.

2853
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:37,930
Be careful.

2854
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:39,600
There's a car there.
What do I do with that?

2855
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,900
(Braking)

2856
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:42,070
A car is coming.

2857
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:46,370
What are you doing?

2858
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:48,610
Why are there so many cars coming?

2859
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,680
I can't drive when there are cars.

2860
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:54,480
You shouldn't be driving
if you can't drive with cars around.

2861
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,650
What do I do?

2862
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:58,280
(A super beginner driver
who can't drive with cars around)

2863
01:31:58,450 --> 01:32:01,850
You couldn't be
any more inexperienced.

2864
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:02,860
I think it's going to be okay.

2865
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:04,460
What are you saying?

2866
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:06,390
(They managed to get
to Dumulmeori somehow.)

2867
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:09,100
(The members are excited
about the picnic!)

2868
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:14,370
(Will Daniel be able to avoid
getting the penalty today?)

2869
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:16,970
(Stop it!)

2870
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:20,270
(The expert instructors
stepped up to help Ye Eun!)

2871
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:23,640
(Instructor Yu is firm
when it comes to driving.)

2872
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:24,640
(Get it together!)

2873
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,710
(Instructor Kim
who is obsessed with the right.)

2874
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:27,850
(Instructor Choi only chats
with others.)

2875
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:30,280
(This instructor only chats.)

2876
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:33,590
(Ye Eun has to take the members
to the destination!)

2877
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:34,850
(I think you will have to wait
for a long time.)

2878
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:38,860
(The members in Ye Eun's car
are very nervous.)

2879
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:40,390
(Shut your mouth!)

2880
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:42,300
- She's good with food.
- With food...

2881
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:46,400
(She can't drive,
but she can place orders like an expert!)

2882
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,300
(Will they be able to reach
the destination safely?)

2883
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:50,740
(Decision to Drive)
