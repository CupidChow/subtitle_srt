1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,910
The weather is nice.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,580
Are they cosmos flowers?
I think they are.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,450
- They're cosmos flowers.
- This is nice.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,850
Gosh, what's all this?

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,280
It must've been beautiful last week.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,220
It must've been pretty, right?

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,250
(The fashionable literature students
are all dressed up in fall attire.)

8
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,890
- Look at the cosmos flowers.
- This is a nice neighborhood...

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,560
for a walk.

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,160
- Hello.
- Hey.

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,330
Ha Ryong, what are you doing here?

12
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,030
- Hello.
- Ha Ryong.

13
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,460
I live for poetry.

14
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,600
Do you guys know
what today's theme is?

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,330
- As you can see...
- Literary people.

16
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,800
- You see, it's such a cliché.
- Poets.

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,870
- Obviously...
- The beret.

18
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,970
- Literary people.
- We're poets, obviously.

19
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,240
Jong Kook, you're dressed up
for the first time in a while.

20
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,910
- Yes.
- He should take this off.

21
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:39,980
He's a study room manager.

22
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,450
- I'm a study room manager.
- With the glasses on...

23
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,710
He doesn't look like Jong Kook.

24
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,750
I'm wearing this because it's cold.

25
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,720
But without the jacket on,
I'm like a man studying for the bar exam.

26
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,650
- Totally.
- Right.

27
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,890
- My goodness.
- A bar exam taker.

28
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,360
- A thug who made up his mind.
- A bar exam taker.

29
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,160
- A thug who's become nice.
- A bar exam taker.

30
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,360
- He decided to study.
- He studies for the bar exam...

31
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,190
- But things are not going well.
- He studies for the bar exam,

32
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,960
but he failed at least three times.

33
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,830
I got into college
on the fourth try.

34
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,870
- You did?
- Yes.

35
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,810
Today, you've gathered
for the Acrostic Poem Club.

36
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,810
What club?

37
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,970
- The Acrostic Poem Club.
- Is that a thing?

38
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,180
Acrostic poem?

39
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,680
It's the Acrostic Poem Club.

40
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,180
You have new members
in the club today.

41
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,210
Okay.

42
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,820
- Who are they?
- Hey, Byoung Cheol.

43
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,050
- Hello.
- MIYEON.

44
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,250
- SUNMI.
- Hello.

45
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,350
- What are you doing here?
- It's Byoung Cheol.

46
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,690
- It's SUNMI.
- SUNMI, how are you?

47
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,620
- Hello.
- MIYEON, we meet again.

48
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,830
- I know, right?
- How are you?

49
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,860
- Hello.
- Hey.

50
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,800
(He made a name for himself
as Tragic End in "Guardian.")

51
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,170
(He acted brilliantly with Ji Hyo
in the movie, "The Favor.")

52
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,970
(An actor who lives up to his name,
Kim Byoung Cheol)

53
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,570
(The original queen
of the Waterbomb Festival)

54
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,240
(With her own new themes,
SUNMI has become the genre itself.)

55
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,750
(She's back with her new song,
"Cynical!")

56
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,680
(Theme master, SUNMI)

57
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,990
(An outstanding quiz queen
with her 4th visit on Running Man)

58
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,320
(You think of drinking water
when it's not certain the person...)

59
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,060
(with rice cakes will give it.)

60
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,230
(A pure brain
hidden behind her beauty)

61
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,700
(She's back with her solo song,
"Say My Name.")

62
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,370
(The good-looking main vocalist
who's back, MIYEON)

63
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,970
Byoung Cheol,

64
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,210
SUNMI, and MIYEON are here.

65
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,970
(The trio with 3 different colors
is here to promote their works.)

66
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,240
- Hello.
- Hello.

67
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,280
SUNMI, it's been a really long time.

68
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,780
- Right.
- It's been almost five years.

69
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,980
- My goodness.
- Unbelievable.

70
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,980
Why did you not come sooner?

71
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,550
- Is your new album coming out?
- That's sad.

72
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,420
SUNMI, is your new song coming out?

73
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,350
- Yes.
- What is the song?

74
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,350
It's "Cynical."

75
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,960
- It's "Cynical."
- I see.

76
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,560
Your song is titled "Cynical,"

77
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,160
- but you don't look cynical at all.
- She looked cynical, though.

78
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,760
- You should be cynical.
- "Cynical..."

79
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,430
- The thing is...
- SUNMI, let me talk to him.

80
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,800
Why are you picking a fight, mister?

81
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,470
I'm not picking a fight.
It's just my opinion.

82
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,730
- That's who he is.
- Why is he picking a fight?

83
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,970
She should be cynical.

84
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,640
- What's wrong with him?
- He's expressing his interest.

85
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,840
- She looks too bright.
- She's cynical.

86
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,340
Here's the thing.

87
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,580
The song says
we should live with a smile...

88
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,710
- in this harsh world.
- I see.

89
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,450
So, it's the opposite.

90
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,020
- On November 5, SUNMI is...
- November 5?

91
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,420
SUNMI has become a lot brighter.

92
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,850
On November 5,
SUNMI made her comeback.

93
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,990
- I see. At the end of the year.
- Can you perform "Cynical" for us?

94
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,090
- Sure. I'll make it quick.
- Good.

95
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,430
- We should listen to it.
- She dances too.

96
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,690
- I'm curious.
- I look forward...

97
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,160
- to SUNMI's new song.
- Sure.

98
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,730
("Cynical" by SUNMI)

99
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,070
What's this?

100
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,570
(She feebly leans backward
like a virgin ghost.)

101
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,640
I like that.

102
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,280
It goes like this.

103
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,710
(This is a flirtation dance.)

104
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,350
- That's amazing.
- Nice.

105
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,780
- Her dance is different.
- My goodness.

106
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,780
That's really nice.

107
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,350
This is going to hit the big time.

108
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,350
This is it, SUNMI.

109
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,250
- Is this enough?
- This is it, SUNMI.

110
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,260
(A performance that enchants people
like Nine-tailed Fox)

111
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,590
- SUNMI.
- It will be a hit.

112
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,460
- The dance is...
- It was over with this.

113
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,960
The dance must've cost money.

114
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
This is it.

115
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,860
- It was over with this.
- Money well invested.

116
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,860
- This is it.
- I knew you guys would like it.

117
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,870
This is the game changer.

118
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,830
I can tell a lot of money
was invested in the choreography.

119
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,970
- It's over with this.
- You can't get this without money.

120
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,570
- This is...
- It's not easy to get.

121
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,570
What's not easy to get?

122
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,840
SUNMI made her comeback
on November 5...

123
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,640
- with her new song, "Cynical."
- "Cynical."

124
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,080
And MIYEON's new song
is coming out too.

125
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
- Is your song out?
- That's right.

126
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
- Is it a head-on fight?
- As a solo artist?

127
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,280
My second solo song is out.

128
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,750
It was released on November 3.

129
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,950
Actually, MIYEON joined our show...

130
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,860
- for no reason before.
- Right.

131
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,960
She has a reason this time.

132
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
- Nice.
- It's her first time.

133
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,660
- This is my first time.
- She was here for no reason before.

134
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,260
- MIYEON is...
- Right.

135
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,260
Isn't it "My Lover?"

136
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,700
The lead track is...

137
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,770
"Say My Name."

138
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,170
- "Say My Name."
- "Say My Name."

139
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,440
- Will you sing it here?
- Are you singing it live?

140
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,610
- My goodness.
- I'm not prepared for this.

141
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,610
She's here to promote her song.

142
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,180
- Is it a ballad song?
- She's the main vocalist.

143
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,850
- She's the main vocalist.
- Right. She is.

144
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,180
- I didn't know.
- I'm so nervous.

145
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,280
- You even have in-ear headphones?
- Really?

146
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,620
- You even have in-ear headphones?
- What?

147
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,680
I heard they'd play it quietly.

148
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,050
- The in-ear headphones...
- By the way,

149
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,990
Byoung Cheol looks
like a songwriter here.

150
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,660
(As if he wrote the songs himself,)

151
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,700
(he smiled broadly
when the two muses appeared.)

152
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,830
(Laughing)

153
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,170
- He wrote two songs.
- Yes.

154
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,970
- Songwriter?
- It's his hairstyle.

155
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,740
- He does look like Beethoven.
- With Kim Byoung Cheol...

156
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,670
All right. She will perform
"Say My Name."

157
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,210
- It's "Say My Name."
- "Say My Name."

158
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,910
- "Say My Name."
- "Say My Name."

159
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,980
MIYEON.

160
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,950
Let's go. She's singing.

161
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,010
The song is really nice.

162
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,650
She's concentrating on her emotions.

163
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,300
I tried to make the song
sound somewhat dreamy.

164
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,460
You did? I see.

165
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,100
(Laughing)

166
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,540
She's so good.

167
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,180
She's so pretty when she sings.

168
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,080
(To stop me from forgetting you)

169
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,850
(You say my name just like that day)

170
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,720
(The flirtation dance is on again.)

171
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,750
She's so good.

172
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,590
(The songwriter is satisfied.)

173
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,690
(An emotional performance
without her empty-head charm.)

174
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,190
She's so talented.

175
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,130
- My goodness.
- She's so good.

176
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,130
She sings so well.

177
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,030
(To stop me from forgetting you)

178
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,730
(You say my name just like that day)

179
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,340
- MIYEON!
- MIYEON, I underestimated you.

180
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,110
- You're so good.
- I'm sorry, MIYEON.

181
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,610
- All this time...
- I love your song.

182
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,610
- I didn't know you were so good.
- You...

183
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,450
- Hey, I had no idea.
- You're so talented.

184
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,610
- Really?
- Hey.

185
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,520
- The song is amazing.
- You are a singer.

186
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,850
- Hey.
- My goodness.

187
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,150
- She's a singer.
- I thought...

188
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,620
you were just the quiz queen.

189
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,720
Seriously, I thought
you were just the quiz queen.

190
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,460
- It's early in the morning.
- Right.

191
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,190
- Exactly.
- It's not easy to sing outdoors.

192
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,560
It took the songwriter three days
to finish this song.

193
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,860
- Nice.
- It took three days, right?

194
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,160
- Yes, three days.
- I see.

195
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,060
It took me three days
to write "Say My Name."

196
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,230
(Sticking to the theme)

197
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,070
- Thank you.
- You did well in the morning.

198
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,900
- Thank you for the good song.
- Well done.

199
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,510
- You'll make a lot of money.
- By the way,

200
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,010
the songwriter filmed a new movie...

201
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,840
- on the side.
- I see.

202
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,110
- "The Favor."
- Yes.

203
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,810
What is the movie about?

204
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,610
"The Favor" is...

205
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,750
- a mystery occult film.
- An occult film?

206
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,190
It's about a family who,
after an unfortunate accident,

207
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,890
receive a miracle...

208
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,360
- that lifts all their misfortunes.
- That sounds fun.

209
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,990
- It turns out...
- "The Favor."

210
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,490
the miracle was actually paid for...

211
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,360
by someone else's misfortune.

212
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,500
- That's the story.
- I see.

213
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,600
Someone else's misfortune
paid for my good fortune.

214
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,530
- He looks like Heath Ledger, right?
- Yes.

215
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,800
- Seriously...
- He's like the Joker.

216
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,470
(Staring)

217
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,040
By the way, is this your real hair?

218
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,410
(By the way,
is this your real hair?)

219
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,410
Hey, you punk!

220
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,810
He's making a mistake.

221
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,340
He is famous for his thick hair.

222
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,680
- Actually...
- You're making a mistake.

223
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,080
- I'm sorry.
- The side is a toupe.

224
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,620
The front and back are my real hair.

225
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,320
- Doesn't he look like the Joker?
- He plays along with the joke.

226
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,890
- Right.
- Heath Ledger.

227
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,490
- You're right.
- My goodness.

228
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,160
To celebrate the arrival of fall,

229
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,830
we will have a race
with the Acrostic Poem Club today.

230
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,360
It's called the Collect and Win!

231
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,760
Fall Literary Society Race.

232
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,000
- I see.
- Acrostic poem?

233
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,730
When you think of fall,
maple leaves come to mind.

234
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,070
Today, we'll be collecting
special maple leaves.

235
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,900
First, please bring in the panel.

236
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,310
What maple leaves are we collecting?

237
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,340
- There must be something.
- What?

238
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,710
- Oh, dear.
- This is Hwatu.

239
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,610
- What's that?
- They are hwatu cards.

240
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,680
That's jangttaeng.

241
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,580
Everyone gets a prize
if they get jangttaeng.

242
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,680
- I see. Jangttaeng?
- What if we don't?

243
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,750
That's December.

244
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,820
- December, August...
- I don't know the rules.

245
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,520
March, January, and May.

246
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,150
As you can see on the board,

247
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,560
in Hwatu, you know that
when you collect two maple leaves,

248
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,860
it's called jangttaeng.

249
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,030
- You know these two cards, right?
- Yes.

250
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,130
You'll split into four teams...

251
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,760
- and each draw three hwatu cards.
- Four teams?

252
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,500
You can exchange cards
through missions.

253
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,140
If you collect
the two maple leaf cards,

254
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,610
the jangttaeng,
you're guaranteed first place.

255
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,270
The team with
the higher-numbered pair...

256
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,440
- will be second place.
- I see.

257
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,880
- Okay.
- The team...

258
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,010
with the lower-numbered pair
will be third place.

259
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,950
And the team with the penalty card,
November Bright Card,

260
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,320
will be last, which is fourth place.

261
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,250
- It's the penalty.
- Even if you have...

262
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,520
May and December,

263
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,030
if there's a team
with two August cards,

264
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,130
that team will be second place.

265
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,400
The team with the same pair
will be the winner.

266
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,270
We must have
the same-numbered cards.

267
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,800
We should make a pair.

268
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,900
We've divided you
into four teams in advance.

269
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,570
Yu Jae Seok, Yang Se Chan,

270
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,170
- and MIYEON are one team.
- Okay.

271
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,810
MIYEON will stand out today.

272
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,440
- MIYEON.
- MIYEON.

273
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,750
Jee Seok Jin, Song Ji Hyo,
and Choi Daniel are one team.

274
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,150
- Okay!
- I see.

275
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,520
Come here.

276
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,590
Kim Jong Kook and SUNMI
are one team.

277
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,620
- Just the 2 of them?
- The 2?

278
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,820
Haha, Ji Ye Eun,
and Kim Byoung Cheol...

279
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,290
- are a team.
- Okay.

280
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,660
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

281
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,790
(Team Haha: Byoung Cheol,
Ye Eun, Haha)

282
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,690
Here's how each team
will decide the order...

283
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,200
in which they will draw
their first cards.

284
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,400
Since this is
the Acrostic Poem Club,

285
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,630
you will decide by having
an acrostic poem competition.

286
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,370
- That's a good idea.
- What do we do?

287
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,600
SUNMI will be good at this.

288
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,900
- You're lying.
- You can do this, right?

289
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,370
- Each team will write one poem...
- One per team?

290
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,840
- and present it.
- One per team?

291
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,280
Why don't we take charge
of one letter each?

292
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,640
- That's a good idea.
- One letter each.

293
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,850
- Let's do that.
- That would be nice.

294
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,910
- Okay.
- One letter each.

295
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,150
What's the theme?

296
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,220
The theme is important.

297
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,020
- Should we give them a theme?
- We should?

298
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,220
- Are we giving them a theme?
- Let's do that.

299
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,250
- Okay.
- All right.

300
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,460
Give us something that suits us.

301
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,290
- Something that suits you?
- Yes. Something that suits us.

302
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,030
(Thinking carefully)

303
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,790
- Dongmyo.
- Trendy?

304
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,060
- Trendy?
- Go with "Trendy."

305
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,130
- That sounds too difficult.
- What?

306
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,330
- Trendy.
- Go with that.

307
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,370
- All right.
- It's "Trendy."

308
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,870
- "Trendy."
- Yes. You go first.

309
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,170
- Start.
- This is tricky.

310
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,840
(T: Gosh, the view is clear.)

311
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,410
Gosh, the view is clear.

312
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,510
You started with "Gosh."

313
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,380
- It starts with "Gosh.
- You started with "Gosh."

314
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,640
- It should start with a T.
- Start with a T.

315
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,310
- Don't try to be petty.
- Wait.

316
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,550
- It should start with a T.
- You can't say, "Gosh."

317
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,220
- Don't try to be petty.
- Sir.

318
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,450
- Don't say, "Gosh."
- That's a poetic play.

319
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,590
You can't say, "Gosh."

320
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,390
- "Trendy" is tricky. T.
- T.

321
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,290
The view is clear.

322
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,360
The scenery here is truly beautiful.

323
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,790
- It's not fun at all.
- R.

324
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,960
(It starts with a lame sentence.)

325
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,030
- R.
- R.

326
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,100
(Studying her face)

327
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,770
- This is tricky.
- It's difficult.

328
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,970
Really, is this the landmark?

329
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,100
(R: Really, is this the landmark?)

330
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,610
- Good one.
- That was good.

331
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,040
- She nailed it.
- That doesn't make sense.

332
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,270
- That's a good one.
- It's a "clear view..."

333
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,380
and there's a landmark?

334
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,640
- The clear view...
- D.

335
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,980
DDP is the name of this place?

336
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,220
- The end.
- It's over.

337
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,320
- It's done.
- My gosh.

338
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,890
- D...
- Oh, no.

339
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,790
(It's so lame that it won't
make them reach full membership.)

340
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,060
- This isn't working.
- This is too difficult.

341
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,760
"Trendy" is too difficult.

342
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,890
It's... Anyway...

343
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,190
"Dreamy and beautiful."

344
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,830
You should've said
something like this.

345
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,660
- We did well.
- You think?

346
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,230
- It's good.
- But it was too difficult.

347
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,670
- It's our turn.
- It's us.

348
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,200
- Byoung Cheol will go last.
- He's the last.

349
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,240
- Yes.
- He will go last.

350
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,240
- Do it with "The Favor."
- "The Favor."

351
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,610
- "The Favor."
- T.

352
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,410
"The Favor" will be released
on November 5.

353
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,110
- F.
- F.

354
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,680
- F.
- F.

355
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,820
Fun, isn't it?

356
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,380
- What?
- All right.

357
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,620
Fun, isn't it?

358
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,620
(The Gen-Z member goes wild.)

359
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,020
- R.
- R.

360
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,590
Refrain from acting up.

361
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,960
Refrain from acting up.

362
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,960
(Mr. Tragic End's heavy blow)

363
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,330
Well done.

364
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,670
- He's good.
- "Refrain from acting up."

365
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,770
- Did you plan this in advance?
- You're good.

366
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,900
- Well done.
- Maybe you planned this.

367
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,940
- You're good.
- We didn't.

368
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,970
- We didn't know.
- I'm serious.

369
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,970
- He's good.
- We didn't plan anything.

370
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,970
- We didn't know.
- Behave yourself.

371
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,410
- That was neat.
- It really was.

372
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,580
Well done.

373
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,010
That was the best.

374
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,380
- I think they talked about this.
- I'm serious.

375
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,310
- What?
- I mean, it was so neat.

376
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,580
- Team Seok Jin is the last.
- Definitely.

377
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,880
Well done.

378
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,590
- The last phrase did all the work.
- "Refrain from acting up."

379
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,690
"Refrain from acting up."

380
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,520
- You're next.
- What's the keyword for us?

381
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,860
What was the title of your song?

382
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,960
- Chic?
- What?

383
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,090
- G with the title of your song.
- "Cynical."

384
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,960
- Go with "Cynical."
- "Cynical."

385
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,130
- Shall we begin?
- Yes.

386
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,430
- C.
- C?

387
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,830
Can't believe...

388
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,370
you're dressed like this
in this day and age.

389
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,400
Can't believe...

390
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,870
you're dressed like this
in this day and age.

391
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,970
You say that
when you're dressed like this?

392
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,070
- Look at yourself.
- Look who's talking.

393
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,470
- Look at your outfit.
- Jong Kook.

394
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,480
N.

395
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,540
None of your business.

396
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,710
(N: None of your business.)

397
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,810
None of your business.

398
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,550
(A spicy blow
from the younger member he trusted.)

399
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,080
Great job!

400
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,580
(SUNMI is so good.)

401
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,120
Great job!

402
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,320
- C.
- C.

403
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,220
- C is difficult.
- That's a tricky one.

404
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,560
(He doesn't know what to say.)

405
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,960
Color.

406
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,990
Color is too obvious.

407
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,600
(To make this work,
the last phrase is crucial.)

408
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,360
- C is difficult.
- C.

409
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,200
- None of your business.
- Chuckling.

410
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,670
There you go.

411
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,240
(C: Chuckling)

412
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,340
- There you go.
- "Chuckling."

413
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,370
(He avoids the crisis
with an embarrassed old man's chuckle.)

414
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,840
- Good one.
- "Chuckling."

415
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,140
- "Chuckling."
- He did well.

416
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,310
"Chuckling."

417
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,780
- Yes. That was nice.
- "Chuckling."

418
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,050
"Chuckling."

419
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,880
- "None of your business" was funny.
- That was the good part.

420
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,480
"None of your business" was funny.

421
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,750
SUNMI has a good sense of humor.

422
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,990
We should say something
to attack Seok Jin.

423
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,690
- It should be about Seok Jin.
- Good.

424
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,190
You're not supposed to discuss it.

425
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,490
- We didn't discuss it.
- We didn't discuss it.

426
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,630
Just give us a theme.

427
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,660
Is it your turn?

428
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,230
- Wait. MIYEON should go last.
- She's the last one to go.

429
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,370
What's the keyword?

430
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,900
- Give us anything.
- Give us anything.

431
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,030
- Anything.
- Yes.

432
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,500
- They say anything will do.
- Anything.

433
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,240
- The other teams...
- Go with Young Forty.

434
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Young Forty.

435
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,440
- Y.
- You, old man.

436
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,610
(Chuckling)

437
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,880
(They attack Seok Jin
as they planned.)

438
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,180
- F.
- Forty, my foot.

439
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,580
You're sixty.

440
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,210
- T?
- T.

441
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,450
This is obvious, anyway.

442
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,780
(T: This is obvious, anyway.)

443
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,080
This is obvious, anyway.

444
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,850
(Knockout)

445
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,920
Good.

446
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,890
- I like the gesture.
- That was a good one.

447
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,090
(She politely attacked him
with her acrostic poem.)

448
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,930
Well done. You did a good job.

449
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,730
- That was fun.
- Good one.

450
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,560
- It was fun.
- It's good, isn't it?

451
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,270
- I didn't mean it.
- It's all right.

452
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,700
- It's okay as long as it's fun.
- That was good.

453
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,970
It's upsetting,

454
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,070
- It was good.
- but it was fun.

455
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,300
It was good.

456
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,370
The results will be announced...

457
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,440
- by Director Kang Chan Hee,
- That was perfect.

458
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,950
the oldest member of our staff,
starting with the first place.

459
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,510
- Okay.
- Chan Hee is announcing it.

460
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,580
- The first place is...
- Yes.

461
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,150
He'd pick Jae Seok again.

462
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,220
(He's suspected of favoritism
toward Jae Seok.)

463
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,190
- The first place is...
- Yes.

464
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,820
Team Haha.

465
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,560
(The 1st place:
Team Haha with "The Favor")

466
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,600
The second place is Team Jong Kook.

467
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,160
The third place is Team Jae Seok.

468
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,570
- Okay.
- It's not bad.

469
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,670
It's good.

470
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,170
Yes. It was fun.

471
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,240
(Team Seok Jin with "Trendy"
comes in last.)

472
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,810
I'm sorry, Team Seok Jin.

473
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,270
It's all right.

474
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,940
- Landmark.
- It can't be helped.

475
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,010
- It was the worst. Landmark.
- Right.

476
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,610
- DDP is the name?
- I knew it.

477
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,280
You should've done better with "D."

478
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
It was too difficult.

479
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,320
Each team will...

480
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,450
pick the first cards
according to the ranking.

481
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,890
It'll be okay
if we pick a good card.

482
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,590
It will be great if we get
jangttaeng at the beginning.

483
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,590
The first place.

484
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,820
- All right.
- Pick three cards...

485
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,390
and come forward
to show us your cards.

486
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,030
- Pick one.
- One...

487
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,730
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

488
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,330
Let's move forward.

489
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,430
Hide your card.

490
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,730
(They'll be at an advantage
if they get jangttaeng.)

491
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,270
Come closer to me.

492
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,370
One, two, three.

493
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,340
(December, March, August)

494
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,740
Okay, good.

495
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,740
- Keep these safe for now.
- Got it.

496
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,650
- Put them in the satchel.
- Sure.

497
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,980
Do we get three in total?

498
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,780
- SUNMI, choose two of them.
- That's a lot.

499
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,220
- Sure.
- Go ahead.

500
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,350
He's back to being a gentleman.

501
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,460
(August, Penalty)

502
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
Do we just choose?

503
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,960
SUNMI, my gosh. Normally,
people go up to the camera.

504
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,890
You surprised me just now.

505
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,260
Maybe this one.
It's standing out to me.

506
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,460
I'll choose this one.

507
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,600
(Getting August, at least,
would be good for them.)

508
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Should I show you?

509
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,200
(Team Jong Kook,
Penalty, January, August)

510
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,440
(The worst combination possible)

511
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,510
SUNMI, we all saw what you have.

512
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,210
Don't lie.

513
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,710
(Team Jong Kook,
Penalty, January, August)

514
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,740
Penalty.

515
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,450
We'll get a chance to swap.

516
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,680
Mine's not that good either.

517
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,980
- Let's go.
- We're fine, SUNMI.

518
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,280
Let's head to the middle.

519
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,020
- Really?
- Pick one.

520
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,150
- Do I choose 3?
- No, 1.

521
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,460
- Choose one.
- And carefully join us.

522
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,120
I saw what she has.

523
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,590
(If they don't have it,
it'll go to Team Seok Jin.)

524
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,530
- It's all right. Don't mind him.
- Forget about him.

525
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,860
I saw what it was.

526
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,900
- It's black.
- MIYEON.

527
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,470
- MIYEON's is black.
- The drawing is black.

528
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,570
Got it.

529
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,400
(They don't have any pairs,
but they have a ttaeng.)

530
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,840
We didn't get lucky.

531
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,670
Unbelievable.
These aren't that good.

532
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,640
I bet yours are good.

533
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,580
- They're not.
- Let's swap, then.

534
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,810
(It's down to protecting
the ttaeng cards now.)

535
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,510
- I have a ttaeng.
- Let's see.

536
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,020
That's a good one.

537
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,320
- Is this good?
- Yes.

538
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,520
- It's a good card.
- That's a good one.

539
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,620
- It's the best.
- It's the best card.

540
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,220
- Really?
- You got lucky.

541
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,720
- How so? Ttaeng...
- What?

542
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,490
- Keep it safe.
- Isn't "ttaeng" bad?

543
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,490
(MIYEON thought "ttaeng" was bad...)

544
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,890
(because she hears it
whenever she gets a question wrong.)

545
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,430
I had it the other way.

546
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,400
- We don't have a choice.
- We really don't.

547
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,970
Let's not waste time.

548
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,300
There.

549
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,140
(They got the jang card
since the others didn't.)

550
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,110
(Team Seok Jin,
Jang, March, December)

551
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,210
Let's see.

552
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,210
(Ji Hyo got it of all people.)

553
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,410
Hold on, Ji Hyo.

554
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,010
- Isn't this a good card?
- Stay put, will you?

555
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,050
Got it.

556
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,020
Hold on, Ji Hyo.

557
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,580
- Isn't this a good card?
- Stay put, will you?

558
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,650
Got it.

559
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,350
You idiot, don't make it so obvious.

560
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,590
I wasn't trying to.

561
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,720
- Put your cards somewhere safe.
- You fool.

562
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,130
You'll get to swap later.

563
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,630
Of course.
We agreed not to make it obvious.

564
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,760
- All right!
- This isn't good.

565
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,970
You'll play a game for a chance...

566
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,800
- to swap cards.
- Okay!

567
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,200
I love it.

568
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,670
- Do we move out?
- Okay!

569
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,670
We have great weather today.

570
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,740
(Being in 1st place
will be a huge advantage!)

571
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,270
Wait. What's that?

572
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,110
(Here come the animal suits.)

573
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,180
Do we put these on?

574
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,210
What's this?

575
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,820
- How do I put this on?
- We must be running in this.

576
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,680
Hey, mine's a dinosaur.

577
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,890
I'm on the dinosaur.
These are its legs.

578
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,120
(Chuckling)

579
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,890
These are hilarious.

580
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,060
You look like
a dinosaur researcher and expert.

581
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,330
What is this, an animal farm?

582
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,960
- Now,
- So adorable.

583
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,970
you'll play a game to swap cards.

584
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,730
This is Bouncing Kick Tennis.

585
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,470
It's a new sport that combines...

586
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,140
foot volleyball and tennis,

587
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,110
- which you're familiar with.
- Really? I see.

588
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,080
This time, you'll be competing
in the balloon suits.

589
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,710
Three of the four players
will have rackets,

590
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,250
and one will play...

591
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,780
- with only their feet.
- Okay.

592
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,990
The 1st team to score
8 points will win.

593
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,050
- Do we win with eight points?
- Yes.

594
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,020
Since there are four teams,

595
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,690
you'll form alliances,

596
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,190
and players can rotate...

597
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,330
- in and out.
- Sounds good.

598
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,960
- Okay!
- I'll leave it to you...

599
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,800
to form the alliances.

600
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,060
Let's combine the teams.

601
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,970
- How should we do it?
- How do we combine the teams?

602
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,700
- Why don't we choose?
- Let's be on the same team.

603
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,870
- He's good.
- Like this? Sure, let's do this.

604
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,940
(Team Jong Kook and Seok Jin,
Team Jae Seok and Haha)

605
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,510
- Come on.
- Hey, there.

606
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,340
- Go, team.
- Byoung Cheol's hilarious.

607
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,880
- I can't see a thing.
- Good luck.

608
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,950
Hold on a second.

609
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,320
Shouldn't we decide
who takes which side?

610
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,750
The sun's in my eyes.

611
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,980
- Come on.
- It's true!

612
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,320
- I mean...
- This is bad.

613
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,490
My eyes!

614
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,390
The animal suit is blocking my view.

615
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,630
Oh, no. Look at him.

616
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,500
Whatever, Haha.

617
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,860
That's the disadvantage
you have to play with.

618
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,370
We should send the ball to Haha.

619
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,000
He's short, that's why.

620
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,100
We'll begin the game, then.

621
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,340
- Let's do this.
- Sure.

622
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,970
- Over here.
- You're probably better at this.

623
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,210
Okay!

624
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,670
- Ji Hyo, where are you?
- We're good.

625
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,840
- I'm right-handed.
- Jong Kook.

626
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,210
Stay behind Seok Jin.

627
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,280
- Shall we?
- Ji Hyo...

628
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,850
- I'll do it. Stay put.
- Got it.

629
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,780
- Someone should be here.
- I can't see that well.

630
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,520
- Ji Hyo, step forward.
- I'll cover that spot.

631
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,790
You? Okay, stay there.
Take a few steps back.

632
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,390
- Let's play.
- The one behind me...

633
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,160
Here we go.

634
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,420
(The game begins
with Se Chan's serve.)

635
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,290
Just play.

636
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,930
My ball!

637
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,800
(The ball heads to Jong Kook.)

638
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,360
(Passing it to SUNMI)

639
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,500
- SUNMI.
- SUNMI!

640
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,100
(It was too long
for her to receive.)

641
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,470
- It's all right.
- It's okay.

642
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,900
- That was a tough one to get.
- Let's go back and forth!

643
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,670
- We'll do it again.
- SUNMI!

644
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,010
- Focus!
- Just let them have it.

645
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,680
It wasn't my fault.

646
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,310
It's all right. Give him the ball.

647
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,750
- That's it!
- How cynical of her.

648
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,580
It wasn't my fault.

649
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,850
How cynical of her.

650
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,020
- It's okay. You did well, SUNMI.
- That startled me.

651
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,750
- She's only promoting her song.
- That's 1 to 0.

652
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,490
- It's 1 to 0.
- Ye Eun, hit it when I say so.

653
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,790
- Stand closer to the net.
- I know, okay?

654
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,790
- I'm about to break a sweat.
- Byoung Cheol, get ready.

655
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,200
Byoung Cheol, get ready.

656
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,000
(Jong Kook's serve)

657
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,430
- Okay, nice.
- I got it.

658
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,500
Don't rush it.

659
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,300
- The ball spun.
- Ye Eun, go for it.

660
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,440
- Nice.
- Don't rush it.

661
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,970
- The ball spun.
- Ye Eun, go for it.

662
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,510
(Tap!)

663
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,810
- Ye Eun!
- Get it!

664
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,580
(Se Chan urgently covers her.)

665
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,450
- I got it.
- My ball!

666
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,050
Nice.

667
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,520
Nice.

668
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,280
- Send it over.
- Nice!

669
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,890
(They hit it back and forth.)

670
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,920
- Leave it.
- Ji Hyo!

671
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,190
- Leave it, darn it!
- That's it!

672
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,620
- Leave it.
- Ji Hyo!

673
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,790
- Leave it, darn it!
- That's it!

674
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,830
No, not here.

675
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,160
(Mr. Leave It clears the ball.)

676
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,830
- Okay, we're good.
- Careful.

677
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,700
(It was returned from the far end.)

678
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,200
(Se Chan's save!)

679
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,830
- Leave it.
- Leave it.

680
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,000
Leave it.

681
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,500
Ji Hyo! No!

682
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,270
(They lose a point for failing
to send it over the net.)

683
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,010
Ji Hyo! No!

684
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,340
(Wriggling)

685
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,610
- I should've sent it over.
- You should've sent it over.

686
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,350
Why didn't you do anything?

687
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,780
I'll just send it over, okay?

688
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,720
Jong Kook's the only one playing
on this team.

689
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,290
That was close.

690
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,220
- Let's do this. Okay.
- For now.

691
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,920
How was that serve?

692
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,490
It was good. That was perfect.

693
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,630
- Leave it.
- Here we go.

694
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,500
- Leave it.
- Nice.

695
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,560
Ji Hyo, go.

696
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,600
(Mr. Leave It gets the ball.)

697
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,870
- Ji Hyo, hit it!
- Ji Hyo, hit it!

698
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,870
Ji Hyo, go.

699
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,170
(While Ji Hyo hesitated,)

700
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,740
(SUNMI hits the ball!)

701
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,270
- Yes, nice.
- Good one.

702
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,840
(A successful attack)

703
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,110
- That's it.
- Nice.

704
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,340
- Okay, we got it.
- Good job!

705
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,110
- That's how you do it.
- Good one.

706
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,650
- Nice.
- Yes!

707
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,020
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok made an error.)

708
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,320
- You're out.
- Jae Seok, move.

709
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
(Swapping players immediately)

710
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,350
Jae Seok.

711
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,620
(They can swap players
as often as they want.)

712
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,320
- Haha.
- I can't believe Haha.

713
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,390
Hit the ball up
and send it to Byoung Cheol.

714
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,190
(New player Haha's turn to serve.)

715
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,730
Nice.

716
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,360
Okay, good.

717
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,330
- Yes!
- It didn't reach the net.

718
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,300
- It's an error.
- Nice!

719
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,400
Nice.

720
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,500
Move.

721
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,810
It wasn't so bad.

722
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,970
(He gets a taste
of his own medicine.)

723
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,780
Get out. Let MIYEON play.

724
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,640
MIYEON, get in here.

725
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,650
MIYEON, join the game.

726
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,450
(He gives up his place to MIYEON.)

727
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,720
You saw me play, right?

728
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,560
Am I in the game?

729
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,990
- Yes, go ahead.
- Who's serving?

730
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,990
- You need to serve.
- Go to the back.

731
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,660
You can do this, right? Good luck!

732
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,030
- Go, me.
- Good luck!

733
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,930
- MIYEON, not like that.
- Hold on.

734
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,370
- MIYEON, hold it like this.
- Like this.

735
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,300
- Not like that.
- You have to hit it.

736
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,540
MIYEON, get out.

737
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,740
You're out.

738
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,940
She reminded me of Maria Sharapova.

739
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,380
- Someone help her.
- MIYEON, come on!

740
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,650
Get a grip on yourself.

741
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,850
MIYEON, move. Get back out here.

742
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,180
(It's not a lost point.
She's sent back to the bench again.)

743
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,980
- Oh, no.
- Unbelievable.

744
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,090
- Take your time.
- Don't rush it.

745
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,650
Team, let's take it slow as well.

746
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,360
- That's it.
- Just leave the ball.

747
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,420
- Just leave the ball.
- Leave it!

748
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,490
(The ball was sent far,
and Jong Kook clears it.)

749
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,300
(Just then)

750
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,730
Take your time. Wait for it.

751
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,730
(Ye Eun sends the ball
to the corner!)

752
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,130
- Look!
- Hey, nice.

753
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,870
(Seok Sam reacted to it
at lightning speed!)

754
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,040
- Nice!
- Be patient.

755
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,670
- Here. Take it slow.
- Jae Seok, no.

756
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,340
- Darn.
- What is it?

757
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,910
(Though it's difficult, Jae Seok
manages to send the ball over.)

758
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,340
(Jong Kook receives
the ball steadily.)

759
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,980
- SUNMI!
- Get it.

760
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,710
(SUNMI hits the ball
with a backhand.)

761
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,880
- SUNMI!
- Get it.

762
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,620
(She scores!)

763
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,850
- Nicely done.
- All right!

764
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,360
(Jong Kook Alliance 3,
Jae Seok Alliance 2)

765
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,520
- SUNMI's good at this.
- Okay!

766
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,260
- SUNMI, do you play tennis?
- SUNMI, that was great.

767
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,390
Nice.

768
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,660
- SUNMI, nice.
- She's great at this.

769
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,530
- Nicely done, SUNMI.
- I didn't expect that at all.

770
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,970
- Haha, please.
- Byoung Cheol, oh, no.

771
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,540
(Meanwhile, those without rackets
are having a rough time.)

772
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,040
- Nice.
- It's hard to play with your feet.

773
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,810
- It's tough.
- It's hard to play with your feet.

774
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,340
- Playing with the feet is hard.
- Right.

775
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,410
- If it's too much of a challenge,
- Let's do this.

776
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,210
we could give out
a racket for both teams.

777
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,410
- Sure.
- That sounds better.

778
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,310
- Take a racket, Byoung Cheol.
- Really?

779
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,420
It's more enjoyable with a racket.

780
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,090
(They restart the game
with Haha's serve.)

781
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,190
Let's go.

782
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,690
- What...
- Hey.

783
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,700
(They lose another point
with a serve.)

784
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,860
- You're benched.
- Get out.

785
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,730
- How dumb are you?
- You're benched!

786
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,930
You're benched.

787
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,000
- Make an error, and you're benched.
- Give it to Jae Seok.

788
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,400
Make an error, and you're benched.

789
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,910
(Jong Kook Alliance 4,
Jae Seok Alliance 2)

790
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,910
Okay!

791
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,640
(Jae Seok will serve this time.)

792
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,380
- You're benched.
- You're out.

793
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,520
- You're benched.
- You're out.

794
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,880
(Jong Kook Alliance 5,
Jae Seok Alliance 2)

795
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,050
- You're benched.
- He's delighted.

796
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,750
- Give it to me. I'll serve.
- Nice!

797
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,020
Make an error, and take the bench.

798
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,690
- I can't see a thing.
- MIYEON.

799
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,160
I'll get you the ball,
so gently tap it.

800
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,660
Go!

801
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,630
- Go!
- Nice.

802
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,200
- Go!
- Nice.

803
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,570
Haha, your ball. Take it slow.

804
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,730
Haha, your ball. Take it slow.

805
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,070
- Didn't that sound great?
- It did.

806
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,570
(Haha sent it too far away.)

807
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,700
- MIYEON, why didn't you get it?
- There.

808
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,810
(Screaming)

809
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,010
Nice.

810
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,210
(Byoung Cheol scores
with a clever move!)

811
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,480
- Hold on.
- What was that?

812
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,350
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

813
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,420
- That felt personal.
- It wasn't.

814
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,020
You swung hard.

815
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,390
I was confused
between my foot and the racket.

816
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,890
You did well.

817
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,620
- Good!
- Okay!

818
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,960
- Go, team!
- Okay.

819
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,990
Just send it soaring.

820
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
Nice.

821
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,800
Move out of the way. Let me have it.

822
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,260
(MIYEON swung and missed.)

823
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,930
- MIYEON!
- MIYEON!

824
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,830
Move out of the way. Let me have it.

825
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,770
(Just when MIYEON froze)

826
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,470
- MIYEON!
- MIYEON!

827
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,810
(Beethoven jumps in from the side.)

828
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,480
- Yes!
- What was that?

829
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,010
(What?)

830
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,810
(Jee-rasoni and Beethoven fight!)

831
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,120
Get it!

832
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,920
(A tough rally
between the experienced veterans!)

833
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,590
Byoung Cheol's doing so well.

834
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,990
(It cools down.)

835
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,360
- Take your time.
- Gosh.

836
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,830
(They get another opportunity.)

837
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,460
- Mister!
- Take your time.

838
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,460
(Here.)

839
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,060
- Mister!
- Take your time.

840
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,730
Okay.

841
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,640
(Seok Sam gives over a point.)

842
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,470
(Laughing)

843
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,970
Just me... Hey.

844
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,870
- Mister. You only attacked me.
- Don't be intimidated.

845
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,380
No. This is the only angle
I can hit at.

846
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,080
- Really?
- I want to go like this,

847
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,180
- but I can only do this.
- You seem to attack just me.

848
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,380
Byoung Cheol is pretty good
at all sorts of things.

849
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,480
- Yes. He can...
- The composer's good at this.

850
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,290
- He's pretty good.
- He's like a maestro.

851
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,420
Here it goes.

852
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,720
(Maestro Byoung serves)

853
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,760
Let's do this.

854
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,690
- Byoung Cheol's good.
- I'll take this one.

855
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,960
- Give me a chance.
- Seok Jin.

856
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,430
Hit it hard!

857
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,160
(He gets a chance right away.)

858
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,970
(Screaming)

859
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,870
Hit it hard!

860
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,100
- That's it!
- Nice one!

861
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,110
(Jee-rasoni scores a point!)

862
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,170
(Jong Kook Alliance 6,
Jae Seok Alliance 4)

863
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,880
- We can win!
- We will win!

864
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,280
- Seok Jin!
- Well done!

865
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,980
- Just hit it hard.
- That was a great trajectory.

866
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,550
- What was that?
- Good job!

867
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,480
You all are useless at this!

868
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,450
- What's the score?
- It's 6 to 4.

869
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,250
We're losing.
We need to concentrate.

870
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,790
- We're losing?
- We're losing.

871
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,460
- What now?
- Let's even up the score.

872
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,060
- Okay.
- Let's go!

873
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,460
- Good.
- Nice one!

874
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,660
Give it back. That's it.

875
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,600
(Well-received by Haha)

876
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,170
(Screaming)

877
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,840
(Flapping off)

878
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,970
This is what we need to do.

879
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,870
- Well done.
- Nice hit.

880
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,380
That was nicely done.

881
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,080
- Well done.
- We won.

882
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,380
- Turn around.
- Come here, you.

883
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,750
What's up with your hair?

884
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,250
- You. Come here.
- What's wrong with your hair?

885
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,120
- Hey. Don't be so menacing.
- What?

886
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,820
Did someone hit you?

887
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,050
I almost got hit.

888
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,190
But you didn't.

889
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,830
- You're going to be menacing?
- A ball, please!

890
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,230
Fine, then.

891
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,360
- A ball.
- Let's play.

892
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,460
- Let's go.
- They're so funny.

893
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,460
A ball.

894
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,470
(MIYEON laughed...)

895
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,870
(with her eyes closed
and got hit on the nose.)

896
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,870
- It was like watching a cartoon.
- That's hilarious.

897
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,010
It was so funny.

898
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,540
(Jong Kook serves again.)

899
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,880
- Okay.
- Se Chan... Byoung Cheol.

900
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,680
(Se Chan receives the serve.)

901
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,880
- Nice.
- Hey. Hit it hard back.

902
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,490
(He just sends it over the net.)

903
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,490
Leave it.

904
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,320
(Jee-rasoni goes on the offensive.)

905
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,090
Yes! Nice one!

906
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,290
Nice one!

907
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,860
- Me.
- No!

908
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,760
- Jong Kook.
- Hey.

909
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,570
Seok Jin! You need to hit it hard!

910
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,800
(It goes to Byoung Cheol's side.)

911
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,970
- Good.
- That's fine.

912
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,670
- Take your time.
- Se Chan.

913
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,370
(Screaming)

914
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,010
(Se Chan scores again.)

915
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,350
Come here. You, come over here.

916
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,280
(The young beret evened the score.)

917
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,090
Come here. You're really annoying.

918
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,890
- Come here.
- What's the matter?

919
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,560
Don't scream during the game.

920
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,360
- Don't scream!
- I can...

921
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,930
- Don't yell "ah."
- You can too.

922
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,530
Don't yell like that.

923
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,100
- It's infuriating.
- Don't go "ah."

924
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,100
(The score is even.)

925
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,800
- It makes me jump.
- You're tied now.

926
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,640
- Oh, really?
- How infuriating. We can't lose.

927
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,840
- Two points.
- Let's stay alert.

928
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,010
Seok Jin!

929
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,170
- We're close.
- You can't just send it over.

930
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,340
- My backhand...
- We need to hit it hard.

931
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,780
I keep having to use my backhand.

932
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,910
We need to win. It's two points.

933
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,880
There's no way we can lose.

934
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,420
We need to win.

935
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,550
- Okay, good.
- Looking good.

936
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,290
- Okay, SUNMI.
- Well done.

937
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,360
Nice! That was a good hit.

938
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,990
- SUNMI must play tennis.
- She's good.

939
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,690
(The ball
they worked hard to get...)

940
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,630
SUNMI! Nice!

941
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,860
That's it.

942
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,830
We need to win while we have a shot.

943
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,970
- Get it across.
- Move.

944
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,570
(Jae Seok's team has a shot.)

945
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,100
- Good.
- Give it to them.

946
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,010
We need to win while we have a shot.

947
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,310
- Move.
- Give it to them.

948
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,880
Nice. Give it to them.

949
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,080
- Nice.
- Come on.

950
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,980
(Jae Seok's forehand
sends the ball down the middle.)

951
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,020
(Jong Kook Alliance 6,
Jae Seok Alliance 7)

952
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,020
- Nice.
- We need to win.

953
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,050
Come on. Shoot.

954
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,090
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

955
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,520
(Team Jong Kook's in a foul mood.)

956
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,960
- We should've received that.
- We should receive one like that.

957
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,360
- Nice.
- Well done.

958
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,060
We're one point away.

959
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,700
- Already?
- You, get out.

960
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,330
- Get out.
- Okay.

961
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,900
- They need one more point.
- One more point.

962
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,970
- Let's go.
- Okay.

963
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,570
- We can do this.
- Stay there.

964
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,670
This is fun.

965
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,170
- One more point.
- We can do this.

966
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,510
Let's go!

967
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,780
- Here it goes.
- Do us a favor, Mr. Composer.

968
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,350
The ball...

969
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,380
(They kick off an important match.)

970
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,850
The ball... Okay.

971
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,180
- It's mine?
- Seok Jin.

972
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,220
(Shouting)

973
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,260
(Seok Sam hit it
too high and too far!)

974
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,630
- Here it goes.
- Seok Jin.

975
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,060
(Jong Kook barely saved it.)

976
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,560
- SUNMI!
- Hey!

977
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,600
(They lose if they
can't get it over the net!)

978
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,730
- SUNMI!
- Go!

979
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,100
- Okay, nice!
- Well done.

980
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,470
(SUNMI gets it over,)

981
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,670
(and Jae Seok receives it.)

982
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,270
Nice.

983
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,370
- That's it.
- Yes!

984
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,970
Take your time.

985
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,270
(MIYEON's caught in the middle.)

986
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,380
Nice. That's it.

987
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,180
(Just then)

988
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,180
(MIYEON hit the ball!)

989
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,580
- Gosh, MIYEON!
- MIYEON!

990
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,680
- That's it!
- MIYEON!

991
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,120
(A point!)

992
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,320
We won!

993
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,190
- MIYEON!
- MIYEON!

994
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,020
(MIYEON did it!)

995
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,060
Well done.

996
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,590
You did great.

997
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,690
Well done.
(Cho-rapova came out of hiding
to score.)

998
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,690
We won.

999
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,060
Well done.

1000
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,330
- Byoung Cheol, well done.
- Thanks.

1001
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,370
Why hit it like this
when you could've done this?

1002
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,970
Look. My eyes...

1003
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,440
- Hey.
- I couldn't see because of this.

1004
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
Because of this darn chicken head.

1005
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,180
- We won.
- Why didn't you...

1006
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,280
tap it lightly like this?

1007
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,710
- Instead, you smacked it hard.
- I couldn't see.

1008
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,850
If only Niel and received it...

1009
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,820
Why are you blaming him?

1010
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,020
(Clip-clopping hooves)

1011
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,280
- But this...
- I hit the ball that one time.

1012
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,290
Hey!

1013
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,660
Mister.

1014
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,690
- We deserve...
- No.

1015
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,990
- It was hard.
- You had an advantage.

1016
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,830
- We couldn't see.
- The sun was in our eyes.

1017
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,860
- I couldn't see a thing.
- Well done.

1018
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,860
There are two teams per side.

1019
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,270
The winners have to decide
which team is 1st and 2nd.

1020
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,570
The losers decide 3rd and 4th.

1021
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,240
It was so close.
Seok Jin, your team is fourth.

1022
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,570
Yes, okay. No, wait.

1023
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,380
- What was that?
- Why is my team last?

1024
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,580
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1025
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,480
- You said okay.
- I said so without thinking.

1026
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,780
- Isn't that over, then?
- No, it's not.

1027
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,820
It's not done.

1028
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,190
Rock-paper-scissors.

1029
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,620
Rock-paper-scissors.

1030
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,060
(Se Chan won.)

1031
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,630
- You lost.
- You're out, mister.

1032
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,600
If there's a deity, we'll win.

1033
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,260
(Sniggering)

1034
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,770
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1035
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,870
Yes! Okay, good.

1036
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,100
SUNMI. There is a deity.

1037
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,270
This is so annoying.

1038
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,510
I'll explain the benefits.

1039
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,080
- The first-place team's benefit.
- Yes.

1040
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,010
- You select one team.
- Yes.

1041
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,080
You can see
all three of their cards.

1042
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,620
That's a great benefit.

1043
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,720
- And then...
- That's amazing.

1044
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,450
- you can swap three cards...
- That's crazy.

1045
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,460
with whichever team you want.

1046
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,960
You don't have to swap all three
with the team whose cards you saw.

1047
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,630
- You can swap two with them...
- We can guess.

1048
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,830
Gosh, coming first...

1049
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,700
You can choose not to swap too.

1050
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,070
- We can refuse?
- You can swap up to three.

1051
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,240
You can choose to stop
after swapping just two.

1052
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,710
The second-place team's benefit.

1053
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,510
You can see just one card.

1054
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,280
Then you can swap up to two cards...

1055
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,750
with the team of your choice.

1056
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,820
Okay. We see one and swap two.

1057
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,820
- The third-place team.
- The last team's so poorly off.

1058
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,390
You don't get to see any cards.

1059
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,420
- There's no checking.
- But you can...

1060
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,160
- swap one card.
- And us?

1061
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,590
- You give one and get one.
- Okay.

1062
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,160
- What about us?
- The fourth-place team.

1063
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,630
- You just...
- We're just victims.

1064
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,000
You get what they give you.

1065
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,970
- Either way...
- The first-place team...

1066
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,900
swaps first, and after that,
you can only swap...

1067
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,270
- with teams beneath you.
- Right. That's a given.

1068
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,170
Discuss among yourselves
which team's cards...

1069
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,640
- you want to see.
- Yes, discuss.

1070
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,710
- Come here.
- What is it?

1071
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,580
- You placed second.
- There are two more games left.

1072
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,980
If we swap now, we'll become a target
since we have a good card.

1073
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,780
How about we skip this turn
and see how things play out?

1074
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,990
If we skip,
they'll know we have a good card.

1075
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,660
- We must see their cards.
- Yes, of course.

1076
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,960
- Them?
- Their three cards.

1077
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,260
Them or them?

1078
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,460
I think theirs are good.

1079
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,960
(Team Jae Seok needs the jang card.)

1080
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,830
- We'll...
- If you decided,

1081
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,630
name the team
whose cards you'll check.

1082
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,670
Seok Jin's team?

1083
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,430
It's Haha's or Seok Jin's team.

1084
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,400
It's Haha's or Seok Sam's team.

1085
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,570
Let us off.

1086
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,740
We have a good card.

1087
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,380
Do you have a good card?

1088
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,580
- We do, yes.
- I...

1089
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,880
- I don't know how to play.
- We have a good one.

1090
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,980
- They have a good card.
- Yes.

1091
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,250
They have one.

1092
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,380
- Then...
- No.

1093
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,020
Let's see Seok Jin's.

1094
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,090
- Then...
- No.

1095
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,890
- Then...
- We'll see their cards.

1096
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,360
Come forward
and show your three cards.

1097
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,260
We have to show them obediently?

1098
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,990
- Yes, just to them.
- Look away.

1099
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,330
The others will turn around.

1100
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,730
Show them to us.

1101
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,970
- Do you have the ttaeng?
- What?

1102
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,870
- Let's see them.
- Well...

1103
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,600
- Slowly.
- Let's see.

1104
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
- Here.
- Let's see.

1105
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,740
- That's...
- You have it.

1106
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,110
- Do we swap?
- Let's swap.

1107
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,110
(They found the jang card
they need.)

1108
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,580
- You have it.
- We must swap.

1109
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,880
We'll swap.

1110
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,180
- With what?
- Now hide them.

1111
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,120
- Mix them up.
- What?

1112
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
- You shuffle them.
- Even I don't know what's what.

1113
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,250
- Which is what...
- You don't know?

1114
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,360
Pick one, MIYEON.

1115
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,590
(MIYEON chose
the one in the middle.)

1116
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,330
- Don't show them.
- Wait. For real?

1117
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,960
- Let go.
- Give it to them.

1118
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,600
- Niel.
- Let's see.

1119
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,800
(They got it in one go.)

1120
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,230
- What is it?
- We can tell from the rest.

1121
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,700
- I didn't see it.
- You want just one?

1122
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,900
Give them one card.

1123
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,370
- We'll give you one.
- Hang on.

1124
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,440
Do we give them yours?

1125
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,770
(Team Seok Sam lost the best card.)

1126
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,080
Seeing before you decide...

1127
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,610
(Inhaling bitterly)

1128
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,750
We'll give you this.

1129
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,520
- Show us what you swapped.
- Okay.

1130
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,190
We're done.

1131
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,290
- What?
- The first-place team...

1132
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,660
finished swapping.

1133
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,620
- It's our turn.
- The second-place team.

1134
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,160
- Pick whose cards...
- Jong Kook's cards.

1135
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,360
Yes, Jong Kook's team.

1136
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,860
We can only swap two.

1137
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,900
- You're sure?
- Yes.

1138
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,160
Can I talk you out of it?

1139
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,530
- SUNMI...
- Are you sure?

1140
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,600
- SUMNI, for me too.
- Nice. Yes.

1141
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,070
But...

1142
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,600
- I seriously warned you.
- Okay.

1143
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,910
Don't say anything to us.

1144
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,010
- Out of the three...
- Are you sure?

1145
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,170
- We have to pick well.
- But...

1146
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,810
- You will only pick and see 1.
- You can see 1.

1147
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:08,980
- Yes, one.
- We won't change.

1148
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,210
- The middle one seems kind of...
- The middle? Okay.

1149
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,510
- Pick it.
- What do you think about this?

1150
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,220
- Go with your gut, Ye Eun.
- You're just checking for now.

1151
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,320
- Just checking.
- Yes, Ye Eun.

1152
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,020
Don't show them. Bring it here.

1153
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,690
Oh, boy.

1154
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,820
Should we switch the other two?

1155
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,990
No, I think the other two might have
the penalty.

1156
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,560
- Oh, you think so?
- Yes.

1157
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,060
Let's see that card again.

1158
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,660
- Don't show them.
- This one.

1159
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,030
Look at this.

1160
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,370
(Haha's team has the same
August card as they just saw.)

1161
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,370
- It's a good thing, then.
- That could be true.

1162
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,540
- This is...
- Then, let's pick that one.

1163
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,070
- I think we can pick that one.
- Yes.

1164
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,010
- Two cards.
- Hurry up and go.

1165
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,640
- You could just switch one.
- Two... No, just trust me.

1166
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,740
All right.

1167
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,210
I'm sure
he put it in the middle again.

1168
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,910
No.

1169
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,080
I think he put the dud
in the middle.

1170
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,350
- Really?
- I'm totally serious.

1171
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,650
- He could've put...
- I think I have something going on.

1172
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,290
- Relax and go ahead.
- This one.

1173
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,320
- This?
- Yes?

1174
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,390
Are you sure about this?

1175
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,490
- No, I'm so sure.
- Then, are we...

1176
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,730
- Are we switching with mine?
- Yes.

1177
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,830
Oh, goodness.

1178
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,860
(It's a dud.)

1179
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,300
- Why, you little...
- Oh, boy.

1180
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,800
(They choose the penalty card.)

1181
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,600
(Penalty)

1182
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,010
(Team Jong Kook got rid of
their penalty card thanks to them.)

1183
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,170
Come on, Jong Kook.

1184
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,670
- I have a really bad hunch.
- Here's mine.

1185
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,040
- You just be quiet.
- Right. Okay.

1186
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,510
- I'll take this, then.
- Okay.

1187
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,550
- Okay.
- That one...

1188
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,510
- Can we switch one more now?
- January is...

1189
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,150
- All right.
- Don't worry. It's okay.

1190
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,350
- What?
- You can go now.

1191
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,090
- Anyway, thank you!
- Sure.

1192
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,390
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Anyway, thank you!

1193
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,720
- Yes, sure.
- Okay.

1194
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:26,920
- Oh, dear.
- Yes.

1195
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,390
- You should just be quiet now.
- Oh, dear.

1196
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,490
- All right.
- Got it?

1197
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,760
Seok Jin, come here.

1198
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,960
- What?
- Seok Jin's team.

1199
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,030
- Oh, us?
- Yes.

1200
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,360
- What about us?
- Do you need us?

1201
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,930
- Team. We're here.
- What is it?

1202
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,300
Okay, we won't check
and just pick from one person.

1203
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,240
- Any card?
- Yes, please take out your cards.

1204
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,940
We don't know which one is which.

1205
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,740
Are you going to switch?

1206
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,840
Yes, switch.

1207
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,410
- Please be a dud.
- Yes.

1208
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,480
Are you sure?

1209
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,910
Nice.

1210
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,180
That's so funny.

1211
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,180
(The penalty card keeps going
round and round.)

1212
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,420
It's a game of Pass the Dud.

1213
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,390
Okay, now, the team in third place,
please come forward.

1214
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,690
- Yes.
- Haha.

1215
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,860
You can switch one card.

1216
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,330
- I'll remember this.
- Do you want to switch?

1217
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,230
- Did you switch just now?
- Yes.

1218
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,460
- With who?
- With Haha.

1219
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,730
- Did Haha switch with you?
- Yes.

1220
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:09,800
- So,
- Yes?

1221
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,100
- we won't switch.
- Oh, really?

1222
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,540
- Yes.
- You should switch, though.

1223
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,700
No, we're okay.

1224
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,570
- SUNMI.
- No.

1225
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,170
- Take your card back.
- No.

1226
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,440
- This is yours. Take it back.
- We won't...

1227
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,180
make the switch and move on.

1228
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,750
- Seok Sam, where are you going?
- Then,

1229
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,210
- we'll move...
- I guess we'll get moving.

1230
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,510
- to the next location.
- Let's move!

1231
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,750
- Let's move!
- Okay.

1232
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,380
Someone I know gave me some coffee.

1233
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,820
- Would you like some?
- Oh, yes.

1234
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,320
- Really?
- This is nice.

1235
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,690
- The coffee looks pretty.
- I love it. Thank you!

1236
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,920
- All right. Yes.
- Thank you.

1237
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,860
(Full of smiles)

1238
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,860
Who wants caramel?

1239
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,100
- Me.
- Me!

1240
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
- Thank you.
- Oh, Se Chan.

1241
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,300
What flavor is the caramel?

1242
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,370
It has red bean in it.

1243
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,640
SUNMI is like Santa Claus.

1244
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,600
By the way, Byoung Cheol...

1245
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,310
Byoung Cheol is good.

1246
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,840
Yes, our composer...

1247
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,870
- He's good at everything.
- seems to be good at ball sports.

1248
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,880
- The composer is good at it.
- Hey, you...

1249
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,410
- Hey, Jae Seok.
- Yes?

1250
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,150
- Don't call him so casually.
- Why not?

1251
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,210
I can call him by his name.

1252
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,420
Why are you calling him casually
by his name?

1253
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,580
- He's younger than me.
- Why are you doing that?

1254
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,320
Do you speak down to everyone
who's younger than you, punk?

1255
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,490
(Being attacked for no reason
as he let on that they were friends)

1256
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,760
- Mister, why are you swearing?
- Why are you swearing?

1257
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,060
- I'm sorry.
- But mister...

1258
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,290
- Why did you change into this?
- I mean...

1259
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,330
(By the way...)

1260
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,660
- Why did you change into this?
- I mean...

1261
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,760
- Seok Jin.
- I wanted to look cool.

1262
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,330
- Isn't that hot?
- You really look like an old man.

1263
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,670
- You're seriously old now.
- Hey, you know,

1264
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,070
Byoung Cheol and I
have a connection.

1265
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,100
For Ki Young's wedding,
I was the host for the first half...

1266
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,740
and Byoung Cheol for the second.

1267
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:24,970
- Ki Young?
- Do you host weddings too?

1268
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,280
- Not the host.
- Right.

1269
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,180
I was there as a guest,

1270
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,180
- Suddenly? Yes, that happens.
- but when we took photos,

1271
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,620
- I was acting awkwardly.
- Someone needs to do that.

1272
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,450
- Jae Seok told me to stand here.
- Right.

1273
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,550
- That's right.
- Seriously.

1274
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,350
- So sweet.
- It's all there.

1275
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,290
- A flood of nice stories.
- It's all there.

1276
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,430
- Stop telling us nice stories.
- Jae Seok is so sweet.

1277
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,630
- There are too many anyway.
- Right.

1278
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,360
- Stop telling us nice stories.
- By the way, mister, are you...

1279
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,360
- an undercover journalist today?
- Yes.

1280
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,530
An undercover journalist to see
how well SUNMI performs today.

1281
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,400
- Oh, you mean "Cynical?"
- Yes.

1282
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,500
Seok Jin is getting
really irritated today.

1283
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,510
Let's get off.

1284
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,940
We're already here.

1285
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,380
- I'm hungry!
- Okay.

1286
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,150
It'll be lunchtime soon, right?

1287
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,610
- Yes.
- So,

1288
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,880
we've prepared a meal...

1289
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,150
with plump hairtail
which is in season.

1290
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,790
- Hairtail!
- I love hairtail.

1291
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,120
- Protein!
- That's awesome.

1292
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,560
- That sounds so good.
- With a hairtail meal on the line,

1293
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,260
we'll proceed with the mission,
A Meal with Wasabi Bombs.

1294
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,690
- Oh, this is fun.
- Okay!

1295
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,090
- It was all the rage on Instagram.
- What is it?

1296
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,400
- What is it?
- Really? I didn't know.

1297
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,800
It's a competition
between two teams.

1298
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,470
Two representatives from each team
will play.

1299
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,770
So, each team's representatives,

1300
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,870
while the other team's players
have their eyes shut,

1301
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,110
will squeeze wasabi...

1302
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,940
into 1 of the 15 cones.

1303
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,980
We fill it.

1304
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,710
After taking turns to fill them
with wasabi,

1305
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,610
you will take turns eating them.

1306
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,020
The team who eats
a wasabi-filled cone first...

1307
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,990
- will lose.
- They lose?

1308
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,020
It's simple.

1309
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,590
Please decide
which team you'll play with.

1310
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,660
Since there are only two of us,

1311
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,820
- we have to keep playing.
- I know.

1312
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,890
- Right. You'll have to play a lot.
- Let's go.

1313
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,990
But when you eat the cones,
you can't sniff it or anything.

1314
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,600
- You have to eat it right away.
- You have to eat it directly.

1315
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,530
- Haha, we all know that much.
- Wasabi is...

1316
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,970
- Isn't that obvious?
- No...

1317
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,970
So,
do you have an Instagram account?

1318
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,370
- What? I don't.
- You don't have an account, do you?

1319
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,400
- You don't know what following is?
- I don't.

1320
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,970
- You don't know Reposting, do you?
- I don't know.

1321
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,510
Mr. Bead Pants,
what's up with you today?

1322
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,540
Bead Pants...

1323
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,980
- They're pearls, okay?
- Bead Pants.

1324
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,280
Go home!

1325
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,450
- Go home.
- They're pearl pants, okay?

1326
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,720
Gosh, bead pants.

1327
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,290
My mom loves pearls.

1328
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,920
So, out of the winning teams,
we'll have 1st and 2nd place.

1329
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,660
And out of the losing teams,
we'll have 3rd and 4th place.

1330
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,730
Getting first place is important.

1331
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,160
The losing teams...

1332
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,430
It's autumn now,

1333
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,700
so you'll get a bowl of rice with
kkakdugi made with autumn radishes.

1334
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,230
- Still, you're giving us something.
- Kkakdugi is...

1335
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,600
- That's delicious.
- We'd be grateful for that much.

1336
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,870
Hey,
but if they're eating hairtail...

1337
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,940
- right next to you...
- A delicious smell!

1338
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,040
- What?
- I already smell it.

1339
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,310
- A delicious smell.
- What's up with you so suddenly?

1340
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,510
I don't smell anything.

1341
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,610
- Do you smell something, MIYEON?
- I smell gas.

1342
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,780
The smell of gas?

1343
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,780
- What's wrong?
- Isn't that the smell of hairtail?

1344
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,850
- The smell of gas?
- MIYEON,

1345
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,150
you must be hungry.

1346
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,350
I'm hungry.

1347
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,790
- Let's have two people come up.
- MIYEON, come here.

1348
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,190
Okay!

1349
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,590
- We will...
- MIYEON.

1350
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,260
- Who will play?
- MIYEON and Ssaebssaeb.

1351
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,800
Will you go 1st?
Shall we let them go 1st?

1352
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,600
- Okay, go ahead.
- Oh, boy.

1353
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,870
Nice.

1354
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,270
- Nice.
- All right.

1355
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,300
(While Team Jong Kook
is turned around,)

1356
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,140
(Team Jae Seok fills a cone
with wasabi.)

1357
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,310
I suddenly want to play too.

1358
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,670
There we go.

1359
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,310
I only saw this in Reels.

1360
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,610
- Fill it up. That's it.
- Yes.

1361
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,080
(Filling it up)

1362
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:22,220
(Being careful
in case they can tell)

1363
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,790
I want to compete against MIYEON...

1364
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,120
- in a quiz.
- Me too.

1365
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,390
- I wish MIYEON joins us often.
- I think I could beat MIYEON.

1366
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,020
- MIYEON has to do quizzes.
- I'm good at quizzes too.

1367
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,590
- Seriously.
- I want to do a quiz...

1368
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,790
with MIYEON too.

1369
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,860
Gosh, but seriously,
she's a treasure.

1370
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,300
When I play with MIYEON,

1371
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,670
- I feel so at ease.
- Right.

1372
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:37,730
- I really respect her.
- She is...

1373
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,770
the top Empty Head among idols.

1374
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,900
Good job.

1375
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,670
(Team Jong Kook starts
filling their cone with wasabi.)

1376
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,770
Let's do that one.

1377
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
(Team Jae Seok)

1378
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,840
(They choose the one
at the very end.)

1379
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,880
Be quiet, Young Forty.

1380
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,320
(Adding a bunch
since he won't be eating it)

1381
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,120
(Team Jong Kook and Team Jae Seok,
both teams are all set.)

1382
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,520
I didn't see it. Oh, no.

1383
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,660
- Okay!
- I saw it.

1384
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,220
- I didn't see it either.
- I saw it!

1385
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,830
- Let's go! Who will eat first?
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1386
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,030
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- I don't remember MIYEON's.

1387
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,230
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1388
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,300
- Eat it right away.
- She won.

1389
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,870
- Will you go first or...
- What do you want to do?

1390
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,030
- That side would be better.
- Go second?

1391
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,870
- Go first!
- Okay, let's go.

1392
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,040
- Okay, let's go first!
- You have to eat it right away.

1393
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,170
- Going first is better.
- It is.

1394
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,140
- Go right away.
- Just eat it straight away.

1395
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,840
- Okay.
- Nice!

1396
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,040
(Attacking first without hesitation)

1397
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,580
(SUNMI passes.)

1398
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,150
- Okay, MIYEON. Go.
- Right away.

1399
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,210
- MIYEON, go.
- Go!

1400
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,320
- Okay, nice.
- Okay!

1401
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,620
- Okay, MIYEON. Go.
- MIYEON, go.

1402
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,990
(MIYEON passes.)

1403
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,750
(The first players from both teams
easily succeed.)

1404
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,220
- All right. Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook.

1405
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,660
(Contemplating)

1406
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,730
- He's taking a long time.
- Go.

1407
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,260
- There you go.
- Okay.

1408
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,800
(Jong Kook passes.)

1409
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,830
- You just have to throw it in.
- Ssaebssaeb.

1410
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,700
- You can't check.
- No, you can't check it.

1411
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,900
(Right then, Se Chan's hand
goes for the one with wasabi.)

1412
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,340
(Will Se Chan get
the spicy flavor right away?)

1413
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,470
- It's tasty.
- You just have to throw it in.

1414
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,470
- You can't check.
- No, you can't check it.

1415
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,140
- Just eat it.
- Yes, go for it.

1416
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,170
Okay.

1417
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,240
(Se Chan passes.)

1418
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,640
(He chooses the one right next to
the wasabi-filled cone.)

1419
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,410
- Okay.
- Nice, SUNMI. Let's go.

1420
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,920
(SUNMI chooses quickly
this time as well.)

1421
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,390
(SUNMI passes.)

1422
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,090
Gosh, this is getting intense.

1423
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,160
MIYEON, let's go.

1424
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,490
(MIYEON passes quickly too.)

1425
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:09,630
- This is fun.
- Se Chan, let's go.

1426
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,030
(There aren't
that many cones left now.)

1427
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,700
- This is getting interesting!
- Okay!

1428
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,270
- This is pretty interesting.
- It is.

1429
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,840
(Team Jong Kook, Team Jae Seok)

1430
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,270
This is fun!

1431
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:22,910
(Pass)

1432
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:25,710
(Now, it's a matter of pride
for both teams.)

1433
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:28,840
(Among the remaining 6,
2 cones are filled with wasabi.)

1434
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,750
(Right then, MIYEON eats one.)

1435
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,520
(MIYEON passes.)

1436
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,720
You guys are incredible.

1437
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,620
You guys are incredible.

1438
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,190
- You actually dodged that?
- Jong Kook.

1439
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:44,160
Hey, this Reel is going to be
a huge hit.

1440
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,300
(There are only 5 cones left.)

1441
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,360
Here it comes.

1442
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,130
- Gosh, now...
- Hey, this Reel...

1443
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,730
(Shouting)

1444
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,470
(He picks the wasabi-filled one.)

1445
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,540
(Team Jong Kook, Team Jae Seok)

1446
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,810
Jong Kook!

1447
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,980
- With that, Team Jae Seok wins.
- Okay.

1448
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,810
(Team Jae Seok moves on
to the finals.)

1449
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:10,090
(Team Jong Kook will play again
to determine 3rd and 4th place.)

1450
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,390
- Nice.
- Spit it out.

1451
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,920
Jong Kook, spit it out.

1452
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,360
Was that the one we filled?

1453
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,590
- It was the one we filled.
- Oh, really?

1454
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,960
- I forgot too. Which one was yours?
- Okay.

1455
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,390
- You can't see it.
- I thought it was this,

1456
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,530
- so I kept avoiding that one.
- Okay.

1457
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:20,900
Gosh, that's so funny.

1458
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,800
(Round 2,
Team Haha versus Team Seok Jin)

1459
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,930
- Let's do it.
- Did we have two?

1460
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,070
Right, Byoung Cheol should go.

1461
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,070
- I get it.
- Ye Eun...

1462
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,640
- and Byoung Cheol should go.
- There are only two among these.

1463
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,710
- Then, we'll close our eyes first.
- Okay.

1464
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,240
- You can fill it 1st.
- We'll go 1st?

1465
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:32,940
Oh, his back.

1466
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,080
(While Team Seok Jin isn't looking,
Team Haha fills a cone with wasabi.)

1467
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,910
- Seok Jin, you can't look.
- I won't.

1468
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,210
I won't look
since it wouldn't be fun that way.

1469
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,980
- It's better to turn around.
- Turn around.

1470
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,120
Why are you making...

1471
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,680
- Grandpa.
- Grandpa.

1472
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,890
Be quiet, you punks.

1473
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,850
(Team Haha places their cone.)

1474
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,890
- Okay.
- All right.

1475
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,060
- Let's go.
- Are you done?

1476
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,220
- I forgot.
- Okay.

1477
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,760
If you forget your cone...

1478
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,390
- and eat it, you still fail.
- It would be funny.

1479
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:52,490
That would be fate too.

1480
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:53,560
You're right.

1481
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,560
(It's Team Seok Jin's turn now.)

1482
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,830
- That was fast.
- That was fast.

1483
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,940
- That's a lot.
- Here we go.

1484
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,870
- Check out that speed.
- That was fast.

1485
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,310
That was fast.

1486
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,470
(Team Seok Jin chooses theirs
without any hesitation.)

1487
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,570
(Which ones have wasabi in them?)

1488
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,640
- I'm nervous.
- You can't tell.

1489
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,650
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1490
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:10,910
(Lose, Win)

1491
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,680
- Go ahead.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1492
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,420
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Byoung Cheol, you first.

1493
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,750
- You first.
- Go ahead.

1494
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,090
- Byoung Cheol.
- Eat it immediately.

1495
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,190
- Pick it up and eat it right away.
- Right away.

1496
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:20,660
- Sure.
- One and two.

1497
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,420
- Sure.
- One and two.

1498
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,490
Darn.

1499
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,260
(He chose the one with the wasabi
on his first attempt.)

1500
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,900
(Laughing)

1501
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,500
He picked one, and it was game over.

1502
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,670
No way.

1503
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,440
(Even he's amazed by it.)

1504
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,510
That's why we didn't pick the one
in the center.

1505
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,910
- Seriously?
- How could you be that naive?

1506
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,310
- Unbelievable.
- How could you?

1507
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,080
I left it looking like
it was meaningless.

1508
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,920
Are you okay?

1509
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,450
- How...
- Did you swallow it?

1510
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,690
How could the game end
the second it started?

1511
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:51,750
We won!

1512
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,220
Wait, hold on.
You need to eat one too.

1513
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,360
- Us too?
- Yes, you too.

1514
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,260
- You should choose one too.
- Who should do it?

1515
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,190
- I'll do it.
- You could've spat it out.

1516
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:01,330
Byoung Cheol lost miserably.

1517
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:02,700
(Seok Jin chooses one
without thinking too much.)

1518
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,930
(He could've chosen the one
with wasabi too.)

1519
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:04,970
Please...

1520
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,240
Darn.

1521
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,340
Just like that, your team lost.

1522
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,170
- That was quick.
- What a bummer.

1523
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,010
- How can it end this fast?
- His eyes are red.

1524
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,380
His eyes look bloodshot.

1525
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,780
That's something Kwang Soo
would've done.

1526
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,250
- Oh, no.
- It was memorable.

1527
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,720
I've never seen someone
choose it on the first try before.

1528
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,850
What on earth was that?

1529
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,890
Maybe it's because
I write songs really fast,

1530
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,460
- but I was fast with this as well.
- Tell me about it.

1531
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,360
- It left a huge impact.
- You made us laugh.

1532
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,130
- It was memorable.
- That was hilarious.

1533
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,360
- We're up next.
- Let's do this.

1534
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,060
- Jae Seok.
- Let the best man win.

1535
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,370
I'm all for it.

1536
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:37,600
- I want to beat MIYEON for once.
- Let's see who's the best.

1537
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,740
- Let's go!
- Please get ready.

1538
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,140
- Let's see who's the best.
- Let's see who's the best.

1539
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,800
MIYEON's on a roll right now.

1540
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,010
MIYEON's good at everything
apart from quizzes.

1541
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,880
- You should turn around first.
- Really?

1542
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,080
You go first.

1543
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,750
(Team Jae Seok will place
the wasabi first.)

1544
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,550
Seok Jin, there's nothing to this.

1545
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,780
(Winning 1st place...)

1546
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,050
(will give them a major advantage
when swapping cards.)

1547
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:01,360
(The 1st place benefit
is something they really want.)

1548
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,460
Since MIYEON's here,
I want us to do a quiz.

1549
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,560
I'm feeling a surge of confidence.

1550
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,130
You're not even that better.

1551
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:07,230
Seok Jin, come on.

1552
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,570
(Team Jae Seok places
their wasabi-filled cone.)

1553
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,300
- There.
- Okay.

1554
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,770
Let's go with the one
from the position before.

1555
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,170
- Right?
- Nice.

1556
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,340
That was fast.

1557
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,510
(The cone that eliminated
Byoung Cheol on his first attempt!)

1558
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,280
(Team Seok Jin)

1559
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,050
(Will Seok Jin's plan work again?)

1560
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,150
(Team Seok Jin)

1561
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,350
I didn't look.

1562
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,850
It's more entertaining that way.

1563
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:32,690
- Rock-paper-scissors, go.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1564
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:35,020
(Seeing who'll go first)

1565
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,760
- Okay.
- Oh, no!

1566
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,190
- MIYEON, I'll go first.
- Sure.

1567
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,160
- Jae Seok's on a roll.
- MIYEON, I'll go first.

1568
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,160
Sure.

1569
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,570
(He chose the wasabi one
on the first try.)

1570
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,370
Unbelievable.

1571
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,500
Is it game over?

1572
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:53,040
(Seok Jin's plan worked!)

1573
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,080
We won.

1574
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,580
- Why that one?
- You're right.

1575
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,350
- I put it in the same place.
- I wanted braised hairtail!

1576
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,420
- I knew you'd go for that one.
- Seok Jin, no way.

1577
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,880
- That was awesome!
- This is all because...

1578
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,050
Seok Jin knows Jae Seok well.

1579
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,620
I know him well.
Remember what I told you?

1580
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,260
How could you have predicted that?

1581
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,220
How hilarious is that?

1582
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,160
That was awesome.

1583
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,130
They should eat one too.

1584
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:14,330
Right, we should too.

1585
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,730
Seok Jin, please.

1586
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:17,830
- Please.
- If...

1587
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:20,370
Let the Variety Fairy
be on our side.

1588
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:21,800
I bet he placed it
right in the middle.

1589
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,740
Go for the one in the middle,
just for kicks.

1590
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,370
- You saw where he put it.
- I didn't.

1591
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,510
- He didn't watch.
- Really?

1592
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,240
- We didn't see anything.
- We were busy talking.

1593
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,850
- Should I pick one for you?
- It can't end like this.

1594
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:30,980
You'll let me know?

1595
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,650
Wouldn't that be a bit weird?

1596
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:33,680
- Should I tell you where it is?
- Jae Seok.

1597
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,250
- Can he?
- Who knows?

1598
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,820
I may or may not be
telling the truth.

1599
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,850
(Jae Seok suddenly suggests
a mind game.)

1600
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:39,590
- Bring it on.
- A mind game.

1601
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:40,720
- It's a mind game.
- A mind game?

1602
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,720
- A mind game.
- Bring it on.

1603
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,190
It's this one.

1604
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,630
- Is it this one?
- Yes.

1605
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:49,400
(Jae Seok chose one of them.)

1606
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,430
That can't be it.

1607
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:51,600
- Come on.
- That's not it.

1608
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:53,800
Eat the one right next to it.

1609
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:56,310
- That can't be it.
- I made myself clear.

1610
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:57,340
Eat the one in the middle.

1611
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,540
Can you zoom in
on Seok Jin shaking his legs?

1612
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,740
(Extremely anxious)

1613
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,050
He's dead serious.

1614
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,080
- I really am.
- It's that skinny one.

1615
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,280
The one in the middle.

1616
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:07,520
Are you saying it's this one?

1617
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,220
Seok Jin, the way you're thinking
about your next move...

1618
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,090
makes you look like an old man
at a go club.

1619
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:13,720
(Running Go Club)

1620
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,860
- It's like you're playing go.
- Is this checkmate?

1621
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,960
Exactly.
That's the vibe you're giving.

1622
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,130
(It's not checkmate.)

1623
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,760
- Go for it.
- Hold on.

1624
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,830
He didn't pick one out of two.

1625
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:25,000
How am I supposed to interpret
him choosing that one?

1626
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,470
What am I supposed to think?

1627
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:27,600
Just choose.

1628
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,900
(Jae Seok's mind game has gotten
into the old man's head.)

1629
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,070
An old man at a go club?

1630
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,540
You picked that one, is that it?

1631
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,210
You have ten seconds on the clock.

1632
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,550
- I'll trust my gut.
- Good one.

1633
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,580
I'm trying not to eat the one
with wasabi in it.

1634
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,880
- I don't want to eat wasabi.
- Let's just win this game.

1635
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,090
(Did Jae Seok tell him the truth?)

1636
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:46,190
- Should I eat it?
- Yes.

1637
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,420
- The one he picked out?
- Yes!

1638
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,560
Face it head on.
I don't want you to be chicken.

1639
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,630
- Should I eat it?
- Yes.

1640
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,660
- The one he picked out?
- Yes!

1641
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,660
Okay!

1642
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,560
(He chooses the one
that Jae Seok picked out.)

1643
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,730
(Does the one he chose
have wasabi in it?)

1644
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,370
(He chooses the one
that Jae Seok picked out.)

1645
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:02,370
(He believes Jae Seok lied.)

1646
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,240
(It had wasabi in it.)

1647
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,940
(He saw through Seok Sam.)

1648
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,050
Since it's a tie,
you'll turn around...

1649
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,150
- once again.
- Good.

1650
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,750
I didn't think he'd eat it.

1651
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,850
- Do we leave this as is?
- Can we have the wasabi?

1652
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,020
Here you go.

1653
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,890
- Would you like to go first?
- Right.

1654
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,020
We'll go first.

1655
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,590
I honestly thought that wasn't it.

1656
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:22,790
- Same here.
- I thought so too.

1657
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,290
- I thought it was on the far end.
- Jae Seok took a gamble.

1658
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,560
That's how you play the game.

1659
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:29,830
Grandpa, choose another one.

1660
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,630
Shut it.

1661
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:34,170
- He's angry.
- Or you'll get an earful.

1662
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,270
Got it.

1663
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,110
- "Or you'll get an earful."
- He'll give me an earful.

1664
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,510
- Or you'll get an earful.
- He isn't kidding.

1665
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,670
He meant that.

1666
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,110
- Okay, go ahead.
- We're done.

1667
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,850
It's our turn now.

1668
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:46,210
I mean, how could
he have picked out...

1669
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,220
- the right one?
- I'm amazed too.

1670
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,150
I'd like the game to continue.

1671
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,420
Me too.

1672
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,620
Goodness.

1673
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,790
(Which team will finish
in 1st place?)

1674
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,690
- Please turn back around.
- Sure.

1675
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,960
All right.

1676
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,360
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

1677
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,130
- I won.
- Who should go first?

1678
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:04,770
- You go first.
- MIYEON, go ahead.

1679
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:05,870
It's better to go first.

1680
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:07,400
- It's...
- MIYEON's on a lucky streak.

1681
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,640
- It's better to go first.
- MIYEON,

1682
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,670
- you're lucky today.
- She's good at this.

1683
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,170
- I'll go first.
- Sure.

1684
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,340
Let's win.
We need to win first place.

1685
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,440
- Don't look.
- You shouldn't look.

1686
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:18,080
- One, two. Stick to that rhythm.
- That's it.

1687
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,350
(The unlucky Jae Seok
makes it this time.)

1688
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,450
Good.

1689
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,920
I think Seok Jin forgot
where he put his.

1690
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:25,890
One, two.

1691
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,920
(Fortunately, he didn't forget
and passed.)

1692
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,590
- Nice.
- Nice going.

1693
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,360
- MIYEON, go.
- This is like Russian roulette.

1694
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,000
- Nice, MIYEON! She's good at this.
- One, two.

1695
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,630
Nice, MIYEON! She's good at this.

1696
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,400
MIYEON's quite lucky.

1697
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,040
MIYEON's good at everything
except quizzes.

1698
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:41,600
Quizzes are what she's best at.

1699
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,570
- She'll beat all of us at it.
- You haven't forgotten, have you?

1700
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:44,770
Nice.

1701
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,480
(Flimsy Daniel passes
without forgetting where theirs is.)

1702
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,210
Nice. Good one.

1703
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,350
- We're down to the final few!
- Is it Jae Seok's turn?

1704
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:52,680
- Jae Seok, don't be chicken.
- I'm scared.

1705
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,520
(Nervous)

1706
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,750
- Jae Seok, don't be chicken.
- I'm scared.

1707
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,990
Don't be chicken.

1708
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,160
(Jae Seok chooses with confidence.)

1709
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:05,760
(He chooses the one
with wasabi in it.)

1710
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,130
Seriously? Is this for real?

1711
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,770
- Yes!
- You've got to be kidding me.

1712
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,440
We won!

1713
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,940
- Do we have to choose?
- You do.

1714
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,610
- Do we?
- Yes, you do.

1715
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,470
I can't believe it.

1716
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,480
- Is it Seok Jin's turn?
- Isn't it my turn?

1717
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,910
- I can't believe it.
- Seok Jin, just choose one.

1718
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:25,010
There you go.

1719
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,720
Okay.

1720
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:29,180
Team Seok Jin finishes
in first place.

1721
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,450
(The old man managed to get
his revenge on Jae Seok.)

1722
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:32,090
You're the best, Seok Jin.

1723
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,090
That's the one.

1724
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,690
- Which one? This one?
- It's this one.

1725
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:36,020
Nice.

1726
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,490
I thought he'd choose the right one.

1727
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,630
- You know Jae Seok too well.
- I really do.

1728
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:40,660
You know him too well.

1729
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,530
- I knew which one he'd choose.
- That was close.

1730
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,400
We'll see who's in third place.

1731
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,430
Do well.

1732
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:46,770
This looks tough.

1733
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:48,000
(Haha confidently takes one
to his mouth.)

1734
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,400
- Haha, don't look at it.
- I didn't.

1735
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,770
(He chose the one with the wasabi
on his first attempt.)

1736
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:54,180
(Team Jong Kook finishes 3rd.)

1737
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,140
Is losing immediately
your specialty?

1738
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,980
- That's your specialty.
- Okay!

1739
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,610
Before you have lunch,

1740
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,350
you'll swap cards
based on the final rankings.

1741
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:05,920
The team in 1st place
can swap 3 cards.

1742
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,820
We'll swap all three.

1743
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,790
- Sure thing.
- You'll be at a disadvantage.

1744
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:11,290
- We're good.
- You'll be everyone's target.

1745
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:12,360
I don't mind.

1746
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,700
- Nice.
- The team in first place...

1747
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,060
- swapped their cards.
- You did this, right?

1748
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,060
I'll keep them safe.

1749
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,970
The team in second place
will now swap their cards.

1750
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,370
- Haha, come here.
- Haha.

1751
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:21,500
- Us?
- Yes.

1752
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,340
- Go ahead.
- Can we only see one of them?

1753
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,340
Okay, we'll take that.

1754
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,280
- Please show it to us.
- Both of ours.

1755
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,510
Give over two of your cards.

1756
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,780
Let's give them this.

1757
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,850
(They choose two meaningless cards
and hand over the penalty card.)

1758
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:34,050
- Good.
- They can't swap with us because...

1759
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,220
You punk.

1760
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,790
The team in third place will...

1761
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,890
We can only swap
with their team, right?

1762
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:42,920
- Yes, and you can't see the cards.
- We won't swap cards.

1763
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,630
- You won't?
- Let's swap cards.

1764
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:47,000
- You should swap cards.
- That's a good idea.

1765
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:48,530
- I won't swap cards.
- Let's swap cards.

1766
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:49,660
No, we won't swap cards.

1767
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,070
- Let's make this entertaining.
- Now,

1768
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:54,070
the teams in 1st and 2nd place
will eat right here.

1769
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:56,540
The teams in 3rd and 4th place...

1770
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,370
- will go into the back room.
- Okay.

1771
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,110
- Mister. Mr. Beads. Go on.
- Yes!

1772
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:02,240
Seriously, I knew
MIYEON would end up eating this.

1773
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,550
- She has good luck with food.
- Mr. Beads, go inside.

1774
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,310
Every time she comes on the show,
she has good luck with food.

1775
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,450
- Right. I always...
- MIYEON always eats well.

1776
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:10,350
Darn it.

1777
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:12,020
Okay! Nice.

1778
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,960
I really love hairtail.

1779
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,660
But it's annoying to
have to debone it.

1780
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:19,260
MIYEON, sit in the middle.
There, go inside.

1781
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,400
- Gosh, this is a good restaurant.
- There's broccoli, my favorite.

1782
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,670
(Braised hairtail,
the winning team's menu, appears.)

1783
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,330
- This is a good restaurant.
- All right.

1784
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:27,570
Gosh, everything looks great.

1785
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:29,000
- It looks nice and spicy.
- Seriously...

1786
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,570
MIYEON has good luck with food.

1787
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:32,440
Say my name, say my name

1788
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,880
It looks so good.
I really love hairtail.

1789
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,010
I'll enjoy the food!

1790
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,450
I'll enjoy the food.

1791
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:38,450
(The 12-dish braised hairtail meal
that's perfect in chilly weather)

1792
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,450
Is that the braised hairtail?

1793
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:43,550
- I guess so. That looks so good.
- I'm sure it is.

1794
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,750
- Gosh, this is delicious.
- That looks so good.

1795
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:47,360
Will you go for it?

1796
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,660
(A plump piece of hairtail)

1797
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,990
The hairtail is insane.

1798
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:53,330
- Gosh, the radish...
- This is amazing.

1799
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,360
(Adding a moist piece of radish
and broth on top)

1800
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,460
It was cooked so well.

1801
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,800
(Hunting down the hairtail first)

1802
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,300
Gosh, Seok Jin.

1803
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:05,640
The hairtail is amazing.

1804
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,580
(Exclaiming)

1805
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:11,210
The hairtail is insane.
I love hairtail so much, you know.

1806
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,350
(Slurping)

1807
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:19,350
(With his mouth that's perfect
for deboning, he eats it like ribs.)

1808
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,760
So, how is the hairtail?

1809
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,460
The hairtail looks so good.

1810
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,960
(Jae Seok takes a spoonful
of hairtail on rice.)

1811
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,630
(Enjoying the flavors of autumn
for real)

1812
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,630
(Slurping)

1813
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:36,640
(MIYEON starts
with the sweet radish first.)

1814
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:37,970
The hairtail is amazing.

1815
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,140
This is so good.

1816
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,380
It's melting in my mouth.

1817
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:48,650
How is the hairtail... The radish is
so good. Really, have you tried it?

1818
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:50,850
The radish is no joke, for real.

1819
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:51,950
(MIYEON, who has good luck with
food, also gulps everything down.)

1820
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,350
Haha, this place has great food.

1821
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:55,560
- Thank you.
- There you go.

1822
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,690
You need to have some broth with it
every now and then.

1823
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:58,690
The broth...

1824
00:55:58,690 --> 00:55:59,730
(Jee Young Man's Food Travel)

1825
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,400
- This is incredible.
- My goodness.

1826
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,700
Is hairtail in season in the fall?

1827
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:06,130
That's right.
Hairtail is in season these days.

1828
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,970
- Now?
- Yes.

1829
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:11,410
The broth makes you gobble up
your rice too.

1830
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,540
(It's perfect for Jee Young Man,
the food guest too.)

1831
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,010
This is so good.

1832
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,650
(Taking a bite
just like his teacher)

1833
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:18,780
Gosh, the hairtail is...

1834
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,550
(Eyes widening)

1835
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:22,020
Gosh, this is so good.

1836
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:23,590
It makes your rice disappear.

1837
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:24,650
(The dish makes you gulp down
your rice in no time.)

1838
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,160
- Did you finish your rice already?
- Yes.

1839
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,120
- Do you want more?
- This is delicious.

1840
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,130
It's good.

1841
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:33,330
Can I get another bowl of rice?
Gosh, this makes the rice disappear.

1842
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:34,400
(Right when he gets
a refill on his rice)

1843
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,430
That looks so good.

1844
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:39,800
(Gulping)

1845
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,370
(It's harder to endure
since they know how it tastes.)

1846
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:43,810
I mean, this is so delicious.

1847
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:46,570
You know what this is, right?

1848
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,280
The radish is...

1849
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,340
(I do know.)

1850
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,810
Gosh, SUNMI.
This is why teams are important.

1851
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,050
The team.

1852
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,350
Gosh, I thought he was my dad
for a second.

1853
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,590
I'll show you my dad, for real.

1854
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,190
- You'll show us your dad?
- You'll be so surprised.

1855
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,590
Look at his profile.

1856
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,360
Seok Jin's profile.
My dad likes that kind of look.

1857
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,660
- This is my dad's hat.
- You know what this is, right?

1858
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,530
- They really look alike.
- Seok Jin.

1859
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:12,430
(Revealing Haha's father)

1860
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,640
Seok Jin. This is my dad's hat.

1861
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:20,780
(Haha's father and Seok Jin
have the same fashion styles.)

1862
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:23,410
Can you give my dad that hat
after the shoot?

1863
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:25,480
The lifting effect looks different.
I mean, the line of my face.

1864
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,450
- So, that's it.
- I mean, the hat.

1865
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:28,920
- The hat.
- That looks delicious.

1866
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,850
Anyway, we have two guests...

1867
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,660
- on that team.
- That's right.

1868
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,690
Since this was
an Acrostic Poem Club,

1869
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,560
- An acrostic poem.
- please give us an acrostic poem...

1870
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,400
- and the person who does well...
- Oh, yes.

1871
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,230
- will get a piece of hairtail.
- That's nice.

1872
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,530
- Let's try it.
- You should try.

1873
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:46,230
- Shall we go one person at a time?
- Shall we?

1874
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,440
How about with hairtail?

1875
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,640
- Hairtail?
- An acrostic poem with hairtail.

1876
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,540
Who will go first?

1877
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,580
- Is it Young Forty?
- Yes, Young Forty.

1878
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,280
- Young Forty.
- H.

1879
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,650
Hand over some hairtail!

1880
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,220
- My goodness.
- That won't pass.

1881
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,950
- Never mind. Who's next?
- That won't pass.

1882
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:04,020
- What? Come on.
- That won't pass.

1883
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,050
What is this?

1884
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,590
Why won't you hear me out?

1885
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:09,660
- Your tone was annoying.
- It should be simple.

1886
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,160
- You sounded annoying.
- Give me the next letter.

1887
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,630
Gosh, no.

1888
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,860
- Please make it simple.
- Don't make it a joke.

1889
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:16,030
- Yes, SUNMI.
- SUNMI.

1890
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,130
- Yes. One second. Okay.
- H.

1891
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,470
- How about coming with me?
- What?

1892
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,340
This gets a pass. I'll go with her.

1893
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,310
- This gets a pass.
- This one is nice and simple.

1894
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:27,740
(A different mood from earlier)

1895
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:28,780
T.

1896
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,350
To Chiang Mai.

1897
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,650
(Chiang Mai)

1898
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:34,920
(A round of applause)

1899
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,920
Nice one.

1900
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,050
All right! Let's go to Chiang Mai!

1901
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,450
- That's it.
- Chiang Mai!

1902
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:40,820
Hey, let's go to Chiang Mai.

1903
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,690
- That's it. Indeed.
- SUNMI.

1904
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:45,090
- Hey, SUNMI is good at this.
- Yes, she did well.

1905
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,830
You said using
your tone of voice wasn't allowed!

1906
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:50,600
But it's okay at the end.

1907
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:53,030
It's okay to make it simple at first
and giving it a twist at the end.

1908
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,400
- My gosh, seriously.
- How about coming with me?

1909
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,540
"Come with me" was simple?

1910
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:58,710
Ye Eun, will you give it a try?

1911
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,640
- Yes.
- Okay. H?

1912
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,780
How about coming with me?

1913
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:03,380
- You're so cute.
- T.

1914
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:04,450
To the dentist.

1915
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,580
(The girl with laminates flirts
with going to the dentist.)

1916
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:10,920
That's funny.

1917
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,150
The dentist? Yes.

1918
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,560
Hey, that was funny. I liked it.

1919
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,490
The dentist was funny, though.

1920
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:18,030
- She has laminates.
- It wasn't bad.

1921
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:19,060
- That much was...
- Okay.

1922
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,700
- Really? Did I do well?
- Yes, this was...

1923
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:22,430
- an acrostic poem from your life.
- Yes.

1924
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,930
Nice. I like your confidence.

1925
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:26,230
Hey, don't be like that!

1926
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,200
- Why not?
- Give me another chance.

1927
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,010
(They savor
the precious piece of hairtail.)

1928
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,270
The weather is so nice.

1929
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:33,680
Really, what a beautiful day.

1930
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,180
It really is autumn.

1931
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,280
I think they'll really like it.

1932
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,950
(Impressed)

1933
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,580
- Welcome.
- What is this?

1934
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:41,580
This is awesome!

1935
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,680
(A strong autumn vibe)

1936
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,550
Dessert!

1937
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,590
- Oh, dessert!
- Let's sit here.

1938
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:47,690
Look at that.

1939
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,820
- What's this?
- What is this?

1940
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,330
Oh, you guys sure do like this.

1941
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:52,890
- Totally!
- You sure do like it.

1942
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:55,800
So, for our Fall Literary Society,

1943
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,030
our final location is
the Fall Literary Society Meeting...

1944
00:59:58,030 --> 00:59:59,830
to boost our inspiration.

1945
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:01,970
Roasted sweet potatoes.

1946
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,110
- What's this?
- I love figs so much.

1947
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,510
I love them even more.

1948
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,410
I really like them.

1949
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,410
- I like figs.
- Let's go.

1950
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,950
Hey, Food Fighter is back.

1951
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:14,850
- By the way, earlier,
- Yes?

1952
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:18,190
there was one person who judged us
when he was not even good himself.

1953
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:20,520
- Who's that?
- There's someone in a beret.

1954
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:24,130
You know,
he gets really nervous himself,

1955
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,160
- but he judged me harshly.
- Well, but...

1956
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,190
I wanted to see his skills.

1957
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:27,260
Yes, I want to see it too.

1958
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,130
But with hairtail,
don't you think you did so badly?

1959
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,470
Let's hear an acrostic poem
with hairtail.

1960
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:32,770
- Yes.
- H.

1961
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,100
However I may go...

1962
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,140
T.

1963
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,770
Ta! I will spit before I go.

1964
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:39,470
Go home.

1965
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:41,780
Thank you.

1966
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:44,980
I'm so relieved that you set
the baseline for us.

1967
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,210
Go home.

1968
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,450
- Wasn't that all right?
- It was.

1969
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:48,820
- What did you say?
- Jae Seok, it was okay.

1970
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:49,850
- It was okay, but...
- What did you say?

1971
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,750
Hey,
this little minion from Antenna.

1972
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,920
- You lacked confidence, though.
- Hey.

1973
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:55,160
I lacked confidence.

1974
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,160
Hey, you brown noser.

1975
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,790
He's a total brown noser.

1976
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,430
- Mister, can you do hairtail?
- Hairtail?

1977
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:03,030
- Yes.
- "Spit before I go."

1978
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:04,070
H.

1979
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:07,900
Haven't come to my end yet.

1980
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,300
- Oh, that's sad.
- Oh, my.

1981
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,310
T.

1982
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,940
Tossing aside? Don't do it.

1983
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,740
That's so sad.

1984
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:16,940
- No.
- Saying that in this outfit...

1985
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,110
Saying that in this outfit
is really sad.

1986
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,620
- Director, don't get the leaves...
- But this was...

1987
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,650
in the same frame as him.

1988
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:24,890
But this was too much
on my part, wasn't it?

1989
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:27,660
- I went overboard, right?
- "Haven't come to my end yet."

1990
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,690
- Why do you feel bad for me, punk?
- No, I...

1991
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,730
What, then?
Have you come to your end?

1992
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:32,960
No.

1993
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,760
- Not yet.
- He just gets angry first.

1994
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,360
He gets angry whenever I talk.

1995
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,730
- Well, I...
- "Haven't come to..."

1996
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,400
- Or...
- Yes?

1997
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,040
Is there a poem that you like?

1998
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:42,800
Since it's autumn.

1999
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,740
I'm sure everyone has
a poem memorized.

2000
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,640
- Do you have one?
- Can I read it out loud?

2001
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,110
- What?
- There's one...

2002
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,810
- Read it?
- Do you have a poem you like?

2003
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:51,350
- I have exactly one.
- Okay, good.

2004
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:52,550
You should memorize it.

2005
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,950
- Mr. Na Tae Ju's...
- Mr. Na Tae Ju's...

2006
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:56,150
- poem called "Happiness."
- "Happiness" is nice.

2007
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:58,590
- When I heard this, I was so...
- Let's do stuff like this.

2008
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,120
It really resonated with me.

2009
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,320
(With an intuitive introduction,
he begins reciting the poem.)

2010
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,860
Let's hear it. "Happiness."
What is it?

2011
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,290
- "Happiness," by Na Tae Ju.
- Yes.

2012
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:09,200
"Having a home to return to
in the evening."

2013
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:13,400
"Having someone to think of
when you're having a hard time."

2014
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,110
"Having a song that you can sing alone
when you're lonely."

2015
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:18,670
This is it.
What's that?

2016
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,410
- Just sit down.
- It's Mr. Na Tae Ju's...

2017
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:23,810
- I'm sorry, Mr. Na.
- "Happiness."

2018
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:26,410
It's poet Na Tae Ju's
most famous poem...

2019
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,020
- called "Happiness."
- Mister.

2020
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,550
- Gosh, I...
- Yes, "Happiness."

2021
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:31,290
- It's Mr. Na Tae Ju's...
- What do you mean, what is it?

2022
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,390
- That's not what I meant. Mr. Na.
- It's Mr. Na Tae Ju's poem.

2023
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,290
He didn't recite it very well.

2024
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:36,390
- Mr. Na.
- It's Mr. Na Tae Ju's poem.

2025
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:38,130
- Why? Wasn't it nice?
- He didn't recite it very well.

2026
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,590
This situation is so funny.

2027
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:42,030
- You shouldn't recite that.
- How dare you?

2028
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,030
Why not?

2029
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,430
I mean...

2030
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:46,700
You talk a lot like poetry too.

2031
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,600
"Will you eat that?"

2032
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,170
"Will you eat that?"

2033
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,710
"Will you sit there?"

2034
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,840
"Will you please bring me that?"

2035
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,050
"Yu Jae Seok, why did you do that?"

2036
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,320
"I will beat you up someday."

2037
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,250
(Satisfied)

2038
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:08,460
I think it would be nice to hear
a poem in Byoung Cheol's voice.

2039
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:09,660
Byoung Cheol, do you have a poem?

2040
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,490
- He has great diction.
- I think he has one memorized.

2041
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,830
- Gosh, I don't have one memorized.
- From your lines, maybe.

2042
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:16,760
- I don't have any memorized.
- Or a line that stayed with you.

2043
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,670
From "The Favor,"

2044
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,840
- there is...
- A line from "The Favor?"

2045
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,040
- a phrase.
- Yes.

2046
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,140
My goodness.

2047
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:24,440
A line?

2048
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:28,140
"Your desperate want
will come true."

2049
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:31,910
"Your desperate want
will come true."

2050
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,480
- That's too...
- Isn't that...

2051
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,650
just a fact?

2052
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:37,350
- That wasn't special at all.
- Hey, Ji Ye Eun.

2053
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:39,650
- Did you see Ye Eun? Hey.
- Hang on. Ji Ye Eun.

2054
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,560
- Hey. "Just a fact?
- I mean, still, how could you...

2055
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,290
- totally belittle Byoung Cheol?
- Right? She was so frigid.

2056
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:44,430
It was like you scoffed at him.

2057
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,590
- "Isn't that just a fact?"
- Goodness, Ye Eun. "Just a fact."

2058
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:49,300
- "Just a fact." Well, it's...
- "Your desperate want..."

2059
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,900
"Your desperate want
will come true."

2060
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:51,930
But this was...

2061
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:53,370
- Ye Eun, don't you have one?
- Yes?

2062
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:54,800
Maybe like a nice saying
or something?

2063
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,070
I liked this saying.

2064
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:58,040
"Don't step on the briquette ashes."

2065
01:03:58,110 --> 01:03:59,410
- It's "Don't kick."
- "Don't kick."

2066
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:00,680
(It's "Don't kick.")

2067
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,780
Hey, you were pretty close.

2068
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:03,980
You got it right.

2069
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,050
- Hey.
- You almost had it.

2070
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,080
You got it right.

2071
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,220
"Have you burned so brightly..."

2072
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,220
- "for someone?"
- "For someone."
That was the quote, right?

2073
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,820
I see that she reads books.

2074
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,690
Now, it's MIYEON's turn.

2075
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:15,490
- MIYEON.
- As for me...

2076
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:16,520
(As for me...)

2077
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,730
(Well...)

2078
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:18,930
Is there anything you can think of?

2079
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:22,530
"Queencard."

2080
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:26,130
("Queencard")

2081
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,400
"I'm hot."

2082
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,570
"My boob and booty is hot."

2083
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,710
"I'm a star, star, star."

2084
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:34,410
- She's good.
- "Look at me."

2085
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:37,780
"I'm twerking on the runway."

2086
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:38,810
(She competes with her brazenness.)

2087
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:39,980
It's true.

2088
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,220
- She's a star.
- She's good.

2089
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:43,820
The lyrics sound nice
when she recites them quietly.

2090
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:46,690
The lyrics are nice as they are.

2091
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:49,720
For a chance to exchange
the cards one last time,

2092
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,590
- we'll have a mission.
- We need to win in this mission.

2093
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,430
- It'll be bad if we fail to win.
- We need to win in this mission.

2094
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:56,100
The mission is called
the Relay Artists.

2095
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,800
Two teams will come together...

2096
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,640
to have 4 members
make 1 drawing in a relay.

2097
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,800
The mission will be a success
if you guess the answer correctly.

2098
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,870
Only the first player...

2099
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:08,040
- will see the keyword.
- Really?

2100
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,410
The next players...

2101
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:11,180
will need to see
the previous player's work,

2102
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,650
guess the keyword,

2103
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:14,680
- and add to the drawing.
- It'll be hard.

2104
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:17,250
The 1st player will have
ten seconds.

2105
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:20,590
- The others will have five seconds.
- Five seconds each.

2106
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,990
The team that gets
more answers right will win.

2107
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:25,930
We decided on the alliances.

2108
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:27,030
- Why?
- Why?

2109
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:29,530
- We considered the drawing skills.
- Okay. That works.

2110
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:31,330
- We want Jong Kook.
- Team Jae Seok and Team Jong Kook.

2111
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:32,500
That's right.

2112
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,100
- No!
- All right.

2113
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,800
- Why?
- And Team Seok Jin...

2114
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,470
- and Team Haha are an alliance.
- Hey.

2115
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:38,740
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2116
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:40,370
- Let's go.
- We need to do well, okay?

2117
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:41,510
We need to win.

2118
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:42,810
All right.

2119
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,780
Seriously, I won't make this funny.

2120
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,420
- Come on. Make it funny.
- No.

2121
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,720
- Make it funny at the very least.
- Seriously. No.

2122
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,290
SUNMI, that's a good idea.

2123
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:52,520
Do that at the very least.

2124
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,590
Seriously.

2125
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:54,820
- Okay. We'll see if it's funny.
- Get ready.

2126
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,860
- I got a proper upgrade.
- Really?

2127
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,560
(Keyword: Circus)

2128
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,600
(10 seconds begin.)

2129
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,860
- It's easy.
- It's doable.

2130
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,730
It's easy.

2131
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:07,100
(Oh, my!)

2132
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,100
- He did a good job.
- It's easy.

2133
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,200
- It's doable.
- It's easy.

2134
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,710
(Keyword: Circus)

2135
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:15,310
(He draws the circus tent.)

2136
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:16,910
(Keyword: Circus)

2137
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:19,910
(Daniel's 10 seconds are up.)

2138
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:21,420
Next player, come on out.

2139
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:22,750
I'm nervous.

2140
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:23,920
- It's easy.
- Get ready.

2141
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,920
(Will she realize
that it's a circus?)

2142
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:28,890
Gosh, it's...

2143
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:31,030
Is that it?
I think I know what it is.

2144
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:32,590
I think I know what it is.

2145
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,800
(She adds the sunny weather.)

2146
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,900
- What's up with that sun?
- Why did she draw that?

2147
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,840
The first player
needs to draw everything.

2148
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:44,340
- It needs to be recognizable.
- The next player can come out.

2149
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,210
- I think I know what it is.
- Right?

2150
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:49,280
- Get ready.
- We'll get it right.

2151
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,410
- I definitely know what it is.
- That drawing...

2152
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:53,710
I definitely know what it is.

2153
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,180
That drawing...

2154
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,650
- Don't touch it.
- Okay.

2155
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:57,850
I definitely know what it is.

2156
01:06:57,850 --> 01:06:59,220
- The first player...
- What?

2157
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,490
(He adds a strange face.)

2158
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:02,860
- That's...
- Seok Jin.

2159
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,390
- Don't touch it.
- Can't I guess the answer?

2160
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:06,560
- Don't touch it.
- I definitely know what it is.

2161
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:07,860
All right.

2162
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,230
Byoung Cheol,
why are your hands so cold?

2163
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:12,430
Byoung Cheol, this is just a game.

2164
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:13,870
No!

2165
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:15,400
- This isn't a game!
- This isn't "Squid Game."

2166
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,600
This isn't a game!

2167
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,510
You die if you get it wrong.

2168
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:20,710
(Byoung Cheol's resolution is
on another level.)

2169
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:23,110
- Last player, come on out.
- Shall I come out?

2170
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:26,280
(Will he be able
to continue drawing a circus?)

2171
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,850
- I would've gotten it right.
- Get ready.

2172
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,280
(He checks the drawing.)

2173
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:33,750
- Hurry up and draw.
- Draw.

2174
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:34,860
Don't marvel at the drawing.

2175
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:36,120
You need to draw.

2176
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,060
- Draw something.
- Put a dot.

2177
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,460
(He adds a ball.)

2178
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,460
- Now,
- Okay.

2179
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:43,360
- come out and guess the answer.
- Let's go.

2180
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,030
I can guess the answer.
I have the answer.

2181
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:48,670
- It's so easy.
- Right?

2182
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:50,870
(Will he be able to get
the correct answer?)

2183
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:51,970
Circus.

2184
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:52,970
(Answer: Circus)

2185
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:56,640
(Circus is correct.)

2186
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,850
Nice!

2187
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:59,110
(Nice!)

2188
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:02,780
(Team Seok Jin Alliance succeeds in
the mission on the first try!)

2189
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:04,050
It's okay.

2190
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,290
We have a chance too.

2191
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:06,550
- It was easy.
- We need to get it right.

2192
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:07,690
- It was easy.
- We have a chance too.

2193
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:09,660
- It was too easy.
- We have a chance too.

2194
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,190
- Let's go.
- Nice.

2195
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:14,230
- Nice.
- Well done.

2196
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:16,100
- That was incredible.
- You drew very well.

2197
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,300
- I had positive thoughts.
- You drew very well.

2198
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,700
(Daniel started the drawing well.)

2199
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,900
- Well done.
- I didn't want to ruin it.

2200
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:22,940
- Right?
- Seriously.

2201
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,270
- Get ready.
- You shouldn't ruin the original.

2202
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,570
Daniel.

2203
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:26,570
(Keyword: Wedding)

2204
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:27,640
He's competitive.

2205
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,710
(Keyword: Wedding)

2206
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:31,510
It's easy.

2207
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:32,810
That's...

2208
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:34,220
(Wedding veil)

2209
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:35,850
(Bow tie)

2210
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:36,880
That's...

2211
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,020
Jong Kook's hands are very fast.

2212
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,690
- I got it.
- That's...

2213
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:42,090
(He drew the groom and bride
in 10 seconds.)

2214
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:43,220
I got it.

2215
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,590
- I got it.
- May I enter?

2216
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:45,690
Please come on out.

2217
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:46,760
It's easy.

2218
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:48,700
It's easy. You shouldn't touch it.

2219
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,400
It's easy. You shouldn't touch it.

2220
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:53,430
- It's easy.
- I see.

2221
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,640
(SUNMI figures out the answer.)

2222
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,740
You need to draw.

2223
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,510
Draw a lot.

2224
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:01,710
That's good. Okay.

2225
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:03,580
(Adding details makes it look
more like a wedding.)

2226
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:05,150
There you go. It's easy.

2227
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:06,280
Please come on out.

2228
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,350
It's Se Chan.

2229
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,620
- He has lousy drawing skills.
- It's easy.

2230
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,690
- Se Chan, we're in your care.
- Don't do anything.

2231
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:14,960
You need to draw.

2232
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,290
- Don't touch it!
- You need to draw.

2233
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:17,960
- Don't touch it!
- Don't touch it!

2234
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,390
I see.

2235
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:20,630
Don't touch it!

2236
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:22,530
That's good.

2237
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:23,730
- There you go.
- Was that what you added?

2238
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:25,000
(He drew the groom he saw recently.)

2239
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,130
There you go.

2240
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,200
There you go. Well done.

2241
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,910
- They might get it wrong.
- We'll get one right.

2242
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:32,110
Next player, please come on out.

2243
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:33,210
- We'll get it right.
- Please come on out.

2244
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,610
(The last player is MIYEON,
the one who can draw well.)

2245
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:36,210
MIYEON is...

2246
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:37,310
Don't ruin it.

2247
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:38,650
- She'll know what it is.
- Yes.

2248
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,550
- You need to draw.
- Draw.

2249
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:43,020
- Draw.
- How do you not know what it is?

2250
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:45,250
Three, two, one.

2251
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:47,090
(She just adds a line.)

2252
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:49,360
- There you go.
- That's it. Well done.

2253
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,660
- Jae Seok...
- Don't you know what it is?

2254
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,760
- No.
- What?

2255
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,830
- Jae Seok.
- Jae Seok, it's so easy.

2256
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:55,360
- Let's go.
- You'll recognize it right away.

2257
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,560
Right away.

2258
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,800
Gosh, this is...

2259
01:09:58,270 --> 01:09:59,400
Right away.

2260
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,570
Gosh, this is...

2261
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:01,940
(The wedding drawing has
all the necessary components.)

2262
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,100
That's right.

2263
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:05,240
(Will Jae Seok recognize it
as a wedding?)

2264
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,470
- That's right.
- That's it.

2265
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:09,110
- Wedding venue.
- Wedding venue?

2266
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:10,110
No, Jae Seok.

2267
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:11,650
(Incorrect)

2268
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:13,550
(Wedding venue is incorrect.)

2269
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:14,780
No, Jae Seok.

2270
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,550
(For goodness' sake)

2271
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:20,090
(How could you call it
a wedding venue?)

2272
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,920
(He got it wrong!)

2273
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,530
(Screaming)

2274
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:25,630
Marriage?

2275
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:26,930
(Marriage?)

2276
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:28,330
- What's this?
- You should've thought about it.

2277
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:29,330
- What's this?
- Wedding.

2278
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:31,530
- We'll win this.
- We'll win this.

2279
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:32,530
(Jae Seok ruined it.)

2280
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:34,470
You know, it's a very nice drawing.

2281
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:35,940
It's a very nice drawing.

2282
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:37,610
I had no idea.

2283
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:38,710
- Wedding?
- Without it...

2284
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:39,810
(Team Seok Jin Alliance's
Byoung Cheol goes first.)

2285
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:41,510
- Get ready.
- Good luck.

2286
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:43,340
You can do it.

2287
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,610
There you go. You're good.

2288
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,180
You're good.

2289
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,520
What? She says that he's good.

2290
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:50,320
Put down the marker.

2291
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,420
(He draws a horse only.)

2292
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,560
"Speed Up Losers."

2293
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,590
(Incorrect)

2294
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,090
Let's begin the countdown.

2295
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:59,190
Korean chicken?

2296
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:00,230
(Incorrect)

2297
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:01,460
- It's hard.
- Let's begin the countdown again.

2298
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,700
A game of go.

2299
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,400
- It can't be that easy.
- Seok Jin.

2300
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,500
- It's Lee Se Dol.
- Lee Se Dol.

2301
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,770
Is the answer Lee Se Dol?

2302
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:09,070
I was like, "It can't be that easy."

2303
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,700
Get ready.

2304
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,310
(Team Jae Seok Alliance goes next.)

2305
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:18,880
(Keyword: Park Se Ri)

2306
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,950
(She draws golf first.)

2307
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:22,150
That's good, SUNMI.

2308
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,750
That's good, SUNMI.

2309
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,290
(She wraps up by drawing a woman.)

2310
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:26,290
- She's good.
- She's good.

2311
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:27,860
- He'd know.
- I figured it out.

2312
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:29,760
I figured it out right away.

2313
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,190
Park Se Ri?

2314
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:32,630
- Yes!
- Yes!

2315
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:33,730
Park Se Ri?

2316
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:36,330
(Team Jae Seok Alliance
catches up with a tie.)

2317
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:37,670
- I did well, right?
- You did well.

2318
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:38,730
How did he get it right?

2319
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:40,030
It was a hard one.

2320
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:41,870
Good luck.

2321
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:43,570
(Then came the next question.)

2322
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:44,740
(Keyword: Zoo)

2323
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:46,170
This one is a bit easy.

2324
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:47,840
(The self-proclaimed
talented artist was confident.)

2325
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,910
(Keyword: Zoo)

2326
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:52,850
(What is she doing?)

2327
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:56,080
(Crying)

2328
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,550
What's this?

2329
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:59,650
- She didn't add much.
- They might get it right.

2330
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:01,760
- Halloween.
- Halloween?

2331
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,160
- Is it incorrect?
- What is it?

2332
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,660
The answer is a zoo.

2333
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:05,930
This drawing?

2334
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:07,230
Don't have any funny thoughts.

2335
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:08,700
It's easy. Just say it.

2336
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:09,730
- Three,
- Three...

2337
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:11,200
- two, one.
- It's easy.

2338
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,430
- What's the answer?
- What's the answer?

2339
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:13,870
- Summer Games?
- Yes!

2340
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:15,470
(Answer: "Heungboo and Nolboo"
Incorrect)

2341
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:17,770
(Jae Seok fails again.)

2342
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:19,240
It's a gourd.

2343
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,240
- They're opening a gourd.
- "Heungboo and Nolboo."

2344
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:23,380
(They blow a chance
to come from behind and win.)

2345
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,410
Since the current score is a tie,

2346
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:27,950
you'll play rock-paper-scissors
to determine the winner.

2347
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:29,580
(The final rock-paper-scissors)

2348
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:34,050
- I can't believe it.
- It's too hard.

2349
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:35,720
- No way.
- Let's have a group game.

2350
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,360
We'll play rock-paper-scissors
in the end.

2351
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:39,930
- What will we do if we lose?
- We tried so hard.

2352
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:41,300
We tried so hard.

2353
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,060
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2354
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,060
- Five...
- A group game.

2355
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,070
Let's have a group game...

2356
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,170
- with five members.
- A group game.

2357
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:47,870
- One at a time?
- You need to beat everyone.

2358
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:49,100
- Then how...
- Someone can go again.

2359
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,500
- One of us can go again.
- Yes.

2360
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,940
- Six members will play, right?
- Yes. Six members.

2361
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,610
- One of you can go twice.
- Okay.

2362
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,210
- Daniel, go first.
- Okay.

2363
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,440
Ji Hyo, go fourth.

2364
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:59,050
- Should I move to the back?
- You should beat everyone.

2365
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:00,650
- Good.
- All right.

2366
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:01,680
(The unlucky member,
Daniel, goes first.)

2367
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,150
I'm a weak member, so I'll go first.

2368
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:04,590
- Okay.
- I'm the worst at it.

2369
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,720
Jae Seok, it's all about
seizing control.

2370
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:08,360
Overwhelm your opponent.

2371
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,460
- It's all about seizing control.
- Yes.

2372
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:10,620
SUNMI, I'll seize control.

2373
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:11,960
- Go.
- Good.

2374
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,390
(The two weak members
have a war of nerves!)

2375
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,230
(It's the weak versus the weak.
What will be the result?)

2376
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:16,560
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2377
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:21,400
(Faulty wins.)

2378
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,870
Daniel, go again.

2379
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:23,970
- He's good.
- Beat everyone.

2380
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:26,110
- Daniel.
- Let's have the perfect win.

2381
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,280
- Daniel is lucky today.
- Let's go.

2382
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,280
You're lucky today.
We got the circus right...

2383
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,010
- thanks to your drawing.
- The ace is back.

2384
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,410
(Meanwhile,
Jae Seok got nervous as always.)

2385
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,220
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

2386
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,350
- Only one person lost.
- Daniel.

2387
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:39,950
- Don't be disheartened.
- We still have a chance.

2388
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:41,390
- Only one person lost.
- We still have a chance.

2389
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:43,360
(The next player,
Se Chan, will turn the tables.)

2390
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,660
Se Chan, let's go.

2391
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:47,030
Daniel, you have it today.

2392
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:49,300
- You're doing well today, Daniel.
- This round is important.

2393
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,600
- Daniel.
- It's very important.

2394
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,430
- Rock-paper...
- Rock-paper...

2395
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,700
- Rock-paper... Scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2396
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,110
(Se Chan sets his own pace
and wins.)

2397
01:13:58,110 --> 01:13:59,140
- Okay!
- Okay!

2398
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:00,940
- There you go.
- Se Chan doesn't disappoint.

2399
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:02,480
- You're good.
- We're back to square one.

2400
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,180
- Se Chan doesn't disappoint.
- My heart is pounding.

2401
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,950
- Okay.
- Okay. There you go.

2402
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:09,350
(The lucky member, Ji Hyo,
goes earlier than expected.)

2403
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:12,220
Ji Hyo, show us.

2404
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:13,550
Please.

2405
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:16,260
- Se Chan can keep on winning.
- If you win in this round,

2406
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,720
- you'll take 1st or 2nd place.
- Yes.

2407
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,360
Yell, "Rock-paper-scissors."

2408
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,890
- Let's go.
- All right. Let's begin.

2409
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:22,130
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

2410
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:23,160
Let's begin.

2411
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,400
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

2412
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:25,800
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

2413
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,830
- Okay!
- Yes!

2414
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:27,840
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

2415
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:28,900
- Okay!
- Yes!

2416
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,970
- He's good.
- Let's go.

2417
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:35,010
(He beats the lucky member
and takes the 2nd win.)

2418
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,910
- Seok Jin.
- You can do it.

2419
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:38,780
- Put yourself at ease.
- Let's go.

2420
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:41,080
- It's okay to lose.
- Go.

2421
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,780
- Se Chan, let's go.
- Go.

2422
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,790
- I think you'll win.
- I know.

2423
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:48,020
(The weak member plays dirty
and lands a surprise attack.)

2424
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,160
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

2425
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:53,660
(Being neck-and-neck,
they keep having a tie.)

2426
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,100
(3rd tie)

2427
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,130
(4th tie)

2428
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:58,300
- What?
- Scissors.

2429
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,000
(In the end, Se Chan
takes the 3rd win.)

2430
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,470
- What?
- What?

2431
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:03,370
(Team Jae Seok Alliance,
Team Seok Jin Alliance)

2432
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:04,910
- What?
- How did that happen?

2433
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:06,710
Gosh, that was... Oh, my.

2434
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:11,250
(Se Chan is on fire.
Will he beat everyone?)

2435
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:13,810
- No way.
- That was incredible.

2436
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,150
- Se Chan.
- Se Chan.

2437
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,150
- It's okay.
- I'll go next.

2438
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:19,390
- Se Chan.
- You won't lose.

2439
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,650
- It's okay.
- I'll go next.

2440
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:22,720
- You can do it.
- Ye Eun.

2441
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:23,760
You can do it.

2442
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:26,030
(Ji Se Chan, hurry up!)

2443
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:28,000
(He's the number 1
at teasing the youngest member.)

2444
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,460
Hey, you'll definitely win.
You'll crush her.

2445
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:30,700
- It's all about the spirit.
- You know,

2446
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,370
- it'll be okay even if I lose now.
- You'll crush her.

2447
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:35,540
(Why are the three of them
such an eyesore?)

2448
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:38,010
Ye Eun, it's all about the spirit.

2449
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:39,040
(Will it be the youngest member
with a vendetta, Ye Eun?)

2450
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,770
(Who will be the winner
of the feud?)

2451
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:44,340
(Ye Eun wins.)

2452
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,210
(Ye Eun stops Se Chan
from taking 4 consecutive wins.)

2453
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:47,880
- Ye Eun.
- We can do it!

2454
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,920
- Let's go.
- You have good energy.

2455
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:52,090
You're much prettier.
You're much cooler.

2456
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:53,890
(The well-matched opponents meet.)

2457
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:59,290
(They faced each other
at the match of the brain.)

2458
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:00,860
Renaissance.

2459
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,930
(It ended as Ye Eun's defeat.)

2460
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,930
(Today, they'll compete
with rock-paper-scissors!)

2461
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:08,300
Rock-paper-scissors.

2462
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:09,800
Rock-paper-scissors.

2463
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:12,510
(It's a close match
like the common knowledge quiz.)

2464
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:13,840
Rock-paper-scissors.

2465
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:15,340
(MIYEON wins today as well.)

2466
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:17,980
- MIYEON! Well done.
- Well done.

2467
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:19,580
(Team Jae Seok Alliance,
Team Seok Jin Alliance)

2468
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,010
(Team Seok Jin Alliance
is in crisis once again.)

2469
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:22,150
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

2470
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:23,650
- I'll go first.
- We're nearly done.

2471
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:25,050
- It's game over.
- A bit more.

2472
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:26,120
(The determined
Young Forty goes next.)

2473
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,220
Young Forty.

2474
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:28,820
- Why is she copying him?
- Young Forty, let's win.

2475
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,960
- It's Mr. Bead Pants.
- Mr. Bead Pants is up.

2476
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,330
- Young Forty is totally nervous.
- Hey.

2477
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:33,330
- Let's win.
- Please.

2478
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:34,490
- Mr. Bead Pants.
- He's totally nervous.

2479
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:35,530
Young Forty, let's win.

2480
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:36,530
Rock...

2481
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:37,630
I'll play rock.

2482
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:40,230
- Rock...
- Come closer.

2483
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,670
She won't listen anyway.

2484
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,270
I'll do this too.

2485
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,840
He has a big belly.

2486
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:46,270
- Rock-paper...
- Scissors.

2487
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:48,140
- Hold on. Let's do it again.
- MIYEON won.

2488
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:49,710
- Rock-paper...
- Scissors.

2489
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,980
(Haha played a hand early
in a nervous state.)

2490
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:54,510
- Let's do it again.
- MIYEON won.

2491
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:56,020
- No.
- He played a hand late.

2492
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:57,150
- No.
- Hold on.

2493
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:58,750
- He played a hand late.
- No, that doesn't count.

2494
01:16:58,750 --> 01:16:59,990
- No.
- That doesn't count.

2495
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,620
- No.
- Let's do it again.

2496
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:03,420
(He claims that
MIYEON has played a hand late.)

2497
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,860
- Young Forty plays dirty!
- No.

2498
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:06,930
It was her fault.

2499
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:08,430
- You played a hand late.
- It was, "Rock-paper-scissors."

2500
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:10,030
Had MIYEON lost,
you guys would've complained...

2501
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:11,230
- and asked for a rematch.
- Yes.

2502
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:12,430
- Listen.
- It's only fair.

2503
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:14,940
- Haha played a hand late.
- If Haha wins in a rematch,

2504
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,000
- they'll go again.
- Okay.

2505
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
- That's only right.
- Okay.

2506
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,170
- Okay?
- Play at "Scissors."

2507
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:21,980
Seok Jin is serious.

2508
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,110
It isn't like that.

2509
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:24,750
He's very angry.

2510
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:26,350
Seok Jin is angry for real.

2511
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:28,020
- Why did you lose?
- He's angry for real.

2512
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:30,180
- Why...
- MIYEON, put yourself at ease.

2513
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:31,550
- Okay.
- MIYEON, don't get intimidated.

2514
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:33,020
- We're stronger.
- MIYEON, go.

2515
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,720
- Don't step backward.
- MIYEON, go.

2516
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,460
- Yell, "Rock-paper-scissors."
- Use this hand. It's confusing.

2517
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,430
- I'm left-handed.
- She's left-handed.

2518
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:40,090
- For goodness' sake.
- Can't you use your right hand...

2519
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:41,130
for this round?

2520
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:42,460
Use your right hand for this round.

2521
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:43,500
- Use your right hand.
- Please.

2522
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,600
- That puts me at a disadvantage.
- Use your right hand.

2523
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,000
- I'm left-handed.
- Her right hand is slower.

2524
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,170
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2525
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:49,870
- Go.
- Use your left hand.

2526
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:51,070
- This is nerve-racking.
- MIYEON will win.

2527
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:52,340
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2528
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:53,410
- Okay.
- Wait.

2529
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:55,880
- One more time.
- MIYEON will go one more time.

2530
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,050
It's okay. You didn't lose.
You'll go one more time.

2531
01:17:58,050 --> 01:17:59,450
Why am I going one more time?

2532
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:01,950
- You let him off earlier.
- You let him off earlier.

2533
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:03,120
- I see.
- MIYEON, don't be nervous.

2534
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,090
- This is the real deal.
- Come closer!

2535
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,950
You come closer.

2536
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:08,260
What?

2537
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:10,520
(Are you satisfied?)

2538
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,630
- She has the spirit.
- You come closer.

2539
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,830
- Play at "Scissors."
- Don't get intimidated.

2540
01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:16,430
- That's right. Don't back off.
- Yell, "Rock-paper-scissors."

2541
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:17,500
Don't get intimidated.

2542
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,570
(Shouting)

2543
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:19,830
Don't get intimidated.

2544
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:21,940
- There you go.
- Come on.

2545
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:23,040
(Neither 1 of the 2 chihuahuas
backs down.)

2546
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,100
- MIYEON is good.
- Let's go.

2547
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,110
- That mutt.
- Okay.

2548
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:26,440
(Who will be the winner
of this dogfight?)

2549
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,780
Rock-paper-scissors.

2550
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:30,240
Oh, yes!

2551
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,280
Rock-paper-scissors.

2552
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,810
(Young Forty Ha wins.)

2553
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:33,950
Young Forty.

2554
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:36,780
- Well done.
- Okay.

2555
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:38,290
(After he barely wins)

2556
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:39,450
- Go.
- Yell, "Rock-paper-scissors."

2557
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:40,490
SUNMI, it's all about the spirit.

2558
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:42,520
- SUNMI, say it yourself.
- This team has three members left.

2559
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,620
- Three.
- This team has two members left.

2560
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:45,290
- SUNMI, it's all about the spirit.
- Go.

2561
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:47,330
- All right.
- I'll play rock.

2562
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:49,230
- Play paper to win.
- Okay.

2563
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,530
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

2564
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,700
(Haha takes 2 consecutive wins.)

2565
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:56,200
(Haha creates a tie
with 2 consecutive wins.)

2566
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,840
- Jong Kook, go.
- It's a tie now.

2567
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,670
- Jong Kook, let's go.
- Good.

2568
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:01,810
Let's go. You just need to win
two more times.

2569
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:04,480
You aren't Jong Kook's inferior.

2570
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,510
- Okay.
- You aren't Jong Kook's inferior.

2571
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:07,910
- Hey.
- Yes?

2572
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,150
- I'm good at fighting.
- I know that.

2573
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:11,920
(From the moment he met Jong Kook,)

2574
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:15,790
(he got treated as an inferior.)

2575
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,430
(Jong Kook gets stronger
with each day.)

2576
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:21,290
(Haha will beat him
in rock-paper-scissors.)

2577
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:23,660
- Haha, don't get intimidated.
- You can do it.

2578
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:24,800
- Why would I get intimidated?
- Let's win.

2579
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,970
- If you win this time...
- It isn't a fight.

2580
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,300
- Hey.
- He's intimidated.

2581
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,540
- Jong Kook.
- All along, you've been...

2582
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:31,400
- Jong Kook, you'll win.
- Okay.

2583
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,640
- You can do it.
- Go.

2584
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,610
- Go.
- If you win this time,

2585
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:35,840
- it'll be a perfect win.
- Yes.

2586
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,240
- It's 2 to 2.
- Let's do well.

2587
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,280
- Let's go.
- He's like a fly.

2588
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,050
- There's one more player.
- Mr. Bead Pants.

2589
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:41,110
Don't worry and win.

2590
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:42,450
Good luck.

2591
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:44,520
You're cool.
Are you Jong Kook's inferior?

2592
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,890
- Are you?
- Play...

2593
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:48,560
Play or lose,

2594
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,720
- rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

2595
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,830
(The little one wins.)

2596
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:59,270
(The short Haha
comes from behind and wins.)

2597
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:02,040
Idols, come on out.

2598
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,700
- Idols, come on out.
- This is my power.

2599
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,510
- No way. This makes no sense.
- Ji Hyo.

2600
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:09,110
- Ji Hyo, I'm nervous.
- This makes no sense.

2601
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:10,780
- Haha, seriously.
- This is incredible.

2602
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:11,950
Hold on.

2603
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,680
- Who is the representative?
- The representative.

2604
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,680
The representative.

2605
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,480
- Se Chan.
- Is it Se Chan?

2606
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:19,290
(In Team Jae Seok Alliance,
1 member will play 2 times.)

2607
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:20,720
- Shall I go?
- Yes.

2608
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,920
You should wrap it up.

2609
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,290
- Go.
- You should wrap it up.

2610
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:27,560
(Team Jae Seok Alliance,
Team Seok Jin Alliance)

2611
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:30,230
(It's up to Se Chan, the player
who had 3 consecutive wins.)

2612
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:31,400
Because of the sunglasses...

2613
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,830
- He should take off the sunglasses.
- Because of the sunglasses...

2614
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:36,700
We have one more player.

2615
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,510
Yes, we have one more player.
It's okay. Put yourself at ease.

2616
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:39,570
- Okay.
- Put them on.

2617
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:40,740
- Hey.
- That's...

2618
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:42,080
He has sunglasses.

2619
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,950
My eyes shouldn't shift.

2620
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:46,880
That's good.

2621
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,780
- When you play...
- Hey, those are so unstylish.

2622
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:51,850
(If Se Chan loses,
Team Jae Seok Alliance will lose.)

2623
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:53,820
Finish him off.

2624
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,660
(The two blowflies fight
for the benefit.)

2625
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,090
- Play...
- Play...

2626
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:00,990
- Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors!
- Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors!

2627
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,530
Okay!

2628
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:03,530
Scissors! Okay!

2629
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:04,900
(Se Chan survives.)

2630
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:07,200
We're set.

2631
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,570
- You're good.
- The last match.

2632
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:09,900
- The sunglasses helped.
- This is a good picture.

2633
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:10,940
The last match.

2634
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:11,940
(One player from each team remains!)

2635
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:13,440
- They're a strong team.
- Byoung Cheol.

2636
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,180
- Relax.
- Let's go.

2637
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,410
Seriously.

2638
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:19,080
- You can be a savior.
- Hold on.

2639
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,280
(Savior Byoung Cheol)

2640
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,650
- You can be a savior.
- He looks like Uncle Sam.

2641
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:25,490
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2642
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:28,020
"Your desperate want
will come true."

2643
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,860
Don't worry. You're on fire.

2644
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:31,120
- You're on fire. Go.
- You're really cool.

2645
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,190
- Go.
- You got this.

2646
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:34,490
(The team that wins this round
will win the mission.)

2647
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:36,230
All right. Our savior.

2648
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,630
- Do it in one go.
- He can be a real savior.

2649
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:38,630
Please.

2650
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:41,030
- Do it in one go.
- He can be a real savior...

2651
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:42,300
- if he wins.
- Please win.

2652
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,600
- Please.
- Savior.

2653
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:48,480
Play or lose,

2654
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,510
- rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2655
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:55,680
(Se Chan wins.)

2656
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,780
I won!

2657
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,520
Team Jae Seok
and Team Jong Kook won.

2658
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,950
We won!

2659
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:02,390
(Team Jae Seok
and Team Jong Kook win.)

2660
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:05,360
- We did it.
- With rock-paper-scissors...

2661
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:07,830
It was so much fun.

2662
01:22:08,230 --> 01:22:09,830
- We did it.
- We did it.

2663
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:12,000
(The best rock-paper-scissors match
with many twists and turns)

2664
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,070
We did it.

2665
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:14,430
It's okay.

2666
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,670
(Sighing)

2667
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:18,270
- It was the most fun match...
- It was so much fun.

2668
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:19,510
(They're out of energy
as if it were an international match.)

2669
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:20,540
It was the most fun match...

2670
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:22,080
- We did it.
- It's okay.

2671
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:23,240
We did it.

2672
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:24,680
It was much better than drawing.

2673
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,610
- It was great. My throat is hoarse.
- It was great.

2674
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:27,750
I didn't know
rock-paper-scissors was so much fun.

2675
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,420
- It was so much fun.
- It was great.

2676
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:32,090
This is the last exchange, right?

2677
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:34,520
First place can check three cards...

2678
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,560
That's right.

2679
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,990
- and exchange two cards.
- Okay.

2680
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:41,760
Second place can check 1 card
and exchange 2 cards.

2681
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:44,900
Third place can exchange 1 card
without checking any cards.

2682
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:45,900
The fourth place
doesn't get anything.

2683
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,970
- Let's not fight. We'll be third.
- We'll take third place.

2684
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:49,200
- Sorry.
- We did well.

2685
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,540
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Do that.

2686
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,240
Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors.

2687
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,240
- Okay.
- Okay.

2688
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,380
- Third.
- Goodness.

2689
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:56,740
- What are we going to do?
- Three!

2690
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,880
On three.

2691
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,150
- Reveal it.
- One.

2692
01:22:59,150 --> 01:23:00,150
- One.
- One.

2693
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:01,750
- Two, three.
- Three.

2694
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:04,250
Goodness!

2695
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:05,750
Goodness.

2696
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,250
- Jong Kook's team is really...
- What's that?

2697
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:08,820
- Well done.
- It can't be helped.

2698
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:10,720
- What are we going to do?
- It can't be helped.

2699
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,190
- Seok Jin.
- It's still doable.

2700
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:13,930
- It's amazing.
- It's a brain game.

2701
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:15,660
How unlucky.

2702
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:17,930
There were no matches
for the ttaeng.

2703
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:19,230
There are no matches.

2704
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:20,700
How many can we check?

2705
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,900
- Three.
- Three.

2706
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:25,610
You won first place earlier.

2707
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,710
It wasn't us. It was them.

2708
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,340
- You didn't know?
- I see.

2709
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:29,680
We have no choice.

2710
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,280
- We have to check the cards...
- Yes.

2711
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,950
- of the team that won...
- Go ahead.

2712
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:34,780
- the previous round.
- Then come forward...

2713
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:36,450
- Okay.
- and check.

2714
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:37,820
You can show this team...

2715
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:39,620
- your cards.
- Ours?

2716
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:41,250
- We'll show you.
- You'll show us...

2717
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,790
Could you turn around?

2718
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:44,420
You can show us three cards.

2719
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:46,060
- Take a look.
- Our...

2720
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:50,360
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

2721
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,770
What are you going to do?

2722
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:53,530
- But this...
- These two cards.

2723
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:56,540
If you take these,
it would be your loss.

2724
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:58,870
- I know. We're also calculating.
- Yes.

2725
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:01,710
But still, we can't leave these
like this.

2726
01:24:01,710 --> 01:24:04,740
- Isn't that right? We can't.
- Right.

2727
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,910
Since we took a look,
we'll decide...

2728
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,520
- Right.
- what we'll pick.

2729
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,980
- Then...
- Yes?

2730
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:12,550
We should discuss.

2731
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:14,090
- We have this, right?
- Yes.

2732
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:15,260
We have this.

2733
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,890
- We can see everything.
- We have this.

2734
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:19,430
- Then...
- Let's change it.

2735
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:22,260
This with this and this. Then...

2736
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:24,400
- We should go for it.
- Right.

2737
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,400
Other teams...

2738
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,970
(Going for the jangttaeng!)

2739
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:28,570
Okay, first...

2740
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:31,540
- We...
- We have to pick from this team.

2741
01:24:32,010 --> 01:24:33,870
- They'll pick from here?
- Yes. We can do it.

2742
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:35,340
- Cover it.
- It's going to be okay, right?

2743
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:36,380
- We can do it.
- Can we see it?

2744
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:38,910
- It's going to be okay, right?
- It's going to be fine.

2745
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:40,010
- This and this?
- Here.

2746
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:41,280
- They're here.
- You held them upside down.

2747
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,980
- Yes.
- Good.

2748
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:44,820
Doesn't it show on the lens?

2749
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,020
Stay still.

2750
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:47,150
- Pick them.
- Okay.

2751
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:48,690
Pick them and take them
without showing them.

2752
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:51,190
- Why did you put these two close?
- I...

2753
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:53,160
I don't know. I really don't know.

2754
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,290
These two are together.

2755
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:56,300
- I swear I don't know.
- These two are together.

2756
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,360
I don't know.

2757
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,200
This is alone,
and these two are together.

2758
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,630
Is that right?
Should I move them like this?

2759
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:03,340
- I don't know.
- You put them like this.

2760
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,240
- Why did you hold them like that?
- He doesn't know.

2761
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:06,240
- I really don't know.
- You held them like this.
- You don't know?
- I really don't.

2762
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,610
- He really doesn't know.
- He's holding the two together.

2763
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:09,940
I... Take them.

2764
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,180
- Should I take them?
- Yes.

2765
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:12,950
- You don't know what they are?
- I really don't.

2766
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:14,280
- You don't know?
- I really don't know.

2767
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,820
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

2768
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:17,550
- I really don't know.
- Hold on.

2769
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:18,650
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

2770
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:19,790
- I don't know.
- Really?

2771
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:20,790
(He succeeded in getting
the jangttaeng.)

2772
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:22,060
- They can see from the back.
- You don't know?

2773
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:23,260
I really don't know.

2774
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:24,790
You have to give them two cards.

2775
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:26,430
- Two of our cards?
- Will you take those?

2776
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:28,730
- Yes.
- You should give it some thought.

2777
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:30,560
- Why?
- Why? This...

2778
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,130
- Did you know?
- It doesn't matter.

2779
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:33,900
- Whichever is fine. Okay.
- I didn't know.

2780
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:37,040
Did we choose well?

2781
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:39,410
- Jangttaeng.
- Really?

2782
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,110
- Does this match?
- It doesn't match ours.

2783
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:44,980
(Team Jong Kook:
January, Jang, Ttaeng)

2784
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:46,250
(Team Seok Jin:
March, August, May)

2785
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:48,980
If we want to change cards,
we have to get theirs.

2786
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,450
They don't have it. They have it,

2787
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:52,520
- and they don't.
- Right.

2788
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:54,590
- Okay.
- No.

2789
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:56,290
Right now!

2790
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:57,520
(Team Jae Seok handed them
the penalty card earlier.)

2791
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,060
I don't want to lose.

2792
01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:02,400
Could you come here?

2793
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,560
- What?
- It's not there.

2794
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,470
- Come here for a bit.
- Us?

2795
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:06,470
- Yes.
- Again?

2796
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:07,500
You can go back.

2797
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,240
- Okay.
- Sir.

2798
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,140
- Can we check 2 cards?
- We can check 1 card.

2799
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,540
- You can check 1 card.
- We'll exchange 2 cards.

2800
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,010
- You can exchange 2 cards.
- Okay. Then...

2801
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:15,110
- They can exchange 2 cards?
- Yes.

2802
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:16,510
- You can check 1, and exchange 2.
- What about us?

2803
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:17,610
- You can go back.
- Spread them.

2804
01:26:17,610 --> 01:26:18,610
Go back.

2805
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:19,910
I'm sorry, but go over there.

2806
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:21,250
Go back, Mr. Beads and Mr. Apple.

2807
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:23,280
- You should go that side so we...
- Go over there.

2808
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,550
- Go over there.
- Ye Eun.

2809
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:26,250
- Go over there.
- You lost.

2810
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:27,650
- But...
- Get some rest.

2811
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:28,890
- Over there.
- Why are you discriminating?

2812
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:30,560
- Go back.
- You were last.

2813
01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:32,490
- We can take two cards.
- It's over.

2814
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,760
They won't let us.

2815
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:36,430
- MIYEON.
- I'll do it.

2816
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:37,730
- Go ahead.
- Check one.

2817
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:39,500
- Pick one, MIYEON.
- Shall we get this one?

2818
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,770
- Hold on.
- That one? Go ahead.

2819
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:42,700
- Hold on.
- We'll show it to you like this.

2820
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,240
- Look at it.
- They might see it from the back.

2821
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,740
- Put it down.
- It's done.

2822
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:47,440
- They need to be shuffled?
- I'll shuffle them.

2823
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,840
- Shuffle them.
- We'll take two.

2824
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:51,180
We can get those or get a match.

2825
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:52,280
- It doesn't matter.
- Right.

2826
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,610
- It went to their team anyway.
- Right.

2827
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:56,780
- We gave it to Team Haha.
- Right.

2828
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,080
- We can just get a matching pair.
- It's over.

2829
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,020
- Here.
- No. Hold them like this.

2830
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:01,090
- Right.
- Here.

2831
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,360
- We can get two. It's over.
- Like this.

2832
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:03,360
- First...
- Get two cards.

2833
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,360
- First, I'll take this one.
- Okay.

2834
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,790
This one.
It's the middle one, right?

2835
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:08,060
- I'll take this one.
- Take that one.

2836
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,360
We don't know either.

2837
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,660
(He used the first chance on May.)

2838
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:12,830
- We got it.
- We got it.

2839
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:14,230
- We have one more.
- You'll take one more?

2840
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:15,870
- We'll take one more.
- Which one?

2841
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:17,340
- We can take it, right?
- You can.

2842
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:18,740
- You can show them both.
- Go, MIYEON.

2843
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:20,270
- Okay.
- MIYEON can pick.

2844
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,180
- It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter.

2845
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:23,740
(Will she pick March?)

2846
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,910
- Nice.
- Hold on.

2847
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:28,250
(She failed to pick March.)

2848
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,920
- You didn't take it.
- It doesn't match. So...

2849
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,990
- This...
- We can give them this and this.

2850
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:33,750
- You'll give us these?
- Yes.

2851
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,190
- They don't match.
- Are we supposed to have two?

2852
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:36,320
We need to have three.

2853
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:41,460
- This is hard.
- It's the third place's turn.

2854
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:42,530
The team in third place...

2855
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:43,660
- won't get to check.
- One card.

2856
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:45,200
You can exchange only one card.

2857
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,270
- Hold on.
- Now, you can only...

2858
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:48,700
- exchange with the last team.
- Come here.

2859
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:49,700
Come here.

2860
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:51,170
One card. Ji Hyo. I'll...

2861
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:54,270
You can't check the cards.
You can only exchange them.

2862
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:55,340
(Is this a chance of revival
for Team Haha?)

2863
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:57,440
- Shuffle them.
- Shuffle them.

2864
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:59,550
- We'll just...
- You can just...

2865
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:00,980
exchange cards.

2866
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,020
- We won't exchange them.
- We won't.

2867
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:03,480
- You won't exchange them.
- We won't.

2868
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,080
This is a really good chance.

2869
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,890
- There is one good one.
- We can't exchange with them.

2870
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:07,920
If you do the math,

2871
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:08,990
- it's better not to switch.
- Right.

2872
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:10,460
- It's because...
- We won't exchange cards.

2873
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:12,430
You still get a penalty
if you have no pairs, right?

2874
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:13,860
Two people will get a penalty.

2875
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:16,000
Two people.
If only two get the penalty...

2876
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,160
- You could turn the tables.
- You could turn the tables.

2877
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,330
- Hold on.
- Hold on.

2878
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:21,600
Did Jong Kook have December?

2879
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:22,800
- No.
- Jong Kook...

2880
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,900
I mean Jae Seok.

2881
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:25,240
- Jae Seok...
- December...

2882
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:26,340
- had May.
- Right.

2883
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:28,010
- He also had August.
- He doesn't have December.

2884
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:30,180
- It'd be great if we had December.
- December...

2885
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,180
(They'll be in 2nd place
if they get 2 Decembers.)
It would be great
if we got December.

2886
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:33,180
- Let's bring it.
- December.

2887
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:37,450
(Team Haha has December.)

2888
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:38,890
- Let's bring it.
- Okay.

2889
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:40,450
- Okay.
- Then...

2890
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:41,950
- Right.
- You can bring one card...

2891
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:43,460
- If we get this...
- without checking.

2892
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:46,430
If we really get this,

2893
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:48,290
it would be amazing.
Two of us will get prizes.

2894
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,800
- We could skip the penalty.
- Right.

2895
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:51,800
All we need to avoid is November.

2896
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,130
- It's all or nothing.
- Yes.

2897
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:54,770
- We'll go for it!
- It's all or nothing.

2898
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:56,640
I have unlucky hands.
Why don't you try?

2899
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:57,840
You should pick.

2900
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,810
- Okay. I'll pick.
- You pick.

2901
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:01,570
- Okay.
- You can pick the wrong one.

2902
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,610
Come on. Okay!

2903
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,950
I want this one,
so I'll take the one next to it.

2904
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:09,820
(What will the Old Raccoon choose?
All or nothing?)

2905
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,820
(What will the Old Raccoon choose?
All or nothing?)

2906
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:13,090
Goodness.

2907
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:14,290
Is it over?

2908
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:17,960
(They got December.)

2909
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,290
- You have to give them one card.
- Can I...

2910
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:21,030
- Give us just one more chance.
- Did you get December?

2911
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:22,060
It worked.

2912
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,930
- It went to them.
- Hey.

2913
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:26,430
This is fun.

2914
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:27,970
(Team Haha escaped last place
without doing anything.)

2915
01:29:27,970 --> 01:29:29,870
- It went to them.
- This is fun.

2916
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:31,540
He's angry.

2917
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:33,310
I told you to pick one.
Why did you let me...

2918
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:35,040
You have to do well
when you give them a card.

2919
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,280
- I'll do it well.
- You should give it to them...

2920
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,980
- so they won't get a prize.
- You shouldn't give it to them.

2921
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:39,510
We'll give you the prize.

2922
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:41,380
- We'll give you the prize.
- We'll give you all the prize.

2923
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:42,880
- Do you believe that?
- No.

2924
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:45,320
- Don't say no.
- No.

2925
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,890
We'll give you the prize.

2926
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:48,220
- I think it's this one.
- Right.

2927
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:50,120
- We'll give you the prize.
- Take this.

2928
01:29:52,230 --> 01:29:54,890
Now, the Collect and Win!
The Fall Literary Society race...

2929
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:57,430
has ended.

2930
01:29:57,430 --> 01:30:00,400
Each team will show us
the hwatu cards...

2931
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,900
you have.

2932
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:03,400
Team Jong Kook.

2933
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,540
- They...
- We have jangttaeng.

2934
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:08,510
- You will all get a prize.
- That's crazy.

2935
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:10,040
- How did they get those?
- It's amazing.

2936
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:12,480
You have November Bright Card,
so all the members of this team...

2937
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,010
- will get a penalty.
- Everyone gets a penalty.

2938
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:15,410
We would have had a chance
if you had given it to us.

2939
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,920
Team Haha will show...

2940
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,650
their cards first.

2941
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:22,220
The cards we have...

2942
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:24,520
- These three couldn't make...
- There are no pairs.

2943
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,430
any pairs.

2944
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:28,030
- Also...
- Us as well.

2945
01:30:28,030 --> 01:30:29,730
- It didn't...
- We have one May.

2946
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:31,600
This team couldn't make
a pair as well.

2947
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,030
- Two penalty-receivers?
- Yes. There's a high chance...

2948
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:34,430
- two members will get the penalty.
- They're...

2949
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:37,040
- They all get a prize there.
- These two teams...

2950
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,210
- couldn't make a pair.
- Right.

2951
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:41,270
You'll pick a card, and the person
with a higher number...

2952
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:42,880
- Nice.
- Nice.

2953
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:43,910
- It's MIYEON.
- Me?

2954
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:44,940
Yes.

2955
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,710
You're the guest, so you can do it.
We won't blame you. I'm serious.

2956
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:48,010
- Really?
- We won't blame you.

2957
01:30:48,010 --> 01:30:50,220
The team with a higher-numbered
card will get the prize.

2958
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,190
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2959
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:54,620
- It's December.
- Twelve.

2960
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,660
Team MIYEON is in second place.

2961
01:30:58,290 --> 01:31:00,890
- We won't get a penalty!
- She's lucky.

2962
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:02,660
Three of you are now candidates.

2963
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:03,930
Three of you will pick a card,

2964
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:05,700
and the two people
with lower-numbered cards...

2965
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:06,970
- will get the penalty.
- Welcome.

2966
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:08,100
One...

2967
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:11,470
If we had won
the rock-paper-scissors,

2968
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:12,570
things would have been different.

2969
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,470
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2970
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:15,980
- One.
- One.

2971
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:19,950
Ye Eun and Haha
will get the penalty.

2972
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:22,220
- He escaped.
- Goodness.

2973
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:24,420
(He ruined all the games.)

2974
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:25,620
- Kim Byoung Cheol...
- Ye Eun. You're always...

2975
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:26,790
will be exempted from the penalty.

2976
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:28,920
- You're you.
- How did you survive?

2977
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:30,860
- That's amazing.
- Ye Eun. I told you, didn't I?

2978
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,230
- It was decided for you.
- Ye Eun.

2979
01:31:32,230 --> 01:31:33,460
It was always you.

2980
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:35,060
- There's a variety deity.
- Now,

2981
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:38,030
the prize goes to Jong Kook
and SUNMI, who won,

2982
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:40,130
and you can choose 2 people
from the team in 2nd place.

2983
01:31:40,130 --> 01:31:41,530
We'll give it to MIYEON
and Ssaebssaeb.

2984
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:44,340
The prize is the fall delicacy
that increases your appetite,

2985
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:46,070
soy sauce marinated crab.

2986
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:47,540
Soy sauce marinated crab!

2987
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:49,210
- Soy sauce marinated crab...
- You'll rot if you eat that.

2988
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:51,580
That's a famous one.

2989
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:54,150
Please bring in the penalty.

2990
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:56,150
- What's the penalty?
- This is nice.

2991
01:31:56,150 --> 01:31:57,580
- That's the penalty.
- I guess it's drawing on the face.

2992
01:31:57,580 --> 01:32:00,590
The penalty is something cute.

2993
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:03,520
You will put a piece of paper
with a maple leaf cut out on it...

2994
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:04,890
- on your face and paint it...
- It looks pretty.

2995
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:06,230
to become human maple leaves.

2996
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:07,430
This is easy.

2997
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:08,630
Will you turn me into a maple leaf?

2998
01:32:08,630 --> 01:32:09,660
Me too.

2999
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,500
You'd look like someone
cheering for Canada.

3000
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:13,000
On the nose?

3001
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:14,570
- Good.
- Let me see.

3002
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,240
This is the epitome of fall.

3003
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,400
(The faces are turning red,
reminiscent of the fall.)

3004
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:18,570
- Amazing.
- Do I look pretty?

3005
01:32:18,570 --> 01:32:20,140
Ji Hyo,
did you get slapped in the face?

3006
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:21,870
(Ji Hyo,
did you get slapped in the face?)

3007
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:23,940
- It looks nice.
- So...

3008
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:25,480
- Come here.
- It's fall.

3009
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:28,680
- Thank you for today.
- Thank you.

3010
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:31,250
(We thank Kim Byoung Cheol, SUNMI,
and MIYEON who enriched the fall.)

3011
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,390
(She went undercover
in the variety show to make a living.)

3012
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:35,920
(Ahn Eun Jin
with the great adaptability)

3013
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,090
(Eun Jin, just throw it away.)

3014
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:39,660
(And a man who's been
lingering around her)

3015
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:41,260
(Eun Jin gives him a surprise kiss.)

3016
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:42,460
(Is she my destined partner?)

3017
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:43,800
(You should get it
one more time, right?)

3018
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,260
(The reckless, white-horse-riding
Prince Baby Octopus)

3019
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:46,870
(You like Eun Jin, right?)

3020
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:48,470
(Please pretend
not to know anything.)

3021
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:49,840
(Do you want mine?)

3022
01:32:49,870 --> 01:32:51,270
(The younger man's
sudden flirtation)

3023
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:52,540
(I'm 100 percent sure
that you have feelings for Eun Jin.)

3024
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:53,670
(The culprit behind
an irreversible love triangle)

3025
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:56,340
(The younger man who's a master
of melodramas, Kim Mu Jun)

3026
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:58,540
(A lame, rotting love triangle
is added here.)

3027
01:32:58,540 --> 01:32:59,710
(Ye Eun, do you like
Daniel or Se Chan?)

3028
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:00,750
(I'll choose Yang Se Chan.)

3029
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:02,080
(Mu Jun's lips on Jae Seok's face?)

3030
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,080
(Mu Jun's lips...)

3031
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,790
(The chaotic and messy lip-matching
is becoming more confusing.)

3032
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:07,850
(Bitcoin!)

3033
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:09,290
(Crazy duck!)

3034
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:11,660
(Will they ever be able to read
the lips amidst this chaos?)

3035
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,930
(Dynamite Abandonment)
