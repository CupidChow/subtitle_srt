1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,970
Oh, dear.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,410
- Gosh.
- I need to clean up.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,780
- There's a pecking order among us.
- Okay!

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,750
Ma'am. Who are these beggars?

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,789
- You, Seok Sam...
- Why are we beggars?

6
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:16,250
Are you beggars or slaves?

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,489
Why are you... You're a slave,
but why is your nose red?

8
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:19,920
- What's that?
- I had a drink.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,489
- He's a drunkard.
- Can't a slave drink?

10
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:22,660
What are you doing?

11
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,829
Is a slave not allowed to drink?

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,559
You're a beggar, not a slave.

13
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,329
- Isn't he a beggar?
- Look at you.

14
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,500
(They were clearly told
to dress up like a slave.)

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,300
- You know what?
- What?

16
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,240
This is what happens
when you do a skit.

17
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,310
When someone does that,
it makes you want to do the same.

18
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,539
- That's true.
- You get greedy.

19
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,609
- It becomes too much.
- You get too enthusiastic.

20
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:40,509
- He drew snot.
- I drew a mole here.

21
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:41,979
- You did.
- It's really...

22
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,479
I'm too old to have snot on my face.

23
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,950
Drawing snot always works.

24
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,920
That's true. It's really cute.

25
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,850
- Se Chan, I want it too.
- Ji Hyo.

26
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,619
Should I put this on then?

27
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:51,759
I need a mole.

28
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,659
Do slaves look like this,
by the way?

29
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:56,030
Which part of town are you from?

30
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,329
- I'm...
- She's a real beggar.

31
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:00,500
- Look at Ye Eun. What's with her?
- Ye Eun!

32
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,570
What are you?

33
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,600
- Hey.
- What are you supposed to be?

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,799
Were you in an individual combat
or what?

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,870
- These gloves...
- You know these gloves.

36
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,170
They are the gloves
from Pyeongchang.

37
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:10,840
- Why are her teeth so white?
- Pyeongchang...

38
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,709
I guess they are fake teeth.

39
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:13,750
- They are dental laminates.
- They're laminates.

40
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,950
- Are they laminates?
- They're laminates.

41
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,519
- That's why.
- I'm rich.

42
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,819
That beggar...

43
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:19,920
You got dental laminates?

44
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,019
- You look so pretty today.
- Ye Eun, seriously...

45
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:25,120
If Ye Eun always dresses like that,
I'll set her up with a guy I know.

46
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,129
Seriously, I'll send her photo.

47
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,489
- To Sang Hyun.
- You look the best.

48
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:29,689
I'm popular these days.

49
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,200
- Yes, you are. It's crazy.
- You are popular.

50
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,230
Crazy Chef says he likes you.

51
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,129
The chef from "Culinary Class Wars."

52
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,469
- It's crazy.
- Hey.

53
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,109
Thank you, Crazy Chef!

54
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:43,140
(She shouts out to him right away.)

55
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,840
- You know that.
- It's unbelievable.

56
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,849
- Crazy Chef and Mickey Kwang Soo.
- You know that.

57
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:50,849
- How did you know?
- Crazy Chef, Mickey Kwang Soo,

58
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,849
- and Yang Se Chan.
- Yoo Hee Kwan.

59
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:54,689
- Yoo Hee Kwan.
- It's crazy.

60
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,650
- We should invite these guys over.
- No.

61
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,290
You should have
a Boyfriend Competition.

62
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,959
- By the way...
- Seriously, no.

63
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,829
They all are like us.

64
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,430
- Crazy Chef and Yang Hee Kwan?
- Yes.

65
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,870
- Yoo Hee Kwan.
- Who's Yang Hee Kwan?

66
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,030
- We should meet Crazy Chef.
- Crazy Chef.

67
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,300
- It's crazy now.
- It's crazy.

68
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,569
- And Ji Hyo... About Ji Hyo...
- Yes.

69
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,340
- She started her business.
- Yes.

70
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,439
- And she is very anxious.
- Why?

71
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,310
She gets only 1 or 2 orders a day.

72
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,150
- That's how you begin.
- Right.

73
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,949
- You should hold out.
- You have to wait.

74
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:24,080
- Right.
- You should get through it.

75
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,280
I'll work hard.

76
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,289
She says it's a long-term thing,
but she's always like, "Jae Seok."

77
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:29,419
This is just the beginning.

78
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,159
Your stretch went viral.

79
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,120
You should do a photoshoot
dressed like this.

80
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,330
- Then it will go viral.
- Should I put it on here?

81
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,300
Then stretch yourself.

82
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,669
You guys are slaves
without your own names.

83
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:41,699
- We don't have names?
- No?

84
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,030
That's why we don't have name tags.

85
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,870
You'd know Goo Deoki
from the famous drama.

86
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,740
Just like that,
during the Joseon Dynasty,

87
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,610
- It's "The Tale of Lady Ok."
- they had names like Shorty,

88
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,879
- It's really fun.
- Big Face, and March.

89
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,849
Slaves were named after
their characteristics like that.

90
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:57,650
So I'd like you to give
the member next to you...

91
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,120
- a nickname that suits them.
- Really?

92
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,590
You will write down the name
and wear the name tag today.

93
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,560
- We don't have names yet?
- So I'm not Seok Sam.

94
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,819
Seok Sam!

95
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:05,919
There wasn't a name...

96
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,729
- like Seok Sam back then.
- You called me Seok Sam.

97
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,500
- That's not my real name.
- I call him Seok Sam, and...

98
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,099
Everyone in the whole country
calls me Seok Sam now.

99
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,830
- Everyone in the country.
- You look like Seok Sam now.

100
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,699
A few days ago... I recently bought
a pair of shoes online.

101
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,840
- It was padded shoes.
- Okay.

102
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,770
- And there was a note.
- What did it say?

103
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,439
- It was under my name Jee Seok Jin.
- Yes.

104
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,909
"Are you the Seok Sam?"

105
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,639
I'm serious.

106
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,349
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

107
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,050
"Are you the Seok Sam?"

108
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,520
"If not, forget it."

109
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,090
"If you're him, I wish you
a Happy New Year."

110
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,319
- And I got two pairs of socks.
- You did?

111
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,789
It said, "This is on me."

112
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,129
- See? I'm the Seok Sam.
- Seok Sam.

113
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:43,189
- My goodness.
- Thank you.

114
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,599
- I'm very grateful.
- Yes.

115
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,530
- I'm serious.
- Everyone uses the name I use.

116
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,330
- Thank you.
- It's a perfect name for him.

117
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,569
Seok Sam is the best.

118
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:52,099
We are good at naming.

119
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,240
- Our names?
- We're good at naming.

120
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,770
- Jong Kook, will you name me?
- Well...

121
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,210
- I'll name you, Seok Sam.
- And I do yours?

122
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,409
- What?
- I'll give you a name.

123
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:02,449
- You should name Ye Eun.
- Should I do that?

124
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:04,449
- Should I name Seok Jin?
- So you will...

125
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,020
- Ye Eun...
- She will name Ji Hyo.

126
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,419
I want something pretty.

127
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,120
Something pretty?
What is something pretty?

128
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
- Something cute.
- What month were you born?

129
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,560
- Me? July.
- Yes.

130
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,090
What about July's Fool?

131
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,959
- What about Cutie?
- What?

132
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,029
Cutie.

133
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,000
- Cutie.
- What? Cutie?

134
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,699
What about Cutie Pie?

135
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:25,699
Cutie Pie?

136
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,839
(What will the name be
for cute Ye Eun?)

137
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,870
She is cute.

138
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,110
I'm cute too.

139
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,480
He wrote Hunchback.

140
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
(He wrote Hunchback.)

141
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,850
- Hunchback?
- It's Hunchback.

142
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,310
- Hunchback?
- Hunchback!

143
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,550
- I like Hunchback.
- It's nice, right?

144
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,920
I like Hunchback.

145
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,180
- That's a strong one.
- She's hunched.

146
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,319
(It means a cutely hunched back.)

147
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,560
- Hunchback?
- I like Hunchback.

148
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,420
- I named you.
- What is it?

149
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,089
- Floret.
- Hey!

150
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,129
- It's cute.
- Seok Sam...

151
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,560
- What's wrong?
- Why would I be Floret?

152
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,899
What's wrong with that?
You wanted a pretty name.

153
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,199
Gosh, seriously...

154
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,639
- Your name...
- I should name Jong Kook.

155
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,939
Yes. Is there anything you want?

156
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:02,040
What should it be?

157
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,110
I was born in April,
so you can call me April.

158
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,050
April? You are April?

159
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,250
April sounds cute.

160
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,850
- That's a girl's name.
- You're April.

161
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,250
There are many women with that name.

162
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,279
- He's April.
- Yes.

163
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,720
Muscleman is too predictable.

164
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,490
I think April is cute. April.

165
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,720
Now please take turns and announce
the names you came up with.

166
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,129
- Good.
- Yes.

167
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:23,560
Hey, you Dog Turd!

168
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,029
- It's Dog Turd.
- I'm Dog Turd.

169
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:26,629
- He's Dog Turd.
- Dog Turd.

170
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:28,329
- You're obviously Dog Turd.
- Yes.

171
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,399
Dog Turd.

172
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,269
- April!
- April.

173
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,269
- Good.
- I'm April.

174
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:33,540
He's April!

175
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,269
Yes. All right.

176
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,970
He's Bucktooth!

177
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,110
- Bucktooth?
- Bucktooth.

178
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,310
- Bucktooth? Gosh.
- Bucktooth.

179
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,310
Bucktooth...

180
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,509
How did they know he would have
a protruding mouth?

181
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,319
- Bucktooth.
- It's hard to tell as a kid.

182
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,720
- Bucktooth.
- Bucktooth.

183
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,319
All right. Floret!

184
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,220
What is Floret?

185
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,519
- You're Floret.
- Floret.

186
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,290
Come here, Hunchback!

187
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,529
- Hunchback.
- Oh, no. She's Hunchback.

188
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:57,660
Brainiac!

189
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,100
- Because she's clever?
- Yes, because she's brainy.

190
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,199
Haha is Dullard!

191
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,370
- Dullard.
- You're Dullard.

192
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,670
- I haven't heard that in a while.
- That's Kwang Soo.

193
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,310
- Floret.
- Floret.

194
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,639
- Yes?
- Why am I Floret?

195
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,779
Hunchback is a great name.

196
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:14,750
You will be calling each other
by those names all day.

197
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,879
- Really?
- That sounds great.

198
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,350
- It's easy to call.
- April.

199
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,519
- Dog Turd and Dullard.
- Dog Turd and Dullard.

200
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,019
- Floret.
- One of them should be Floret.

201
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:23,149
- You're Floret.
- You should be Floret.

202
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:24,759
- My goodness.
- What's that?

203
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,920
- One of them should be Floret.
- You're Floret.

204
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,860
(The Lord shows himself.)

205
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,129
- Who is he?
- What?

206
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:33,730
My Lord.

207
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,569
- My Lord.
- You fools.

208
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,470
Is he the man from the drama,
"The Tale of Lady Ok?"

209
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,670
(Is he the man from the drama,
"The Tale of Lady Ok?")

210
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,610
- My Lord.
- You fools.

211
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,379
There's a rule in the household,

212
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,839
but why aren't you greeting...

213
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,149
your master when you see him?

214
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:48,610
- Hello, My Lord.
- Hello, My Lord.

215
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,079
Say more!

216
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,449
Greet your master!

217
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,250
- Hello, My Lord.
- Hello.

218
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,220
- Go ahead and bow.
- Isn't that him?

219
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,889
He's... Hey, you.

220
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:57,920
- "Hey?"
- I mean...

221
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,189
How dare you call
your master like that?

222
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:01,029
- He's your master.
- He's a lord.

223
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,290
Is he a lord?

224
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,399
- I think I know him.
- Who is he?

225
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,600
- Who?
- He's...

226
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,370
- I'm your master.
- Dae Myeong?

227
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,899
- He's not Dae Myeong.
- It's not him. They do look alike.

228
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:11,399
- Greet your master first.
- Okay.

229
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,399
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

230
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,240
(Who is he?)

231
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,439
Hello, My Lord.

232
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,009
Why aren't you saying anything,
Floret?

233
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,540
Oh, hello.

234
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,079
You have a pretty face,
but you're dull of hearing.

235
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,579
He says I have a pretty face.

236
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:26,149
You have a pretty face,
but you're dull of hearing.

237
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,519
He says I have a pretty face.

238
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,490
Why you...

239
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,459
- He seems a little nervous.
- It's not him, is it?

240
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,560
- Is he an announcer?
- An announcer?

241
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,759
- I said I was your master.
- Oh, right.

242
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,829
How dare you?

243
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,360
What did he say?

244
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,569
- Master!
- Master.

245
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:41,870
The master of this house.

246
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,199
Your master.

247
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,439
Master!

248
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,139
- He said "Master."
- The master of this house.

249
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,240
His pronunciation...

250
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,709
- It's hard to understand.
- Master.

251
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:50,680
How many times
do I have to say that?

252
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,439
"I said I was your master!"

253
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,310
Five times. Say it five times.

254
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,319
Master, master, master,
master, master!

255
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,250
- "Master!"
- That doesn't sound right.

256
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,620
- Please go on, My Lord.
- Yes.

257
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,620
All right. In the morning...

258
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,920
Didn't he say "Da?"

259
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,089
"Da!"

260
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,629
It's so nice that I'm smiling
in the morning because of you.

261
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,129
- Because of us?
- I'm feeling great.

262
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:13,029
- We're happy.
- We're smiling because of you.

263
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:15,800
I'm feeling great in the morning
thanks to you guys.

264
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,069
So here's the deal.

265
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,470
If you are done
running errands for me by 4 p.m.,

266
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,670
- you all will get off work.
- Yes!

267
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:26,079
(If they are done running errands,
they all will get off work.)

268
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,750
- Nice.
- It's by 4 p.m.

269
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,350
- That's great.
- By 4 p.m.?

270
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,949
- What would you like us to do?
- It's by 4 p.m.

271
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:36,250
- If you fail to finish it by 4 p.m.,
- Yes.

272
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,059
- you will be harshly punished.
- Okay.

273
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,029
- Keep that in mind, okay?
- Yes, sir.

274
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:42,490
- Yes, My Lord.
- Yes, My Lord.

275
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,230
I've prepared various clues so that you,
who don't know...

276
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,000
- how to read, can find the way.
- Thank you.

277
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,440
- So put your brains together...
- Yes.

278
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,100
and make sure to finish it well.

279
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,440
- Yes, sir.
- And...

280
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,039
What's with his mustache?

281
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:58,809
- Make sure to run all the errands.
- Yes, sir.

282
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:00,750
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

283
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,179
I guess my mustache is
feeling good too.

284
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:04,320
(I guess my mustache is
feeling good too.)

285
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:06,850
(Nice one, My Lord.)

286
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,450
Make sure to run all the errands.

287
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,990
- Yes, My Lord.
- Yes, My Lord.

288
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,860
- Thank you.
- Yes, My Lord.

289
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,429
(1. Finish errands by 4 p.m.
2. Use clues to find the locations.)

290
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,029
(3. If the deadline is not met,
punishment will be given.)

291
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,929
Actually, slaves are not supposed
to get off work.

292
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:22,429
But thanks to your generous master,

293
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,700
you can get off work at 4 p.m.

294
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,899
If you want to get off work
without getting a penalty,

295
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,669
you will have to find the locations
of the errands quickly.

296
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,740
- Right.
- But you can't get the clues...

297
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,149
that your master prepared
right away.

298
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,309
Since you are slaves,
you should earn them by working.

299
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,480
Should we work?

300
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,850
- Work.
- What?

301
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,080
- Let's go.
- Floret.

302
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,090
When you call me Floret, it doesn't
feel like you're calling me.

303
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,220
Work!

304
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,289
To get the clue about
the location of the first errand,

305
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,960
you should deliver...

306
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,559
- the English words that...
- English?

307
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,500
The English words that
your master is learning in Korean.

308
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,700
For this mission,

309
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,000
only Haha, Ji Hyo,
Se Chan, and Ye Eun...

310
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,269
- can be the 1st player.
- The 1st player?

311
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,370
Yes, the first player.

312
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,809
- Hang on.
- Wait. The members selected...

313
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,710
The question is, are they
the good ones or the bad ones?

314
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:11,379
- The bad ones should go first?
- No.

315
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:14,190
- This is...
- Are we the bad ones?

316
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,289
Seriously...

317
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:17,250
English. Oh, no.

318
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,659
What is lake in English?

319
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,289
- What is it?
- Lak.

320
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:22,230
(Lak)

321
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,559
It's an f.

322
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,700
- Frotein.
- It's frotein.

323
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,129
- Isn't it protein?
- Hey, it's a p.

324
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:30,200
Don't they say frotein in Korea?

325
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:32,370
What's the English title
of the movie, "Parasite?"

326
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,539
"Ameba?"

327
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,509
What is giraffe in English?

328
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,240
Girin?

329
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,549
- We're doomed.
- Hey, this is...

330
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:43,850
(English proficiency is the reason
why they are the first players.)

331
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,179
It won't be easy.

332
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:48,190
The first player will see
the given English word,

333
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,690
write its meaning in Korean,

334
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,659
- and show it to the next player.
- Hey, this is...

335
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,320
- Write down the meaning in Korean?
- Yes.

336
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,860
The second player will see
the Korean word and draw it.

337
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,159
Then the third player
will see the drawing...

338
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,529
and write down the answer in Korean.

339
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,070
You will take turns
alternately like that.

340
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,100
- I see. Okay.
- And the last player will see...

341
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,570
the drawing and give an answer.

342
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,309
If the first player gets it wrong,
it's over.

343
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,070
- The difficulty of the keywords...
- It must be difficult.

344
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,210
- will be at your level.
- Okay.

345
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,080
- Me, Se Chan, and Ye Eun are...
- Thank you.

346
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,350
- at different levels.
- It won't be easy though.

347
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,149
Haha is a bit advanced though.

348
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,779
He was born in Germany.

349
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:19,919
- Among you guys?
- You know what?

350
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,720
- I can spell kitchen.
- Right.

351
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:24,460
If you get 1 question right
out of 5,

352
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,789
- you will get the clues.
- You guys think we are...

353
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:27,429
- It must be difficult.
- You're being too much.

354
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:29,259
- Good.
- Let's do this.

355
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:31,500
- You look down on us.
- I think it's difficult.

356
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,659
- We should give it a try though.
- They look down on us.

357
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,899
The first player will be...

358
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:38,399
Dog Turd.

359
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:42,740
If it's Dog Turd, we'll be doomed.

360
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,909
- Dog Turd?
- Dog Turd?

361
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:45,409
Sure. I'll give it a try.

362
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,340
Please give me a chance.

363
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,980
- Please sit over there.
- Sit over there.

364
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,179
The first player should get
enough time to think.

365
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,019
- I'm not good at drawing.
- Bucktooth.

366
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,149
- Bucktooth will answer.
- Bucktooth should answer.

367
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,159
- You should draw.
- Is this for drawing?

368
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,960
- You should be drawing.
- Should I answer?

369
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,429
- Should I draw?
- You should draw.

370
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:03,830
Dog Turd is from Dongducheon.

371
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,100
- Right.
- Yes.

372
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,860
- Give me chocolate.
- Yes. Give me chocolate.

373
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,870
Give me one dollar.

374
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,470
- Thank you. Sorry.
- Okay.

375
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,899
- He's a native speaker.
- A native speaker.

376
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,340
I will show you what I can do.

377
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,769
(The man from Dongducheon
bursts with self-confidence.)

378
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,009
- The category is...
- Is it a difficult word?

379
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:19,039
animal.

380
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,179
- Animal?
- Animal?

381
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:21,480
I'll show you the word.

382
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,580
- Is it difficult?
- Gosh, this is...

383
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,980
- Just guess it.
- You get five seconds.

384
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,320
- What?
- Five.

385
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,649
- Is it an animal?
- Four.

386
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:29,889
- Three.
- Is it a difficult word?

387
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:31,090
- No.
- Two.

388
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,090
- I guess he can do it.
- He seems to know that.

389
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,259
- It's done.
- He can answer.

390
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,629
I don't think this is it.

391
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:38,730
This isn't right, but I had no time.

392
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,370
Why do you need more time
when you write it in Korean?

393
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,200
- You write it in Korean.
- Hey.

394
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,870
But, Jong Kook...

395
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,299
- Hey, it's Korean.
- Jong Kook.

396
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,039
I think I'm wrong,
so you should guess it.

397
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,169
It's something like this.

398
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,879
- What?
- It's something like this.

399
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,009
What is that?

400
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:53,610
It's something that feels like this.

401
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,879
- How does it feel?
- It feels like this.

402
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,809
- What's that?
- Gosh, seriously...

403
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,649
This isn't the answer though.
It's something like this.

404
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:01,049
- Can we see that?
- This is a difficult one.

405
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,120
- This isn't it.
- We can get it right.

406
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,190
(Jong Kook draws a bear as seen.)

407
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,720
- It's an animal.
- Right.

408
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,889
We can get it right in the middle.

409
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,559
- It's an animal.
- What is it?

410
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,990
This is... You...

411
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,659
- What is it?
- It doesn't make sense.

412
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:13,799
It's something like this,

413
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,200
- but it's difficult.
- Is it a difficult word?

414
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,429
- You will know once you see it.
- You should guess what it is.

415
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,039
That's not the answer.

416
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,370
- Darn it!
- How is it difficult?

417
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,009
He says it's not the answer,
but this is all I can think of.

418
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:24,210
You should change it.

419
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,309
- Change this?
- You should change it.

420
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:27,440
- He tells you to change it.
- Okay.

421
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,350
Change what?

422
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,409
- He tells you to change it.
- Okay.

423
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,080
- I'll change it.
- It's something similar.

424
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,779
- The English word is similar.
- Is it similar?

425
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,549
- Does it look similar?
- It's an animal.

426
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:36,990
- Something similar is...
- No.

427
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,019
(Something that looks similar?
I get it!)

428
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,330
- They will know what this is.
- Three.

429
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,360
- He told me to change it, but...
- How are these similar?

430
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,600
This is all I can think of.

431
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,000
And he says that's not the answer.

432
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,570
- I don't know.
- Haha.

433
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,769
We might get it right in the middle.

434
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,370
- What is it?
- Hey.

435
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,570
This is too difficult.

436
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,470
This is too difficult.

437
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,139
- Isn't this it?
- Deer?

438
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,269
Deer?

439
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,879
- It's a deer.
- This isn't it.

440
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,240
- A deer.
- What's that?

441
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:02,149
(We're doomed.)

442
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,820
- What is it?
- This isn't the answer.

443
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,250
Just guess it.
This isn't the answer.

444
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,720
How can I make a guess?
I can't even start.

445
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,590
- Make a guess.
- What are you talking about?

446
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,820
"This isn't the answer."

447
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,289
- That's not it.
- We don't know it yet.

448
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,899
- It's an animal anyway.
- Wait. All right.

449
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,600
- Good. Just draw anything.
- You should change it.

450
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,029
- Right. Good.
- Change it.

451
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,629
It might be similar. What?

452
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,200
I think we're getting close.

453
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:29,110
I think we're getting close.

454
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,509
I just drew anything.

455
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,309
- Good.
- I made it ambiguous.

456
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,879
I made it ambiguous.

457
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,809
(Ji Hyo writes down elephant
after seeing the drawing.)

458
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,049
Now it's Ye Eun's turn.

459
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,279
It's not easy.

460
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:41,950
- Five, four...
- Change the answer?

461
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,990
(After Ye Eun seeing
the word elephant,)

462
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,960
(she draws an elephant.)

463
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,190
Let me see.

464
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,190
(Ye Eun's drawing)

465
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,460
Elephant.

466
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,629
- My gosh.
- It's not easy.

467
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:53,000
- Elephant.
- No.

468
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,600
- What was it?
- I'm sorry, but it was close.

469
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:56,899
- Deer.
- It's a deer.

470
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:58,740
- Do you not know this word?
- Deer.

471
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,639
I wrote bear instead.

472
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,669
- What?
- Deer?

473
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:03,309
Deer is easy, so I changed it...

474
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:04,940
- to bear.
- Wait.

475
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,110
- Bear?
- Did you not know the word?

476
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,149
- Hey, you...
- Dullard is AI.

477
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:09,679
Hunchback, show us.

478
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:11,320
I should go.

479
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,250
- Hunchback sounds confident.
- Korea National University of Arts.

480
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,320
- Again?
- I should go.

481
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,019
- This is embarrassing.
- It wasn't easy.

482
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,889
- Deer.
- Okay. Hunchback.

483
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:19,820
- I drew an elephant well, right?
- Do you know what deer is?

484
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,460
I don't know.

485
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,299
What? I've been banished.

486
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,159
Deer wasn't easy.

487
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,870
I think it will be a difficult word.

488
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,139
What do I do?

489
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,100
Give me a tough one instead.

490
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,970
Hunchback, let's go!

491
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
- The category...
- It won't be too difficult.

492
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,710
- is food or ingredients.
- What you can eat.

493
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,210
- What we can eat?
- Okay, good.

494
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,320
Here you go.

495
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,820
- All right. Five, four, three,
- Is it a tough one?

496
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:50,389
- She's not hesitating.
- two... Good.

497
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:51,960
She was done in no time.

498
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,360
- She must know this word.
- Hunchback didn't take long.

499
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,330
They gave her an easy one unlike me.

500
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,129
(Was the word "mushroom?")

501
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:00,399
- Go down the line.
- She must know this word.

502
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,039
(It's an easy one!)

503
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,570
- one.
- It's an easy one.

504
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,240
- Goodness.
- Got it.

505
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,169
(Jong Kook's drawing)

506
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,480
(Mushroom)

507
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,509
Here.

508
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:13,509
It came down the line in no time.

509
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:15,649
I think we can get this one.
We'll get it for sure.

510
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,019
This... That's a fine drawing.

511
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:19,580
- There you go.
- We'll get this one right.

512
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,720
He can draw.

513
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,620
We'll definitely get this one.

514
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,120
I see it was an easy one.

515
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,659
- We can get this.
- Are we up to Brainiac?

516
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:29,789
This is an English word
she can't afford not to know.

517
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,899
- This?
- Yes.

518
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:32,929
Are we at Seok Jin?

519
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:34,570
- Yes.
- No, Hunchback. I mean...

520
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,730
- Hunchback.
- Floret.

521
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,029
- That...
- He didn't draw it right.

522
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,269
- This is it, isn't it?
- That could be debatable.

523
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,539
- It's something we eat.
- It could be confusing.

524
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,009
(He adds a line
since the others are worried.)

525
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:45,139
- Floret, bring it.
- Okay, we're good.

526
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,610
- Good.
- Okay, we're set.

527
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,610
(Seok Jin's drawing)

528
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,179
- Mushroom.
- Mushroom?

529
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:51,919
(Answer: Mushroom)

530
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,580
- No?
- What is it, then?

531
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,490
(The answer isn't mushroom?)

532
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,049
- Mushroom?
- Cabbage?

533
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,289
- It's cabbage!
- It's cabbage!

534
00:16:58,289 --> 00:16:59,720
(Darn...)

535
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,759
(Head sinking)

536
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,929
- It's cabbage!
- It's cabbage!

537
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:03,360
- Hold on.
- Even I'd know that.

538
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,200
Your drawing did look like
cabbage at the end.

539
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,400
- Did it?
- If only you hadn't drawn the line.

540
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,769
How could you not know cabbage?

541
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:10,799
- Cabbage...
- How could you?

542
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,500
Savage and cabbage.

543
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,670
- How could you not know that?
- That...

544
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,170
How could you confuse it
with mushroom?

545
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:16,670
- Mushroom...
- I know what a mushroom is.

546
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,410
I just thought cabbage
was a type of mushroom.

547
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,640
- Move out of that seat.
- Do you get it?

548
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,180
There's no helping her.

549
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,109
Hunchback, focus.

550
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,319
- We're slaves.
- Why is it...

551
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,779
that you know the word
when you're over there?

552
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,720
You become a genius
at the end of the line.

553
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,819
- I'd know it too over there.
- This is infuriating.

554
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,089
Hold on. Brainiac,

555
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:33,589
- switch seats.
- Take that seat instead.

556
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:35,559
Got it. I'll give it a try.

557
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,589
Let's switch seats too. I'll draw.

558
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,099
- What?
- I'll draw this time.

559
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,099
Why don't I draw this time?

560
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:41,599
- What?
- I'll draw, while you guess.

561
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,930
- Sure, I'll guess the answer.
- Good.

562
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:45,170
Sure. Since you can't draw...

563
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:47,500
Let's go with those
who can't draw well.

564
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,170
- We should give a laugh.
- They should...

565
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,539
- Let's show them.
- Go for it.

566
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,809
- Animals.
- The category is animals.

567
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:55,750
It's not a collective noun like fish
but an actual animal.

568
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,250
- Go, team.
- Go!

569
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,519
Don't be vague about it.

570
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,049
(Keyword: Camel)

571
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:01,690
(She wrote something down.)

572
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,049
(Does she know
the English word for camel?)

573
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:06,019
Look at Ji Hyo. She's writing
the answer down with ease.

574
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,890
(She knows the English word
for camel.)

575
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,759
(Finally, the first person
wrote down the correct answer.)

576
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:13,400
Three, two, one.

577
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:15,569
- It's an animal.
- Show the next person.

578
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:17,069
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

579
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,339
It's an easy one.

580
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,440
- Five, five, three...
- Okay. Hold on.

581
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,710
(Even Haha figures out
that the answer is camel!)

582
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,109
Unbelievable.

583
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:28,309
(It's now time for Jae Seok
to draw it.)

584
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:30,180
- It must be easy.
- two,

585
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,519
- We must be doing okay.
- one.

586
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:32,779
Three,

587
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:34,720
- two, one.
- This...

588
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,950
- You did great.
- We've got this.

589
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,890
- Nicely done.
- You drew what was important.

590
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,519
Good job.

591
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,059
- Nicely done.
- Five, four...

592
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,589
We've got this.

593
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,430
Dog Turd.

594
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,259
- I know.
- Right.

595
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,029
- Dog Turd, draw it right.
- Four, three...

596
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,900
- Dog Turd, draw it right.
- Four,

597
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,170
- three, two, one.
- It's impossible not to know.

598
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,809
Ye Eun, put yours down.

599
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,309
Are you done? Dog Turd,

600
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,509
- did you draw it?
- Show him.

601
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,640
- Can I look at it?
- That seems vague.

602
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,480
- Can I look at it?
- That's so vague.

603
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:03,279
Of course I know what this is.

604
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,150
- What is it?
- It's easy.

605
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,150
(Will they finally get
the right answer?)

606
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,819
- It's vague.
- Ostrich.

607
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:10,049
- What?
- Ostrich?

608
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:11,619
Seriously?

609
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:14,289
(How can you get this wrong?)

610
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:15,730
- Isn't this an ostrich?
- I drew a hump.

611
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,559
- You should've drawn two.
- But...

612
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,859
We were almost there.
How is this a camel?

613
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,430
- It was vague.
- Isn't this an ostrich?

614
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,029
- Also, why...
- They gave this one to us.

615
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,299
does it have a bird's feet?

616
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,440
- Se Chan.
- Look.

617
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:28,869
I ran out of time.

618
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,240
It was probably
the only one we could get.

619
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,279
It was probably the only one
Ji Hyo could get.

620
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,250
- They gave this one to us.
- Yang Se Chan.

621
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,980
We were practically fed this one.

622
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,119
- You...
- Unbelievable.

623
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,849
- Get out.
- Should I?

624
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:41,990
Running Man's pride is on the line.
Let's at least get one right.

625
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,750
It's upsetting to know...

626
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,519
that we're stuck guessing
such elementary words.

627
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,759
What's the category?

628
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:49,130
- It's animal.
- Animal?

629
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,329
Haha, here's the word.

630
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:58,700
(Keyword: Whale)

631
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:00,170
You didn't hesitate.

632
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,940
(He got it right.)

633
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,509
You can interpret my drawings.

634
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:04,740
You didn't hesitate.

635
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,509
- Be at ease while you draw.
- Five, four,

636
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:09,309
- three, two, one.
- You can interpret my drawings.

637
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,049
Ji Hyo, write it down in Korean.

638
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,119
- Five, four... Right.
- There you go.

639
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:17,849
We have to get this right.
They fed this one to us.

640
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,619
Jae Seok, be at ease while you draw.

641
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,960
- Of course.
- Right.

642
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,730
- You can interpret my drawings.
- Absolutely.

643
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,990
One.

644
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,660
(It's Jae Seok's turn to draw.)

645
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,430
- Please draw it.
- Right.

646
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,130
- Five, four...
- It's easy.

647
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,140
(Jae Seok wasn't holding his pen!)

648
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,170
Just a second.

649
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,740
Why wasn't it uncapped?

650
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,109
Keep your sketchbooks covered.

651
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,180
(He urgently draws it in a hurry.)

652
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,539
"Why wasn't it uncapped?"

653
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,180
- Four, three...
- What did you do?

654
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,109
- Here.
- "Why wasn't it uncapped?"

655
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,680
(There's something off
about Jae Seok's whale.)

656
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,519
- Write the Korean word.
- Let me see.

657
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,650
- Can't you also tell what it is?
- Let me see.

658
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,460
- You should know.
- How did you draw it?

659
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,259
- This...
- Seriously?

660
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:55,990
- Come on!
- What on earth is that?

661
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,000
- Why...
- I didn't have much time.

662
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,329
- What on earth is that?
- What is that?

663
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:01,160
- My pen wasn't uncapped.
- Is that a monster?

664
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,099
- No, that's...
- Next.

665
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:05,299
(What did Se Chan write down?)

666
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,599
Did you write it down?

667
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,769
- What is it?
- Look at Se Chan's.

668
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,269
Let me see.

669
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,970
- This?
- Seriously?

670
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,710
- Three, two...
- I didn't have much time.

671
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,880
(A curve ball was thrown at them
at the end once again.)

672
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,650
What is the matter with you?

673
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,250
They gave us that one to get right.

674
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,890
But...

675
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,390
Keep the pen uncapped!

676
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,759
Here.

677
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,589
You get it, right?

678
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,289
- Three...
- Snake.

679
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:29,390
Snake?

680
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,160
Look. It has a magic pearl.

681
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:33,529
- What was it, Haha?
- A magic pearl.

682
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
- Guess what this is.
- It's a whale!

683
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,470
I ran out of time.

684
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,569
- How is this...
- Why couldn't you draw a whale?

685
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:40,869
- Is that a whale?
- A whale.

686
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:43,609
How is that a whale? He said dragon.

687
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:48,710
(The evolution of a whale)

688
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,019
- I thought it was a giant snake.
- Unbelievable.

689
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:55,519
- Guys, we can do this.
- Right.

690
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,549
- Uncap your pens.
- That's right.

691
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,160
- Before I lose it.
- Okay.

692
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:02,160
Don't order us around
when we're all slaves here.

693
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,589
What?

694
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,230
- Just keep your pen uncapped.
- Guys, we can do this.

695
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,400
- Hunchback, come out here.
- You sit up there.

696
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,269
Hunchback, come on.
Guess the answer first.

697
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:12,240
- And after Jong Kook draws it,
- I can't do it.

698
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,500
I'll write the answer.

699
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,940
- You'll do that?
- And you...

700
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:16,670
- Why don't I draw?
- I'll write.

701
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,009
- You should write, so you'll draw.
- You write.

702
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:19,579
- I should write.
- You guess the answer.

703
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,109
- Should I guess?
- Yes.

704
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:22,180
Right, and you'll draw.

705
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,680
- That's it. This is perfect.
- I should guess.

706
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:26,549
- Hold on.
- What? Should I draw?

707
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:27,880
- What about this is perfect?
- You'll draw.

708
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,349
Let's get one right.

709
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,690
- This...
- What do I do?

710
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,119
I'm disappointed in us.

711
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:33,920
- This we should get.
- Unbelievable.

712
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,960
Would I know this?

713
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,690
- Hunchback, you can do this.
- This much...

714
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,700
The category is animal.

715
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,799
- This is our last chance.
- Show the next person.

716
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,170
(They were fed the answer,
and Hunchback got this hint.)

717
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,670
- Hold on.
- Sure.

718
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,640
- Here we go.
- Five, four,

719
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,769
- three, two,
- Your drawing is great.

720
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:49,039
- Let's do this.
- one.

721
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,670
Lower your sketchbook.

722
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,680
All right. In 1, 2, 3.

723
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,309
- Got it.
- Five, four,

724
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:56,250
- You get it, right?
- three...

725
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,650
Haha's up.

726
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,450
This is an easy one.

727
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:01,420
- Five, four,
- Hold on.

728
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,420
three, two...

729
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,819
- Cover the Korean word.
- Hold on.

730
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,160
- One.
- Just a second.

731
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,160
- Only draw what stands out.
- Hurry up.

732
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,460
- Just what stands out.
- Stick to what stands out.

733
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,130
- Don't try to make it look perfect.
- Just what stands out.

734
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,230
- Exactly. Stick to what stands out.
- Five, four,

735
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,529
- three,
- These.

736
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:15,670
- I got it.
- two, one.

737
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,829
- I guess they lack time.
- Here.

738
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,440
- Are you good?
- Floret, here.

739
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,140
- Of course I know this!
- Five,

740
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,440
- four, three...
- All right.

741
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
(All that's left is for Seok Sam
to draw it well.)

742
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,309
Three, two,

743
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:26,809
- one.
- What are you drawing?

744
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:27,980
You'll now guess the word.

745
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,750
This is an easy one.

746
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,750
- Floret, let's do this.
- You can guess now.

747
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,250
- What...
- Floret, that's not bad.

748
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,180
- Floret, let me see.
- You can get this.

749
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,420
- All right. It's an animal.
- Feel the vibe of the drawing.

750
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,319
- Is it an animal?
- Yes, it has that vibe.

751
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,660
You get it, right?
It looks like that animal.

752
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,220
Hold on. Let me have some water.

753
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,759
(Drinking water?)

754
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,900
- Gosh.
- Hey.

755
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,630
Let's at least get one.

756
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:48,170
It's our last chance.

757
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,130
- Hippo!
- That's it.

758
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,269
That's what I'm talking about!

759
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,539
(They dramatically succeed
on their last attempt!)

760
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:58,380
- We got it!
- Hey, she knew the word.

761
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,339
- You think so little of us.
- It must be tough.

762
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,380
(They were upset
about being belittled,)

763
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,410
(but they almost failed.)

764
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,579
What a disappointment.

765
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:08,920
The clue about the first location
regarding the errand...

766
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,819
will only be given to Se Chan.

767
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:11,920
- Really?
- Why?

768
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,490
The rest will close their eyes.

769
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,690
Does he have to explain it to us?

770
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,329
- It must be in English.
- Does he have to draw it?

771
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:18,599
- I see.
- It must be in English.

772
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,160
- Come on.
- You'll get ten seconds to see it.

773
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,670
(He can see it for 10 seconds.)

774
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,269
Why did it have to be Se Chan?

775
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,710
(What hint about the location
will he get to see?)

776
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,240
- Memorize it.
- Ready, go.

777
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,809
- Ten, nine,
- Look closely, Dog Turd.

778
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,420
eight, seven, six,

779
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,720
five, four, three,

780
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,450
- My head hurts.
- two,

781
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,690
one. The time's up.

782
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,490
- Why did they name Dog Turd?
- What's this for?

783
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:52,900
- Se Chan just saw the name...
- Yes?

784
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,970
- of the first location.
- What?

785
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,470
Write down what you just saw
and show the other slaves.

786
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,309
I guess it's not English.
It must be a weird foreign language.

787
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,039
(Dog Turd writes something.)

788
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,410
There are a lot of
odd place names in Jongno.

789
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,220
- Are there?
- Yes. Weird diner names too.

790
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,049
- It could've been Chinese letters.
- Yes, Chinese letters.

791
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:18,119
No, I have a feeling it's Arabic.

792
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,420
- No.
- It's Arabic. What do you say?

793
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:24,190
(Oh, what a headache.)

794
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,660
- It's Chinese.
- It's Chinese?

795
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,000
Yes, it's Chinese.

796
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,230
- My gosh. Dog Turd...
- That's all I got.

797
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,400
- Share the info with the others.
- This is what I got.

798
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,799
- What is it?
- It was in Chinese.

799
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,839
- Chinese?
- Chinese?

800
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,769
I recognized these two characters.

801
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,309
- "Gu Woon..."
- It's something "san."

802
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:39,410
That looks like "woon."

803
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,309
- "Gu Woon..."
- It's something "san."

804
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:43,509
- It's "san poong."
- This one...

805
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,019
- No?
- I don't know.

806
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:46,619
- This one...
- Isn't that "jeon?"

807
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:48,019
- No, it's not "jeon."
- It's not?

808
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:49,789
These two were high level.

809
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:52,089
These two were easy.

810
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:53,589
- "Gu woon san..."
- It's "gu something san."

811
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:54,819
It's "gu something san."

812
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,559
I'm sure about this part.

813
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,400
It's "gu something san."

814
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,500
(He accurately wrote
the two easy letters!)

815
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,769
I'm sure about this part right here.

816
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,130
- Could it be "cloud?"
- This part.

817
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,599
- Yes.
- It looked like this.

818
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:07,440
Is it "woo" for rain
or "woon" for cloud?

819
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,910
Is it "gu woon san poong?"

820
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,039
That's the name of the location.

821
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,740
Now I'll give you the second hint.

822
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,309
- Can we find the place?
- Isn't that the letter for "door?"

823
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:18,420
- At the end?
- You can carry these around.

824
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,450
- What's that? A needle?
- "Gu woon san?"

825
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,019
It looks like dog fur.

826
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:24,119
It's fur? Let me see.

827
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,119
(Second clue: Two strands of fur)

828
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,660
- Is it hair?
- It must be hair.

829
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,589
- Is it hair?
- One is white,

830
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,089
and one is brown and yellow.

831
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,730
- What?
- There are three strands?

832
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,829
There are two.

833
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:35,099
- Is it dog fur?
- Is it thread or fur?

834
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:37,200
- It's fur.
- It's fur? Are you sure?

835
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:38,599
- From a wig?
- It's hair.

836
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,000
- From a wig?
- Isn't it from a broom?

837
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,200
From a broom? A wig?

838
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,970
- Would hair be that...
- Isn't it from a brush?

839
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,109
- It's too thick for hair.
- A brush!

840
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:46,039
- It's thick.
- Oh, it's from a brush.

841
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,410
- It's from a brush.
- Is it?

842
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,210
- How is this from a brush?
- Because...

843
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,450
Not just this place but this area...

844
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,680
- The mountains...
- In the Joseon era...

845
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,990
There are many famous places
from that time.

846
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,819
Use the clues to decide
where to go to run the errand...

847
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:01,359
and go where you want to go.

848
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,789
You can't search the Internet
to find the destination,

849
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,299
but you can ask
members of the public.

850
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:08,799
It must be somewhere nearby.

851
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,200
- Like a famous...
- A mountain?

852
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,039
Gu-something... Oh, I lost one.

853
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,970
Gu-something... Oh, I lost one.

854
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,410
- Darn you.
- Don't do that.

855
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,140
- Let's not do that.
- You can't find it now.

856
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,109
- Dog Turd!
- I'm sorry.

857
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,250
- Haha, the brown one...
- You had two,

858
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,720
- and you lost one?
- That's so important.

859
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,680
I have the white one.
Where did it go?

860
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,619
- A place starting with "gu..."
- Let's go outside.

861
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:31,019
Let's go outside and ask.

862
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:33,289
- "Gu-something..."
- A mountain that starts with "gu."

863
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,390
- "Gu woon..."
- Let's find out.

864
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,460
- A mountain with nine clouds...
- Yes.

865
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,099
- A fortress?
- A mountain that starts with "gu."

866
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:41,299
Gu-something san-something.

867
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:42,400
We need to ask.

868
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,369
- Could it be a village school?
- It could be.

869
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:45,769
It's "gu-something san," right?

870
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:47,569
I think it's a mountain name
that starts with "gu."

871
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:49,509
- If we look on the way...
- Yes.

872
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:51,740
- We'll see some place names.
- There are signs.

873
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,210
We're currently in Gugi-dong.

874
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,109
(Their current location
is Gugi-dong.)

875
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,880
- That's the "gu," then.
- This is Gugi-dong.

876
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,420
This place... You're sure
about "gu" and "san," right?

877
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,849
- Yes.
- You are?

878
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,490
Then we can ask passers-by.

879
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,789
Let's hurry.

880
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:06,819
Let's have a look.

881
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,990
It's not
Hwanghakjeong Archery Range.

882
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:12,230
"Poet's Hill."
It must be someplace like that.

883
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,029
Hang on.
"Traditional games in Jongno."

884
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,839
This has something to do with fur.

885
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:20,369
(Another hint was strands of fur.)

886
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:22,539
- No, that's Hwanghakjeong.
- It must be bows and arrows.

887
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:24,509
Yes, so a traditional game like...

888
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:25,779
- Something like...
- That's archery.

889
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:27,640
Is it something involving brushes?

890
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,049
I think it could be hair
from a horse's tail.

891
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:33,950
Why are we dressed as slaves?
Shouldn't we consider that?

892
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,119
It's about the past,
so I think it could be brushes.

893
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,920
- Yes.
- How about we ask an elder?

894
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,460
- Yes, an elder.
- A local elder.

895
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,730
- A local elder.
- Let's do that.

896
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,990
- Since it's an old place.
- Let's do that.

897
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,960
I bet their seolleongtang's good.

898
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,500
- Whose?
- Their food must be good.

899
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
That looks good. Seolleongtang.

900
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
- Seolleongtang is good.
- It's lovely.

901
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,670
It looks tasty.

902
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:56,210
A bowl of soup and rice
would be nice and filling.

903
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,410
Shall we have some?

904
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,740
- Gukbap sounds good.
- It's seolleongtang.

905
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,049
There's an elderly person there.

906
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:03,480
- Let's go.
- Let's go. It's a green light.

907
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,349
- The elderly person.
- Instead of that...

908
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,579
Where do we go?
If we go to the restaurant...

909
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,519
Let's find someone
who lives locally.

910
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,990
- Hello.
- Hello.

911
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:12,490
Excuse us.

912
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,089
Are you a local resident?

913
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:15,390
- Do you live nearby?
- No.

914
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,960
- You don't live here?
- No?

915
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,130
Do you come here often to hike?

916
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,299
We do hike a lot,
but we came from that way today.

917
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:24,799
We couldn't find a decent trail,
so we're about to leave.

918
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,200
- I see.
- You came from another place?

919
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,839
- Yes. We came from Hongje-dong.
- From Hongje-dong?

920
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,240
Have you been to Ansan?

921
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,910
- Ansan?
- I know Ansan.

922
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,410
- I know Ansan.
- Ansan's worth checking out.

923
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,480
- Ansan...
- There are many trails.

924
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,779
- I see.
- Is there a gu-something mountain?

925
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,990
- What?
- Is there a gu-something mountain?

926
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,920
- "Gu-something san."
- Something looking like this.

927
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:47,490
The second
and fourth letters are wrong.

928
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,960
It's gu-something san-something.

929
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,500
- I don't know this area.
- You don't know.

930
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
(She hasn't heard of
a "gu something san.")

931
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,829
I wish you a happy new year.

932
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:58,470
- I wish you good health.
- Thanks. Congratulations.

933
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,869
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

934
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:02,910
- Bye.
- Happy New Year.

935
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,910
We must be there by 4 p.m.
How will we do that?

936
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,839
Let's head to
the seolleongtang place.

937
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:09,609
- The seolleongtang...
- Seok Sam.

938
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:12,720
- Floret.
- The restaurant owner must know.

939
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
- It's been around for 30 years.
- Yes.

940
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,150
They've worked here for years.

941
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,349
I think we should...

942
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,759
- ask a local.
- Let's ask the restaurant owner.

943
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,190
There must be something nearby.

944
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,190
The seolleongtang restaurant owner
will know.

945
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,500
- They've been here for decades.
- Hang on.

946
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,599
- Hello.
- What?

947
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,099
Is there a gu-something,
san-something nearby?

948
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:33,369
- "Gu-something, san-something."
- "San-something."

949
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,809
Something famous nearby...

950
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:39,309
(She knows something?)

951
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:40,579
You know?

952
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:42,410
(The slaves flock toward her.)

953
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,950
- You know?
- What is it?

954
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,519
- Gugi...
- What?

955
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,319
- What is it?
- Gugi what?

956
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,720
- What was that?
- It's all right!

957
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,559
- Hang on.
- It's okay!

958
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,819
- This is too much.
- It's okay.

959
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,130
Don't go too close.
Now you can talk.

960
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,759
- Not too close. It's too much.
- Gu...

961
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:02,130
Something like Gugisan Tunnel...

962
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,799
- Gugisan Tunnel?
- Gugisan?

963
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:07,200
(Gugisan Tunnel?)

964
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,839
Gugisan Tunnel's over there.

965
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,940
It's "Gugisan" then!

966
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,509
- It's Gugisan something.
- Gugisan...

967
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:13,680
- It's Gugisan something.
- Gugisan...

968
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,849
- It's Gugisan something.
- Yes, Gugisan something.

969
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:18,009
- Gugisan something.
- That's right.

970
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,720
- Gugisan. It must be that.
- It's that, isn't it?

971
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,920
- Thank you.
- Where are you headed?

972
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,690
I'm going home.

973
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,359
I had a lecture
at Sangmyung University.

974
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,690
- You're a university student.
- You go to Sangmyung University?

975
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,990
- Yes.
- Are you sure about Gugisan?

976
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,099
There is a Gugisan. Mount Gugi.

977
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,299
- It's over there.
- If you take the bus,

978
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:37,769
the announcement says
we pass the Gugisan Tunnel.

979
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,869
- Then it's Gugisan.
- Thank you.

980
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,210
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Bye.

981
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,410
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

982
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,240
- Gugi...
- Gugisan.

983
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,480
- Gugisan.
- Gugisan something.

984
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,710
- Gugisan something.
- Gugisan something.

985
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,450
- What could the last letter be?
- Gugisan...

986
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,480
That's what I want to know.

987
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,690
What does hair
have to do with Gugisan?

988
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,789
Exactly.

989
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,420
- Hair...
- It's hair.

990
00:31:58,759 --> 00:31:59,859
- What's that called?
- What is it?

991
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:01,890
Gugisan Mo!

992
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,230
Mo. Gugisan Mo.

993
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,089
- It wasn't that.
- It's not "mo."

994
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,430
- Mo.
- Everyone.

995
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,500
It's from a brush.
It's an old school.

996
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
- Yes.
- A village school...

997
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,140
- Wait!
- It's a village school.

998
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,599
Gugisan ink.

999
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,200
Something like "Gugisandang."

1000
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,009
- "Dang!"
- It could look similar to that.

1001
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:19,240
- "Dang?"
- "Gugisandang?"

1002
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,579
- "Dang" would work.
- Then...

1003
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:24,710
- shouldn't we go to university?
- Isn't that a university?

1004
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,980
(They went from
a village school to a university?)

1005
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,220
- "Gugisandang."
- Hey.

1006
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,250
Isn't that
Sangmyung University's old name?

1007
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,490
- Is it really?
- No.

1008
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,220
- Shouldn't we study with brushes?
- No.

1009
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,660
- Shouldn't we study with brushes?
- No.

1010
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,359
- You sound like a beggar.
- It's not that.

1011
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,430
- What slave...
- You need to learn...

1012
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,369
the basics of comic acting.

1013
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:44,730
You sound like a beggar.

1014
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,940
That's it!

1015
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,970
He did sitcoms.

1016
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,710
- He was on "Non Stop."
- He did sitcoms.

1017
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,910
- "Gugisandang?"
- "Gugisandang?"

1018
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,980
- That sounds plausible.
- Then...

1019
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,480
if you were to see Gugisan
in Chinese, would you recognize it?

1020
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,119
- Yes. I remember that.
- That's it.

1021
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,220
Let's confirm "Gugisan" first.

1022
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,420
Is there a sign
with "Gugisan" in Chinese?

1023
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,089
There must be one by the tunnel.

1024
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:09,089
Then let's go to the tunnel!

1025
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:11,589
- The name must be in Chinese.
- Yes.

1026
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:12,960
The tunnel name must be in Chinese.

1027
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,559
Let's go over there.

1028
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,500
What are the hairs for?
There must be a reason.

1029
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,599
Let's get in first.

1030
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:21,599
- Listen. I think it's a brush.
- Why?

1031
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,670
- We did a quiz in the morning.
- It's brush-related.

1032
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,740
- It's a brush.
- And we're slaves.

1033
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,710
We need to write.
We must learn something.

1034
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,910
I guess we need to write.

1035
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,579
I think the first three letters
are "Gugisan."

1036
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:34,980
- The last one is "dang" or...
- Something easy?

1037
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,650
- "Bang."
- "Bang."

1038
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:38,960
- "Dang" or "bang."
- How about this?

1039
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,390
Could it be this?

1040
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,529
How about this? "Gugisanjang."

1041
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,730
- "Sanjang?"
- "Gugisanjang."

1042
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,460
I thought you had a brainwave.

1043
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,400
- "Gugisanjang..."
- Floret.

1044
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,599
- Floret.
- It could exist.

1045
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,799
- What?
- The crew gave that to us.

1046
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,410
- Hair.
- Hair from a brush.

1047
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,940
- Floret.
- Schools use brushes.

1048
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,039
- Or "bang."
- Or "bang," like rooms.

1049
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,109
- Floret.
- It's "Gugisanbang..."

1050
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:02,750
- or "Gugisandang."
- Floret.

1051
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,380
- Floret, will you keep up?
- Hey.

1052
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,519
I don't have to keep up.
Think about it.

1053
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,720
- Floret.
- Floret!

1054
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,719
Floret.

1055
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:10,519
Floret.

1056
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,460
(It's her chance
to yell at the eldest.)

1057
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,289
You just love to be able to
talk casually to him.

1058
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:18,190
- You...
- She looks a bit dull.

1059
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,230
You don't have
anything to say to me.

1060
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,730
- You just enjoy talking freely.
- She's loving that.

1061
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,530
- Floret.
- No, I'm not!

1062
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,670
- Hunchet.
- Floret.

1063
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,139
That's not it. Hunchback.

1064
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,269
Floret.

1065
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:31,139
- Only you have a different opinion.
- That's not how you deduce things.

1066
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,940
- We'll go see if Gugi is right.
- Right.

1067
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,780
But Gugi...
Do you remember what it looks like?

1068
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,050
- The character for Gi.
- It goes like this. I know.

1069
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,219
- It looks like this.
- So...

1070
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,320
- This is what I think.
- Like this.

1071
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,880
If Gugi is right,

1072
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,489
- it's either Gugisanbang...
- That's right.

1073
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,949
- or Gugisandang.
- That's right.

1074
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,460
- We can go with one or the other.
- Yes, we can do that.

1075
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,460
- Let's go with Dang-digi-bang.
- Yes.

1076
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,590
There really is a Gugi Tunnel.

1077
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,760
There really is a Gugi Tunnel.

1078
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,400
Look for the small print.

1079
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,630
- We're almost at Gugi Tunnel.
- Gugi-dong...

1080
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,139
- Let's look now. Look carefully.
- If I see the Chinese characters...

1081
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,239
I need to see
the Chinese characters.

1082
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,570
Oh, there is the tunnel.

1083
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,239
- We'll be at the tunnel soon.
- Nice.

1084
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:07,110
- I think I see Chinese characters.
- It's Gugi Tunnel.

1085
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,949
- I think it's written at the front.
- Here's the tunnel.

1086
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:11,250
Could you let us out
near the tunnel?

1087
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,619
- Let's get off.
- Yes, let's get off.

1088
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:13,949
Let's look
at the Chinese characters.

1089
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:15,719
(They get off the bus near the tunnel
to check the characters.)

1090
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,050
- Let's take a look.
- This is Gugi Tunnel,

1091
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,320
but the Chinese characters
must not be written here.

1092
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,789
It doesn't have the name
of the tunnel written on here.

1093
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:20,920
This is Gugi Tunnel,

1094
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,989
but the Chinese characters
must not be written here.

1095
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:23,760
It doesn't have the name
of the tunnel written on here.

1096
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,389
Usually, the Chinese characters
are written on here.

1097
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:28,869
- We just need to see the Gi part.
- It's not written on here.

1098
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,929
- It doesn't have the characters.
- We should ask Mother-in-law.

1099
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:34,639
- It might be there if we go closer.
- We should ask Mother-in-law.

1100
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:36,769
- Mother-in-law.
- Here comes Mother-in-law.

1101
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:39,739
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Oh, my.

1102
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:41,139
- Hello.
- Hello.

1103
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,210
Hello.

1104
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,949
Could we ask you something
for a minute?

1105
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,480
- Is there perhaps...
- Yes?

1106
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,250
- This is Gugisan Tunnel, right?
- Yes.

1107
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,420
- This is Gugi Tunnel.
- Gugi Tunnel.

1108
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,289
Is there a mountain here
named Mount Gugi?

1109
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:53,760
- No.
- There is no Mount Gugi?

1110
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,929
- There is no Mount Gugi?
- Is that right?

1111
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,530
There is no Mount Gugi?

1112
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,929
- There's nothing called Mount Gugi?
- No.

1113
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:03,329
- Thank you.
- Anyway, I will...

1114
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,929
- Yes?
- go and try that.

1115
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,039
- This isn't where I live.
- Where are you going?

1116
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:09,110
- Is there Mount Gugi here?
- Pardon?

1117
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,039
- Is there Mount Gugi?
- Mount Gugi?

1118
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,909
This is Mount Bukhan.

1119
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:14,780
- That's right.
- Yes, Mount Bukhan. No Mount Gugi?

1120
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,349
- There are realtors down there.
- Right.

1121
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:18,309
- Let's go and visit them.
- Yes.

1122
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,550
- That's right.
- It must not be a mountain.

1123
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,750
- Jae Seok.
- Anyway, thank you.

1124
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,289
Let's look at a map.

1125
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:23,920
- Let's look at a map.
- Yes, that's the best.

1126
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,590
- We'll go to a realtor's office.
- A realtor's office.

1127
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,190
If we go to a realtor's office,

1128
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,820
- we'll see the Chinese character.
- Yes, the Gi character.

1129
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,130
- Here's the realtor's office.
- Yes, let's go.

1130
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,760
- There are several of them.
- Here's another one.

1131
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:34,260
Hello, ma'am.

1132
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,769
One second. So...

1133
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,670
Around here,
is there maybe a place called...

1134
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,500
Gugisandang or Gugisandang?

1135
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,639
Sanbang?

1136
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,579
Is there Mount Gugi?

1137
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:47,980
(If there is no Mount Gugi,
their deductions are back to square one.)

1138
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,280
Is there perhaps...

1139
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,380
There is no Mount Gugi.

1140
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,980
- No, right?
- Or a place that makes brushes?

1141
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,719
- Let's check the characters first.
- Yes, the Chinese characters.

1142
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,889
- Could we see the Gi character?
- Could we look at a map?

1143
00:36:55,889 --> 00:36:57,190
- The Gi character is Gugi.
- Oh, my.

1144
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,289
- Hey, take...
- I'm curious too.

1145
00:36:58,289 --> 00:36:59,719
Hey, Dog Turd, take a good look.

1146
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,019
- Take a good look.
- Hello.

1147
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,289
- I've seen you a lot before.
- Oh, yes. Hello.

1148
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,800
- The Chinese characters...
- Oh, hello.

1149
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,099
- How do we check the characters?
- Won't it be on the map?

1150
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,300
Do you have a map
with Chinese characters?

1151
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,929
We don't have maps
with Chinese characters.

1152
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,599
- Teach them the characters.
- For Gugi...

1153
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:18,369
- What does the Gi character mean?
- What does it mean?

1154
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,480
(It has to be Gugi
so they have some idea.)

1155
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,079
(The realtor searches online
for them.)

1156
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,510
- The Gi in Gugi-dong is this.
- The Gi character is...

1157
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,079
- Here it is.
- They must've searched online.

1158
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,019
- It's not this, is it?
- It's not.

1159
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:30,289
This isn't the Gi character you saw,
is it?

1160
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,889
- Then it must not be Gugi.
- This is...

1161
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:33,960
- Then we must be completely wrong.
- We were...

1162
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,690
totally on the wrong track
because of that person earlier.

1163
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,030
- I'm sorry. Thank you.
- Sorry.

1164
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,760
- Jong Kook!
- It must not be Gugi-dong.

1165
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,199
We were on the wrong track.

1166
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,170
- Why?
- I told you so.

1167
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,369
- It wasn't Gugi.
- Then what is it?

1168
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:47,940
- The Gu in Gugi doesn't mean nine.
- Right.

1169
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,969
- We believed that person earlier...
- This part...

1170
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,880
Is there a gu-something,
san-something nearby?

1171
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,980
Something like Gugisan Tunnel...

1172
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,550
- Gugisan Tunnel?
- Gugisan?

1173
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,780
- It's Gugisan something.
- Yes, Gugisan something.

1174
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,019
(They decided it was Gugisan
on their own at an unsure answer.)

1175
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:05,119
- Well, she's not at fault.
- That's right.

1176
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,260
She was just trying to help us.

1177
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,420
So, let's look forward
and keep going.

1178
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,059
- Don't think about the past.
- Okay.

1179
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,429
- Right. Just look forward and go.
- Indeed, April.

1180
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:13,829
Gu-something san...

1181
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,460
So, it's not Gugi.

1182
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,230
- It's not Gi.
- Then what is it?

1183
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,340
(They must decide where to go
based on just two hints again.)

1184
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,699
This is hard.

1185
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,570
- Where on earth is this?
- Let's go.

1186
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:24,869
- We were hooked on Gugi-dong.
- I know.

1187
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,710
(Their deductions so far include
a brush and a village school.)

1188
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,550
This is what I think.

1189
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:34,480
- It must be near Insa-dong.
- Insa-dong?

1190
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,719
Where they sell brushes.

1191
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:37,849
Oh, Insa-dong.

1192
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,889
- Right, Insa-dong.
- Then, let's go to Insa-dong.

1193
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,289
They sell brushes near Insa-dong.

1194
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:43,360
Should we go to an art supply store?

1195
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,829
- Let's do that.
- It's an old place.

1196
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:45,860
Yes, let's try that.

1197
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,230
- We'll go toward Insa-dong.
- Yes, to Insa-dong.

1198
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,429
Let's go.

1199
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:50,730
It might be someplace
like an art supply store.

1200
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,969
Our outfits are perfect
for Insa-dong.

1201
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,670
- Many places end in "bang."
- There are.

1202
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:57,139
- Hey, this place.
- Oh, look.

1203
00:38:57,139 --> 00:38:59,139
- Many places end in "bang."
- Look at the brushes.

1204
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:01,179
- Brushes, hanji, and so on.
- This place is huge.

1205
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:02,409
And there are lots
of Chinese characters.

1206
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:04,809
- Since that's the case...
- So many places end in sanbang.

1207
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,280
- He could take a look and...
- If I see it...

1208
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,519
He'll know if he sees it.

1209
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,920
Hey, there's another one.
Songjukpilbang.

1210
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:12,420
- Many places end in bang.
- The Chinese characters...

1211
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,619
Gu-something, san-something.

1212
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,420
- This one ends in dang.
- Hey, there's one with dang too.

1213
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,860
- It could be dang.
- Gosh, how confusing.

1214
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,230
We were thinking about dang or bang.

1215
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,230
- It's either dang or bang.
- Yes, it's either dang or bang.

1216
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,929
- Bang or dang.
- Se Chan,

1217
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,530
look at the Chinese characters.

1218
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,900
But there aren't
any Chinese characters.

1219
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,099
- There aren't?
- He can't read them.

1220
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,199
- Maybe like the oldest...
- An art supply store?

1221
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,340
- art supply store or something.
- Bang or dang.

1222
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,579
Gosh, people will be shocked
if we get off looking like this.

1223
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,380
- Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.
- Hello.

1224
00:39:35,949 --> 00:39:37,110
That's right.

1225
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,679
Goodness, hello.

1226
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:41,250
Yes, I'm that person.

1227
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,789
You can greet us happily. Hello.

1228
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:45,019
Have you been well?

1229
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:46,760
(Have you been well?)

1230
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,159
(The group of slaves ended up
in the middle of Insa-dong.)

1231
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:49,429
All right. Let's take a look.

1232
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,760
Hey, there are so many people
in Insa-dong.

1233
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,199
Wearing this outfit here is...

1234
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,599
- even more embarrassing.
- I know.

1235
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,230
This is like that penalty.

1236
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,800
Guys,
find Chinese characters for me.

1237
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:01,769
- Bang...
- Pilbang.

1238
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:03,510
- Well, so...
- I need to see the characters.

1239
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,409
- An old something here...
- Dang or bang.

1240
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:07,739
- That's it.
- Is that the character you saw?

1241
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,650
- At the end of the name. Bang.
- Where?

1242
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,280
- Where does it say that?
- Look at it.

1243
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,619
This place is called "Myeongsindang
Art Supply and Brush Store."

1244
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,920
(Exclaiming)

1245
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,119
- Is that the character you saw?
- It must be. It looks similar.

1246
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,019
- No.
- That's not it?

1247
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:20,690
- I don't think so.
- The one on the right.

1248
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,360
- That's the character for bang.
- Is that bang?

1249
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,559
- Yes.
- That's the character for bang.

1250
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:24,989
- Is that the right character?
- Isn't that the one?

1251
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,300
I think it might be right.

1252
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:27,860
It's either dang or bang.

1253
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,070
(The final character
that Se Chan saw...)

1254
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,639
(is the character for bang!)

1255
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:36,570
(The character on the sign...)

1256
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,610
(and the character in the answer
are a match!)

1257
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,610
- Gu-something...
- Hey, be sure.

1258
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,250
- Gu-something sanbang.
- Yes.

1259
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:45,550
- Gu-something sanbang.
- Gu-something sanbang.

1260
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:47,519
- Is it right?
- Jae Seok, I think it's right.

1261
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,949
- Right, I think it is.
- The thing that goes like this.

1262
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:51,750
(Se Chan recognized it!)

1263
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:53,659
- How could you write it like that?
- He says it looks similar.

1264
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,860
- I drew a square. I went like this.
- Here?

1265
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,929
- Gu-something sanbang.
- Gu-something sanbang.

1266
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,829
Seok Jin, the gu-something part.
I'll know when I see it.

1267
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:02,630
- He knows the second character.
- I'll definitely recognize it.

1268
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:03,969
By the way,
there are lots of delicious...

1269
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:06,400
- Look, Myeong-dong kalguksu.
- I love Myeong-dong...

1270
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,699
(Myeong-dong kalguksu)

1271
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,070
I love Myeong-dong Gyoza.

1272
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,809
- What do I do?
- That's different, though.

1273
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:15,039
I have to eat that now.

1274
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,110
Do you have money?

1275
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,150
- I'll pay you back.
- What about wire transfer?

1276
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,250
- What do I do?
- Wire transfer.

1277
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,420
Oh, but Myeong-dong...

1278
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,789
- Dullard, I want kalguksu.
- Hey, Hunchback.

1279
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:28,889
Then, let's look for
Gu-something sanbang.

1280
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:30,530
We should go
and ask somewhere around here.

1281
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,599
Let's go to an art supply store.
That last place seemed good.

1282
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:33,960
- An art supply store?
- Sanbang...

1283
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,260
- The place where they sell brushes?
- That's right.

1284
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,070
- Let's go to the brush store. Good.
- Then we have to go back.

1285
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,769
By the way, Floret.

1286
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,099
Floret.

1287
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,239
- Yes, why?
- Did you see Myeong-dong kalguksu?

1288
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,369
Hey.

1289
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:46,139
- Should we go and eat in secret?
- Do you have money?

1290
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:47,210
- Me too.
- I just...

1291
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,909
- I just have Samsung Pay.
- Take us too.

1292
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:50,480
- The five of us.
- Samsung Pay.

1293
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,849
Hey, guys!

1294
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,349
- Floret, just go for it.
- And will you help me if I do?

1295
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:55,480
In secret.

1296
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:58,289
Hey, where are you going? Wait up!

1297
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,789
Let's go in here and ask.

1298
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:03,989
Oh, brushes. Oh, here it is.

1299
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:05,760
- There are brushes here.
- Yes, brushes.

1300
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,630
- Let's try going in.
- Ma'am. Here she comes.

1301
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,070
- Ma'am, excuse us.
- Yes, hello.

1302
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,369
Is there perhaps...

1303
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,869
a place called Gu-something sanbang?

1304
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:17,039
(Is there a place called
Gu-something sanbang?)

1305
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:19,409
Is there a place called
Gu-something sanbang?

1306
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,750
- Yes, there is.
- Where?

1307
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,309
- Take a right at the intersection.
- What?

1308
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,719
- Really?
- What is it called?

1309
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:28,320
- Guhasanbang.
- Guhasanbang!

1310
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:30,550
(There is a place called
Guhasanbang!)

1311
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,920
- Oh, really?
- What kind of place is it, ma'am?

1312
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,659
- It's a calligraphy store.
- A calligraphy store.

1313
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,489
Take a right at the intersection?

1314
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:36,960
Yes,
take a right at the intersection.

1315
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,599
- Thank you!
- Thank you, ma'am. Guhasanbang.

1316
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,099
- See? Hey, Guha...
- Hey, this place...

1317
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:42,159
- Guhasanbang.
- This must be...

1318
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,670
- It was Guhasanbang.
- a very famous place.

1319
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:46,599
- I'll push for it. Help me out.
- Thank you.

1320
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:48,199
I'll push for it. Help me.

1321
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,739
- He'll push for it.
- Okay. Go.

1322
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:51,070
- Hey.
- Go.

1323
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,940
- Hey, Bucktooth.
- What?

1324
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,380
- Hey, so...
- Yes.

1325
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,679
- Before we go to Guhasanbang,
- Just a little...

1326
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:57,150
- how about kalguksu...
- No kalguksu.

1327
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,349
Right now, Guhasanbang is...

1328
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:01,050
It's not my opinion.

1329
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:04,750
- It's the master's orders.
- Hey.

1330
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,820
- Floret, why are you doing that?
- Floret, right now, we are...

1331
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,789
Gosh, Floret.

1332
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:11,389
- Hey, you...
- Please.

1333
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,500
Please stop losing your minds
over food.

1334
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,059
- Hunchback, you...
- Hunchback.

1335
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,130
- I'll smack you.
- I want some red bean porridge.

1336
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,030
Come on, Floret.

1337
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:20,500
Where is Guhasanbang?

1338
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,739
- Oh, there it is! Guhasanbang.
- Where?

1339
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,309
On the left.

1340
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:25,440
Is it on the left?

1341
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:27,179
- Guhasanbang.
- Here it is.

1342
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:29,039
- Guhasanbang.
- Guhasanbang is here.

1343
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,349
- Guhasanbang. It's right there.
- Oh, it's here.

1344
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,519
- This is it. Guhasanbang.
- Guha...

1345
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:34,820
Yes, it's right!
That's the Chinese character.

1346
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,250
- Is that it?
- The first brush store in Korea.

1347
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,519
(They came to the right place!)

1348
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:38,989
- Is that it?
- The first brush store in Korea.

1349
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:40,119
- Those are the right characters.
- You're right.

1350
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:41,590
- Guhasanbang. Is that it?
- Hey, the Chinese characters...

1351
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,030
- The characters...
- You're right.

1352
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,190
The characters look similar.

1353
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,000
- Gosh, my head hurts.
- What is this?

1354
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,300
It's like this. I don't know.

1355
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,630
- This one...
- Isn't that "jeon?"

1356
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,769
- Guhasanbang. Is that it?
- Hey, the Chinese characters...

1357
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:51,170
- The characters...
- You're right.

1358
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,469
- The characters look similar.
- Oh, is that it?

1359
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:54,900
- It's similar.
- I told you so, right?

1360
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,940
- Right, Guhasanbang.
- It's similar.

1361
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,239
I said it must be
the first something in Korea.

1362
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:59,480
- The first brush store.
- It's the first one.

1363
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,940
- The first brush store?
- A brush store.

1364
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,579
- I was right.
- Yes, let's go in.

1365
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:03,949
This is it.

1366
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:05,309
Hello, ma'am.

1367
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:08,619
(The inside is full of old things.)

1368
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,849
- Is this Guhasanbang?
- That's right.

1369
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,889
- Is this the first brush store?
- Yes.

1370
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:14,760
How old is this place?

1371
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,760
- It has been around for 113 years.
- Gosh, 113 years.

1372
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:20,699
You've made it to the place
for the master's first errand.

1373
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,659
Having opened in 1913,

1374
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:24,869
this is
the oldest calligraphy store.

1375
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:25,969
Gosh, this place...

1376
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:28,369
No way. Is this...

1377
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:29,710
These are the brushes.

1378
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,269
The brushes made here
were of high quality...

1379
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:32,840
and supplied to the palace.

1380
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,510
- Really?
- It is said that King Gojong...

1381
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:36,610
and King Sunjong
both used their brushes.

1382
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,079
- Over there,
- Yes?

1383
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,480
- it reads "Gosuneoyong."
- Right.

1384
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,989
That means
this was the first store...

1385
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:46,190
King Gojong and King Sunjong
got their brushes.

1386
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,320
I see.

1387
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,590
- No way.
- For real?

1388
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,929
We're here at a historic place.

1389
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,329
Those are the brushes used...

1390
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,159
by those who paint drunk.

1391
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,769
- Like in the movie "Chihwaseon."
- Yes, "Chihwaseon."

1392
00:44:56,769 --> 00:44:58,929
- They're different.
- Check this out.

1393
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,239
It's made with everything
including wool.

1394
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:02,769
(An inkstone is spotted.)

1395
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,809
Should there be a flea
that goes with it?

1396
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:08,380
- It's called an inkstone.
- It's an inkstone, not a flea.

1397
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,480
- Right, an inkstone.
- A flea.

1398
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,949
(It's Brainiac's first time
at a calligraphy store.)

1399
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,650
I wanted to show you
an inkstone used in the past...

1400
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:17,489
which is why I have these out.

1401
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:18,920
- Used in the past?
- Yes.

1402
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,489
- They do seem old.
- How old are they?

1403
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:23,329
- They're from the Joseon Dynasty.
- Really?

1404
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:26,099
- Were they actually used?
- These were used...

1405
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,900
- by painters at the Office of Art.
- I see.

1406
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,670
Ink sticks were ground
on one side...

1407
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:32,000
while the other side
was used for coloring.

1408
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,639
This is where
the different colors went.

1409
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:37,809
- No way.
- Is this a museum?

1410
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:40,179
- How fascinating.
- And this...

1411
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,809
What do you think this is?

1412
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:43,780
- Is it bamboo?
- Yes, it's an inkstone...

1413
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,909
made out of bamboo.

1414
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,420
- Is that even possible?
- A bamboo inkstone?

1415
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,920
On it, it reads "Chimuk..."

1416
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,789
which means drunk on ink.

1417
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,750
You don't easily
come across inkstones these days,

1418
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,389
so I wanted to show you these.

1419
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:57,690
Meanwhile, this is an inkstone
made out of jade.

1420
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,130
This was one
that would be carried around...

1421
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,760
- to use on the road.
- It was portable.

1422
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:05,670
This was used to rest the hand...

1423
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,199
- while writing.
- It's a palm rest.

1424
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:09,000
- Like when you use the mouse.
- It's like a wrist rest.

1425
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,070
That'd be the equivalent of it.

1426
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,510
- What on earth are these?
- Check these out.

1427
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,480
I can't believe it.

1428
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:18,949
Here's the errand you must run
for your master at this place.

1429
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:22,150
You must buy a brush, paper,
and an inkstone.

1430
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:25,420
(The Master's Errands)

1431
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,920
- A brush, paper, and an inkstone?
- Yes.

1432
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,989
This.

1433
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:29,119
(He hands in the brush hair
they were given as a clue.)

1434
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,130
We were told to come here with that.

1435
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:32,530
- One that is brown too.
- Are these brush hairs?

1436
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:34,300
What is that though?
Are those from a horse?

1437
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,659
No, this is wool.

1438
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,000
- Wool?
- Yes.

1439
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,570
I studied calligraphy as a kid.

1440
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,639
- Same here.
- Me too.

1441
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:41,070
Classes were taken by kids
who had issues focusing.

1442
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,099
- That was me.
- You're right.

1443
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,739
Right?
That's why I took classes too.

1444
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:44,940
- Those who couldn't focus...
- These three?

1445
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,739
- Yes. Here you go.
- Thank you, ma'am.

1446
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:48,480
The pleasure's mine. Thank you.

1447
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,880
Thank you. The joy was ours.

1448
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,010
Goodness.

1449
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,949
I'm lucky to have met
such precious people.

1450
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:55,079
- Goodness.
- Thank you.

1451
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,920
- Ma'am, you're...
- You said that so calmly.

1452
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,219
How elegant of you.

1453
00:46:58,219 --> 00:46:59,349
Yes, she sounds elegant.

1454
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,920
- I learned a lot today.
- You are a woman of class.

1455
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,519
Yes, she's classy.

1456
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:05,130
- Now, the slaves will get lost.
- We should go.

1457
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:06,900
- Right.
- Let's get going. Thank you.

1458
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,599
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

1459
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:09,900
- Thank you so much.
- Goodness.

1460
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,829
- I appreciate it.
- Have a good day.

1461
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,400
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

1462
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,500
Hunchback, come on.

1463
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,239
Getting here wasn't easy.

1464
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:18,469
- It was tough.
- I know.

1465
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:19,909
I'm proud of how
we guessed it though.

1466
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:24,179
You were able to complete
your first errand with no fuss.

1467
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:26,719
- Right.
- This is the next errand's clue.

1468
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,019
- We're eating.
- Which is?

1469
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:30,489
- Food.
- You can see it together.

1470
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:31,789
- Together?
- Okay, together.

1471
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,190
(They check the video together.)

1472
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,820
- We're eating.
- We're to watch it together.

1473
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,920
Is it a video?

1474
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:37,860
- Yes, it's a video.
- It's from "Rustic Period."

1475
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:39,190
"Rustic Period?"

1476
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:44,469
(Like Se Chan guessed,
it's a scene from "Rustic Period.")

1477
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:47,340
<i>My dear friend</i>

1478
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:49,000
Is this an actual scene?

1479
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:51,110
Are we going to find
something of Kim Doo Han's?

1480
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,880
(Singing together in tears
at a restaurant)

1481
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,309
(Just then)

1482
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:59,550
Imun Diner?

1483
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,179
Our errand must be
to get a bowl of gukbap.

1484
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:03,250
Isn't Imun Diner
the place that serves seolleongtang?

1485
00:48:03,389 --> 00:48:04,519
- Do you know that place?
- It's nearby.

1486
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:05,590
- You know it?
- Really?

1487
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:07,059
After checking the clue, discuss,

1488
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:09,090
- and move to a location.
- We know where to go.

1489
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,260
- Imun Diner.
- The seolleongtang place.

1490
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,860
- It's the longest-running place.
- It's the longest-running...

1491
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,860
- seolleongtang place.
- That's right.

1492
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,030
- Right.
- Also, it's where...

1493
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,159
Kim Doo Han frequented.

1494
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:16,369
- Is that where we go?
- We should go...

1495
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:17,570
where Kim Doo Han used to eat.

1496
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:19,530
- They serve boiled pork slices.
- I can't take these three.

1497
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,070
- You get what you wish for.
- Right.

1498
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,199
- Exactly.
- Unbelievable.

1499
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,369
- They're an eyesore.
- I didn't know.

1500
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:26,010
I haven't been
to Imun Diner before though.

1501
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,280
This is my first time
hearing the name.

1502
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,510
- Then...
- Let's ask some people.

1503
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,110
- We should ask.
- I bet she knows.

1504
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,610
- Ma'am.
- Imun Diner.

1505
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,750
- How do we get to Imun Diner?
- The seolleongtang place.

1506
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,880
Imun Diner?
It's right around the corner.

1507
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,250
- Around the corner?
- Really?

1508
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,150
Do we just have
to walk around the corner?

1509
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,489
- Yes.
- This way?

1510
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:42,789
Down this alley and to the left.

1511
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:44,630
- I see. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1512
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,929
- Nice.
- It's been standing for 100 years.

1513
00:48:46,929 --> 00:48:48,260
- Really?
- About 100 years.

1514
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,929
We must be seeking out restaurants
with a history of 100 years.

1515
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,699
It's been around for a long time.

1516
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:53,670
We recognized it immediately.

1517
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,239
Jae Seok managed
to read the Chinese characters.

1518
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:58,269
The letters were easy.

1519
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:03,679
(The fans of "Rustic Period"
are excited.)

1520
00:49:04,179 --> 00:49:05,809
<i>- Passion</i>
<i>- Passion and romance</i>

1521
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:07,150
Kim Doo Han.

1522
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,150
- "I am Kim Doo Han of Jongno."
- Right.

1523
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,150
- That was his line.
- Right.

1524
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,920
- "I am..."
- I'm more like Sirasoni.

1525
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:12,690
I'm a lone wolf.

1526
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:13,989
I'm Head-butter of Pyongyang.

1527
00:49:13,989 --> 00:49:15,219
- Pyongyang?
- Head-butter of Pyongyang.

1528
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:17,360
- I'm Head-butter of Pyongyang!
- Right, him.

1529
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,059
Wasn't this featured
in the movie "The General's Son..."

1530
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:22,000
- that was about Kim Doo Han?
- The place for gukbap.

1531
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,369
- Exactly.
- Originally...

1532
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,199
- Floret can be Gumajeok.
- Gumajeok.

1533
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:26,469
Imun Diner, was it?

1534
00:49:26,469 --> 00:49:28,000
- Do you know Imun Diner?
- Imun.

1535
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,170
We're just heading down here...

1536
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,269
- to see if there's anything.
- We're taking the long route.

1537
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:32,510
- If we're lucky...
- It'll show if we're lucky.

1538
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,840
Imun... They say it's there.

1539
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,039
- It's over there.
- Where?

1540
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:36,949
- On the opposite side.
- The opposite side?

1541
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:38,579
- Yes. There!
- Where?

1542
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:40,349
- Where?
- She's an energetic one.

1543
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:41,679
- Have you tried the food?
- Is it this?

1544
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,090
No, it's up there.

1545
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,750
- Where?
- Follow me.

1546
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:45,920
She says to follow her.

1547
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,820
- Where?
- She's a social butterfly.

1548
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,519
- A social butterfly.
- A social butterfly.

1549
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:50,860
- The social butterfly of Insa-dong.
- A social butterfly.

1550
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,260
What's your MBTI personality?

1551
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,500
I'm an ESFP.

1552
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,000
- An ESFP?
- That's my personality!

1553
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,570
- Yes!
- An ESFP.

1554
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:57,699
An ESFP.

1555
00:49:57,699 --> 00:49:59,369
- Of course she's an extrovert.
- There's no doubt about it.

1556
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:02,000
- Extroverts are this cheery.
- An ESFP.

1557
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,570
Look. She's in front of the camera
like she's one of the members.

1558
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:05,710
Where to?

1559
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,539
- Keep walking.
- We're to keep walking.

1560
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,539
- It must not be around here.
- Hold on.

1561
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:10,949
- Is this your lunch break?
- We need to walk more.

1562
00:50:10,949 --> 00:50:12,280
- Yes.
- Have you eaten?

1563
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,650
- Yes, I have.
- You have?

1564
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,250
(With the free-spirited ESFP
as their escort)

1565
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,820
- Over there.
- It's here!

1566
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,019
- Here it is.
- Got it.

1567
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:21,590
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

1568
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,460
- Bye.
- What's your name?

1569
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,590
It's Cho Seo Hyeon.

1570
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,889
- Seo Hyeon, bye.
- Seo Hyeon, thanks.

1571
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,400
- Nice.
- You're the best.

1572
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,429
She's extremely cheery.

1573
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:29,730
We almost didn't find it.

1574
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,929
We might not have found it
without her.

1575
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,170
This is a future legacy
of Seoul as well.

1576
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,940
(The Chinese characters match that
from the scene in "Rustic Period.")

1577
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,079
We need to hear about this place.
This is it, right?

1578
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,440
I think I ate at Imun Diner once.

1579
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,949
You did a good job
of arriving at the location...

1580
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:46,750
where you must be
for the second errand.

1581
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:48,650
You're at a restaurant...

1582
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:51,389
that opened in 1904 during Joseon
and the Korean Empire.

1583
00:50:51,389 --> 00:50:52,789
- It's the oldest restaurant...
- Really?

1584
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:54,690
that dates back 121 years.

1585
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,260
The Japan-Korea Treaty
was signed in 1905.

1586
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:59,030
Imun at the time was the name
of the checkpoint of the capital,

1587
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,659
and a firewood market
was popular around this area.

1588
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,730
At first, it opened as Imun Diner,

1589
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,800
but it changed its name
during the Japanese colonial era...

1590
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,670
to Imun Seolleongtang.

1591
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:08,900
It changed its name.

1592
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,440
It's been open for a long time.

1593
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,369
Like you said earlier,

1594
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,110
- the general's son Kim Doo Han...
- See?

1595
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,309
was said to have worked here...

1596
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:18,449
during his teenage years.

1597
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:20,050
- Really?
- I think it was in...

1598
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:22,719
- "The General's Son."
- Here's your errand.

1599
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:25,849
Your master hasn't had
much of an appetite lately.

1600
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,989
- What about us?
- Won't we get to eat?

1601
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:29,519
Won't we get to eat?

1602
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,460
For your master,

1603
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,730
you will eat the seolleongtang...

1604
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,800
and describe the taste
in the most appealing way.

1605
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:38,429
(The Master's Errands)

1606
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,739
(2. Describe the taste
after enjoying the seolleongtang.)

1607
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:42,170
- Nice.
- Good!

1608
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:44,210
I thought we had
to deliver a bowl to him.

1609
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:47,210
We all badly wanted
seolleongtang today.

1610
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,409
- For some reason.
- It was weird.

1611
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:51,179
- Order to go,
- I love it.

1612
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:52,579
- and you'll enjoy it...
- Nice.

1613
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:53,579
someplace else.

1614
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:55,949
- Yes!
- Nice!

1615
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:57,690
Since this concerns food, you and...

1616
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:59,250
The two of us will go.

1617
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,760
- And Hunchback.
- It'll be the three of us.

1618
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,059
Hunchback and Dullard.

1619
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:03,119
- Go ahead.
- Come on.

1620
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,460
- No way.
- My gosh.

1621
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,260
They serve huge slices of meat...

1622
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,599
which makes the broth to die for.

1623
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,159
This looks delicious
with the huge slices of meat.

1624
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,369
- Gosh, that looks good.
- That looks incredible.

1625
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:12,769
The kimchi looks insane.

1626
00:52:12,769 --> 00:52:14,269
Gosh, check out the kimchi.

1627
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:15,539
It smells incredible.

1628
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:16,739
Smell the kkakdugi.

1629
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:18,539
No way, it's Ji Ye Eun.

1630
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:19,809
Gosh, hello.

1631
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:22,210
(The rising star just had
to be dressed like a beggar.)

1632
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:23,550
That looks good.

1633
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,750
- Are you embarrassed?
- Yes.

1634
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:25,849
Don't be.

1635
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,250
I'm embarrassed.

1636
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:29,219
(Sniffing)

1637
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:30,519
It smells incredible.

1638
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:32,090
- Smell the kkakdugi.
- It's to die for.

1639
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,820
Do you serve it in a larger size?

1640
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,989
- Yes, we do.
- We'll take that.

1641
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:37,159
- It has more garnish.
- We'll take that.

1642
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:38,690
- Seven bowls.
- Seven bowls.

1643
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,329
- And...
- Be generous with the kkakdugi.

1644
00:52:40,329 --> 00:52:42,059
- And the meat.
- Sure.

1645
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,429
- Seven bowls.
- And knee cartilage.

1646
00:52:43,429 --> 00:52:44,570
- Sure.
- Good.

1647
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,170
- Are we good?
- Floret, did you order?

1648
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:48,000
- Yes, it'll be delivered.
- Did you place the order?

1649
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,599
- Let's go, then.
- I'm glad you ordered a big bowl.

1650
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,969
- He'll be generous with the meat.
- Why doubt us?

1651
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:52,010
No way.

1652
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,070
(They move to where they can eat.)

1653
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:56,010
- Hello.
- Hello, everyone.

1654
00:52:56,849 --> 00:52:59,250
They're having iced Americano
after their lunch.

1655
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:00,920
- You know...
- Yes?

1656
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,880
Because of how we look today...

1657
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,420
We seem more approachable, right?

1658
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,489
- They want to catch us on camera.
- Right.

1659
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:09,820
It's hilarious to see us
roaming the streets like this.

1660
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,090
Of course we'll stand out.

1661
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,130
We'll stand out for sure.

1662
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,230
(They see their hideous reflection
in the window.)

1663
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,599
Do we cross the street?

1664
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,130
You'll cross the street!

1665
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,829
We're crossing the street.

1666
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:19,940
(After crossing the street...)

1667
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,400
- Hold on.
- I thought it'd be connected.

1668
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,739
I thought that too.

1669
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:24,809
(Only by themselves)

1670
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:26,639
The streets are bustling today.

1671
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:28,340
- Because it's lunch hour.
- It's their lunch break.

1672
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,440
That must be why.

1673
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,380
- They come out to eat.
- They're out to grab their lunch.

1674
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,449
Look around us.
They're all taking photos.

1675
00:53:35,449 --> 00:53:37,889
(Swarming)

1676
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:39,960
Hello. Happy New Year.

1677
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,619
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

1678
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:42,820
- Happy New Year.
- Please help us.

1679
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,659
The pajamas sold by Ji Hyo
are pretty.

1680
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:48,500
The new pajamas she launched
are cute.

1681
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,170
- The perfume is just as nice.
- I should buy one.

1682
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,570
It's pretty
with the underwear and everything.

1683
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:53,599
(They arrive at a place
to eat their seolleongtang.)

1684
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:56,239
- Goodness.
- Will this be an eating show?

1685
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,440
What will we be doing here?

1686
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,940
- Is this where we eat?
- Are we eating here?

1687
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,940
- Is this where we'll eat?
- Hold on.

1688
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,010
- What do you mean?
- Will we be eating here?

1689
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,679
- It suits us.
- Are we sitting on the ground?

1690
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:03,949
Because we're slaves.

1691
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,409
It's finally meal time...

1692
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,050
which is what the slaves
have been dying for all day.

1693
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,980
- Okay!
- We should be fed.

1694
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,550
It wouldn't be easy
for all the slaves...

1695
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,320
to get a taste of the seolleongtang.

1696
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,760
- What?
- Don't do that!

1697
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,590
- Please, don't.
- Seriously?

1698
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,130
Don't do that!

1699
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,230
Look here, Director!

1700
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,260
- That's too mean.
- Since 10 a.m. this morning,

1701
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,260
we've been talking
about seolleongtang.

1702
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,730
If you want to fill your stomach
with seolleongtang,

1703
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:27,070
you must succeed in
jumping rope as a group.

1704
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,239
We can do this. Wait, Ye Eun.

1705
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:30,940
After all seven of you
stand in the middle,

1706
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,269
you must do the actions
to the children's song,

1707
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:35,110
- "Kid, kid."
<i>- Kid, kid</i>

1708
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:36,510
(Turn around, Touch the ground,
Say, "Hurrah," Take your leave)

1709
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:37,679
- I can do this.
<i>- Kid, kid</i>

1710
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:39,050
- We have to do this?
<i>- Touch</i>

1711
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:41,280
(Turn around, Touch the ground,
Say, "Hurrah," Take your leave)

1712
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,650
(They must do all of these actions
to succeed.)

1713
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,119
<i>- Kid, kid</i>
- And then, we have to get out.

1714
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:45,320
<i>- Take your leave</i>
<i>- Take your leave, goodbye</i>

1715
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,489
- And then you have to leave.
- Then we leave.

1716
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:48,119
- We have to touch the ground.
- That's hard.

1717
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,489
If you succeed,
we'll give you seven bowls.

1718
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:51,489
Okay, there are seven of us.

1719
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:52,630
- For each try after that,
- I don't think we can do this.

1720
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:55,429
- you'll get fewer bowls.
- Oh, okay. Got it.

1721
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:57,599
- Nice.
- Let's succeed and get seven bowls.

1722
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,570
Hey, Hunchback. If we can't eat
because of you, I'll hate you.

1723
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:01,599
Floret.

1724
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,269
- Let's decide on the order first.
- You can go in, right?

1725
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:05,070
- Jae Seok, you're number one.
- I'll go first.

1726
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:07,510
- Behind him, Seok Jin?
- No, I'll go last.

1727
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,980
- Haha.
- Am I third?

1728
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,110
- Am I fourth? Third?
- I'll go here.

1729
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,349
You're 3rd. And Jong Kook is 4th.

1730
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,449
- And me. But Seok Jin can't do it.
- Okay, I'm fourth.

1731
00:55:13,449 --> 00:55:15,119
- I can do it.
- All right. Let's try it.

1732
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,150
(They start practicing first.)

1733
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:19,090
- I have to go in first.
- This is hard.

1734
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,219
- No.
- What's wrong with you?

1735
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,159
(Getting hit in the face)

1736
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:26,329
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me.

1737
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:28,360
- Why were you so confident?
- What was that?

1738
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,730
- "It's fine. I'll go."
- Gosh, hey.

1739
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:32,070
- Hey, the rope hit my forehead...
- Bucktooth.

1740
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,969
- I mean...
- Got it was just...

1741
00:55:33,969 --> 00:55:35,539
- a huge smack.
- You acted like you were good.

1742
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:37,539
- What's wrong with you, Bucktooth?
- You have to go in here.

1743
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:39,340
- It's easier if you go in this way.
- Okay.

1744
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,440
- Not the left.
- Which way will you face?

1745
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,639
- Which way? This way?
- Right now.

1746
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,780
- This way is hard.
- Yes, it's hard.

1747
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,250
- There you go. Nice.
- Oh, my.

1748
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,050
- Gosh, no.
- Nice.

1749
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,119
(April got caught in the rope.)

1750
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:51,550
- Who was that?
- Gosh, April!

1751
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,619
- I went in well.
- Come on, April.

1752
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:54,820
- I went in well.
- April.

1753
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,989
- Hey, but this is...
- We just have to go in like now.

1754
00:55:56,989 --> 00:55:58,230
- We went in well.
- Yes, you did well.

1755
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,329
We went in well.

1756
00:55:59,329 --> 00:56:00,730
- Hey, I...
- Yes?

1757
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,699
Why are you doing that?
You'll start coughing in the cold.

1758
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:05,329
I didn't tell the master, but I
bought a lightweight puffer jacket.

1759
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:06,369
Oh, a lightweight puffer jacket.

1760
00:56:08,269 --> 00:56:09,699
- The clothes are too heavy.
- He looks... Haha.

1761
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,469
Doesn't he look like an auntie?

1762
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:13,010
- Jae Seok.
- Auntie!

1763
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,280
We'll have another order
of kkanpunggi.

1764
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,340
Look at Jae Seok from behind.

1765
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,849
(He has the vibe of an outgoing
auntie who likes hiking.)

1766
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:20,449
Hey, you look like someone who works
at a healthcare center...

1767
00:56:20,449 --> 00:56:22,250
- I feel so much lighter.
- Okay, let's go.

1768
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,119
Let's do a good job, friends.

1769
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:26,119
- There you go. Nice.
- You should try going too.

1770
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:27,719
- Okay. Come on out.
- You should try.

1771
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:29,260
- Go.
- Come in.

1772
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:30,989
- Two.
- There.

1773
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:33,030
Darn it.

1774
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,099
- April!
- My knees hurt.

1775
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:36,099
My knees hurt.

1776
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:38,170
- Who was it?
- April.

1777
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,230
I have bad knees.

1778
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,440
- Two of us will spin.
- No, I'll try.

1779
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,739
- Then, only Jong Kook will spin.
- Okay.

1780
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:45,539
- Okay.
- The six of you will jump.

1781
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:47,079
Hang on. I should take this off too.

1782
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:48,610
These clothes are uncomfortable.

1783
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:49,980
Can I take off my pants too?

1784
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:51,949
Hey, you might take everything off
at this rate.

1785
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:53,380
- No, I need to take off my pants.
- There are lots of people.

1786
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:56,619
I have another pair on underneath.
These pants are too heavy.

1787
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:59,619
Hey, we're so impressive.
Just to have some seolleongtang...

1788
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:02,489
My pants are way too heavy.
Oh, there we go.

1789
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:04,590
- I'll take off my wig.
- Yes, take it off.

1790
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:05,630
Take off your wig.

1791
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,860
Gosh, are we going to do this naked?

1792
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:09,530
It's much lighter
just by taking off the top.

1793
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:12,630
- All right. Let's go again.
- Then, you've had enough practice.

1794
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:15,369
If you try this time and succeed,

1795
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:17,539
- you'll get 7 bowls.
- Okay, there are 7 of us.

1796
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:18,769
For the next try,

1797
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,809
- you will get fewer bowls.
- Okay.

1798
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:22,610
- You're going for it now.
- Sounds good.

1799
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,750
Let's succeed this time
and get seven bowls.

1800
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,409
- Let's start.
- Okay.

1801
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,050
- Let's go in as groups of three.
- Not yet.

1802
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:29,449
- Go.
- Then, the four of us should go.

1803
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,349
- Four of us together?
- Four of us together?

1804
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:32,949
- Bam. That's good, right?
- Go in as pairs.

1805
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,320
- Okay. Go in after the bounce.
- Shall we go?

1806
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,989
- Let's go.
- Bang. Go.

1807
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:39,230
After the bounce...

1808
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:41,329
Why did it slow down?
It suddenly slowed down.

1809
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:42,559
- It stopped.
- Darn it.

1810
00:57:42,929 --> 00:57:44,130
We have to get this down.

1811
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,429
(Seok Sam is grabbing his hand.)

1812
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:48,500
(The rope hit him
on the back of the hand.)

1813
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,610
Why did it slow down?
It suddenly slowed down.

1814
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:51,809
(Crying)

1815
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:54,010
I got smacked really hard.
Gosh, I was going in...

1816
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,079
- after the bounce.
- That's gone.

1817
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:57,150
- It's six bowls now.
- I'm sorry.

1818
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:59,949
- This was...
- No, we didn't start yet.

1819
00:57:59,949 --> 00:58:02,380
- No, it starts when you go in.
- But that wasn't a real try.

1820
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,920
- Be quick.
- This is for six bowls.

1821
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,150
It's six bowls.

1822
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,150
- Shall we go?
- Let's start.

1823
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,389
- It's hard.
- Okay.

1824
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:09,219
- All right.
- Let's go.

1825
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:10,630
Bang. Let's go.

1826
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:11,760
Go after the bounce.

1827
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,130
Bang. That's me.

1828
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,059
(Jae Seok, Haha, and Se Chan
come in without a hitch.)

1829
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,269
Go in after the bounce.

1830
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,599
- One.
- You guys are good at this.

1831
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:22,639
(The ladies enter successfully too!)

1832
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:24,170
- One.
- You guys are good at this.

1833

1834
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,110
- Oh, who is it?
<i>- Kid</i>

1835
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:29,280
(Ji Hyo is the culprit.)

1836
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,280
- I went over.
- Oh, it was Ji Hyo.

1837
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,809
- Ji Hyo, this...
- I should take my pants off.

1838
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:35,050
- It looks really heavy.
- My pants were like this.

1839
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,150
Oh, your pants...

1840
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:38,119
- I'll switch shoes with you.
- Ji Hyo, you can switch shoes.

1841
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:39,920
- We're going for five bowls now.
- Those shoes are hard to jump in.

1842
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,519
Right, they get caught easily.

1843
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:42,920
Now, you must succeed...

1844
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,329
- to get five bowls.
- Okay.

1845
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:45,360
- Gosh, let's just...
- Let's say a cheer.

1846
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,099
- Let's go!
- Here we go.

1847
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:49,099
- Go.
- Turn, touch the ground, Hurrah.

1848
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,300
- One, two.
- Go!

1849
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,500
After the bounce.

1850
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,340
We're in.

1851
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,440
(They're all in!)

1852
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,139

1853

1855
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:06,349
(Ji Hyo is the culprit again.)

1856
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,579
- Who is it?
- It must be me.

1857
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:10,550
It must be me.

1858
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:11,789
Ji Hyo...

1859
00:59:12,489 --> 00:59:14,420
- It's okay.
- No one is laughing now.

1860
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,420
- Okay.
- Jump!

1861
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,889
(Ji Hyo was always bad at jumping
rope. This might be a tough one.)

1862
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:20,230
- How many bowls is it now?
- Four bowls.

1863
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,429
- Here we go!
- Let's go!

1864
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:24,599
- Let's go. Yes.
- Is Ji Hyo in the front?

1865
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:26,630
- Go.
- Se Chan, go with me.

1866
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,139
- Yes, go with her.
- Go!

1867
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:30,869
- I'll go next.
- One.

1868
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:32,710
- Nice.
- Not yet.

1869
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,610
Nice.

1870
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:39,179
- Seok Jin, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?

1871
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:40,250
(Everyone,
including Seok Sam, is in!)

1872
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,420
- What's wrong?
<i>- Kid</i>

1873
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:44,090

1874
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:46,019

<i>Turn around</i>

1877
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:51,329
(Ye Eun gets caught.)

1878
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,260
Ye Eun!

1879
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,400
- I don't know what to say.
- No!

1880
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,030
- Who is that?
- Ye Eun!

1881
00:59:59,369 --> 01:00:01,340
- Ye Eun.
- I can't laugh anymore.

1882
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,369
No!

1883
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:03,809
- It's slippery here.
- We can't eat.

1884
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:05,869
We won't be able to eat.

1885
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:07,980
- I won't eat.
- I won't eat either.

1886
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,940
- I'll eat at home.
- I won't eat.

1887
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,010
- I'll eat at home.
- I won't eat.

1888
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:12,880
- Our teamwork might be ruined.
- Hey, let's starve!

1889
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,880
We won't be able to eat this.

1890
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,880
- I can't get angry.
- Some people fast.

1891
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,250
- I'm angry, but...
- You know what I mean, right?

1892
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,590
It was my first time getting caught.

1893
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,159
- Or...
- This spot is slippery.

1894
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:24,329
- Ye Eun.
- My saliva tastes like metal.

1895
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,960
This time, it's for three bowls.

1896
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,230
- It's three bowls.
- That's too little.

1897
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:29,030
- We have to do this.
- Gosh, for three bowls...

1898
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:30,699
This means they won't feed us.

1899
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:32,329
- One, two...
- Let's go!

1900
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:33,769
- Go in.
- Three.

1901
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,139
- Four.
- No, don't go now.

1902
01:00:35,139 --> 01:00:37,269
Five. Six.

1903
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:39,340
Seven. Eight.

1904
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,739
Nine. Ten.

Oh, that's me.

- Ji Hyo.

1913
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:56,590
- Ji Hyo!
- Ji Hyo, what's wrong?

1914
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,329
- Ji Hyo.
- You used to be good!

1915
01:00:58,329 --> 01:01:00,630
- I'm sorry!
- You used to be good!

1916
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:02,130
You used to fly around!

1917
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,400
- Ji Hyo.
- I'm sorry.

1918
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,630
- After turning...
- The clothes...

1919
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,530
After turning around,
I couldn't see the rope. Sorry!

1920
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,170
- What's wrong with you?
- Sorry!

1921
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:09,440
- Don't be sorry!
- How many times is this?

1922
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,940
- This is...
- Don't do things to be sorry for!

1923
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,239
- It's higher than you think.
- When she turned around...

1924
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:13,539
Who wants to eat at home?

1925
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:14,710
- If you jump like this...
- I will eat at home.

1926
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,280
- Just cancel lunch.
- I was jumping like this,

1927
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,449
but as soon as we turned around,

1928
01:01:17,449 --> 01:01:18,610
- I lost my tempo.
- I'll go eat at home.

1929
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,650
Sorry!

1930
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:22,119
- Now, it's for two bowls.
- How many?

1931
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:23,920
- Two bowls.
- Then where will you go?

1932
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,389
- Ji Hyo, wait. Where will you go?
- This is...

1933
01:01:25,389 --> 01:01:27,219
- I don't have to eat.
- Come to your senses.

1934
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:28,619
Let's do it this time.

1935
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:29,719
- Okay, let's do it.
- We should at least have one bowl.

1936
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,530
- Let's try it.
- We should have a bowl.

1937
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,090
- Let's have a bowl.
- You can do it once you get going.

1938
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:34,159
- We don't have to touch...
- That way...

1939
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:36,030
- We can share a large size.
- Or...

1940
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:38,230
- Or, if you're physically tired,
- Yes?

1941
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:39,230
let's just all go in at once.

1942
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,500
- Let's go in at once.
- Okay, at once.

1943
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,699
I don't think I can go in
on one try.

1944
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:42,699
- Let's go!
- I feel like I'm going to trip.

1945
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,039
- Let's go!
- Just go in at once.

1946
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:45,639
- Let's hold hands.
- I'll spin it in big circles.

1947
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:46,940
- Go in after the bounce.
- Go.

1948
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:49,139
- Hang on. Come.
- Go!

1949
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:54,880
(All of them are in for now.)

1950
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,150
<i>- Kid, kid</i>
<i>- Kid, kid</i>

1951
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:59,219
<i>- Turn around</i>
- Hey.

1952
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:01,420
(They neatly get through
turning around.)

1953
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:02,719
(Now, it's time to
touch the ground.)

1954
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,789
- Nice!
<i>- Kid, kid</i>

1955
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:07,230

touching the ground.)

1957
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:10,630
<i>- Touch the ground</i>
- Nice!

1958
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:13,099

touch the ground!)

01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:14,639
<i>- Touch the ground</i>

1960

Gosh, seriously?

1961
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:20,909
(Falling over)

1962
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:23,239
- Are you okay?
- Gosh, seriously?

1963
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,349
Ye Eun.

1964
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:26,110
- No, but you guys did well.
- But...

1965
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,150
That was going really well.

1966
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:29,250
- You were so close.
- You should give us another chance.

1967
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,550
- You were nearly finished.
- This time, we were...

1968
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:33,219
- She fell over.
- This one...

1969
01:02:33,219 --> 01:02:34,219
You shouldn't count this one.

1970
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:36,119
- Touching the ground is easy.
- Look at the kid.

1971
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:37,230
(Crying)

1972
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:40,090
- What's wrong?
- I hit my head.

1973
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,030
She fell over like in a cartoon.

1974
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:44,429
- It wasn't reality but a cartoon.
- Her face looks like a cartoon too.

1975
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,630
- Did you just fall from midair?
- Yes.

1976
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,699
I'm dizzy now.

1977
01:02:47,699 --> 01:02:50,909
- Can we skip touching the ground?
- I'm dizzy now.

1978
01:02:50,909 --> 01:02:52,510
How many times are we jumping
on empty stomachs?

1979
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,909
- I know. We...
- We'd rather not eat...

1980
01:02:54,909 --> 01:02:56,309
- and rest.
- Let's go eat at home.

1981
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:58,110
- Right now, this is...
- This is making us hungry.

1982
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:01,019
- I might get mad while eating.
- My gosh.

1983
01:03:01,019 --> 01:03:02,880
This is fasted cardio.

1984
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,090
- Hey, let's not eat.
- Seriously.

1985
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:06,119
- So, there's one bowl left, right?
- Yes.

1986
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:08,619
- Jump if you want to eat.
- Or...

1987
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:10,630
- Jump if you want to eat.
- Or how about this?

1988
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:11,989
- Only if you want to eat.
- Only if you want to eat.

1989
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:13,260
Only those who want to eat
should jump.

1990
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,030
- Only if you want to eat.
- Only if you want to eat.

1991
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:17,099
- I'm going to rest.
- Then if you succeed...

1992
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:18,369
- with only those who want to eat,
- Okay.

1993
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:19,730
- you will get one bowl.
- Okay.

1994
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,699
- If you won't eat, get out.
- Only those who want to eat.

1995
01:03:21,699 --> 01:03:22,940
- I won't eat.
- I won't eat.

1996
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,739
- Get out.
- I won't eat.

1997
01:03:24,739 --> 01:03:25,739
- Okay, nice.
- I'll eat.

1998
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:28,340
If someone gets caught here,
will they get sent out?

1999
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:29,539
They should.

2000
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:31,380
- Let's go!
- All right.

2001
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,449
Let's all go in at once.

2002
01:03:32,449 --> 01:03:33,550
- This is good.
- All at once.

2003
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:34,920
- Look at the rope as you enter.
- Okay.

2004
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,550
- Look at the rope when you enter.
- This is for one bowl.

2005
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:38,150
- One bowl. One, two.
- Look at the rope when you enter.

2006
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:39,190
- Enter on the count of three.
- Let's go.

2007
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,190
After it hits the ground...

2008
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:42,619
<i>- Kid, kid</i>
<i>- KId, kid</i>

2009
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,989
<i>- Turn around</i>
<i>- Turn around</i>

2010
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:47,329
<i>- Kid, kid</i>
<i>- KId, kid</i>

2011
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:49,400
<i>- Touch the ground</i>
- I touched the ground.

2012
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:51,670
Hold on.

2013
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:52,769
<i>- Touch the ground</i>
- I touched the ground.

2014
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:55,500
(Floret falls down in a lousy way.)

2015
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,210
I did my best to keep going.

2016
01:03:57,239 --> 01:03:58,539
Please.

2017
01:03:58,539 --> 01:03:59,610
- What's your problem?
- Seriously.

2018
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:01,210
- Grandpa!
- What's wrong?

2019
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:02,909
- Sir, get out.
- Get out.

2020
01:04:02,909 --> 01:04:04,579
- Sir.
- Get out.

2021
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,449
- You're out.
- Aren't you worried about me?

2022
01:04:06,449 --> 01:04:08,280
- I fell down.
- Sir.

2023
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,320
- You touched the ground twice.
- Hey!

2024
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,789
Okay. I hope you guys do well
without me.

2025
01:04:13,219 --> 01:04:14,659
- I fell down, okay?
- We can do this on our own.

2026
01:04:14,659 --> 01:04:16,989
Aren't you going to ask me
if I'm okay?

2027
01:04:16,989 --> 01:04:19,289
- Floret, are you okay?
- Floret, come here.

2028
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:20,699
I know how it is since I fell down.

2029
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:22,059
Floret, are you okay?

2030
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,670
(The female division's reunion)

2031
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:26,699
Those jerks.

2032
01:04:26,699 --> 01:04:28,440
- The 3 of us for 1 bowl.
- Okay.

2033
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,869
- It's for 1 bowl.
- The 3 of you for 1 bowl.

2034
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:31,369
- Okay. Let's go.
- Hold on.

2035
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:32,969
- Let's do this.
- Hold on.

2036
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,679
- Come on. One,
- This is a survival.

2037
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:36,110
two... Hurry up.

2038
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:38,880
Three, four, five,

2039
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,980
<i>- Kid, kid</i>
- six,

2040
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,349
- seven...
- They have enough space now.

2041
01:04:43,949 --> 01:04:45,250
- Touch the ground.
- Hold on.

2042
01:04:45,389 --> 01:04:46,550
<i>- Touch</i>
<i>- Touch</i>

2043
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:48,559
- Touch the ground.
- Hold on.

2044
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,360
<i>- Touch the ground</i>
<i>- Touch the ground</i>

2045
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,829
- It's time to say, "Hurrah."
- They touched the ground.

2046
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:56,300
- Say, "Hurrah."
- Hurrah.

2047
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,829
It's time to leave.

2048
01:04:57,829 --> 01:04:58,969
(It's time for them to leave!)

2049
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:00,469
<i>- Take your leave</i>
- My goodness.

2050
01:05:00,469 --> 01:05:02,039
<i>- Take your leave</i>
- My goodness.

2051
01:05:02,769 --> 01:05:04,070
(Hitting)

2052
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:07,309
(Yang Se Chan is out.)

2053
01:05:07,309 --> 01:05:08,880
- He got caught. He's out.
- Are you okay?

2054
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:10,579
- He's out. Try again.
- All right.

2055
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:12,780
- Am I out?
- You failed.

2056
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:14,880
- Let's share the food.
- Okay.

2057
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,579
- Let's share the food.
- Why would you share?

2058
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,849
I got caught.

2059
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,849
The way he got slapped
on the back was funny.

2060
01:05:20,389 --> 01:05:21,789
- I got scared.
- The way he got slapped was funny.

2061
01:05:21,789 --> 01:05:23,059
Life is funny, right?

2062
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:25,929
The desperate ones can't eat.

2063
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,400
- Seriously.
- It looks delicious.

2064
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,329
(The milky and rich soup
contains 121 years of history.)

2065
01:05:30,329 --> 01:05:32,829
Pour some into your bowl.
It looks so tasty since it's big.

2066
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:35,340
It looks so tasty.

2067
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:37,710
Play rock-paper-scissors
so that only one person can eat it.

2068
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,539
It looks delicious.

2069
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,579
- Let's hear you describe the taste.
- His hand is shaking.

2070
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,380
(Shaking)

2071
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,650
- Describe the taste.
- His hand is shaking.

2072
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:52,119
I'll try the meat first.

2073
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:53,320
- Gosh.
- How does it taste?

2074
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:55,619
I bet it tastes incredible.

2075
01:05:55,889 --> 01:05:57,429
Does it taste amazing?

2076
01:05:57,429 --> 01:05:59,829
But it looks like
they lost their appetite.

2077
01:05:59,829 --> 01:06:01,059
Everyone...

2078
01:06:01,059 --> 01:06:02,260
I taste blood.

2079
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:04,000
- This is...
- Food can't taste good...

2080
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,570
after an exercise like that.

2081
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:06,829
(Eat seolleongtang
and describe the taste.)

2082
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:08,070
- How is it?
- The soup is...

2083
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,400
It's so nice.

2084
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:12,070
The size of the meat is extra large.

2085
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:15,539
- It looks tasty.
- The texture is different.

2086
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:16,710
It's tasty.

2087
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,380
You just raised
the volume of your voice.

2088
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,579
It's insane.

2089
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:23,480
It must be so nice and warm.

2090
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,019
The air is cold,
but they're eating warm food.

2091
01:06:26,019 --> 01:06:28,119
They're enjoying the food. Hey.

2092
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,730
- Kimchi.
- They're enjoying the kimchi.

2093
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:33,460
- The kimchi looks delicious.
- Bucktooth.

2094
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:35,429
Bucktooth.

2095
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:38,170
Slaves who can't eat
seolleongtang...

2096
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:40,170
- will get a rice ball.
- Okay.

2097
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,039
- Not bad.
- A rice ball isn't half bad.

2098
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,670
Thank you.

2099
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,570
It would've been nice to eat
a rice ball without exercising.

2100
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,579
- Right?
- We didn't know that.

2101
01:06:48,579 --> 01:06:50,179
There's some seasoning.

2102
01:06:50,179 --> 01:06:51,750
I lost my appetite.

2103
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,449
- Can we get some kimchi?
- Is there something inside?

2104
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,579
No.

2105
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,690
- It's so nice.
- At least we got a rice ball.

2106
01:06:57,690 --> 01:07:00,150
(He sniffs the food
and takes a bite.)

2107
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:01,590
- It looks tasty.
- It's tasty.

2108
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,019
Let me describe the taste.

2109
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,230
When it enters the mouth,
the texture is grittier...

2110
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:07,760
than I expected.

2111
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,300
I feel like someone made it
after playing in the sand.

2112
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:11,769
That's how it tastes.

2113
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:13,929
Shouldn't we get some side dishes?

2114
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:16,269
- This is plain rice.
- Back in the day, the slaves...

2115
01:07:16,269 --> 01:07:18,340
ate a rice ball that was made
with plain rice.

2116
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:19,739
Do you think we're actual slaves?

2117
01:07:20,739 --> 01:07:22,579
They still got kimchi.

2118
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,409
- Hey, we're SBS' slaves.
- Yes, they still got kimchi.

2119
01:07:24,409 --> 01:07:25,650
- Right.
- Dried laver.

2120
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,880
(He accepts his fate.)

2121
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,519
- There's so much rice.
- What's the use of making money?

2122
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:31,949
I still need to eat
this kind of lunch.

2123
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:33,949
- Gosh.
- He's complaining so much.

2124
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,860
- You eat a lot of tasty food.
- Seok Jin, it's just Monday.

2125
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,929
That's right. You eat a rice bowl
with raw seafood every day.

2126
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:42,130
- It's just Monday.
- You eat that at home every day.

2127
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:44,699
I just became sad, okay?

2128
01:07:44,869 --> 01:07:46,070
Seok Jin,

2129
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:48,039
I don't even need to apply
chapstick.

2130
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:50,000
- What do you mean?
- This dish is so oily.

2131
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,469
Look at my lips.
They're no joke, right?

2132
01:07:51,469 --> 01:07:53,570
- That's right.
- Your tongue and lips are dry.

2133
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,079
- They're chapped, right?
- Look at mine.

2134
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:56,110
- Haha.
- They're no joke.

2135
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:57,849
- You now have kissable lips.
- The dish is so oily.

2136
01:07:57,849 --> 01:08:00,079
- Did Kim Doo Han work...
- It's so rich.

2137
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:01,980
- part-time there?
- I see why Doo Han went there.

2138
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:04,820
I bet no one had a fight
in that seolleongtang restaurant.

2139
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:07,719
"I'm Sirasoni!"

2140
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:09,019
- It looks delicious.
- Okay.

2141
01:08:09,019 --> 01:08:10,219
Go ahead and eat.

2142
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:11,630
It's tasty, Ma'am.

2143
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:12,760
(He returns to reality.)

2144
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,329
It must be so tasty.

2145
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:19,100
If you keep chewing on it,
it tastes sweet.

2146
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,130
(Talking about the rice ball)

2147
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:22,069
If you keep chewing on it...

2148
01:08:22,069 --> 01:08:23,439
- Is there a sweetness?
- Yes, there's a sweetness.

2149
01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:29,310
(The easygoing Slave Kim
finishes eating the rice ball.)

2150
01:08:30,909 --> 01:08:34,350
(Team Gukbap
finishes eating as well!)

2151
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:36,449
- It replenished my energy.
- My goodness.

2152
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:40,520
The location of the last errand
remains.

2153
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,590
- Okay.
- Okay.

2154
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:44,359
The clue regarding the location
of the last errand...

2155
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:46,659
- will be shown to only Jae Seok.
- Only me?

2156
01:08:46,659 --> 01:08:48,760
(The clue will be provided
to only Jae Seok.)

2157
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,800
- Other members, please turn around.
- Really?

2158
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,329
- Why is it like that?
- Still,

2159
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:55,039
Jae Seok has good eyes.

2160
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:56,439
Maybe he'll check it out alone
and go alone.

2161
01:08:56,439 --> 01:08:58,170
- It's strange, right?
- Jae Seok knows everything.

2162
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,710
I think there's something about him.

2163
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:02,180
Maybe we're only going
to the 100-year-old stores.

2164
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:03,539
What is it?

2165
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:05,909
- As an errand,
- Hunchback.

2166
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:07,979
you bought paper, brush,
and inkstone.

2167
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:12,289
As a clue, you'll see a photo
of the owner of the last location.

2168
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,590
In 20 seconds, look at the photo...

2169
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:16,289
and draw the person using a brush.

2170
01:09:16,289 --> 01:09:20,460
After looking at the photo,
draw the person using a brush.

2171
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:25,930
- Then find the location with it.
- But...

2172
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:27,569
- I can't draw.
- A drawing?

2173
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:29,300
- Why did you pick me to draw?
- I should've known.

2174
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,869
He can't draw.

2175
01:09:30,869 --> 01:09:32,640
- Just look at the characteristics.
- The key points.

2176
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,479
- I need to draw, right?
- Bucktooth can't draw.

2177
01:09:34,539 --> 01:09:36,279
- You have 20 seconds.
- Okay.

2178
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:39,010
- I bet the owner has unique looks.
- Set, go.

2179
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:40,149
- Right?
- Who is that?

2180
01:09:40,149 --> 01:09:41,520
- Unique looks.
- Set, go.

2181
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,720
- Right?
- Who is that?

2182
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,420
That must be it.
We'll need to ask around.

2183
01:09:44,989 --> 01:09:47,020
- My goodness.
- Who is that?

2184
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,659
- Who is that?
- Focus on the characteristics.

2185
01:09:49,659 --> 01:09:50,859
Just the characteristics.

2186
01:09:50,859 --> 01:09:52,460
- My goodness.
- How am I supposed to draw him?

2187
01:09:53,329 --> 01:09:55,029
- We're ruined.
- This is...

2188
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,729
- Go ahead and draw.
- I'm drawing, but...

2189
01:09:57,729 --> 01:09:58,899
That man...

2190
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:00,699
I'm curious.

2191
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:02,340
He should've shown a full smile...

2192
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,039
or something.

2193
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:05,909
- Is his facial expression awkward?
- It's awkward.

2194
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:07,069
Is it awkward?

2195
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:10,479
In my opinion,
I put my soul into it.

2196
01:10:10,779 --> 01:10:13,409
Now, check the clue...

2197
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:16,050
- with the other slaves.
- Let me see it.

2198
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:17,420
- I'd like to say this.
- Can we see it?

2199
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,149
- Is it done?
- I'm sorry, but they might think...

2200
01:10:19,149 --> 01:10:20,890
- that he's a Japanese soldier.
- What?

2201
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,220
- Let me see it.
- Let me see it.

2202
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,359
- I...
- Hey.

2203
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:27,529
- Jae Seok, what's that?
- Are you kidding me?

2204
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:29,199
- Are you kidding me?
- Who is that samurai?

2205
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:30,260
Seriously.

2206
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,270
- In Joseon Dynasty...
- Jae Seok, this is...

2207
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,800
- Sir, I'm so sorry.
- Jae Seok.

2208
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,170
This happened
because I have no drawing skills.

2209
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:39,310
Jae Seok, I see
what you tried to do.

2210
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,109
- Did he have little hair?
- Yes, he did.

2211
01:10:41,109 --> 01:10:43,079
- I get it.
- I get the vibe.

2212
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:44,409
Also,

2213
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,680
he was wearing a gown.

2214
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:48,880
- Is he someone we know?
- A gown?

2215
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,449
- Someone we know?
- He was wearing a gown.

2216
01:10:50,449 --> 01:10:52,489
And there was a sofa.

2217
01:10:52,489 --> 01:10:53,850
I think...

2218
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,590
- it's a barbershop.
- Is that so?

2219
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,960
- Hyoja-dong barbershop!
- It must be a barbershop.

2220
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,329
Wouldn't there be a barbershop
that's 100 years old?

2221
01:11:00,329 --> 01:11:01,630
- I think...
- Someplace old. Today,

2222
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:02,930
- we're visiting the old places.
- That's right.

2223
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:04,300
- A barbershop.
- How about a pharmacy...

2224
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:05,430
or an oriental medicine clinic?

2225
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:07,369
- An oriental medicine clinic.
- An oriental medicine clinic?

2226
01:11:07,369 --> 01:11:08,699
That isn't it, right?

2227
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:09,970
That's a possibility.

2228
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:11,369
- Hey.
- An oriental medicine clinic.

2229
01:11:11,369 --> 01:11:14,810
During that era, they put this up
to find a serious criminal.

2230
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:16,579
- That's right.
- Jae Seok.

2231
01:11:16,579 --> 01:11:18,479
- A serious criminal.
- Seriously.

2232
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,310
How are we supposed to find
the location with this?

2233
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:22,220
- How are we supposed to do it?
- In any case,

2234
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,850
- I can recognize him.
- You can recognize him.

2235
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:27,489
- Let's go.
- Let's find the location.

2236
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:30,819
- Where could it be?
- Shall we hold on to it or what?

2237
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:32,560
- We should carry it.
- It's game over.

2238
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,560
(Looking for this person)

2239
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,229
How will we find the location
with that drawing?

2240
01:11:35,229 --> 01:11:36,760
That's my biggest question.

2241
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,770
Let's look at the hairstyle first.

2242
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:40,069
Someone in a gown, right?

2243
01:11:40,069 --> 01:11:41,399
- Someone in a gown.
- Let's find someone in a gown...

2244
01:11:41,399 --> 01:11:43,369
with that hairstyle.

2245
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,770
If it's an old location,
it must be a barbershop...

2246
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:47,539
- or an oriental medicine clinic.
- I think it's a barbershop.

2247
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,140
An oriental medicine clinic.
That's a possibility.

2248
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,520
(Is the person in the photo
a barber in a white gown?)

2249
01:11:56,449 --> 01:12:00,819
(Is he a clinician
at an oriental medicine clinic?)

2250
01:12:00,819 --> 01:12:03,020
I think the white gown is a hint.

2251
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:05,289
That's right.
What kind of a gown was it?

2252
01:12:05,289 --> 01:12:08,760
I don't think
we would suddenly get a doctor...

2253
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,899
in internal medicine...

2254
01:12:10,899 --> 01:12:13,069
- or surgery department.
- I don't think so.

2255
01:12:13,069 --> 01:12:14,439
- Hey.
- In my opinion,

2256
01:12:14,439 --> 01:12:15,869
- It's a barbershop.
- there must be an old place.

2257
01:12:15,869 --> 01:12:17,640
- Your guess is right.
- Hyoja-dong barbershop.

2258
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,939
- Hyoja-dong is here.
- Hyoja-dong barbershop.

2259
01:12:18,939 --> 01:12:20,270
- It's nearby.
- Yes.

2260
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,909
- There's "The President's Barber."
- Hyoja-dong barbershop.

2261
01:12:22,909 --> 01:12:24,409
- That's right. I know.
- There's that movie.

2262
01:12:24,409 --> 01:12:25,949
- I know.
- There's that movie.

2263
01:12:25,949 --> 01:12:27,279
Song Kang Ho starred in it.

2264
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:29,819
I think the white gown is a hint.

2265
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,119
Hold on.

2266
01:12:31,449 --> 01:12:33,189
We need to go up
to reach Hyoja-dong.

2267
01:12:33,189 --> 01:12:34,220
That's right.

2268
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:36,020
That's right. Hyoja-dong barbershop.

2269
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:37,460
Let's go to a barbershop.

2270
01:12:37,859 --> 01:12:40,260
- This is Hyoja-dong.
- This neighborhood?

2271
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:42,560
- We should go to the right.
- Yes.

2272
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,729
We're nearby,

2273
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:47,770
- so let's ask the residents.
- Okay.

2274
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:51,510
Even though people haven't seen
my drawing before,

2275
01:12:52,069 --> 01:12:55,140
- the residents might recognize it.
- That's right.

2276
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:58,810
(That way,)

2277
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:02,720
(the slaves walk endlessly.)

2278
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,789
(They jump roped
on an empty stomach.)

2279
01:13:04,789 --> 01:13:07,149
I can only see the restaurants.
Seochon Restaurant.

2280
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:08,619
- Same here.
- Same here.

2281
01:13:08,619 --> 01:13:10,159
- Seochon Restaurant.
- The restaurants.

2282
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:11,789
- I can only see food.
- I can only see the restaurants.

2283
01:13:11,789 --> 01:13:14,329
- It's cold in the alley.
- It's cold.

2284
01:13:14,329 --> 01:13:15,430
- It's chilly.
- It's so windy.

2285
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:16,630
- It's cold in the alley.
- Gosh.

2286
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:17,770
- Gosh, it's cold.
- My goodness.

2287
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:19,199
Look at this restaurant.

2288
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,500
(Beef brisket soft tofu stew)

2289
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,840
- Gosh.
- Look at that.

2290
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,939
Today's menu is...

2291
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:24,340
- beef brisket soft tofu stew.
- Beef brisket soft tofu stew.

2292
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:26,439
Is it because of this outfit?
I keep feeling hungry.

2293
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:27,739
It's driving me insane.

2294
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,239
- Hey, you know,
- Seriously.

2295
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:31,710
- we seriously became slaves.
- We're nearly slaves.

2296
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:33,609
I keep feeling hungry
in this outfit.

2297
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,380
Seok Jin, we should eat something.

2298
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:37,079
- Seriously.
- Seriously. We need to eat.

2299
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,319
- I know.
- Something like bread.

2300
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:39,819
- Excuse me.
- Something like bread.

2301
01:13:39,819 --> 01:13:41,659
- Hyung In.
- Give us food.

2302
01:13:41,659 --> 01:13:42,689
Hyung In.

2303
01:13:42,689 --> 01:13:44,260
Please let us have a drink.

2304
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:45,329
- That's right.
- Let us eat.

2305
01:13:45,329 --> 01:13:46,529
- Bread.
- But...

2306
01:13:46,529 --> 01:13:48,460
- Seriously.
- We want to go into this cafe.

2307
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,199
- Iced Americano.
- Let us sit down for a bit.

2308
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:51,300
- Let us sit down for a bit.
- We're exhausted.

2309
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,229
Iced Americano is only 2.30 dollars.

2310
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:55,069
- May we go in?
- Yes.

2311
01:13:55,069 --> 01:13:56,569
May we film a show for a moment?

2312
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:58,409
Would it be okay?

2313
01:13:58,409 --> 01:13:59,470
- Sure.
- Okay.

2314
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:00,810
- I want dark chocolate.
- Thank you.

2315
01:14:01,109 --> 01:14:03,479
- Do you know this person?
- He might be...

2316
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:05,149
- at a barbershop.
- Do you know this person...

2317
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:06,409
at a barbershop?

2318
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:07,949
Isn't the Hyoja-dong barbershop
nearby?

2319
01:14:07,949 --> 01:14:10,149
Hyoja-dong barbershop?
Do you know where it is?

2320
01:14:10,149 --> 01:14:11,949
- If you go up a bit further,
- Really?

2321
01:14:11,949 --> 01:14:13,989
you'll see a community center.
It's over there.

2322
01:14:13,989 --> 01:14:15,220
- A bit further?
- Yes.

2323
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:16,819
- Is it here?
- It's across the road.

2324
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:18,130
- Is there a barbershop?
- Yes.

2325
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:19,159
Let's go.

2326
01:14:19,159 --> 01:14:21,500
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day.

2327
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,630
Thank you.

2328
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,899
We're getting closer.

2329
01:14:23,899 --> 01:14:25,470
- Hyoja Bakery.
- The bakery's name is Hyoja.

2330
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:27,270
- Bakery.
- A food-related place again?

2331
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:29,270
- The bakery's name is Hyoja.
- This is the Tongin Market.

2332
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:30,939
- Hyoja Cafe.
- My goodness.

2333
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,840
- Is the Tongin Market here?
- This is the Tongin Market.

2334
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,579
Tongin Market?
Should we go inside the market?

2335
01:14:34,579 --> 01:14:36,279
- We should visit.
- There it is.

2336
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:37,710
- Where?
- There's a barber's pole.

2337
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:39,510
- There it is.
- Where?

2338
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:40,850
There's a barber's pole.

2339
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:42,350
- There it is.
- It's spinning.

2340
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:43,680
- But it says it's a sauna.
- Isn't it a barbershop?

2341
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,119
But it's a sign for a barbershop.

2342
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,520
- It's a barbershop.
- That's the sign.

2343
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,989
- I think it's a barbershop.
- Let's go around the corner.

2344
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:49,159
- Let's go around the corner.
- That's a barber's pole.

2345
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:50,159
Let's go into the alley.

2346
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:51,689
- Is it a sauna as well?
- Let's ask the owner.

2347
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,390
- Ask him.
- Sir.

2348
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:55,960
- I think he's busy.
- May I ask you a question?

2349
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:57,560
Hello.

2350
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,029
Do you happen to know someone...

2351
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:03,140
- who looks similar?
- With that drawing...

2352
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:05,039
Are you that confident
about your drawing?

2353
01:15:05,409 --> 01:15:07,010
- Seriously.
- Why is he showing the drawing...

2354
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:08,340
- with so much confidence?
- A barbershop.

2355
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:10,439
Where is the Hyoja-dong barbershop?

2356
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:12,649
The Hyoja-dong barbershop
closed down.

2357
01:15:12,649 --> 01:15:13,909
- I see.
- Did it close down?

2358
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:17,149
(Did the Hyoja-dong barbershop
close down?)

2359
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,850
- Was it here?
- Where was the location?

2360
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:20,850
It was down the alley...

2361
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,390
- around the corner.
- I see.

2362
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:23,819
- Did it close down?
- Yes.

2363
01:15:23,989 --> 01:15:25,329
- I see.
- Really?

2364
01:15:25,329 --> 01:15:27,329
- What now?
- I guess it closed down.

2365
01:15:27,529 --> 01:15:30,100
We don't know
if he's a barber or not.

2366
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:31,569
- That's right. We aren't sure.
- We don't know that.

2367
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:33,800
Why don't we ask her?

2368
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,239
Ma'am.

2369
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:38,039
- Hello.
- Hello. My goodness.

2370
01:15:38,069 --> 01:15:39,609
Among people who live
in this neighborhood,

2371
01:15:39,609 --> 01:15:41,939
- do you know...
- I don't have any drawing skills.

2372
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:44,079
Among the barbershop owners,

2373
01:15:44,539 --> 01:15:46,909
do you know anyone
who looks like this?

2374
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:49,020
- Tiger? Tiger Barbershop?
- Excuse me?

2375
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,350
- Excuse me?
- Tiger Barbershop?

2376
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:52,020
- Tiger Barbershop?
- Where is it?

2377
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,489
Aren't you looking for a barber?

2378
01:15:53,489 --> 01:15:54,789
That's right.

2379
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,060
He looks like the owner
of the Tiger Barbershop.

2380
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:59,460
Where is the Tiger Barbershop?

2381
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,930
- Where is the Tiger Barbershop?
- Where is the Tiger Barbershop?

2382
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:03,100
It's down there.

2383
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,399
- Is it down there?
- We'll visit the place.

2384
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:06,029
Let's visit the place.

2385
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:07,899
The owner looks like this.

2386
01:16:07,899 --> 01:16:09,470
- Ma'am, thank you.
- Thank you.

2387
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:10,739
Let's go to the location.

2388
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:13,140
You can recognize him
in real life, right?

2389
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,439
- You can recognize him, right?
- Yes, I can.

2390
01:16:14,439 --> 01:16:15,539
You can do that in real life.

2391
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,979
Let's go and check.
If it isn't him...

2392
01:16:17,979 --> 01:16:20,010
- Can we meet him?
- Can we meet him?

2393
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,550
- Really?
- In that case...

2394
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:23,880
- Robert Pattinson is in the market.
- He's in the market.

2395
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,390
- What?
- Robert Pattinson.

2396
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:26,449
- Who?
- Robert Pattinson?

2397
01:16:26,449 --> 01:16:27,590
- The Hollywood actor?
- Yes.

2398
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:28,819
- Really?
- What is he doing here?

2399
01:16:28,819 --> 01:16:31,390
He came to Korea
to promote "Mickey 17."

2400
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:33,630
- Really? That's incredible.
- I see.

2401
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,760
(100 percent real)

2402
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,930
- Robert Pattinson?
- This is so sudden.

2403
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:39,399
- Let's go.
- That's incredible.

2404
01:16:39,399 --> 01:16:41,000
- Robert Pattinson?
- Shall we meet him here?

2405
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,340
- Director Bong Joon Ho's movie?
- Yes.

2406
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:44,840
- Really?
- Is it okay to meet him like this?

2407
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,239
- Would he know who we are?
- How fun.

2408
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:47,239
Robert Pattinson?

2409
01:16:47,239 --> 01:16:49,039
Everyone knows Running Man.

2410
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:50,840
- Really?
- Will it be okay?

2411
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,649
- In this state...
- But...

2412
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:54,750
- Will it be okay?
- In this state...

2413
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,649
- But...
- He's right over there.

2414
01:16:56,649 --> 01:16:58,149
- Is that so?
- We'd love to meet him.

2415
01:16:58,149 --> 01:16:59,850
- Shall we go?
- There he is!

2416
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:01,460
- Where?
- I think it's him.

2417
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:02,859
- What? I think it's him.
- What?

2418
01:17:02,859 --> 01:17:04,060
- Gosh.
- isn't that him?

2419
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:05,289
- What?
- My goodness.

2420
01:17:05,289 --> 01:17:06,329
My goodness.

2421
01:17:06,329 --> 01:17:08,029
- Robert Pattinson.
- The tall man.

2422
01:17:08,029 --> 01:17:10,229
He's very famous.

2423
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:12,029
- What?
- That's him.

2424
01:17:12,029 --> 01:17:14,529
- Where?
- That's him.

2425
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,239
That Dracula film.

2426
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,069
- This is incredible.
- What was it called?

2427
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:19,810
- "Light." "Twilight."
- "Twilight."

2428
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:21,010
- "Twilight."
- "Twilight."

2429
01:17:21,939 --> 01:17:23,979
(He spots the members.)

2430
01:17:24,609 --> 01:17:25,880
- Hi.
- Hello.

2431
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,449
- Hi.
- Robert Pattinson.

2432
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,579
(Hollywood actor
who starred in "Twilight," "Tenet,")

2433
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:32,149
(and "The Batman," Robert Pattinson)

2434
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:33,850
(He's the leading actor
in "Mickey 17,")

2435
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:37,060
(an upcoming Sci-Fi movie
by Director Bong Joon Ho.)

2436
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:41,960
(The story behind the unique meeting
that heated up the internet)

2437
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,699
("Robert Pattinson Will Meet
Yu Jae Seok on 'Running Man!'")

2438
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:46,930
(It's so funny that Jae Seok met him
while he was dressed as a beggar.)

2439
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:48,640
(Robert Pattinson came to Seoul
and met the Joseon beggars.)

2440
01:17:48,699 --> 01:17:49,899
- Hi.
- Hello.

2441
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:51,369
- Hi.
- Robert Pattinson.

2442
01:17:51,369 --> 01:17:52,939
- He has time.
- Really?

2443
01:17:52,939 --> 01:17:54,109
Really?

2444
01:17:54,109 --> 01:17:56,109
- How did this happen?
- This is so sudden.

2445
01:17:56,109 --> 01:17:57,539
- Hi.
- What is he doing here?

2446
01:17:58,449 --> 01:18:00,149
(The Joseon slaves
meet a Hollywood star.)

2447
01:18:00,149 --> 01:18:02,350
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

2448
01:18:02,619 --> 01:18:03,880
- There he is.
- Nice to meet you.

2449
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,619
Nice to meet you.

2450
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,619
It's nice to meet you.

2451
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:09,359
Nice to meet you.

2452
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:11,529
- I'm your fan.
- Yes.

2453
01:18:11,829 --> 01:18:13,430
He came here to eat
the oil tteokbokki.

2454
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:14,760
Hi, guys.

2455
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,399
- How did he come here?
- Nice to meet you.

2456
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:18,229
He visited
the Tongin Market today...

2457
01:18:18,229 --> 01:18:19,800
to promote the movie.

2458
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,329
- Gosh.
- Gosh. Yes.

2459
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:22,569
They're not...

2460
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,869
(Seok Jin failed to give him a hug.)

2461
01:18:25,869 --> 01:18:26,970
Seok Jin.

2462
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:28,239
(Floret is too excited about
meeting a Hollywood actor.)

2463
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,140
They're not always like this.

2464
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:32,180
They're well-dressed.

2465
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:35,720
But they're like,
they're playing beggars here.

2466
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,250
- Oh, nice.
- Yes.

2467
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,390
Not beggars. We're like, slaves.

2468
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:41,050
They're slaves.

2469
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,960
This is the concept of the day.

2470
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,489
- Sorry.
- Concept.

2471
01:18:45,029 --> 01:18:46,529
Are you shooting a show right now?

2472
01:18:46,529 --> 01:18:48,699
- Yes.
- We're doing it now.

2473
01:18:48,699 --> 01:18:50,000
Look at the cameras there.

2474
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,869
- Oh, yes.
- "Squid Game."

2475
01:18:51,869 --> 01:18:53,800
- "Squid Game."
- We're famous in Korea.

2476
01:18:55,699 --> 01:18:58,439
(We're famous in Korea.)

2477
01:18:58,569 --> 01:19:00,210
(He adds an explanation to avoid
getting mistaken for a real beggar.)

2478
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:03,079
He's here to promote a movie, right?

2479
01:19:03,079 --> 01:19:04,210
"Mickey 17."

2480
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:06,310
- "Mickey 17."
- "Mickey 17."

2481
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,350
- Bong Joon Ho.
- Yes.

2482
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:09,579
- Yes.
- I see.

2483
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:11,949
It's a movie that's directed
by Director Bong Joon Ho.

2484
01:19:11,949 --> 01:19:13,250
- Bong Joon Ho.
- Yes.

2485
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,350
- Are you Mickey?
- Yes.

2486
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:16,489
- Yes.
- "Mickey 17."

2487
01:19:16,489 --> 01:19:18,590
(He abruptly ends the interview
because his English is limited.)

2488
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:19,989
Destiny.

2489
01:19:20,529 --> 01:19:22,029
Please tell him that it's destiny.

2490
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,800
That came out of nowhere.

2491
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,399
We could be friends. Let's do it.

2492
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:26,470
Yes.

2493
01:19:26,569 --> 01:19:30,170
Although it was sudden,
we enjoyed meeting you.

2494
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:32,039
- Thank you for having time with us.
- Nice to meet you. Thank you.

2495
01:19:32,039 --> 01:19:33,710
Yes. Absolutely.
Nice to meet you guys.

2496
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:35,439
- Yes.
- Ask him.

2497
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:36,609
- We...
- We...

2498
01:19:36,609 --> 01:19:38,350
- aren't usually like this.
- It's just today.

2499
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:40,550
- She explained it to him.
- Did she?

2500
01:19:40,779 --> 01:19:42,050
- Yes.
- Seriously.

2501
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:43,579
- Hey.
- Here, Ye Eun.

2502
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:45,619
Why did we have to meet him today?

2503
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,020
(Their meeting will remain
as a photo in these outfits.)

2504
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:49,489
What's up with this meeting?

2505
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:52,090
(With the shining star
of Hollywood,)

2506
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:55,729
(they take a group photo
in the shabbiest state.)

2507
01:19:55,829 --> 01:19:57,699
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

2508
01:19:57,699 --> 01:19:58,869
Thank you.

2509
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:00,899
- Yes.
- Are you having fun in Korea?

2510
01:20:00,899 --> 01:20:02,399
- Yes, it's so fun.
- Okay.

2511
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:04,500
- I've been here for 24 hours.
- How long will you stay here?

2512
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:06,710
- Two more days?
- Two more days.

2513
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:08,180
- Have fun, man.
- Thanks a lot.

2514
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:09,640
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thank you.

2515
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,739
- Bye.
- Take care.

2516
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,750
I can't believe it!

2517
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,579
- It's so fascinating.
- Thank you.

2518
01:20:14,579 --> 01:20:16,250
I can't believe
we met Robert Pattinson here.

2519
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,479
Robert Pattinson.

2520
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:19,750
It was a bit embarrassing
to meet him in this state.

2521
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:21,760
- My goodness.
- It's Running Man.

2522
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,890
- Hello.
- Hello.

2523
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:23,960
(People greet them
right after meeting Rober.)

2524
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,159
- Hello.
- We're...

2525
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:27,060
(Robert should've seen this.)

2526
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:30,100
It's so embarrassing
that we're dressed like beggars.

2527
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:31,829
Why did it have to be today?

2528
01:20:31,829 --> 01:20:33,930
- I thought about not doing this.
- Why did it...

2529
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:35,140
- Why did it have to be today?
- Will the video be aired...

2530
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,600
in a foreign country?

2531
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,539
- Let's say no to that.
- It might happen.

2532
01:20:38,539 --> 01:20:39,909
- It might happen.
- We can't let that happen.

2533
01:20:39,909 --> 01:20:41,409
- We can't let that happen.
- It might happen.

2534
01:20:41,409 --> 01:20:42,840
- Let's say no to that.
- Seriously.

2535
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,210
It makes no sense
to air the video on this show...

2536
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:45,409
and say no to them.

2537
01:20:45,409 --> 01:20:46,810
- You have a point.
- That's right.

2538
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:48,720
But we look so shabby.

2539
01:20:48,779 --> 01:20:50,520
- That's why...
- We're...

2540
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:51,890
- in this state.
- What will he think of us?

2541
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,550
- It's a bit embarrassing.
- I'm so embarrassed.

2542
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:54,989
- Hello.
- The movie...

2543
01:20:54,989 --> 01:20:56,659
- I like him so much.
- Hello.

2544
01:20:56,659 --> 01:20:58,760
(They're on their way
to the Tiger Barbershop.)

2545
01:20:58,989 --> 01:21:00,590
Jae Seok, it's nice to meet you.

2546
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:02,699
Ma'am, I'm bad at drawing.

2547
01:21:02,699 --> 01:21:04,060
Do you know someone
who looks like this?

2548
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:05,369
- He's on the older side.
- He has this hairstyle.

2549
01:21:05,369 --> 01:21:06,770
He wears a white gown.

2550
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:08,569
Then he must be
an oriental medicine clinician.

2551
01:21:08,569 --> 01:21:10,340
- An oriental medicine clinician?
- There's a clinic.

2552
01:21:10,439 --> 01:21:11,970
Then he must be
an oriental medicine clinician.

2553
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:14,310
(A citizen points
to an oriental medicine clinic.)

2554
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:15,409
- Is there a clinic?
- An oriental medicine clinic.

2555
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:16,739
- Is it old by any chance?
- Yes.

2556
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:18,079
- How old?
- How old is it?

2557
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:19,680
- It's quite old.
- Really?

2558
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,909
Is he an oriental medicine
clinician?

2559
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:21,979
- I said it earlier.
- A grandpa runs it.

2560
01:21:21,979 --> 01:21:23,449
- A grandpa?
- That's right.

2561
01:21:23,449 --> 01:21:24,720
It's over there.

2562
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,149
- Is it over there?
- Yes.

2563
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:27,689
- My goodness.
- Over there?

2564
01:21:27,689 --> 01:21:28,819
- Really?
- Yes.

2565
01:21:28,819 --> 01:21:30,420
- Let's go.
- Hello.

2566
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,090
- That must be it.
- Let's go. That must be it.

2567
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:33,729
He wasn't a barber.

2568
01:21:33,729 --> 01:21:35,229
- No, he wasn't a barber.
- I had a hunch.

2569
01:21:35,229 --> 01:21:36,699
I can't believe she recognized
the person from that drawing.

2570
01:21:36,699 --> 01:21:37,960
She remembered the place
when we mentioned...

2571
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,500
- the white gown.
- Yes. The white gown.

2572
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,869
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

2573
01:21:40,869 --> 01:21:41,899
It's on the second floor.

2574
01:21:41,899 --> 01:21:43,239
- Is it old?
- You know,

2575
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:45,869
if she guessed from this drawing,
it'd be incredible.

2576
01:21:45,869 --> 01:21:47,170
Perhaps he has the same vibe.

2577
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:48,779
- Seriously.
- That means you drew well.

2578
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:50,340
- The second floor.
- There are people inside.

2579
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,180
(They arrived at the clinic
the woman told them about.)

2580
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:53,180
Isn't this the place?

2581
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:56,279
- Hello.
- Excuse me.

2582
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,489
I'm bad at drawing, but...

2583
01:21:58,789 --> 01:22:01,319
I drew this
while looking at a photo.

2584
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:03,189
By any chance...

2585
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:05,130
- What?
- That drawing is embarrassing.

2586
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:06,489
Is it him?

2587
01:22:06,489 --> 01:22:08,800
(Jae Seok spots someone!)

2588
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,260
(Geumsung Oriental Medicine Clinic)

2589
01:22:10,329 --> 01:22:13,199
(They see a white gown
from a distance.)

2590
01:22:13,569 --> 01:22:15,239
- Is it him?
- It's him.

2591
01:22:15,369 --> 01:22:16,439
Is it him? No?

2592
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:18,239
- Jae Seok needs to see him.
- No way.

2593
01:22:19,109 --> 01:22:20,340
- What?
- Is it him?

2594
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:24,039
(He's wearing a white gown
they've been looking for.)

2595
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:27,880
(He's an old gentleman
with gray hair.)

2596
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,949
Why did celebrities visit?

2597
01:22:29,949 --> 01:22:31,850
- It isn't him.
- I'm sorry.

2598
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:34,020
- It isn't him. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

2599
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:37,260
(He wasn't the person in the photo.)

2600
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:38,859
- I'm sorry.
- Why did you visit?

2601
01:22:38,859 --> 01:22:41,329
- Well...
- We're looking for a person.

2602
01:22:41,329 --> 01:22:42,800
- It isn't him.
- It isn't him.

2603
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,399
- Ask him.
- I'm sorry.

2604
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:47,300
I see why she directed us here.

2605
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,340
He looks similar.

2606
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:50,840
- It isn't him.
- I'm sorry.

2607
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,439
- It isn't him.
- I'm sorry, sir.

2608
01:22:52,539 --> 01:22:55,010
- It isn't him.
- He has that vibe.

2609
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:56,810
I see why she directed us here.

2610
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:58,810
- That's right.
- I see the resemblance.

2611
01:22:58,810 --> 01:23:00,579
We don't have much time.

2612
01:23:00,579 --> 01:23:01,779
- We're nearly done.
- We're almost out of time.

2613
01:23:01,779 --> 01:23:03,050
We're almost out of time.

2614
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,149
(Just like people did
in the Joseon Dynasty,)

2615
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:09,359
(they walked around.
and asked questions.)

2616
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,619
(It's already close to 4 p.m.)

2617
01:23:11,859 --> 01:23:14,029
- Where is it?
- Go this way.

2618
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:18,899
(They got further delayed
because they met Robert.)

2619
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:20,729
Goodness.

2620
01:23:21,369 --> 01:23:24,739
- It doesn't look right.
- We look horrible right now...

2621
01:23:24,739 --> 01:23:27,869
- You don't have much time.
- That's right.

2622
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:30,409
- You're not getting anywhere close.
- Yes.

2623
01:23:30,609 --> 01:23:33,109
We'll let you search
using your phone...

2624
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:35,850
- for 15 seconds.
- Each of us?

2625
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:37,020
- Yes. Each of you.
- Fifteen seconds?

2626
01:23:37,319 --> 01:23:38,449
- Then...
- Wait.

2627
01:23:38,449 --> 01:23:41,319
I know the face.
You can search for him quickly.

2628
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:44,460
- Is it a barbershop?
- Search for them at the same time.

2629
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:46,359
- Hyoja-dong?
- I should search for the image.

2630
01:23:46,359 --> 01:23:48,500
- The image.
- I'll start counting.

2631
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,199
- It's closed today.
- Okay.

2632
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:52,000
- It's closed?
- It says it's closed today.

2633
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,069
- Three.
- It's a barbershop.

2634
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:54,399
- Here. Isn't it this person?
- Four.

2635
01:23:54,399 --> 01:23:55,439
Five.

2636
01:23:55,439 --> 01:23:56,970
(The person Haha found)

2637
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,609
(Park Soo Ung, the real model of
the movie "The President's Barber")

2638
01:23:58,609 --> 01:24:00,069
- Six.
- But this was when he was young.

2639
01:24:00,069 --> 01:24:02,310
- Seven.
- Now...

2640
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:03,810
- Eight.
- Isn't it...

2641
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:05,649
- Hold on.
- You have five seconds left.

2642
01:24:05,649 --> 01:24:07,210
- Five, four,
- Many employees wear a gown.

2643
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:09,119
- Isn't it him?
- three,

2644
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:10,420
- This person.
- two, one.

2645
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,090
- It's him!
- It is?

2646
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:13,119
- Did you find him?
- No.

2647
01:24:13,119 --> 01:24:14,149
- This person.
- It's him!

2648
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:15,789
(The photo Se Chan found)

2649
01:24:15,789 --> 01:24:16,890
It's him, right?

2650
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:17,890
(The person in the photo
is identical to the person he saw.)

2651
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:19,489
- We can look at what we found.
- He searches well.

2652
01:24:19,489 --> 01:24:21,189
- Yes.
- Who is it?

2653
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:22,300
- I don't know.
- Jongno.

2654
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:23,399
It's a clinic.
An oriental medicine clinic.

2655
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:25,369
- It's an oriental medicine clinic.
- An oriental clinic?

2656
01:24:25,369 --> 01:24:26,729
Is it in Jongno?

2657
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:30,270
Jongno is where we walked around
all day.

2658
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:33,510
(Jongno was the stage
of today's race.)

2659
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:37,109
(Starting from the first brush store
that was 113 years old...)

2660
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,649
(to the oldest
seolleongtang restaurant...)

2661
01:24:39,649 --> 01:24:43,220
(that began in the Joseon Dynasty)

2662
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:46,050
I searched "Joseon Dynasty
oriental medicine clinic in Jongno."

2663
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:47,189
And he came up.

2664
01:24:47,189 --> 01:24:48,420
- Really?
- Yes.

2665
01:24:48,689 --> 01:24:50,689
- Jongno.
- Yuil Oriental Medicine Clinic?

2666
01:24:50,689 --> 01:24:52,760
- It was Yuil.
- Yuil Oriental Medicine Clinic.

2667
01:24:52,789 --> 01:24:54,489
This is a very old clinic.

2668
01:24:56,100 --> 01:25:00,529
(They found the person in the photo
thanks to Ssaebssaeb's tricks.)

2669
01:25:00,529 --> 01:25:02,470
- Jae Seok.
- Look at this and this.

2670
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:04,699
Right. This...

2671
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:05,970
I can't tolerate this.

2672
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:07,210
It fits somehow, right?

2673
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:09,210
- It looks a bit similar.
- That's too much.

2674
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:11,810
- Too much.
- How is this similar?

2675
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:14,350
- Let's get in the car first.
- Okay.

2676
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:16,220
- It's an oriental medicine clinic.
- It's an oriental medicine clinic.

2677
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,420
It's an oriental medicine clinic.
That's so fascinating.

2678
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:19,689
Let's all get off work
together today.

2679
01:25:19,689 --> 01:25:21,750
You can get off work
without getting the penalty...

2680
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:24,460
- if you get done within 40 minutes.
- Yes.

2681
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:25,460
There's an oriental medicine clinic.

2682
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:27,090
It is the Seoul Future Heritage.

2683
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:28,800
- It is?
- Yuil Oriental Medicine Clinic.

2684
01:25:28,899 --> 01:25:31,000
- Right.
- I think I came here before.

2685
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,170
The doctor here isn't Yu Il Han,
right?

2686
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,199
- Really?
- When did you come here?

2687
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:35,600
I remember the entrance.

2688
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,439
- Let's go in. I was here before.
- It's this place.

2689
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:38,710
- I was here.
- Is it the place?

2690
01:25:38,739 --> 01:25:42,510
I remember it. I totally do.

2691
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:46,510
I don't think I visited as a group.
I came with about three people.

2692
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:47,949
- Three or four people.
- This...

2693
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,119
This place...

2694
01:25:50,119 --> 01:25:52,090
- Doctor.
- Hello, Doctor.

2695
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:53,489
- Hello.
- It's been a while.

2696
01:25:53,489 --> 01:25:54,949
(Doctor Lee Gyu Ok,
Yuil Oriental Medicine Clinic)

2697
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:56,420
(Run by 3 generations since 1914,
in the Japanese colonial period.)

2698
01:25:56,659 --> 01:25:57,989
- Have you been well?
- Hello.

2699
01:25:57,989 --> 01:26:00,090
Right. I've been here before.

2700
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:02,199
(About 10 years ago)

2701
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:09,470
(Jong Kook got acupuncture from him
during the Memory Heritage Race.)

2702
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,909
- Don't get tense.
- Right.

2703
01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:14,439
Hello. He looks the same.

2704
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:15,539
Right. Doctor.

2705
01:26:15,539 --> 01:26:16,609
- It is this face.
- Hello.

2706
01:26:16,609 --> 01:26:18,079
I drew you.

2707
01:26:18,909 --> 01:26:20,550
I remembered when I came
to the entrance.

2708
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,810
It is you.

2709
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:23,550
They look similar now.

2710
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:25,289
- You're an artist.
- Right?

2711
01:26:25,289 --> 01:26:26,949
There's the feeling. You drew well.

2712
01:26:26,949 --> 01:26:28,590
- At one glance.
- You drew well.

2713
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:30,189
- It looks like him.
- Seriously.

2714
01:26:30,189 --> 01:26:31,189
It is you.

2715
01:26:31,189 --> 01:26:32,729
- It's been a while.
- Right.

2716
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:33,890
Did you come here?

2717
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:35,329
- I met him.
- Did you meet him before?

2718
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:37,960
- Of course. He came before.
- I came before.

2719
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:41,430
How long has this oriental medicine
clinic been here?

2720
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:42,899
It's been more than 100 years.

2721
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:45,409
- One hundred years?
- One hundred years.

2722
01:26:45,409 --> 01:26:47,470
How many years have you worked here?

2723
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:50,279
I took over...

2724
01:26:50,279 --> 01:26:51,810
- From your father.
- from my father.

2725
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,609
It came down
starting from my grandfather's time.

2726
01:26:53,609 --> 01:26:56,380
Your grandfather, your father,
and now you.

2727
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:58,079
- Really?
- Amazing.

2728
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:00,289
- It's so fascinating.
- You came to the last place...

2729
01:27:00,289 --> 01:27:02,560
to run your errand correctly.
This place...

2730
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,590
is an oriental medicine clinic
with a 111-long history,

2731
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:07,689
which started giving acupuncture
treatments since 1914.

2732
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:09,399
It's been running
for three generations now...

2733
01:27:09,399 --> 01:27:11,060
continuing the will
of Director Lee Taek Seong,

2734
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,729
the first director who was taught
by Ban Gyu Seok,

2735
01:27:12,729 --> 01:27:13,899
- the king's doctor of that time.
- Three generations?

2736
01:27:13,899 --> 01:27:14,970
Goodness.

2737
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:17,899
- Right. I was here. I remember.
- Amazing.

2738
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,840
All the places you went today
to run errands...

2739
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:23,810
were places with history
starting from the Joseon Dynasty...

2740
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:25,979
- to the Japanese colonial period.
- Right.

2741
01:27:25,979 --> 01:27:27,810
(The first caligraphy store
in Korea...)

2742
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:31,550
(that was loved by Gojong
and Sunjong)

2743
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:36,890
(The best restaurant
with a tradition of 121 years)

2744
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:40,529
(And an oriental medicine clinic
running over 3 generations.)

2745
01:27:40,529 --> 01:27:41,960
(They all have a history
of more than 100 years.)

2746
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,960
The last errand you'll run here...

2747
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:46,600
is to experience the effects
of acupuncture...

2748
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,000
the lord will be getting.

2749
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,270
(The Last Errand: Experience
the effects of the acupuncture.)

2750
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:53,770
- That's so nice.
- We'll decide the number...

2751
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:55,270
of people
who will get the acupuncture.

2752
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,210
- No.
- I really don't like it.

2753
01:27:57,210 --> 01:27:59,609
It's good for your health.
You should get it.

2754
01:27:59,609 --> 01:28:01,649
I have a needle phobia.

2755
01:28:01,649 --> 01:28:02,720
- Me too.
- I don't want to get it.

2756
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,750
Who doesn't have that?

2757
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:05,250
I'm really afraid...

2758
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:06,949
- of needles as well.
- No. It's okay. You can get it.

2759
01:28:06,949 --> 01:28:09,489
Our lord is really weird.

2760
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:12,289
- Why would he ask us to do this?
- He's...

2761
01:28:12,289 --> 01:28:14,760
We're his slaves.

2762
01:28:14,829 --> 01:28:16,899
Where will we get the acupuncture?

2763
01:28:16,899 --> 01:28:19,630
He'll apply it
after examining your pulses.

2764
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:22,170
- It's the bosa acupuncture method.
- Bosa.

2765
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:23,899
They're not applied on the face.

2766
01:28:23,899 --> 01:28:27,810
They're applied to the large muscles
like the shoulders, neck, and legs.

2767
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:29,710
- I could get them on the shoulders.
- The needle is inserted...

2768
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:31,579
and spun around.

2769
01:28:31,579 --> 01:28:35,479
(The needle is inserted,
turned around, and flicked.)

2770
01:28:35,479 --> 01:28:36,479
(They already feel stung
just from hearing it.)

2771
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:38,350
It digs inside.

2772
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:41,350
- It throbs.
- It goes like that.

2773
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:42,960
- It hurts.
- It hurts a little.

2774
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,090
They're turned when it goes in.

2775
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:47,090
- They're turned?
- I got it before.

2776
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:49,529
- Ye Eun can get it.
- Five five-cent coins.

2777
01:28:49,529 --> 01:28:51,399
- Four 50-cent coins.
- Ye Eun will get it.

2778
01:28:51,399 --> 01:28:52,899
Ye Eun can get it.

2779
01:28:52,899 --> 01:28:54,199
- You'll get it today.
- She was going...

2780
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:56,170
- to be the member.
- She has to get her senses back.

2781
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:58,300
- Shall we vote for it?
- Yes.

2782
01:28:58,300 --> 01:28:59,310
Good.

2783
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:01,569
- Shall we point to the person?
- Yes.

2784
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:02,810
No.

2785
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:03,810
Should we say, "You, acupuncture?"

2786
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:06,109
- But we...
- "You can get it."

2787
01:29:06,109 --> 01:29:07,109
- "You can get it."
- Don't you want it?

2788
01:29:07,109 --> 01:29:08,649
Shall we make a pitch?

2789
01:29:08,649 --> 01:29:10,319
- Sure.
- Okay.

2790
01:29:10,319 --> 01:29:13,890
Since Seok Jin is the oldest here,

2791
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:15,890
- I think he should get it.
- Good.

2792
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:17,260
Show me your two chins.

2793
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:20,090
(Her two chins appeal
better than her words.)

2794
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:22,600
This is what I think.

2795
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:25,359
Ye Eun joined Running Man.

2796
01:29:25,359 --> 01:29:27,170
- She wouldn't have experienced it.
- Right. This is the chance.

2797
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:28,699
- I've been getting the penalties.
- We've all experienced it.

2798
01:29:28,699 --> 01:29:31,100
- We got acupuncture.
- I got it from here.

2799
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,439
- It's good.
- It's a vote.

2800
01:29:32,439 --> 01:29:33,739
- You never know who'll get it.
- We don't.

2801
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:36,609
- We don't know that.
- Shall we close our eyes?

2802
01:29:36,609 --> 01:29:37,909
I think we can just do it.

2803
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:39,010
- Shall we just do it?
- How should we do it?

2804
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:40,050
Hold on. This...

2805
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:42,279
So...

2806
01:29:42,279 --> 01:29:44,380
- So...
- Say "you."

2807
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:45,689
Right.

2808
01:29:45,689 --> 01:29:47,390
- Put your finger out.
- Okay.

2809
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:50,720
- You.
- One.

2810
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,289
- One, two...
- On three.

2811
01:29:53,289 --> 01:29:54,590
One, two, three.

2812
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:56,159
- You can get it.
- You can get it.

2813
01:29:56,699 --> 01:29:58,359
- Hold on.
- Hold on.

2814
01:29:58,359 --> 01:29:59,529
- How many are there?
- It's 3 to 3.

2815
01:29:59,529 --> 01:30:00,529
- It's 3 to 3.
- It's 3 to 3.

2816
01:30:00,529 --> 01:30:02,170
- No. Jong Kook...
- It's 4 to 3.

2817
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:03,539
- Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook. It's 4 to 3.

2818
01:30:03,539 --> 01:30:04,539
One, two.

2819
01:30:04,539 --> 01:30:06,439
- Here. There's Jae Seok.
- Three?

2820
01:30:06,439 --> 01:30:07,810
- It's 3 to 3.
- It's 3 to 3.

2821
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:09,539
- It's 3 to 3.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

2822
01:30:09,539 --> 01:30:10,979
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- It's crazy.

2823
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:13,979
The loser will get it.
Play rock-paper-scissors.

2824
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:16,079
Rock-paper-scissors.

2825
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:18,680
Rock-paper-scissors.

2826
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,720
(Ye Eun loses.)

2827
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:22,359
You lost like that.

2828
01:30:22,359 --> 01:30:23,390
This is on you.

2829
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:25,020
Then...

2830
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,430
Go in.

2831
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:28,060
- The door opened.
- Go in.

2832
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:30,430
(The acupuncture needles appear
before she even speaks.)

2833
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:31,899
He's doing it properly.

2834
01:30:31,899 --> 01:30:33,600
- There's a table.
- Look at her face.

2835
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:35,369
(Crying)

2836
01:30:35,369 --> 01:30:36,399
I can't tolerate pain.

2837
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:37,840
That goes for everyone.

2838
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,340
If you can't take it,
you don't need to get it.

2839
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:42,439
Get it if you want to get better.

2840
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,840
Tell him if there are parts
that don't feel well.

2841
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,149
It's a simple thing.

2842
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:47,210
Let's have him examine your pulse.

2843
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:48,550
- Your pulse.
- Check what's wrong.

2844
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:50,020
- Your pulse.
- Have your pulse examined.

2845
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:51,279
My back is bent so my neck hurts.

2846
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:52,989
That's right, Hunchback.
Have a seat first.

2847
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:56,189
You're a mere slave,
but you're getting examined by him.

2848
01:30:56,359 --> 01:30:58,890
Slaves couldn't get acupuncture
back in the day.

2849
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:00,930
- They have no money.
- Right.

2850
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:02,829
(Is Hunchback's health okay?)

2851
01:31:02,829 --> 01:31:04,260
The pulse.

2852
01:31:04,329 --> 01:31:05,500
How is she?

2853
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,039
- She has constipation, right?
- You can't digest well.

2854
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:10,939
That's right.

2855
01:31:10,939 --> 01:31:12,939
- I can't digest well.
- Sit up straight.

2856
01:31:12,939 --> 01:31:14,670
You can't digest well,
and you have constipation.

2857
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:16,539
I have constipation.

2858
01:31:16,539 --> 01:31:18,909
In that case,
your head hurts all the time,

2859
01:31:18,909 --> 01:31:20,949
you have blurry vision,
and your neck is stiff.

2860
01:31:20,949 --> 01:31:22,579
Right. My neck hurts.

2861
01:31:22,579 --> 01:31:25,149
You feel dizzy...

2862
01:31:25,149 --> 01:31:27,920
Totally. I fainted before.

2863
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,960
I'm serious.

2864
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:32,189
- Don't speak casually.
- Why are you speaking casually?

2865
01:31:32,189 --> 01:31:33,729
Why are you being rude
to the doctor?

2866
01:31:33,729 --> 01:31:36,029
- What are you doing?
- How could you speak like that?

2867
01:31:36,029 --> 01:31:37,260
(It was so amazing
how he found out everything.)

2868
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:38,930
I was talking to myself.

2869
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:41,600
- Then...
- Where should I get it?

2870
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:44,539
You can just sit still.
I'll do what I do.

2871
01:31:44,539 --> 01:31:45,670
He'll do what he does.

2872
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:47,739
- Right. Why do you need to know?
- Just sit still.

2873
01:31:47,739 --> 01:31:49,279
- But the needles...
- You should take this off.

2874
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:51,140
He wouldn't put it
where it would kill you.

2875
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:53,050
He'll do what he does.

2876
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:56,750
(The Hunchback's blocked
energy will be opened...)

2877
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:58,850
(by the great doctor's needle.)

2878
01:31:59,619 --> 01:32:01,520
- Will I get it on my head?
- She'll get it on her head.

2879
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,390
Your head hurts.
You should get it here, of course.

2880
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:06,060
- It won't hurt.
- Be still. It doesn't hurt.

2881
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:07,989
- It won't touch the skull.
- He knows...

2882
01:32:07,989 --> 01:32:09,130
(Poking)

2883
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:10,430
- Where?
- My gosh.

2884
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:11,560
He's poking her.

2885
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,569
- Where is it?
- My head hurts.

2886
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:16,369
Did he stick a needle in?

2887
01:32:16,369 --> 01:32:17,739
- No.
- Not yet.

2888
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:19,710
- He's just poking.
- He's just poking the meridians.

2889
01:32:19,710 --> 01:32:21,109
I think he stuck needles in.

2890
01:32:21,109 --> 01:32:22,340
- No.
- He didn't.

2891
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:23,640
- No.
- I think he did.

2892
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:24,739
- No.
- He didn't.

2893
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:26,510
Why does it hurt so much?

2894
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:29,520
(Their meridians for laughter
have been unblocked.)

2895
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,119
- It hurts, Doctor.
- No.

2896
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:33,350
Just be patient.
Your sight will become clear.

2897
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:35,319
Your sight is becoming clear.
Just stay still.

2898
01:32:35,319 --> 01:32:36,590
He's looking
for the acupuncture points.

2899
01:32:36,590 --> 01:32:37,619
Just stay still.

2900
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:38,960
- It hurts.
- Hunchback.

2901
01:32:39,029 --> 01:32:40,189
Hey.

2902
01:32:40,189 --> 01:32:41,930
(He wipes off the soot.)

2903
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:43,229
- Hunchback.
- Be patient.

2904
01:32:43,229 --> 01:32:45,970
(He pokes the middle
of her forehead.)

2905
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:47,670
- It's an acupuncture treatment.
- It hurts.

2906
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:50,569
- "It hurts."
- It should hurt.

2907
01:32:50,569 --> 01:32:52,770
- It hurts.
- "It hurts."

2908
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:54,310
- "It hurts."
- It hurts.

2909
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:56,609
(Crying)

2910
01:32:57,409 --> 01:33:00,680
(She ends up sobbing.)

2911
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:03,119
(Sobbing Queen cries again today.)

2912
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:05,550
I think it will hurt
a lot around here.

2913
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:07,520
- She's crying.
- She's bursting into tears.

2914
01:33:07,619 --> 01:33:09,489
- It's not a needle.
- It's not a needle.

2915
01:33:09,489 --> 01:33:10,859
- It's not a needle.
- He's just pressing it.

2916
01:33:10,859 --> 01:33:11,890
(Squeaking)

2917
01:33:13,659 --> 01:33:14,789
(Screaming)

2918
01:33:15,159 --> 01:33:16,300
My goodness.

2919
01:33:16,729 --> 01:33:18,430
(The experienced doctor is
facing a crisis because of Ddochi.)

2920
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:19,569
Hunchback.

2921
01:33:19,569 --> 01:33:22,029
- Hunchback is crying.
- Why are you crying?

2922
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:23,699
- It really hurts.
- It hurts?

2923
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,600
(She finds it funny too.)

2924
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,909
- It's really painful.
- My gosh.

2925
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:29,739
- Hunchback is so funny.
- Good, Hunchback.

2926
01:33:30,609 --> 01:33:32,779
- This is called pungji.
- I see.

2927
01:33:32,779 --> 01:33:35,250
- It's stiff around here.
- It doesn't hurt now.

2928
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:36,350
You will feel better after this.

2929
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:37,680
- This is how you are treated.
- Right.

2930
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:38,949
Congratulations.

2931
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:40,520
- It must feel good.
- It's okay.

2932
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:43,159
- It must feel good.
- Hunchback is tolerating it well.

2933
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,460
It's fine now.

2934
01:33:44,489 --> 01:33:45,619
(Shedding tears)

2935
01:33:45,619 --> 01:33:47,859
- She cries easily, Doctor.
- I do.

2936
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:49,529
I'm a crybaby.

2937
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:53,869
Is her back all wet with blood?

2938
01:33:55,069 --> 01:33:56,439
Seriously?

2939
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:58,340
No.

2940
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:00,270
No. He was joking.

2941
01:34:01,039 --> 01:34:02,609
- It's okay.
- "Seriously?"

2942
01:34:02,609 --> 01:34:04,010
(They stop teasing her
before she wails.)

2943
01:34:04,579 --> 01:34:06,479
- You're being patient.
- She puts up with it well.

2944
01:34:06,609 --> 01:34:08,380
- Have you been crying like that?
- Yes.

2945
01:34:09,479 --> 01:34:12,180
- Her voice sounded just fine,
- It's over now.

2946
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:13,350
- but she was crying.
- Yes.

2947
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:15,090
- She's been crying the whole time.
- Yes.

2948
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:17,720
- She just cries easily, Doctor.
- Right.

2949
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:19,689
Does it hurt here?

2950
01:34:19,689 --> 01:34:20,890
No.

2951
01:34:21,859 --> 01:34:23,359
- I think it hurts.
- When you're tired...

2952
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:25,500
- Just listen to me.
- Her back is arched.

2953
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:26,729
You can see that her back is arched.

2954
01:34:26,729 --> 01:34:29,039
When you are tired, the part
below the shoulder blades...

2955
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:31,439
- is stiff and painful.
- Does it feel good?

2956
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:33,310
- How are you feeling?
- I feel a lot better.

2957
01:34:33,569 --> 01:34:35,710
- Wait.
- I got better. I'm fine.

2958
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,140
I've fully recovered.

2959
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:38,880
I'm serious. I'm feeling great.

2960
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:40,609
I'm serious.

2961
01:34:40,609 --> 01:34:42,779
- You need two parts to be treated.
- He's right.

2962
01:34:42,779 --> 01:34:44,420
- Then...
- You should be treated.

2963
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:47,050
(She urgently looks
for an acupuncture knight.)

2964
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:48,819
- I have a bad neck, sir.
- Good.

2965
01:34:48,819 --> 01:34:50,819
- I can take a look at it.
- My neck? Good.

2966
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:52,859
- Good. You have a neckache.
- Take off your glasses.

2967
01:34:52,859 --> 01:34:54,630
- He does have a neckache.
- He really wants it.

2968
01:34:54,630 --> 01:34:56,529
- He wants it.
- I just want my neck to be treated.

2969
01:34:56,829 --> 01:34:58,600
Now that you're here,
you should get a clear sight.

2970
01:34:58,600 --> 01:34:59,600
- Your eyes.
- Well, my eyes...

2971
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,930
Now that you're here,
you should get a clear sight.

2972
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:02,029
- Your eyes.
- Well, my eyes...

2973
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:03,369
- He should get a clear sight.
- But, my eyes...

2974
01:35:03,369 --> 01:35:04,770
- You should get it.
- I don't think it's a problem.

2975
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:06,909
- You have to get it.
- You need a clear sight.

2976
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:08,539
- That's not necessary.
- Your sight should be clear.

2977
01:35:08,539 --> 01:35:09,710
Your eyesight isn't good.

2978
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:10,810
- My eyes...
- He has poor eyesight.

2979
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:13,250
- I just want my neck to be treated.
- He needs it.

2980
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:14,979
He should get a clear sight.

2981
01:35:14,979 --> 01:35:16,020
(Disappointed)

2982
01:35:17,149 --> 01:35:18,180
(He starts treating
Jae Seok's neck.)

2983
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:20,220
- He sticks a needle in.
- That's...

2984
01:35:22,689 --> 01:35:24,489
(Shouting)

2985
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:26,430
- It must hurt.
- See?

2986
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:28,029
- It really hurts.
- He has a knot in his shoulder.

2987
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:30,199
I wasn't overreacting.

2988
01:35:31,029 --> 01:35:32,260
Do you know what it is like?

2989
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:33,430
(Bucktooth enjoys the treatment
with 111 years of history.)

2990
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:34,970
- He seems serious.
- He's serious.

2991
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:36,300
If it makes Jae Seok scream,

2992
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:37,739
- it must hurt a lot.
- It hurts.

2993
01:35:37,739 --> 01:35:40,039
Right. I wasn't overreacting.

2994
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:42,069
I know what it is like.

2995
01:35:42,739 --> 01:35:43,779
It's all loose now.

2996
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:45,210
Does it hurt here?

2997
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:46,409
What? No.

2998
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:49,619
- You said it hurt.
- I'm fine.

2999
01:35:51,619 --> 01:35:52,920
Gosh, Doctor. Why?

3000
01:35:53,050 --> 01:35:55,189
- I should do this side too.
- He has soot on his face.

3001
01:35:55,189 --> 01:35:56,789
(He naturally expands
the treatment area.)

3002
01:35:56,789 --> 01:35:58,020
It really hurts.

3003
01:35:58,020 --> 01:35:59,489
It must hurt there.

3004
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:02,960
- All right.
- Turn your arm.

3005
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,760
No, you should turn your shoulder.

3006
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,600
- Why did you stomp on me?
- My gosh.

3007
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,199
Why are you stepping on me?

3008
01:36:08,199 --> 01:36:10,640
- My goodness.
- You should turn your shoulder.

3009
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,510
- Your shoulder.
- Turn your shoulder.

3010
01:36:12,869 --> 01:36:15,409
- Turn your shoulder, Jae Seok.
- Your shoulder.

3011
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:17,140
- Turn your shoulder.
- Turn your shoulder.

3012
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:19,039
- Your shoulder.
- My goodness.

3013
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:20,779
Doctor, he wants to stop.

3014
01:36:21,010 --> 01:36:24,680
(The Master's Errands)

3015
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:27,350
(They had to finish running
all the errands by 4 p.m.)

3016
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:30,460
You guys arrived here...

3017
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:33,659
- at 3:50 p.m.
- What a relief.

3018
01:36:33,659 --> 01:36:34,859
So you'll get off work...

3019
01:36:34,859 --> 01:36:36,560
- without getting a penalty.
- Yes!

3020
01:36:36,659 --> 01:36:39,369
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

3021
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:42,840
(Congratulations
on Yu Jae Seok's 20th Grand Award.)

3022
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,800
(The guests who are here
to celebrate him together)

3023
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,409
(Joo Jong Hyuk)

3024
01:36:46,409 --> 01:36:48,210
(Kim Si Eun)

3025
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:50,109
(The meeting of look-alikes
that surprised the world)

3026
01:36:50,109 --> 01:36:51,310
You two look alike.

3027
01:36:51,310 --> 01:36:52,380
(They agree that they look alike.)

3028
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:53,949
(The Protruded Brothers are
like doppelgangers.)

3029
01:36:53,949 --> 01:36:56,819
(A journey to find look-alikes
with the look-alike guests.)

3030
01:36:56,819 --> 01:36:58,479
- Seok Jin.
- Gosh, Seok Jin.

3031
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:00,050
(They are busy
looking for their look-alikes.)

3032
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:02,050
(But there's one thing
they have been forgetting about.)

3033
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:04,260
(Doppelgangers are not
supposed to meet each other.)

3034
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:05,819
Stay calm, Si Eun.

3035
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:08,130
(Those who shouldn't meet
are meeting each other.)

3036
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:10,859
(The curse of doppelgangers
that falls on the members)

3037
01:37:10,859 --> 01:37:16,539
(Who will survive the curse?)

3038
01:37:16,699 --> 01:37:17,970
(Family in Joy and Sorrow)
