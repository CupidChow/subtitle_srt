1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,040
The two masters
who dominate the Korean art world.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,510
(Title: At the Shoot,
Title: TV Rating Notice)

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,150
(The detailed expression
and artistry are remarkable.)

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,920
I just did it,

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,390
- and I found it fun.
- Born with artistic blood,

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,760
- the elite artists, the Kim Family.
- I should draw.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,590
Though he may not look like it,

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,290
(The avant-garde art
that breaks form and framework)

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,400
He was not cut out for comedy,
so he gave up being a comedian...

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,800
and pursued the path of an artist.
The Yu Family.

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,500
This is Son Heung Min.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
- Son Heung Min?
- What?

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,300
How is this a soccer ball?

14
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,210
The drawing looks the same!

15
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,710
What is this?

16
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,710
(Title: Deer)

17
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,540
(Isn't this a carrot?)

18
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,080
The two families,
disrespectful of each other's talent,

19
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,150
are having a showdown
to determine the winner today.

20
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,060
It's been a really long time
since I picked up a brush.

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,130
I should try drawing this guy.

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,700
His face is a little...

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,200
(Painter Kim is drawing
someone's portrait.)

24
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,200
The teeth.

25
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,740
It totally looks like a locust.

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,650
Seriously, this looks
just like Yu Jae Seok.

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,520
All right. I should do some art...

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,580
after a long time.

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,990
(Painter Yu works on a drawing
after a long time.)

30
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,950
Would you like me to draw your face?

31
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,290
- Me?
- Yes.

32
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,730
Yes. Don't worry and trust me.

33
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,900
My family has been painting
for generations.

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,140
My family is also known
for being quick drawers.

35
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,300
(Messy)

36
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,110
It will be quick.

37
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,410
(A bold touch
to replace hands with tree branches)

38
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,510
(Drawing without hesitation)

39
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,150
It's done.

40
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,320
- Is it over already?
- Sure.

41
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,250
This is my drawing.

42
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,520
I'll give this to you.
This will go up in price later.

43
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,390
It will bring you good money.

44
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,090
My hands look like chicken feet.

45
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,300
That's a characteristic
of my painting style.

46
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,600
It needs things like this to be
recognized for its value later.

47
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,240
I notice you have long hair.

48
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,240
(Adding details)

49
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,210
(Chuckling)

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,180
All right. I drew the hair.

51
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,450
(A unique art style that
ordinary people can't appreciate)

52
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,920
Who is that? Hey.

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,320
- Hello, Father.
- Dad.

54
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,780
Hey, you guys are here.

55
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,190
- Hello.
- Father.

56
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,950
The comedian-turned-painter family.

57
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,220
(As expected from former comedians,
they show up while making a fuss.)

58
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,230
Are you a couple?

59
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,160
- No.
- No, she's my younger sister.

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,900
Why do you keep saying
that we're a couple?

61
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,200
- You two...
- I'm the third child.

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,500
- You are wearing similar clothes.
- I see.

63
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,700
- My younger sister.
- He's dressed like a nerd.

64
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,400
- What?
- I'm dressed like a moron.

65
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
A moron or a nerd.

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,670
Please draw something for me.

67
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,770
- You want one?
- Yes.

68
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,610
Hang on. Actually, I was...

69
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,640
(They take a look
at what he drew in advance first.)

70
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,280
- I drew one person.
- What?

71
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,610
- Is it one of the people here?
- Yes.

72
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,880
- It's Wan Su.
- I see.

73
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,720
I recognize it. You know that.

74
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,920
- I didn't know.
- It's Wan Su.

75
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,250
- It looks like her, right?
- Yes.

76
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,220
He recognizes Su Wan right away.

77
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,060
- It's Su Wan.
- He recognizes her right away.

78
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,590
- Try drawing Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun?

79
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,160
- Okay. I'll draw Ye Eun.
- Stand in front of him.

80
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,960
- Draw your youngest daughter.
- Okay.

81
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,860
I'll draw my youngest daughter.

82
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,300
In the past, all I needed was
a double chin to draw Ye Eun's face.

83
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
But now...

84
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,140
Your face has become a lot slimmer.

85
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,340
Gosh, it's really slim.

86
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,510
- I know, right?
- Yes.

87
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,910
- My drawing has the vibe, right?
- Yes.

88
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,810
You know that my trademark
is the dimples, right?

89
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,010
Don't worry. I'll draw them.

90
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,710
Why?

91
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,520
What is it?

92
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,590
(Wrinkles disguised as dimples)

93
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,060
- It looks the same, right?
- Yes.

94
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,590
Seriously...

95
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,720
Why?

96
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,860
- All right.
- It looks great.

97
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,260
- This is my youngest daughter.
- Here.

98
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,930
- Her expression looks the same.
- Okay.

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,400
What's that?

100
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,670
This is you. These are your dimples.

101
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,540
I described the look
on your face perfectly.

102
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,910
- My gosh.
- But this is too ugly.

103
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,110
Seriously, it looks the same.

104
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,080
- This is hyperrealism.
- This is just you.

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,350
- Take this.
- Who do you think will notice it?

106
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,380
- Father.
- They're here.

107
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,080
- My gosh.
- Hey.

108
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,780
(The next family members
of the Yu Family appear.)

109
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,020
(The first child of the Yu Family,
Seok Sam)

110
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,420
- Father.
- Are you a trot singer?

111
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,790
A "Show Me the Money" contestant?
What are you?

112
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,720
Goodness, Father.

113
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
- Goodness, my daughter-in-law.
- Goodness, Father.

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,030
- Father.
- Father.

115
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,160
She's the one...

116
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,730
- She's the one I told you about.
- Father.

117
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,400
- She's my babe.
- Is this a hairdryer?

118
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,900
- It's just too hot in here.
- Is this a hairdryer?

119
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,970
- It's too hot.
- My darling.

120
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,770
I told you I would bring
a fantastic bride for me.

121
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,380
- No, you two are already married.
- We are already married.

122
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,480
- We are married?
- You are.

123
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,680
- So we're already married.
- She's my first daughter-in-law.

124
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,050
She's my daughter-in-law.

125
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,150
- You have 3 children.
- He's got 3 children.

126
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,720
- First, second, and third.
- First, second, and third.

127
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,750
- And you're the father.
- Right.

128
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,280
And you are my daughter-in-law.

129
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,620
- And I'm the biggest.
- Right.

130
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,490
Are you a trot singer?
"Show Me the Money" contestant?

131
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,790
- What are you?
- Seok Sam.

132
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,820
- Yes?
- What are you?

133
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,530
- Isn't he a painter...
- I...

134
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,800
Before you knew it,

135
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,360
I made it big.

136
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,600
I made it big
by discovering a gold mine.

137
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,270
- It's complicated.
- Yes.

138
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,870
- I didn't tell you, did I?
- You didn't.

139
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,040
- But look, Seok Sam.
- What is it?

140
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,710
You are the son, yet you said,
"I didn't tell you, did I?"

141
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,810
Where are your manners?

142
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,510
- And you even pointed at him.
- Mind your manners.

143
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,050
That's too rude.

144
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,080
How dare you act so rudely
to your father?

145
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,720
- You are a rude boy.
- Dad.

146
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,380
You didn't raise me that way.

147
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,120
Did you just touch Dad's cheek?

148
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,220
When I was little... Honey.

149
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,320
- When I was little...
- You are treating me...

150
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,830
- "Honey!"
- he was like a friend.

151
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,530
- Come here.
- Father, I'm a guest, you know.

152
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,060
- Hey!
- How can you be...

153
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,270
What?

154
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,830
(What did you just
do to my husband?)

155
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,230
- How dare you treat your father...
- What's going on?

156
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,540
- Hey! What's the problem, Father?
- I...

157
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,670
- I just...
- What's the matter?

158
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,010
- Hey! What's the problem, Father?
- I...

159
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,940
(A wife fiercely
guarding her husband)

160
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,840
- What are you doing to my husband?
- I...

161
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,280
I...

162
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,910
Wait.

163
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,050
- Don't do that to my husband.
- Are you a gangster or what?

164
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,280
- Honey.
- I'm the daughter-in-law.

165
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,020
- Honey, he hit me.
- Darling daughter-in-law.

166
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,750
- Honey, what's going on?
- Wait.

167
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,250
- Honey.
- What's going on?

168
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,890
- Where's my welcome watermelon?
- And look.

169
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,390
"Where's your welcome watermelon?"

170
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,590
Darling daughter-in-law.

171
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,260
By the way,
the carpet is getting flattened.

172
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,900
Her shoe imprints are pretty deep.

173
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,400
I apologize.

174
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,670
Those high heels!

175
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,440
- My feet really hurt.
- Are your feet all right?

176
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,940
- I'm okay.
- The heels might break.

177
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,740
Honey, this is my family.

178
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,410
- What's up with this family?
- We are a family of artists.

179
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,140
- You are in the arts.
- He draws and paints.

180
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,310
- I told you about him.
- I draw.

181
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,510
Should I draw you?

182
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,380
- Draw my sister-in-law.
- Come, honey.

183
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,580
- To celebrate her first visit,
- My sister-in-law.

184
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,390
- I should draw her.
- Wait.

185
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,450
- Darling.
- Yes.

186
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,720
I draw what I see.

187
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,820
- I am a hyperrealist artist.
- Father is...

188
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,630
- Father is a famous artist.
- Father.

189
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,790
- Isn't she too big?
- He's...

190
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,530
(Huge)

191
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,600
She's too big.

192
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,200
- You swung your arm like this.
- No.

193
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,740
- My goodness.
- It's hyperrealistic.

194
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,770
(Fearless strokes)

195
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,000
Dad, you are...

196
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,610
brave.

197
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,640
(Laughing)

198
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,340
Dad, you are...

199
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,210
His art doesn't take long.

200
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,780
- Can I see?
- I'm a hyperrealistic artist.

201
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,280
Here.

202
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,250
Hey, mister.

203
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,720
Hey, mister.

204
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,890
(In disbelief.)

205
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,920
She called him "mister."

206
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,760
- Her mouth is so small.
- It's...

207
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,360
She looks just like this.

208
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,690
- She looks just like this.
- Wait.

209
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,230
But there is no mouth.
How can I eat?

210
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,330
- Dad.
- She looks like this.

211
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,330
She looks too old.

212
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,770
- She looks just like this.
- My honey is cute.

213
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,030
- I'm not your daughter-in-law.
- What?

214
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,000
- My feet hurt too much.
- Honey, are you all right?

215
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,170
I'm not used to wearing high heels.

216
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,970
Honey, are you okay?

217
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,340
I'm not used to wearing high heels.

218
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
- Honey.
- How...

219
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,750
- Her feet can't breathe.
- By the way,

220
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,280
her shoes are crying.

221
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,820
- It's crying for help.
- Her shoes are crying.

222
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,490
- Honey, your feet are bigger.
- Honey.

223
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,390
You're not supposed
to say that, honey.

224
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,890
Honey.

225
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,960
(Desperate to make people laugh,
he puts on his wife's shoes.)

226
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,230
You humiliated me.

227
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,330
- What happened?
- Why did you do it?

228
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,060
It's too big, honey.

229
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,330
What's your shoe size?

230
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,170
- I wear a size 10.5.
- Really?

231
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,000
- I wear a size 9.
- Her feet are bigger than mine.

232
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,100
- I sometimes wear a size 12.
- Right.

233
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,400
Honey, it's okay. You can stay down.

234
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,140
- Okay. I'm okay, honey.
- I will help you.

235
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,770
(The Kims are
looking at the drawing.)

236
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,540
- I know him.
- I know him.

237
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,740
I know him.

238
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,780
(He drew Grasshopper.)

239
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,880
What do you think?

240
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,250
Father draws really well.

241
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,450
- Of course.
- He draws really well.

242
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,450
Stop drawing, Father.

243
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,090
No, Father. You're great.

244
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,320
Father.

245
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,230
- You're here.
- You're here.

246
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,330
- It's nice to meet you, Father.
- Ji Hyo.

247
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
What?

248
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,200
(He bows down right away.)

249
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,400
- Father.
- Who is he?

250
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,700
He's my fiancé.

251
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,870
- What?
- Gosh.

252
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,070
I am Ji Hyo's boyfriend, Shindong.

253
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,910
You should say you're my fiancé now.

254
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,970
- Wait.
- Right.

255
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,240
I am her fiancé.

256
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,610
- You're really getting married?
- Yes.

257
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,840
- Wait.
- We're engaged.

258
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,650
- Finally, we are tying the knot.
- Darling.

259
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,680
What?

260
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,250
You're really getting married?

261
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,680
- Wait.
- We're engaged.

262
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,920
Finally, we are tying the knot.

263
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,650
- You!
- She's older.

264
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,120
- Are you older?
- What?

265
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,720
I only go for older ladies.

266
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,520
- Shindong.
- Yes.

267
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,960
- You...
- Ji Hyo's not divorced yet.

268
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,130
(Ji Hyo's not divorced yet.)

269
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,260
What?

270
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
You.
- Why didn't you...
- Are you going to be okay?

271
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,000
tell me such a secret?

272
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
Why didn't you tell him
about your past?

273
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,000
- It's all right, Father.
- How can you...

274
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,300
- reveal your daughter's past?
- It's all right...

275
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,840
- because I have a past too.
- Really?

276
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
What did you do?

277
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,040
- Hey!
- I've been divorced too.

278
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,780
- Right.
- Right.

279
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,810
So it's okay.

280
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,310
Weren't you supposed to get married?

281
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,580
- I failed.
- It's all right.

282
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,980
We both have been hurt,
so we decided to embrace each other.

283
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,220
- Right.
- Right. We wish you good luck.

284
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,120
- Good luck.
- Please give us your blessing.

285
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,660
- But to join my family,
- Yes?

286
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,890
you need to be athletic.

287
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,090
- You can't be like that.
- Athletic?

288
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,560
- I am athletic.
- You are?

289
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,100
- I can do a breakfall.
- Nice.

290
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,460
- A breakfall?
- A breakfall?

291
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,970
Here?

292
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,670
Stop it.

293
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,940
Do you want to see a breakfall?

294
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,100
- Nice.
- A breakfall?

295
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,570
- Here.
- Don't do it.

296
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,870
He's good.

297
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,680
(He's heavy but agile!)

298
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,440
- That was smooth.
- Smooth.

299
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,710
- So smooth.
- Don't do it.

300
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,850
- Don't do it.
- Look.

301
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,380
(Landing lightly)

302
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,520
So smooth.

303
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,180
- So smooth.
- When I was little...

304
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,380
- You could do this?
- My goodness, Shindong.

305
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,550
- He's so good
- I used to do judo.

306
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,120
- You could do this?
- Yes.

307
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,260
- When you were doing this,
- You are amazing.

308
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,720
- you were very bouncy.
- Very smooth.

309
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,190
I am very smooth.

310
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,890
- So sexy!
- He can move.

311
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,090
- He can move.
- So sexy!

312
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,100
Father!

313
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,300
My youngest is...

314
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,760
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

315
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,470
- Father.
- Our cutie pie is here.

316
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,740
- Youngest.
- Pumpkin.

317
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,840
(The youngest Kim, Jang Hoon)

318
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,970
The youngest is...

319
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,710
Why do we always gather outside
under the hot sun?

320
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,110
- He's the youngest?
- We could...

321
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,210
- Jang Hoon.
- stay inside where it's cool.

322
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,450
- He's the youngest?
- Wait.

323
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,480
We could
stay inside where it's cool.

324
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,050
You should say hi
to your father first.

325
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,520
We met earlier, Father.

326
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,050
You should still say hi, boy.

327
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,590
I haven't seen this pumpkin
in a while.

328
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,060
(Big brother steps in
to keep the youngest in line.)

329
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,290
- Boys.
- You cutie pie!

330
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,390
I've missed you.

331
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,500
Hey!

332
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,830
(Groaning)

333
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,070
(The younger brother, 1.5x bigger
than his brother, rebels)

334
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,270
How dare you do that
to your big brother?

335
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,970
What are you doing
to our big brother?

336
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,840
- You had a giant younger brother?
- I haven't been on TV...

337
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,010
with my brothers in a while.

338
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,710
(The Kim family is cursed to grow
with every birth.)

339
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,150
It's hot today.

340
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,210
Should we not get on
each other's nerves?

341
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,810
Let's keep a distance
since it's hot.

342
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,880
(Let's keep a distance
since it's hot.)

343
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,920
You're acting like a star.

344
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,050
- Jang Hoon.
- Jang Hoon is...

345
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,220
Look at our youngest.

346
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,320
- Adore him.
- Don't annoy him.

347
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,260
Jang Hoon, why are you
standing so far away?

348
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,760
- He's moving into the shade.
- It's hot to be close to us.

349
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,230
Come here.

350
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,030
- Come near.
- Go to the center.

351
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,200
It's just
that it's surprisingly hot.

352
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,470
- He got even taller.
- Why did you...

353
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,240
- put on a sweater then?
- Why won't you listen to us?

354
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,410
I thought we were
going to be inside.

355
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,840
Come here.

356
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,610
- I will...
- Father drew...

357
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,810
- He's really good.
- It's been a while.

358
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,850
I drew a little something.

359
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,850
- He looks familiar.
- He...

360
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,420
I am an artist, you know.

361
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,220
And you all have my artistic talent.

362
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,190
I actually did well that time.

363
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,920
I actually did well that time.

364
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,230
Jang Hoon, why did you
bother to bring an umbrella?

365
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,760
I know it's hot, but still.

366
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,100
I know it's hot, but still.

367
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,730
Why would you bring
an umbrella of your own?

368
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,330
(The huge parasol looks
like an umbrella in his hand.)

369
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,900
Why would you bring
an umbrella of your own?

370
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,700
It's nice to see
someone really tall.

371
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,370
- It's hot.
- Yes.

372
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,410
The sun is strong.

373
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,310
- Where?
- I saw a really tall boy earlier.

374
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,440
The really tall boy...

375
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,650
- is looking very upset.
- Right.

376
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,150
He's wiping sweat.

377
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,250
- Tell him to come here.
- He's there?

378
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,450
- Is he outside?
- I guess our family is better.

379
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,820
- At least we're inside.
- I know.

380
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,220
They are our rivals.

381
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,820
They are just one rude family.

382
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,820
A family with no class.

383
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,790
They are just one rude family.

384
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,360
- Okay!
- What? They are here.

385
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,790
- What?
- What?

386
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,230
- It's hot.
- Why did you put us outside?

387
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
- Look.
- Look.

388
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,900
- You rude...
- You nobodies.

389
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,070
- You rude family.
- Gosh.

390
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,670
You nobodies.

391
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,140
- Rude?
- Your family is...

392
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,670
- How dare you?
- the uneducated and cheap one.

393
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,680
- You are the rude ones.
- How dare you?

394
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
- You have no class.
- Gosh.

395
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,110
- Goodness.
- You are the family with no class.

396
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,650
You're wearing that cliché apron
just because you're an artist.

397
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,750
- Cliché?
- Cliché?

398
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,250
Is he a Boy Scout or what?

399
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,420
- Gosh, you.
- Look at that sweat.

400
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,590
- Goodness.
- Look at him sweating.

401
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,820
He's sweating so much.

402
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,890
It's...

403
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,890
- He's so tall.
- I'm already sweating too.

404
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,320
Why are you sweating so much?

405
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,330
I've seen them a lot recently.

406
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,300
In the recent episodes,

407
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,960
- they didn't do this. Why...
- A role play?

408
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,430
- We sometimes do this.
- What's up with the role play?

409
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,830
We do a mix of things.

410
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,170
- A mix of things.
- Hey, Youngest!

411
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,400
We do a mix of things.

412
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,240
(At Yu's, his whining won't work.)

413
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,040
- Hey, Youngest!
- Yes.

414
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,340
You standing in the middle
makes it look like we're swearing.

415
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,210
(Standing tall)

416
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,210
You're sticking out alone.

417
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,720
Go to the side!

418
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,450
Father, I haven't
been on this show in a while.

419
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,520
He's your son?

420
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,820
- He's his son?
- He's his son?

421
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,730
- He's the youngest.
- He's our little brother.

422
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,990
He's our little brother.

423
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,590
(He finds something.)

424
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,260
She's born to be the center figure.

425
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,230
No matter where she is,
she stands in the center.

426
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,640
She's the one
who brings in the viewer rating.

427
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,740
- I am the one.
- She makes people see it.

428
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,840
- She does.
- Do you know why...

429
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,410
- she's next to my little brother?
- Why?

430
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,470
To look pretty.

431
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,440
- To look petite and precious.
- She's good at positioning.

432
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,980
I'm going to stick to you.

433
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,610
- To look petite and precious.
- She's good at positioning.

434
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,880
- She's petite and precious.
- Is that why you're here?

435
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,020
You usually stand there.

436
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,320
- You're making her look pretty.
- She's the pocket girl.

437
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,890
(She can be the pocket girl
only today.)

438
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,590
Who's the man there?

439
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,960
- Me?
- Who?

440
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,330
- I'm a rich man.
- Going on "Show Me the Money?"

441
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,660
- I'm a rich man.
- But look.

442
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,960
You look too cheap...

443
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,530
- to be a rich man.
- Hey!

444
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,530
(He looks too cheap
to be a rich man.)

445
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,300
I don't look as cheap as you do.

446
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,440
- Youngest.
- You little man.

447
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,400
Fake jewelry will make
your allergies explode.

448
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,210
- How dare you?
- Aren't you the son?

449
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,240
(The two families fight.)

450
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,740
How dare you fight my father?

451
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,380
- What are you doing?
- He's the father?

452
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,350
- I'm the father.
- He's the father.

453
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,350
- He is?
- What kind of a family is this?

454
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,590
I'm the daughter-in-law.

455
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,120
(The daughter-in-law joins in.)

456
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,390
(Flinching)

457
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,890
- That was intimidating.
- Baby brother!

458
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
- Thank you, honey.
- No way.

459
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,560
- Honey, let me handle this.
- Baby brother.

460
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,060
Jang Hoon, as the youngest,
you should defend the family.

461
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,300
- What a bunch of jerks!
- Are you kidding me?

462
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,670
- How dare you?
- You wait and see.

463
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,440
- Shindong, Jang Hoon,
- Unbelievable.

464
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,580
and Gi Ru are here...

465
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,040
as our guests today.

466
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,350
- What's this?
- No way.

467
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,320
"Baebully Hills" airing on Disney?

468
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,580
- What's this?
- "Baebully Hills."

469
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,920
- "Baebully Hills?"
- On August 24.

470
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,190
It's the second season
of "Meokjjippa."

471
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,320
- You all know "Meokjjippa."
- Of course.

472
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,430
- It's a remake of that show.
- I see.

473
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,560
We're aliens from space
called Baebullians.

474
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,800
(Embarrassed)

475
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,500
We're aliens.

476
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,640
- We're Baebullians...
- Aliens?

477
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,140
who have come to attack Earth.

478
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,810
- Are you aliens?
- That's right.

479
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,540
(They have to consume
plenty of calories...)

480
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,680
(to make it back
to their home star.)

481
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,780
(Seo Jang Hoon)

482
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,410
(Shindong)

483
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,780
(A show featuring Baebullians
who must eat to survive)

484
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,220
(Shin Gi Ru)

485
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,620
("Baebully Hills")

486
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,060
"Baebully Hills" will premiere
on August 24.

487
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,490
That sounds like fun!

488
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,400
- Show your support.
- Good luck.

489
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,830
Good luck.

490
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,330
This is the Between Masterpiece
and Failure Race.

491
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,500
The rival artist families...

492
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,670
- will face off with their drawings.
- Really?

493
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,140
- This will be easy.
- We'll see which family...

494
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,610
comes out on top.

495
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,340
Each of your drawings...

496
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,150
will be evaluated in a unique way...

497
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,880
to determine its price.

498
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,180
Nice.

499
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,650
The family whose drawings
have the higher total value...

500
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,550
will win.

501
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,760
- Okay!
- Okay.

502
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,020
The father of the winning family...

503
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,460
will be awarded a prize
with no risk of penalty.

504
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,960
- Just the father?
- The family members...

505
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,560
whose drawings
have the two highest values...

506
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,570
will win a prize.

507
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,900
The one with the lowest value
will receive a penalty.

508
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,470
- But I'm bad at drawing.
- As for the losing team,

509
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,510
the father will receive a penalty,
no matter what.

510
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,970
Aside from those with
the two highest-valued drawings,

511
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,340
the others will receive a penalty.

512
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,780
- The losing team...
- I should wreak havoc.

513
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,610
Even if you lose,

514
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,750
- you won't receive a penalty...
- With the two highest values.

515
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,490
if your family's drawing is pricier.

516
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,320
What about those
who are bad at drawing?

517
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,390
- Just work hard on it, Jang Hoon.
- You see...

518
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,630
Stop whining.

519
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,560
- You see, it's like this.
- Seriously?

520
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,430
The evaluation of the drawings
will go beyond techniques.

521
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,500
Am I not allowed to ask that?

522
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,430
They will consider
your drawing skills.

523
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,170
- But...
- Why are you scolding my brother?

524
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,700
- Hold on. What was that?
- Some people can't draw.

525
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,640
- That's my son you're scolding.
- Some people can't draw.

526
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,840
That's my son you're scolding.

527
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,280
- Some people can't draw.
- Jang Hoon, it's okay.

528
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,810
- What was that?
- What's wrong with your family?

529
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,880
Father, step aside.

530
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,580
(The teto daughter-in-law returns
to the mound.)

531
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,650
- What's with her?
- She's intimidating for sure.

532
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,450
Just know that she is
not as strong as she looks.

533
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,160
- She may wear 300mm shoes,
- Really?

534
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,820
- but she's weak.
- Your shoe size is 300mm?

535
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,160
I'll win the drawing contest.

536
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,090
- You'll win with your drawing?
- With her drawing.

537
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,860
By playing today's games,

538
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,330
you'll gain benefits...

539
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,400
that let you boost...

540
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,500
- Of course.
- the price of your drawings,

541
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,200
- I knew it.
- regardless of your talent.

542
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,510
You'll regroup after changing
into matching clothes.

543
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,970
- Okay!
- Let's go.

544
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,740
Our family has always had class.

545
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,940
My style is hyperrealism.

546
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,080
I'm glad our dad...

547
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,180
quit being a comedian
and chose to draw.

548
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,310
- Let's go.
- Sure.

549
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,450
Let's go!

550
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,150
Okay! Goodness!

551
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,790
(What shocked the members?)

552
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,050
- What's that?
- What's that?

553
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,960
- Are you kidding me?
- It's fried chicken.

554
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,560
(The Baebullians react
to the fried chicken.)

555
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,390
- It's fried chicken.
- Fried chicken.

556
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,060
- No way.
- I can't believe it.

557
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,060
It's my favorite brand.

558
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,330
- No way. It's fried chicken.
- It's fried chicken.

559
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,740
Why are we getting fried chicken?

560
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,400
- What's that?
- You can't create art...

561
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,010
on an empty stomach,

562
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,440
so you'll eat
before we begin the race.

563
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,480
(Recharging their souls
before letting their artistry flow)

564
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,410
- That must be the sauce.
- Look at this.

565
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,210
What's this?

566
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,350
- Hold on.
- This looks delicious.

567
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,880
- No way.
- Can you believe it?

568
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,950
I taste pepper.

569
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,520
That tastes good.

570
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,120
What? No way.

571
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,230
That wasn't a normal crunch.
It was more like a crack.

572
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,690
- Crack?
- The batter makes a cracking sound.

573
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,860
- A crack?
- Yes. Try one.

574
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,900
- I haven't had breakfast.
- No way.

575
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,400
(Gi Ru's busy getting ready
to have fried chicken.)

576
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,200
(Fidgeting)

577
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,800
That's for Gi Ru alone.

578
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,910
- That's hers.
- I see.

579
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,210
(Just for Gi Ru)

580
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,280
- That's hers.
- I see.

581
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,610
- Enjoy it all.
- That's mine.

582
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,780
- She almost hit you.
- I almost got hit.

583
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,820
- Ye Eun, where are your manners?
- I'm sorry.

584
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,690
- Ye Eun, she's your sister-in-law.
- Yes, of course.

585
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,390
- This is for your sister-in-law.
- She's your sister-in-law.

586
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,820
That's for Gi Ru alone,

587
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,090
- but Ye Eun almost took one.
- My sister-in-law.

588
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,020
- Did you almost take hers?
- Yes, and I'm sorry.

589
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,390
Give her a warning, will you?
A family should function better.

590
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,400
I'm sorry, honey.

591
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,100
(She takes a bite
once she's kept her family in line.)

592
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,440
Is it delicious?

593
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,970
- Totally.
- Isn't it super crunchy?

594
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,270
This must be the sauce.

595
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,310
Really?
Should we have some with this?

596
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,140
That's too much.

597
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,180
- It's really good.
- Is it delicious?

598
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,910
- Totally.
- Isn't it super crunchy?

599
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,680
It's more than just crunchy.

600
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,650
(Perfect for the Food Fighter)

601
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,020
The sauce is delicious.

602
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,360
- I see. I get it now.
- It's so good.

603
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,230
You can enjoy it
with the sauce of your choice.

604
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,790
- It's crunchy.
- I want the pepper sauce.

605
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,160
You can enjoy it
with a variety of flavors.

606
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,100
You put the sauce on top like so.

607
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,430
(Opening another packet)

608
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,500
(She's opening all three packets?)

609
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,940
- I've never had powdered sauce.
- Dip it like so.

610
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,140
- There must be three sauces.
- That's a proper feast.

611
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,680
- Enjoy the three sauces.
- Right.

612
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,810
- She knows her stuff.
- It's like lamb skewers.

613
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,250
Look at Gi Ru.
That's a proper feast.

614
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,220
(Just then)

615
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,420
- Goodness.
- Is that a penalty?

616
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,320
- We...
- Don't they get anything to eat?

617
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,560
We're the faces...

618
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,030
of different fried chicken brands.

619
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,190
(They're the faces
of different fried chicken brands.)

620
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,490
Jang Hoon's the face of one too.

621
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,430
(There are family members
who can't eat the chicken.)

622
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,060
Honey, open wide.

623
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,830
I sprinkled all three types
of sauce on that.

624
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,840
- Nice.
- Is that it?

625
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,010
If you want a snack,
have this fried chicken.

626
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,910
(They all enjoy the fried chicken.)

627
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,140
You can enjoy it
with the sauce like so.

628
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,480
- No way.
- It's so good.

629
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,680
- It's delicious.
- Isn't it amazing?

630
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,280
Fried chicken is a bit too heavy
to have for breakfast.

631
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,720
If you're almost done
with your meal,

632
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,320
- we'll move on to the game.
- Okay.

633
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,020
What if some of us
haven't had enough?

634
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,260
Gi Ru can eat
three fried chickens for brunch.

635
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,490
Let's move on if we've had enough.

636
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,060
- Shindong...
- Stop eating, will you?

637
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,230
- Shindong's a big guy.
- They're removing the table.

638
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,530
(The Baebullian keeps eating
until the very end.)

639
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,370
Stop eating, will you?

640
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,270
(Glaring)

641
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,910
You've had enough.

642
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,010
Wait.

643
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,410
(She quickly secures her Coke.)

644
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,440
But I want more.

645
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,650
They took it away
without even saying anything.

646
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,150
(After the feast of a breakfast
that left them wanting more)

647
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,920
Hold on. Two, four...

648
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,220
They have more members.

649
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,920
- Over here. Sit here, honey.
- Here?

650
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,960
(Immersed in the skit)

651
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,890
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo and Shindong
sit far apart.)

652
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,100
- You take the inner seat.
- I'll sit next to Gi Ru.

653
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,530
Okay!

654
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,000
Shindong, you really need
to pick a side.

655
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,130
Tell me about it.

656
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,940
Either gain more weight or lose it.

657
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,000
- Right?
- He's right.

658
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,940
- You look too handsome right now.
- Aren't I mediocre?

659
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,040
He weighs over 100kg.

660
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,270
- He can't.
- No way.

661
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,710
- What do you mean?
- How can he be 100kg?

662
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,610
- He's heavier than 100kg.
- No way.

663
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,880
- Do you weigh over 100kg?
- I'm 103kg.

664
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,750
Why do I feel like
you're not exactly fat or slender?

665
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,320
We're nearly the same size.

666
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,680
- Exactly.
- I shouldn't have been...

667
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,790
- part of this group.
- Why not?

668
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,760
(He was robbed
of his chance to talk.)

669
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,890
(Sucking in every topic
and making it about himself)

670
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,960
I'm on the slimmer side.

671
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,490
- What?
- No way.

672
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,230
- I...
- You're a giant.

673
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,730
I'm slender.

674
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,300
- Slender?
- He says he's slender.

675
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,570
(Presenting himself appealingly
to others)

676
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,140
Look at Gi Ru, for instance.
She has a specific character.

677
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,700
- Gi Ru's cute.
- She's adorable.

678
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,740
Gi Ru's adorable.

679
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,340
- Absolutely. She looks like a cat.
- Totally cute.

680
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,210
Don't be ridiculous.

681
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,880
- She looks like a cat?
- She looks like a cat.

682
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,850
She's a water buffalo.

683
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,880
A water buffalo?

684
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,950
- One from Africa.
- A buffalo.

685
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,720
He's known as Kim Woo Bin
in "Baebully Hills."

686
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,790
From space...

687
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,050
He's known as Kim Woo Bin.

688
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,050
- From space...
- Kim Woo Bin?

689
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,220
Are you kidding me?

690
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,290
Kim Woo Bin.

691
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,430
- Don't you dare.
- Don't irritate us.

692
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,230
- Kim Woo Bin's my ideal man.
- Isn't he like Mr. Bean?

693
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,100
- He's your ideal man, then.
- I didn't call myself that.

694
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,500
Kim Woo Bin, my foot.

695
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,430
Come on. He's a taller Mr. Bean.

696
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,570
There's something peculiar
about that family.

697
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,770
Jang Hoon looks like the father.

698
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,640
- Tell me about it.
- That's the vibe I'm getting.

699
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,340
I'm 16.

700
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,910
- But...
- I see.

701
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,480
- Are you 16?
- He's still a minor.

702
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,120
- I said I was 16.
- Let me explain the game.

703
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,480
It's to determine how much time
you'll get to draw.

704
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,650
This is Swift Correct Answer Mode.

705
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,650
- Okay.
- I see.

706
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,160
In order, each family member...

707
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,790
must say three words
that fit the category...

708
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,660
within the time limit.

709
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,730
- Three?
- Yes.

710
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,030
- Three each.
- Three each?

711
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,160
Three each?

712
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,430
You'll fail
if you answer incorrectly...

713
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,700
or don't say them in time.

714
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,370
If the other team gets it wrong,

715
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,840
you can shoot them...

716
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,470
- with the given water gun.
- Sounds good.

717
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,240
Do we all get sprayed
even if one person gets it wrong?

718
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,910
Yes. The team that gets
all its family members to say...

719
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,410
- the three words first will win.
- Nice.

720
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,350
Since Team Jae Seok
has five members,

721
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,220
one will have to answer twice.

722
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,350
Jae Seok, you can go twice.

723
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,420
I can't do that.

724
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,620
That won't be easy to do.

725
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,350
Gi Ru, would you like go twice?
Are you good at these things?

726
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,490
- I'm terrible at playing games.
- Are you?

727
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,990
Ssaebssaeb, you'll do it.

728
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,290
- Should I go twice at the end?
- Yes.

729
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,490
- That's it.
- Got it.

730
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,300
- Go first.
- Should we go first?

731
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,560
- Yes.
- Jae Seok, will you go first?

732
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,600
I'll go first.

733
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,100
Here's your keyword.

734
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,500
- Okay.
- We start with Jae Seok.

735
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,600
Let's do this!

736
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,840
Name Korean co-ed singing groups.

737
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,970
- One, two, three.
- KOYOTE, the one with "Famous..."

738
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,240
ALLDAY PROJECT.

739
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,910
(Failed)

740
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,120
(They spray him with water
as soon as he gets it wrong.)

741
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,450
(Grinning from ear to ear
at their own Waterbomb Festival)

742
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,090
No hands!

743
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,060
- No hands!
- Hold on.

744
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,960
- Hold on a second.
- Don't cover your face.

745
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,760
- Only aim at him.
- Guys.

746
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,500
- You all get sprayed.
- Wait.

747
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,870
- You should stop...
- You all get sprayed.

748
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,670
after having done enough.

749
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,600
- What are you talking about?
- Why did you keep shooting?

750
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,810
Doesn't it look silly
to cover your face...

751
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,640
with your hands?

752
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,910
(He nitpicks over the way
Jae Seok gets shot at.)

753
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,210
- Of course.
- What are you saying?

754
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,650
- He should take it like a man.
- Come on.

755
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,280
You shouldn't cover your face
with your hands.

756
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,090
Why does Jang Hoon talk so much?

757
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,390
That's how he is.

758
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,560
We can just ignore him.

759
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,290
He does shows where he talks a lot.

760
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,560
Why do you talk so much?

761
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,760
- He does a lot of talk shows.
- Was he always this talkative?

762
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,160
I do shows where I talk...

763
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,500
- all day long.
- His shows are like that.

764
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,000
Pretend you don't hear him.

765
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,570
He's a chatterbox.

766
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,500
- It's your turn now.
- He talks too slowly, that's why.

767
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,740
- Will Jong Kook go first?
- Okay. I'll go first.

768
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,510
- Good luck, Father!
- Okay.

769
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,180
Are you ready?
Yu Jae Seok's nicknames.

770
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,280
- One,
- Grasshopper!

771
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,680
- two,
- Grass...

772
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,950
Why does he have so many nicknames?

773
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,920
- Two, three.
- Grass... Why does he...

774
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,090
(They start shooting
before the verdict is announced.)

775
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,660
Grasshopper,
Small Nipples, Low-chested.

776
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,790
Small Nipples, Low-chested.

777
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,590
Hey.

778
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,230
It's true. You can look them up.
They're on a site.

779
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,860
- Grasshopper.
- Low-chested.

780
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,830
When did "Low-chested"
become a nickname?

781
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,470
- Low-chested.
- Jae Seok.

782
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,600
Your nipples are way down here.

783
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,300
Grasshopper, Low-chested...

784
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,770
Let's be honest.
Wasn't that a tough one?

785
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,340
- Grasshopper.
- Grasshopper.

786
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,480
- Ugly Face.
- Lousy Shot.

787
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,980
- Beloved Host?
- Front Teeth.

788
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,580
Yu San Seul.

789
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,480
- No...
- He's Yu San Seul.

790
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,850
There are so many.

791
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,720
They shot at me
when I was trying to concentrate.

792
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,150
- What am I to do?
- You shoot at us, then.

793
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,290
- You shoot at us.
- Excuse me.

794
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,830
- Sir.
- You shoot at us.

795
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,300
(The chatterbox has more to say.)

796
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,400
- Hey! Shoot from over there.
- Jang Hoon.

797
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,130
(Pretending not to hear)

798
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,500
No one's listening to Jang Hoon.

799
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,540
- Hey, if we're wrong...
- Can someone get me earplugs?

800
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,370
- If we're wrong...
- I can't hear on this side.

801
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,780
They must start shooting
after the referee decides...

802
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,910
- they got it wrong.
- Hey, Jang Hoon.

803
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,110
- Mister! Talk it out with us!
- Jang Hoon.

804
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,380
Yes, wait. Jang Hoon.

805
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,550
- Jang Hoon.
- Yes?

806
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,450
Why do you keep talking to the crew
and not to us?

807
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,350
- You won't listen.
- He's talking to the viewers.

808
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,590
- That's why.
- They won't listen.

809
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,090
He cares a lot about the public.

810
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,090
Give it a go.

811
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,860
- Then now...
- Wait. Let's start from that end.

812
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,730
- From this end?
- Okay.

813
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,730
Are you ready?

814
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,770
Three Super Junior members
who are currently working.

815
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,600
Shindong, Kyu Hyun, Kim Hee Chul.

816
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,670
- Good.
- Well done.

817
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,870
That was easy!

818
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,440
Father?

819
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,740
- Why are you so whiny?
- Father.

820
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,640
I paint to release my anger.

821
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,640
Gosh.

822
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,650
Next up is Ye Eun.

823
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,210
Three celebrities
with your family name.

824
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,480
Jee Seok Jin,
Ji Ye Eun, Ji Chang Wook.

825
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,950
- Okay.
- Okay!

826
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,390
Jee Seok Jin,
Ji Ye Eun, Ji Chang Wook.

827
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,950
(2 successes in a row)

828
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,860
- Yes. Well done.
- Come on!

829
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,660
(The Yu Family is the 1st
to succeed 2 times in a row.)

830
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,660
Gosh. They're good.

831
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,730
Don't be nervous. It's easy.

832
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,530
- Wait. I...
- It's easy.

833
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,100
Movies that Lee Byung Hun was in.

834
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
One...

835
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,010
(She just has to name 3
out of this long list.)

836
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,670
- Two,
- Tteok Bo's... No, wait.

837
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,340
- three.
- Tteok Bo's...

838
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,950
(Tteok Bo?)

839
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,280
- "Tteok Bo's Day?"
- What's that?

840
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,850
What on earth is "Tteok Bo's Day?"

841
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,450
What is that even?

842
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,850
When was Byung Hun
in "Tteok Bo's Day?"

843
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,390
- "Tteok Bo?"
- Oh, "Squid Game."

844
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,790
- "Squid Game?"
- I confused that with this.

845
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,190
- They're so different.
- "Squid Game" and "Tteok Bo's Day?"

846
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,600
You can eat squid and rice cakes...
Anyway, I got confused.

847
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,900
- Gosh.
- What a shame.

848
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,970
Who will go first?

849
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,100
Jang Hoon.

850
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,570
It's too much pressure to go first.
I'll do it.

851
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,600
- Which way do we go?
- Okay.

852
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,210
- I'll start, and we'll go this way.
- He went to Yonsei University.

853
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,240
- Yonsei University.
- Okay.

854
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,440
Jang Hoon's impossible to miss.

855
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,680
Jang Hoon's first.

856
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,640
Three male idol groups.

857
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,980
- One,
- What?

858
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,050
- two,
- Super Junior...

859
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,580
Come on, Jang Hoon.
My dear younger brother.

860
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,120
Super Junior...

861
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,690
Aim for his head.

862
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,560
You're sitting next to
a Super Junior member.

863
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,090
A Super Junior member is
next to you, Jang Hoon.

864
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,730
Ruin his hairstyle.

865
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,800
(He's getting a hydrating facial.)

866
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,460
You could name at least one!

867
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,570
- Jang Hoon...
- Hey!

868
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,570
(Laughing)

869
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,940
- Do you need a beating?
- Jae Seok's overjoyed.

870
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,570
(He's pleased to see
Jang Hoon drenched.)

871
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,940
- Hey.
- Look at him.

872
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,210
I love it.

873
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,980
My gosh. Look.

874
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,850
Hey. Look. See what he did?

875
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,120
(Covering up shyly)

876
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,190
(The culprit was...)

877
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,830
(Yang Ssaebssaeb
aimed for his groin.)

878
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,200
Hey, that's a low move.
Se Chan... Why would he aim at...

879
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Why were you sitting like that?
Don't spread your legs out.

880
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,170
I've never known someone
to wear cotton slacks...

881
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,210
to shoot an active, physical
variety show like ours.

882
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,540
- Long pants...
- Hey.

883
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,480
- That's his uniform.
- It's what he wears.

884
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,950
(It happens to be pale
and pretty fitting too.)

885
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,080
- He's wearing slacks.
- So what?

886
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,580
- I'm sorry, but...
- That's because he's 16.

887
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,350
this is what I usually wear
on my other shows.

888
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,120
- Yes, but we're...
- It's because...

889
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,190
he rarely shows his lower body
on his other shows.

890
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,490
- It looks like it's washed.
- Mr. Cotton Slacks.

891
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,230
I'd love to get that completely wet.

892
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,590
He looks funny.

893
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,230
Who dresses like that
for Running Man?

894
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,700
My gosh...

895
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,970
Okay. Let's start with Jae Seok.

896
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,100
- Okay.
- Let's go!

897
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,400
- Let's cheer. One, two, three.
- Let's go. One, two, three.

898
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,000
- Let's go!
- Let's win!

899
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,010
Celebrities under the Antenna label.
One...

900
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,280
(Celebrities
under the Antenna label)

901
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,740
(Jae Seok and Se Chan
are represented by Antenna!)

902
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,550
- Yu Hui Yeol, me...
- Three!

903
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,280
- Yu...
- Come on.

904
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
(Incorrect)

905
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,790
Yang Se Chan.

906
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,650
"Me?"

907
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,190
- Who is "me?"
- Hey!

908
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,090
- That was easy!
- Me!

909
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,960
Me! I was right here!

910
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,600
- Why...
- Jae Seok, Se Chan, Lee Hyo Ri!

911
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,000
- Yes! Lee Seo Jin!
- Not long ago...

912
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,560
- Me!
- you filmed together.

913
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,000
Me!

914
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,470
(Squelch)

915
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,800
What was that?

916
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,480
- Me!
- What was that?

917
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,240
- What was that?
- Hang on.

918
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,180
I think Jang Hoon is
crushing on Ye Eun.

919
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,450
- Why?
- He won't stop shooting at her.

920
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,180
(The love-crazed fool comes up
with a weird subplot.)

921
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,450
Are you showing how you feel
with your water pistol?

922
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,450
(A weird subplot)

923
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,490
(Giants from rival families
falling in love?)

924
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,190
I thought he was harassing her,
but he was flirting.

925
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,190
Hey.

926
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,690
- Mr. Cotton Slacks!
- Seriously.

927
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,200
Are you serious?

928
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,030
- It's for real?
- Really?

929
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,230
Hey. Nice.

930
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,100
- Nice.
- What's that?

931
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,200
He confessed his love. What for?

932
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,510
- Nice.
- "Nice."

933
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,870
- What?
- You like her?

934
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,840
- You're professing your love?
- For real?

935
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,910
Ye Eun said
her ideal type was Kim Woo Bin.

936
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,550
- Yes.
- She's all about good looks.

937
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:18,390
(Ye Eun's 175cm, and he's 205cm,
an exhilarating height difference.)

938
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,860
Seo Jang Hoon!

939
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,090
(It's a fake subplot made up
purely for entertainment purposes.)

940
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,060
What is this, really?

941
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,930
This is fun.

942
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,500
- Is it that side?
- I'll go first.

943
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,200
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

944
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,000
Three foreign singers.

945
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,570
Christina Aguilera,
Britney Spears, Michael Jackson!

946
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,340
(Christina Aguilera,
Britney Spears, Michael Jackson)

947
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,440
Christina Aguilera,
Britney Spears, Michael Jackson!

948
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,080
(The Kim Family
succeeds for the first time.)

949
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,880
- Yes!
- Yes.

950
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
(Jong Kook is next.)

951
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,710
Jong Kook, it's your turn.

952
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,650
Jong Kook, name three shows
Seo Jang Hoon appears on.

953
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,460
(Will Jang Hoon's good friend
get it right?)

954
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,920
- One,
- "My Little Old Boy."

955
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,860
two, three.

956
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,460
(Incorrect)

957
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,030
(Ugly duckling!)

958
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,100
(His yell is followed by silence.)

959
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,400
Darn you.

960
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,600
- Hey!
- You should know by now.

961
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
- Hey.
- He knows nothing.

962
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,070
- I do so many...
- The divorce show!

963
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,770
- You...
- "My Little Old Boy."

964
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,740
"Men on a Mission."

965
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,210
Come on, Kook Jong.

966
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,450
I watch them all, but the titles...

967
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,280
Who memorizes the titles these days?

968
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,880
Okay. You're making...

969
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,920
- so little progress.
- We're useless.

970
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,950
- It's hard.
- It's too hard.

971
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,950
We'll let you pass twice.

972
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,860
- Okay, good.
- Two passes.

973
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,830
Who will go first on this side?

974
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,530
- I'll go first.
- You start it off.

975
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,960
Okay.

976
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,400
- If you don't know, pass.
- If you don't know, pass.

977
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,060
- Let's do it this time.
- If you don't know, pass.

978
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Three of Seok Jin's nicknames.

979
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,300
- One, two,
- Seok Sam, Big Nose,

980
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,940
- feeble kid.
- Okay.

981
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,370
"Feeble kid..."
- Feeble kid.
- Feeble kid.

982
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,380
They're all names he came up with!

983
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,750
- They're all what he calls him!
- He's feeble.

984
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,950
What is "feeble kid?"

985
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,080
Feeble kid.

986
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,690
- What, feeble kid?
- Feeble kid.

987
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,290
We did this for decades.

988
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,120
They should be nicknames...

989
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,730
- the viewers are familiar with.
- The oh, so feeble kid.

990
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,290
- "Feeble kid?"
- Feeble kid.

991
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,400
You can look it up online.

992
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,300
- Let's keep going.
- Seok Jin is next.

993
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,400
- Okay.
- Three of Jong Kook's songs...

994
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,800
including Turbo songs.

995
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,000
- One, two,
- "One Man," "Twist King,"

996
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,000
- three!
- Pass!

997
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,670
(He used his "pass" chance
before the chime.)

998
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,680
- He passed.
- I said "pass."

999
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,810
You can do this too?

1000
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,910
Three of Jong Kook's songs.

1001
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,080
"Twist King,"
"December," "Black Cat Nero."

1002
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,080
- Okay!
- "December,"

1003
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,220
(She successfully answered
the same question.)

1004
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,750
- Ye Eun's next.
- Yes.

1005
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,720
Three Chinese idioms. One,

1006
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,990
- two,
- Yeokhak... Pass!

1007
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,460
(No one can pass now.)

1008
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,560
Three Chinese idioms.

1009
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,830
- Gojingamrae, yeokjisaji.
- Two,

1010
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,830
ilseokyijo!

1011
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,770
You did it!

1012
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,400
(The leader of the empty heads
is doing a great job.)

1013
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,840
- Great!
- They need to get one more right.

1014
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,810
You need one more right.

1015
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,610
- We need one more.
- Who will do it?

1016
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,540
(Se Chan's the one left.)

1017
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,380
(What is the last question
that will decide the result?)

1018
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,550
- He's the last one.
- Are you ready?

1019
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,520
Three English words
starting with the letter M.

1020
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,490
Three English words
starting with the letter M.

1021
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,860
- Memory!
- One.

1022
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,420
Two.

1023
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,560
- Moya!
- Three.

1024
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,730
Gosh, what?

1025
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,930
- Moya!
- Three.

1026
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:11,960
Gosh, what?

1027
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Moya!

1028
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,130
(He runs out of time as he can't
overcome the language barrier.)

1029
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,370
- What is "Moya?"
- What? "Moya?"

1030
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,400
(What is "Moya" supposed to be?)

1031
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,970
Moya!

1032
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
"Moya?"

1033
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,940
- MBC.
- Hey, you could've said music.

1034
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,240
- Music, memory.
- Oh, music.

1035
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,710
Gosh, you could've succeeded.

1036
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,740
- Memory, music.
- It's such a shame.

1037
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,880
- Let's succeed this time.
- Yes.

1038
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,280
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1039
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,650
- We'll do this, no matter what.
- Just once.

1040
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,380
- If possible, try not to pass...
- No matter what, just go.

1041
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,520
- for the next person's sake.
- Right.

1042
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,490
- Pass after you try.
- Okay.

1043
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,020
- Pass after you try.
- Pass after you try.

1044
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,790
We have to buy time
for the people behind us.

1045
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,360
Also, you have to think about...

1046
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,660
the question before
as much as you can.

1047
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,860
Okay.

1048
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,300
That way, you can get it right
when it becomes your turn.

1049
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,430
Who will go first?

1050
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,500
We'll start with our youngest.

1051
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,170
- So, starting with Jang Hoon?
- Yes.

1052
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,400
- No, you go first.
- That way.

1053
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
- Start there and go this way.
- "You go first?"

1054
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,170
- No, let's start with you, Dad.
- Why, you rude punk!

1055
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,570
Dad, you go first.

1056
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,570
(Getting shot
right in the Adam's apple)

1057
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,870
Let's start with Dad.

1058
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,280
- Then, starting with Jong Kook.
- Yes.

1059
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,610
Okay, I'll go first.

1060
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
All right.

1061
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,350
Three foreign sports stars.

1062
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,950
(Jong Kook is absolutely crazy
about sports.)

1063
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,450
- Three.
- Park Ji... Oh, Cristiano Ronaldo!

1064
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,720
- Messi!
- Okay.

1065
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,020
- Three!
- Jordan!

1066
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,460
Why didn't you pass?

1067
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,560
- Why didn't you pass?
- Why won't you pass?

1068
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,890
(An athlete
with nothing but a loud voice)

1069
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,490
(Soccer Kim stumbles over
the sports question as well as in sports.)

1070
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,730
I was going to pass...

1071
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,500
- after doing as much as I could.
- You say you love soccer so much.

1072
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,530
Jong Kook got it all wrong too.

1073
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
Okay, then.

1074
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,140
Now, we'll only give you...

1075
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,570
- one last chance each.
- Okay.

1076
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,140
- Okay.
- They're so harsh only on us.

1077
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,440
Hey, we should...

1078
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,080
- Yes, this sounds good.
- Let's go with this.

1079
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,180
- Let's go.
- Pass if you don't know.

1080
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,480
- We can pass twice, right?
- Let's get this right.

1081
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,610
- Pass if you don't know.
- All right.

1082
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,810
- Pass if you don't know.
- Pass if you don't know.

1083
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,610
Three great historical figures
of Korea.

1084
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,780
- One.
- Admiral Yi Sun Sin.

1085
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,780
- Two.
- Shin Saimdang.

1086
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,880
- Sejong the Great.
- Okay!

1087
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,250
Let's go.

1088
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,660
Okay. Three foreign musicians.

1089
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,490
- One.
- Beethoven. Bach. Handel.

1090
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,860
(Foreign musicians:
Beethoven, Bach, Handel)

1091
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,290
(He even succeeds
in the difficult question.)

1092
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,360
- So smart!
- Let's go.

1093
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,760
Okay, Gi Ru.

1094
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,630
Three foreign painters.

1095
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,830
- Pass.
- One.

1096
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,470
Foreign painters. One.

1097
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,700
- Picasso. Pass.
- Two.

1098
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,740
Three great historical figures
with four syllables in their names.

1099
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,270
- Historical figures? Shin Saimdang.
- One.

1100
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,740
- Two.
- Madame Curie.

1101
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,780
Sejong the Great.

1102
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,210
(Yang Se Chan succeeds again.)

1103
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,250
Gosh, Se Chan!

1104
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,250
Madame Curie?

1105
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,450
- Isn't it Marie Curie?
- Madame Curie is correct!

1106
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,590
- Madame Curie is her name.
- Oh, even the "Madame" part?

1107
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,890
- Madame Curie.
- What?

1108
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,320
You said "Madame" Curie.

1109
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,060
- Madame Curie.
- It's Marie Curie!

1110
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,660
- Her name is Marie Curie.
- Yes, but she's called...

1111
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,490
- You can't say Madame Curie.
- Gosh, what's up with him?

1112
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,030
- Jong Kook, isn't she Madame Curie?
- Curie.

1113
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,300
- Look.
- Isn't she a "Madame?"

1114
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,700
Then, Daddy Jae Seok.

1115
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,200
Should Daddy Jae Seok
also count as four syllables?

1116
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,200
- Big bro Jong Kook. Four syllables.
- Gosh, Big bro Jong Kook?

1117
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,300
- What is that?
- My gosh!

1118
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,240
Madame Curie?

1119
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,670
- Does that make sense?
- I mean...

1120
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,380
- Also... Hang on.
- Marie Curie should be right.

1121
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,740
All right. They have one more left.

1122
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,450
- Here's the last question.
- They have one more left.

1123
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,050
- The last question.
- Me?

1124
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,250
Three well-known scientists.

1125
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,450
- Einstein.
- One.

1126
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,350
Let's go.

1127
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,320
- Einstein.
- One.

1128
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,860
Two. Three.

1129
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
(Fail)

1130
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,130
(Madame Curie is a scientist too.)

1131
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,100
My gosh. Seriously?

1132
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,030
For this team,
all but one succeeded.

1133
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,900
- Let's do it this time.
- Okay.

1134
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,070
For real. Let's do it.

1135
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,910
- Starting with Shindong.
- We'll go this way.

1136
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,110
Three songs by Haha.

1137
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,110
- One. Two.
- Give him one hour.

1138
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,510
Pass. Gosh, I don't know.

1139
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,780
"Dang Diggi Bang,"
"SSK," "You Are My Destiny."

1140
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,780
- What's "SSK?"
- "SSK?"

1141
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,720
- "Story of a Short Kid."
- But you said...

1142
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,890
No, you should've said "Story of..."

1143
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,450
- You can't call it "SSK."
- What is that?

1144
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,820
We let you get away
with Madame Curie!

1145
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,020
- Okay.
- Well, okay.

1146
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,330
- Go ahead.
- Madame Curie.

1147
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,290
- All right. Now, it's Daniel.
- Okay.

1148
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,900
Three songs by Super Junior.

1149
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,960
- That's so easy.
- One.

1150
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,170
- "Sorry Sorry."
- Two.

1151
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,530
- Two.
- Pass!

1152
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,570
- Okay.
- All right.

1153
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,970
(They've already used up
all of their passes.)

1154
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,400
- "Sorry, Sorry," "Rokuko..."
- One.

1155
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,470
Two.

1156
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:47,780
(Will Jong Kook know
Super Junior's songs?)

1157
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,080
"Express Mode!"

1158
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,180
("Express Mode")

1159
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,450
"Express Mode!"

1160
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:57,390
(Somehow, the old bachelor
remembered a new song!)

1161
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,450
- "Express Mode."
- My goodness.

1162
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,920
You've used all of your passes now.

1163
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,920
- There are two of us left.
- Okay, Ji Hyo.

1164
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,490
Three four-syllable Chinese idioms.

1165
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,900
- One.
- Ilseokyijo.

1166
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,600
- Two.
- "2 Days and 1 Night."

1167
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,800
- "2 Days and 1 Night?"
- "2 Days and 1 Night."

1168
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,130
("2 Days and 1 Night")

1169
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,640
- "2 Days and 1 Night."
- Hey, Ji Hyo.

1170
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,870
Gosh, how could you ask Ji Hyo...

1171
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,040
How could you ask Ji Hyo for
three four-syllable Chinese idioms?

1172
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,810
- Isn't that too harsh?
- They're our rival show!

1173
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,480
- Our rival show!
- Hey, but Ji Hyo.

1174
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,610
- Ji Hyo, they're our rival show!
- "2 Days and 1 Night" is...

1175
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,950
That's a show that airs
at the same time as our show.

1176
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,480
I mean, four-syllable Chinese idioms
for Ji Hyo?

1177
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,390
- Gosh, but "2 Days and 1 Night" is big.
- It is big.

1178
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,120
Here is the result of the mission.

1179
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,220
The Yu Family has won.

1180
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,360
- So,
- Okay!

1181
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,990
when you draw the picture
at the end,

1182
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,460
you can choose two people...

1183
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,860
to take two more minutes.

1184
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,860
Okay.

1185
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,770
- That's nice.
- You can give two minutes...

1186
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,870
- to those with less confidence.
- Those who aren't confident.

1187
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,600
Then, we'll move...

1188
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,510
- and do the next mission.
- Okay, let's go!

1189
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,540
Okay!

1190
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,540
- Look.
- What is this?

1191
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,680
Hey, what is this?

1192
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,380
- Hey, it's food.
- What is this?

1193
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,050
- Gosh, look at this.
- It's food.

1194
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,110
- It's an interesting game.
- Hey, Shindong.

1195
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,150
It's Shindong time now.

1196
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,180
You're right.

1197
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,020
(Groaning)

1198
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,620
Gi Ru, you look cute.

1199
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,920
Mister, be careful.

1200
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,220
- Why, you little...
- I told you to be careful.

1201
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,260
Come on.

1202
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,820
All right. That was great.

1203
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,360
You are...

1204
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,790
What am I saying?
Even when you've gotten older,

1205
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,360
you're so full of energy.

1206
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,230
- That's because they pay me.
- What?

1207
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,300
That's because they pay me.

1208
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,100
By the way, Mr. Cotton Slacks,

1209
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,270
you changed into jeans.

1210
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,670
- Mr. Jeans.
- What...

1211
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,470
- Which pants will you wear next?
- Who are you calling "Mister?"

1212
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,570
He's 16 years old.

1213
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,610
He's our youngest.

1214
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,010
- I'm...
- Don't talk about...

1215
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,810
- sixteen years old.
- our youngest like that.

1216
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,510
My pants were a bit...

1217
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:32,680
In case they made
the viewers uncomfortable,

1218
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,820
- I changed into a new pair.
- What a pro.

1219
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,850
- He's a good kid.
- I know.

1220
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,320
By the way, Seok Jin,

1221
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,820
why are you shaking
your legs so much?

1222
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,120
It's because he's nervous.

1223
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,130
- Who?
- I'm just nervous.

1224
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,590
Why do you care about my leg?

1225
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,900
Are you supposed to bite
each other's heads off on this show?

1226
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,330
- Yes, that's how you get paid.
- That's right.

1227
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,400
- It's our routine.
- It's a cliche.

1228
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
- Is that how it's supposed to be?
- A cliche.

1229
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,370
When we go home,
we get carried out like this.

1230
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,200
(They go home exhausted after
growling at each other all day.)

1231
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,670
- That's how you go home.
- Oh, I...

1232
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,440
I love this kind of show.

1233
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,970
- I'm good at being ferocious.
- I mean, we just started,

1234
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,140
- and everyone is...
- That's how it is.

1235
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,180
- I'm good at biting and gnawing.
- Let me explain...

1236
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,580
the next mission.

1237
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,150
Among the games submitted to us
by foreign fans of Running Man,

1238
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,290
there is a game that would be
a good fit for our three guests.

1239
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,850
So, we've adjusted it slightly
and prepared the game...

1240
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,090
called Eat Your Fill
and Throw Mission.

1241
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,090
Eat Your Fill and Throw?

1242
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,830
- Eat Your Fill and Throw.
- Eat Your Fill and Throw?

1243
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,730
Two representatives from each team
will come up...

1244
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,060
and eat the buffet food...

1245
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,670
moving on the conveyor belt.

1246
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:25,500
Then, you have to build a tower
of plates in the order you ate them.

1247
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,570
We have to eat a lot.

1248
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,040
(Build a tower of plates
after eating the buffet food.)

1249
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,370
Then, that's too easy.

1250
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,610
- The order is important.
- You can also throw empty plates...

1251
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,810
to attack
the other team's plate tower...

1252
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,640
and try to make it collapse.

1253
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,780
You can also throw empty plates...

1254
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,050
to attack
the other team's plate tower...

1255
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,020
and try to make it collapse.

1256
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,350
- The team that gets attacked...
- We have to knock it down.

1257
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,690
can keep piling plates...

1258
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,560
- on top of the surviving plates.
- I see.

1259
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,060
- We have to bother the other team.
- We can either pile them up...

1260
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,060
or throw them.

1261
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,960
After the time is up,

1262
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,930
we will measure the height
of the plates still standing.

1263
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,260
That's how we'll determine
who wins and who loses.

1264
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,900
We'll play three rounds in total.

1265
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,170
To the winning team of this mission,

1266
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,040
we will give you a luxury frame...

1267
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,940
that will increase
the value of your drawing.

1268
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,710
If you earn it,
that will be a huge advantage.

1269
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,480
- A frame is important.
- Okay.

1270
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,110
- First, you can choose...
- Okay.

1271
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,350
- two representatives.
- Representatives?

1272
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,750
- One more person...
- Who eats well?

1273
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,480
Gi Ru, let's crush them.

1274
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,980
- Can you eat a lot?
- Should I go?

1275
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,250
- With who?
- I'll go.

1276
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,290
- You should go.
- With Ruru.

1277
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,620
- With Ruru.
- Me? Okay.

1278
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,890
- Ruru should go.
- All right.

1279
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:20,960
With my daughter-in-law.

1280
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,460
The daughter-in-law
and father-in-law.

1281
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,860
- Go, sweetie! You can do it!
- Oh, right.

1282
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,190
- Why isn't Shindong playing?
- Let's go!

1283
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,360
- Let's go!
- Come on, youngest brother.

1284
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,360
- Okay.
- They're really strong.

1285
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,200
- Gosh, Jang Hoon eats a lot.
- Our youngest...

1286
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,570
I think Jang Hoon will eat a lot.

1287
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,000
Shin Gi Ru says that I eat a lot.

1288
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,340
We threw so many plates
when we were little.

1289
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,810
But is it okay
to throw these plates?

1290
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:39,940
- Yes, you can throw them.
- Are they nice plates?

1291
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,180
- Would we use glass plates, mister?
- I know.

1292
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,210
- No, I mean, new ones...
- Well, our youngest just cares...

1293
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,920
- about the show and the viewers.
- You keep calling him "Mister."

1294
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,220
Well, that's because
he's asking unnecessary questions.

1295
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,320
- "Ask Us Anything Fortune Teller."
- I mean...

1296
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,660
That's right. Ask Us Anything."

1297
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,760
(Hoon suddenly cracks jokes.)

1298
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,430
- Good job.
- Right. That's another one.

1299
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,360
- Hey, you're that fortune teller!
- Right.

1300
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,760
- I do lots of odd jobs.
- That's right.

1301
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,630
- He has lots of part-time jobs.
- I'm called...

1302
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,670
- Chief, Fortune Teller...
- He has many jobs.

1303
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,800
- I have lots of jobs.
- "Chief and Fortune Teller."

1304
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,340
- That's right.
- Gi Ru.

1305
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,670
They don't have the upper hand
on us in terms of size.

1306
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,310
- They're not that much bigger.
- But I don't eat much.

1307
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,740
- Well, I eat a variety of foods.
- Still, enjoy it.

1308
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,870
But I don't eat much.

1309
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,080
Well, I eat a variety of foods.

1310
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,510
- Let me know if you get tired.
- Seriously.

1311
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:17,950
Really, though. Don't come on
someone else's successful show...

1312
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,620
- and spew that nonsense.
- He's been saying...

1313
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,350
- You don't eat much?
- Hey, mister.

1314
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,150
- She says she doesn't...
- Hey, so...

1315
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,350
Let me just say this.

1316
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,420
She said she didn't like clams
that much.

1317
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,720
- But then...
- I can eat the clams, then.

1318
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,860
No, she said she didn't like clams,

1319
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,160
and she said she'd only eat a bit.

1320
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,860
Then, she ate this many clams.

1321
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,060
Why would you say that, Jang Hoon?

1322
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,100
She ate all the clams...

1323
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,900
- in front of the sandy beach.
- My goodness.

1324
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,840
- Look here. Why would you...
- Why are you doing this?

1325
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,570
Why would you bring up
my weakness like that?

1326
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,980
(The scene of the clam massacre
that Jang Hoon witnessed)

1327
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,210
- What if she liked them for real?
- I'll eat them, okay?

1328
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,950
- She eats clams until she's full.
- Seriously, though.

1329
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,250
- Well, so,
- Until I'm full?

1330
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,450
- what if she actually liked them?
- Hyung In.

1331
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,650
- I think you should sit here.
- Why are you being so...

1332
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,750
I think he wants to talk to you.

1333
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,820
- She didn't like them,
- Hey, Hyung In.

1334
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,950
- but she ate this many clams.
- Hey.

1335
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,020
- Hey, tall guy.
- Just talk to me.

1336
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,160
Why do you keep talking...

1337
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,220
- as you look over here?
- He's talking to Hyung In.

1338
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,190
Why are you talking to them?

1339
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,390
- Always.
- Who are you talking to?

1340
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,860
- Always.
- He's just talking.

1341
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,560
(Tripping)

1342
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,700
Talk to us.

1343
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,500
- The viewers come first.
- What's wrong with him?

1344
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,730
- Hey, what are you...
- Why would you talk to...

1345
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,800
- the viewers?
- What about us?

1346
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,970
The viewers come first.

1347
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:14,970
- But why are you doing this?
- Always.

1348
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,410
- That's enough.
- My gosh, seriously?

1349
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,970
- Okay, that's enough. Come on.
- Talking to those people...

1350
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,080
- won't even get any screen time.
- He keeps facing the front.

1351
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,440
- Why are you talking to the front?
- You didn't even talk to us.

1352
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,480
(As Jang Hoon speaks out
about his beliefs)

1353
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,710
- Okay!
- All right. Ready.

1354
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,780
(The game begins.)

1355
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,920
- Here it comes.
- What is it?

1356
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,850
(The time limit
of 5 minutes begins.)

1357
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:30,950
- Enjoy it.
- Hey.

1358
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,020
This is...

1359
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,190
What is that?

1360
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,690
- What is it?
- What is that?

1361
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,960
- It's galbi.
- One at a time.

1362
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,390
Do I just have to
stack it like this?

1363
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,400
You can't flip it.

1364
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,600
(They must pile the plates in order
without flipping them upside down.)

1365
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,260
Gi Ru, don't eat the camera.

1366
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,840
- What is it?
- Jjajangmyeon.

1367
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,700
- The food just keeps on coming.
- Jjajangmyeon sounds good.

1368
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,470
We have to eat a lot.

1369
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,180
Gi Ru, pick that up.

1370
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,840
Oh, I should eat too.

1371
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,840
(Macaron)

1372
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,610
(Shin Gi Ru empties three plates
in a flash.)

1373
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,710
What is this?

1374
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,220
- Do we win if we eat a lot or what?
- They can eat together.

1375
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,350
No, the team that piles up
more plates,

1376
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,490
- but they can knock our tower over.
- I see.

1377
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,890
- Here. Yes.
- Is that a dumpling?

1378
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,920
- Let's see. Me?
- Eat it, you.

1379
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,190
(The father and son duo)

1380
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,230
Hold on a second.

1381
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:13,460
My son said, "Eat it, you."

1382
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,400
Act out like that again,
and you'll get slapped.

1383
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,430
Those aren't small portions.
Is that a dumpling?

1384
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,340
- That's japchae.
- It's not what I thought.

1385
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,270
(Whining about it being too big)

1386
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,910
Here we go. That's japchae.

1387
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,840
(He made his dad
eat the big dumpling...)

1388
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,950
(and is enjoying
the japchae he loves.)

1389
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,920
Our baby brother
only eats what he likes.

1390
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,480
- Exactly.
- You're right.

1391
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,650
Do you have any salt?

1392
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,860
What's that?

1393
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,860
It's a piece of meat,
but I'd like some salt.

1394
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,560
He wants salt.

1395
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,790
(To the son complaining
about his food,)

1396
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,060
(the dad says to chew properly.)

1397
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,730
Avoid eating things
that are difficult to eat.

1398
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,230
You need to eat faster.

1399
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,700
(The father and son
take their time.)

1400
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,430
- Hurry.
- They just served a soup.

1401
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,800
- Eat things like this.
- The plates differ in size.

1402
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:57,710
- Is it the height or the number?
- The height.

1403
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,740
- It's the height.
- You need to stack it high.

1404
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:00,840
That looks tasty.

1405
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,580
- Do we need to drink all the broth?
- Yes.

1406
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,610
But it's spicy.

1407
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,350
- You need to stack those well.
- Gi Ru.

1408
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,820
The plates and bowls
aren't the same kind.

1409
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,690
Hurry. Eat faster.

1410
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,890
- It's the height.
- You need to stack it high.

1411
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,190
You need to stack
as many plates as possible.

1412
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,490
So go with plates and bowls
that are bigger.

1413
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,060
- Do we need to drink all the broth?
- They need to start...

1414
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,130
- with bigger bowls on the bottom.
- It's spicy.

1415
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,400
You shouldn't have that, Jae Seok.

1416
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,700
Forget the dumpling.

1417
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,000
Don't have the dumpling.

1418
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,530
Stack a flat plate.
That's it, Gi Ru. No.

1419
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,900
- No, not at the bottom.
- Make sure they're in order.

1420
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,500
- Jae Seok, you're next.
- Stack a taller one.

1421
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,540
- Jae Seok, stack one on top.
- That's right.

1422
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,540
It's getting taller.

1423
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,510
They'll soon be throwing
their bowls.

1424
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,210
- Nice. That's a good one.
- Good.

1425
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,710
- Look at them.
- Looking good, Gi Ru.

1426
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,710
- Gi Ru!
- Okay.

1427
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,450
My darling, you've got this.

1428
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,610
Darling!

1429
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,280
That's the bowl you should go for.

1430
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,650
(She had 7
while Jae Seok only had 2.)

1431
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,050
Have the time of your life.

1432
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,690
(Because of Gi Ru,)

1433
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,520
(the Kim Family has fallen behind.)

1434
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,630
(Jang Hoon, throw!)

1435
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,730
They'll now start throwing
their plates.

1436
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,300
Can we start throwing?

1437
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:55,960
- Sure.
- Can we throw these?

1438
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:57,930
- Gi Ru, get out of the way.
- They ate a lot.

1439
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:59,130
- Gi Ru, move.
- Can we start throwing?

1440
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,240
Are you kidding me?

1441
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,500
- Nice.
- What is this?

1442
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,540
- She's good.
- Good job.

1443
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,270
- Stand behind the line.
- Move.

1444
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,310
(The legendary Seo Jang Hoon
gets into position again.)

1445
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,510
He used to be a basketball player.

1446
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,910
He's a basketball player.

1447
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:10,910
Right.

1448
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,550
(He missed.)

1449
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,820
- Okay.
- Good.

1450
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,020
(He immediately gets ready
to throw another one.)

1451
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,160
Don't stack that just yet.
Wait for it.

1452
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,490
(What about this time?)

1453
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,090
Don't stack that just yet.
Wait for it.

1454
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,830
(He misses again.)

1455
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,600
What's wrong with you?

1456
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,470
- Didn't he play basketball?
- Didn't he play basketball?

1457
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:32,770
(He wasted plates for no reason.)

1458
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,770
(Swoosh)

1459
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,610
(Jong Kook misses too.)

1460
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,640
If only we could stack this on top.

1461
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,310
You need to stack more!

1462
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,580
- That was close.
- We already lost.

1463
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,910
(There's only 1 minute left.)

1464
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:46,980
You have one minute left.

1465
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,250
Eat faster and throw the plates.

1466
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:51,590
We won. There's no way we can lose.

1467
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,190
We'll win unless they manage
to knock our tower down.

1468
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,990
Jae Seok, you can stack more.

1469
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,290
(They are far ahead in the lead.)

1470
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,690
This is tougher than it looks.

1471
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,330
Baby brother, throw it
like you would a basketball.

1472
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,370
Baby brother, throw it
like you would a basketball.

1473
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,700
(Jang Hoon tries again.)

1474
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,840
He's throwing one!

1475
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:10,710
He's lost his basketball touch.

1476
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:12,670
Just throw it.

1477
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,840
(Throwing it in a different way!)

1478
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,810
(Well?)

1479
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,080
He's lost his basketball touch.

1480
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,150
(Bullseye)

1481
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,420
(The tower comes tumbling down.)

1482
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,720
(Nice shot!)

1483
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,690
That's it.

1484
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,560
Did you see that? Did you see it?

1485
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,800
You're adorable.

1486
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,330
(The baby brother is getting love
he hasn't felt in a long time.)

1487
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,430
Come on. Keep eating.

1488
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,070
(The Yu Family quickly stacks more.)

1489
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,410
- He played basketball.
- He's a basketball player for sure.

1490
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:46,510
We're still in the lead.

1491
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,640
- You have 30 seconds left.
- Nicely done.

1492
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,550
Good job, baby brother.

1493
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:53,350
- Mr. Jeans played basketball.
- Ours is still higher.

1494
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:55,150
- Ours is still higher.
- Ours is way higher.

1495
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:57,290
Have the soup and stack those bowls.

1496
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,620
- Twenty seconds.
- Jang Hoon, you don't have it.

1497
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,090
You have 20 seconds left.

1498
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:01,160
Throw it.

1499
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,520
This is easy to knock down.

1500
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,890
- Careful. That might topple down.
- It's wobbly.

1501
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,590
- He won't hit it twice.
- Ours is still higher.

1502
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,800
He retired as a basketball player
decades ago.

1503
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,570
- My youngest, go for it.
- Ten seconds remain.

1504
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,600
- Ten seconds. Ten, nine...
- Go for it.

1505
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,570
- My youngest, go for it.
- Ten seconds remain.

1506
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,970
- Ten seconds. Ten...
- Go for it.

1507
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,910
- Do better, will you?
- Eight, seven...

1508
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,440
- Do better, will you?
- Eight...

1509
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,610
- Do better, will you?
- Eight, seven,

1510
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,280
- six...
- It's a miss. Keep eating.

1511
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,850
- Have a soup.
- He's not even aiming.

1512
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,490
- He's lost his touch. Keep eating!
- Five, four...

1513
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:34,220
- Six, five, four...
- He's lost his touch. Keep eating!

1514
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,820
(Thud!)

1515
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,830
Oh, no!

1516
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,790
(Is it about to topple over?)

1517
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:41,030
Three, two...

1518
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,100
(Some are still left!)

1519
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,530
- Nice.
- Okay!

1520
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,940
(Jae Seok and Gi Ru win.)

1521
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,570
There's no need to attack.
Just keep eating.

1522
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,470
- Yes, let's eat.
- You just have to keep eating.

1523
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,910
(Jong Kook and Jang Hoon lose.)

1524
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:55,310
You couldn't even do that?

1525
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,380
- You did great.
- Seriously.

1526
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,650
It was fun.

1527
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,050
- Why couldn't you hit it?
- That's not it.

1528
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:04,950
- They couldn't hit our tower.
- How were they so bad at this?

1529
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,820
- Why couldn't you hit it?
- They didn't eat much either.

1530
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,020
How is this so hard?

1531
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,360
Are you sure Jang Hoon
played basketball for years?

1532
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,730
The height difference is 10cm.

1533
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,960
We won by a landslide.

1534
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,970
- Is that all you ate?
- You just had to toss this.

1535
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,800
- Even I'd be able to hit it.
- He retired ages ago.

1536
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,040
Eat the food in the black bowls.

1537
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,540
The black bowls are easier to throw.

1538
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,070
Really? Are they easier to throw?

1539
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,010
(Round 2: Seok Sam, Ye Eun
versus Ji Hyo, Shindong)

1540
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,140
I see a macaron.

1541
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,910
- Shindong...
- I bet he can eat a lot.

1542
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,420
He's good at physical activities.

1543
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:34,450
- I think he'll be good at this.
- I think so too.

1544
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,150
- I'm suddenly hungry.
- Do you have good aim?

1545
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,720
Get ready.

1546
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,090
(Their 5 minutes begin.)

1547
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,160
(Shindong immediately
picks up cold buckwheat noodles.)

1548
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,490
That's it. Looking good, Shindong.

1549
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:46,300
- Nice.
- That's it, Shindong.

1550
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:50,100
That's it. Looking good, Shindong.

1551
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,470
(He clears a bowl in 3 seconds.)

1552
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,770
Stack them in one corner
to make it harder for them.

1553
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,640
- That's it. Keep it up.
- You've got this.

1554
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:00,110
- Just keep eating.
- Since they could be pushed back.

1555
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,210
Keep eating.

1556
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,610
(Ji Hyo eats a fried tofu rice ball
that's the size of her face.)

1557
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,710
- She's small but...
- Look at her eat.

1558
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,480
- Looking good.
- Good job.

1559
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,850
Nicely done, Shindong.

1560
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,150
(Looking cool)

1561
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,290
- The Baebullians...
- "Baebully Hills."

1562
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,790
Shindong's smaller,
but he's still eating a lot.

1563
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,990
He must've been born with the gene.

1564
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,330
(Toppling over)

1565
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,390
Okay.

1566
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:22,760
(He knocks down
the tower he stacked.)

1567
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,630
You can stack them again.

1568
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,070
- You can't.
- That's not allowed.

1569
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,440
No way. You can't use
what's on the ground.

1570
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,000
Can't you throw
what's on the ground?

1571
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,570
That's not allowed!

1572
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,140
- Can't we throw them?
- So stack them carefully.

1573
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,240
Mister, come on.

1574
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,280
What's this?

1575
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,740
(Meanwhile, Chungju Ji and Jee)

1576
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,350
If you can't eat much,
just think about throwing the plates.

1577
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,550
- Don't stress out over it.
- She's right.

1578
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,150
Gosh, this chilled cucumber soup!

1579
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,420
- Isn't it tasty?
- It's tasty.

1580
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,290
(Udon)

1581
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,260
Ye Eun, don't savor the food
and stack the plates.

1582
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,830
- That's good.
- Stack them in order.

1583
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,460
Stack them in order.

1584
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,430
Go with bowl, plate,
bowl, and plate.

1585
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,900
(They're advised to alternate
between bowls and plates.)

1586
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,000
Stack them in order.

1587
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,600
Looking good.

1588
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:02,670
Stack them in order.

1589
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,340
Looking good.

1590
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,810
Go with a bowl. There you go.

1591
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:07,840
You're doing great.

1592
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,910
- Take that one. The soup bowl.
- Eat that.

1593
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,280
Keep eating.

1594
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,050
Have a soup.

1595
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,580
(Slip)

1596
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:16,650
(Seok Sam lost hold
of his pickled radish.)

1597
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,350
Shouldn't he eat what he dropped?

1598
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,460
- You should eat what you dropped.
- Eat what you dropped!

1599
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,720
- That shouldn't count.
- Come on!

1600
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,190
- You should eat it.
- What's wrong?

1601
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,990
- That shouldn't count.
- Lose that plate.

1602
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:26,230
- Lose that plate.
- Take that off.

1603
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,700
- You're a Baebullian.
- That's right.

1604
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,330
You should live up to the name
and eat more.

1605
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,970
- Baebullians.
- "Baebully Hills."

1606
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,400
- Stack them well.
- Make sure the bottom is secure.

1607
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,170
Ye Eun, don't savor the food
and stack more plates.

1608
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,170
(Inhaling the food
without hesitating)

1609
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,640
(Ji Ye Eun,
the Shin Gi Ru of Running Man)

1610
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,810
After Ye Eun is done,
stack the bowl,

1611
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,210
and then Seok Jin's plate.

1612
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:46,980
Gosh, that's sour.

1613
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:48,950
Hurry up and stack more plates!

1614
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,320
Shindong, throw one right about now.

1615
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,720
(Attacking the fish cake ball
without taking a break)

1616
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,760
Mr. Jeans, throw better yourself.

1617
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,460
(While Ye Eun focuses on defense,)

1618
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,630
(Seok Sam plays offense.)

1619
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,430
- Move out of the way.
- He stepped on the line.

1620
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,760
- He stepped on the line.
- You stepped on the line.

1621
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,070
- You stepped on the line.
- Okay.

1622
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,540
- Throw it.
- Throw it.

1623
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,970
- Aim for the center.
- Throw it hard.

1624
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:09,400
- He's terrible.
- Put more muscle into it!

1625
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,840
You should've let it soar.

1626
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:12,970
- By the way...
- Throw one.

1627
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,310
The food is delicious.

1628
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,810
Throw one already.

1629
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:18,680
(A piece of rolled omelet)

1630
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,950
- What the heck?
- No, not like that.

1631
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,980
- Are you kidding me?
- What's wrong?

1632
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,190
Are you kidding me?

1633
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,220
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

1634
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,290
Who put mustard
in the rolled omelet?

1635
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,160
(He chose the mustard bomb
hidden among the food.)

1636
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,030
- Watch it.
- You stepped on the line.

1637
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,260
- Seriously?
- Come on!

1638
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,030
- Seriously?
- Come on!

1639
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:38,630
Nice!

1640
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,770
(The tower toppled over
even though he hit the stand.)

1641
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,540
(Ye Eun eats while Seok Sam throws.)

1642
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,710
(Their strategy worked.)

1643
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:46,240
You shouldn't stack them like that.

1644
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,910
- Okay, we won.
- Nice.

1645
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,450
Ji Hyo!

1646
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,050
(She wasted three plates
trying to get revenge.)

1647
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,320
- Stop it!
- Look at her.

1648
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:55,680
We've won. It's done.

1649
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,990
Stop it!

1650
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,690
- How are you so bad at this?
- Aim at that.

1651
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,120
- Try to hit the stand.
- That won't work.

1652
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,790
- Jang Hoon, come on.
- Mr. Jeans, stay out of it.

1653
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:04,060
- Stay out of it.
- What's your problem?

1654
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,260
I'm sorry to say this,

1655
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,130
but I'm the one
who has hit the most so far.

1656
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:08,660
- That's true.
- Yes!

1657
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,430
But I'm the one
who has hit the most so far.

1658
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,130
(Ji Hyo managed
to hit the stand as well.)

1659
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,100
- No!
- Yes!

1660
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,200
That's it!

1661
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,810
- Just aim for the stand.
- We'll win anyway.

1662
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,280
We've already won.

1663
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,010
Stack it.

1664
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,880
(Food Fighter stacks
another empty plate right away.)

1665
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,350
You startled me.

1666
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:27,880
- You have 30 seconds left.
- Finish the food first.

1667
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,590
- All right.
- You need to keep throwing now.

1668
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:32,390
Throw. It's time to throw.

1669
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:33,960
- Hang in there.
- Throw one.

1670
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,930
Shindong, aim well.

1671
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:41,130
- Okay!
- Throw another one.

1672
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:45,900
- You have 20 seconds left.
- Keep throwing!

1673
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,940
Focus, darn it!

1674
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,540
- Yes!
- That's it!

1675
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,910
(Right before the game ended)

1676
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:52,740
(Food Fighter's tower of plates
came crashing down.)

1677
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,240
- Eat more. Stack more.
- Hang in there.

1678
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,580
- Eat more.
- Eat more!

1679
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,780
- Nice!
- Eat faster!

1680
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,680
- Ten, nine...
- Find a tall one.

1681
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:01,080
- Eight.
- There aren't any.

1682
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,080
- Seven.
- We've got this.

1683
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,120
Stack it!

1684
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,250
- Five.
- Put it down!

1685
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,950
- Four. Three.
- A tall one!

1686
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,120
- Two.
- Isn't there a tall one?

1687
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,320
Grab anything.

1688
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,890
- Okay. That's it.
- You got it!

1689
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:12,360
- Oh, nice.
- You did it.

1690
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,900
- Darn it.
- When did they stack those?

1691
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,100
- I know, right?
- We did it.

1692
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,830
- Gosh, that was great.
- Ji Ye Eun...

1693
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,570
(The whistle)

1694
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:21,570
- put it down after the whistle.
- There weren't any tall ones.

1695
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:22,740
Please take the last one out.

1696
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,910
- Ji Ye Eun put it down...
- I think...

1697
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,040
after the whistle.

1698
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,780
You have great eyesight.
You see everything, don't you?

1699
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,310
You can't play basketball
with bad eyesight.

1700
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,410
- Oh, that's right.
- Mister.

1701
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:30,610
- You're totally like a chameleon...
- Mister.

1702
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,850
- Hey, you can't come across!
- Mister, are you the referee?

1703
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:34,480
Are you the referee or something?

1704
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,150
- Are you the referee?
- You can't come across this line.

1705
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,890
Are you the referee or something?

1706
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,120
- Mister.
- Of course.

1707
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,920
- You can't come across.
- Don't treat our kid like that.

1708
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,430
They're all pretty similar, right?

1709
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,360
They're too thin.

1710
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,270
Sweetie, are you taking a moment
to eat lunch?

1711
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,970
- No.
- Are you eating lunch?

1712
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,810
- Excuse me, Gi Ru.
- Don't eat that.

1713
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:58,940
- What are you doing right now?
- I mean...

1714
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,040
- Why are you eating dessert?
- I was wondering what was going on.

1715
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:04,350
I'm sorry, but are you on vacation?

1716
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:05,650
(Embarrassed)

1717
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,780
Do you think we're at a hotel buffet
right now?

1718
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,350
Hey, Locust.
The two bucktoothed guys should go.

1719
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,520
- It was this one.
- This.

1720
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,790
- This or this.
- Don't go for these.

1721
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:13,890
- Don't go for those?
- No.

1722
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:17,060
Daniel, eat the ones
in the soup bowls.

1723
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,730
(The final round starts.)

1724
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,630
- Just eat this one first.
- This?

1725
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:21,630
Eat.

1726
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:25,430
(Haha's strategy: build a tall tower
out of soup bowls)

1727
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,070
- All right. Good.
- Nice.

1728
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,240
- Good. That's better.
- Should I try throwing it once?

1729
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,540
Okay!

1730
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,040
(They succeed right away.)

1731
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:35,340
(Daniel succeeded in one try!)

1732
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,210
- Good job!
- Hey, Daniel!

1733
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,580
- That was awesome.
- So awesome.

1734
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:39,880
(Ssaebssaeb's counterattack!)

1735
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,150
- That's okay.
- What was that?

1736
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,220
- It's okay.
- Hey.

1737
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,250
- Ssaebssaeb went over the line.
- He stepped over the line.

1738
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,490
He threw it with his foot here.

1739
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,690
- He stepped over it!
- It's fine.

1740
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,990
We can do a bench cleaner.

1741
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:51,590
- What's a bench cleaner?
- A bench cleaner?

1742
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,500
(A bench cleaner?)

1743
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,400
- Bench cleaning?
- Are you wiping them clean?

1744
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,970
- I don't know. Anyway...
- It's bench clearing.

1745
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:58,800
- Anyway, do the bench thing.
- What was that?

1746
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,640
You have 20 seconds left.

1747
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,640
(Now,
they only have 20 seconds left!)

1748
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,640
- Haha, throw it.
- Good. Ours is taller.

1749
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,240
- Go for it.
- Throw it.

1750
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,340
You have ten seconds left.

1751
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:09,580
- No, Niel should throw.
- Ten.

1752
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,350
- Hit the table!
- Niel, you should throw.

1753
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,750
- Eight.
- The table!

1754
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,950
- We should throw too.
- Seven. Six. Five.

1755
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:16,620
- Right now! Hit it!
- Just one more.

1756
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,690
- Three.
- Eat more!

1757
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,790
(Haha throws his last plate.)

1758
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,060
- Okay! That's good!
- Eat more!

1759
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,960
- No, don't do that. That's it.
- Two...

1760
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,960
- One.
- Okay.

1761
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,430
- That's it.
- Hey, that was awesome.

1762
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:28,260
- I told you to hit the table.
- That was awesome.

1763
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,000
- That was so good.
- Good job.

1764
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,430
- You have to hit the table.
- Gosh, we were so close.

1765
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:32,870
- It only took one blow.
- Right.

1766
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,340
- My goodness.
- Hitting the table was a good idea.

1767
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:38,040
Daniel and Haha, our warriors...

1768
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,040
- You guys did great.
- Warriors.

1769
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,640
- We played three rounds.
- That was so close.

1770
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,980
It's lunchtime after this,
so we'll give it to you then.

1771
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,350
- Lunch...
- Look over there.

1772
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,720
Excuse me.
We're having lunch later on.

1773
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,450
- Oh, isn't this our lunch?
- No.

1774
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:52,950
Is there a separate lunch? Sorry.

1775
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,060
(Taking the repeat offender away
immediately)

1776
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,920
- Then, who will eat all that food?
- Nice.

1777
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,360
- Don't worry about it.
- My goodness.

1778
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,230
- Gosh, that was spicy.
- Jae Seok's team,

1779
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,360
your total for the 3 rounds
was 23cm.

1780
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,530
- My goodness.
- That's not a lot.

1781
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,670
- Jong Kook's team had 41cm.
- Yes!

1782
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,070
- We lost big time.
- They didn't even come close!

1783
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:11,340
(Chewing furiously)

1784
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,540
My gosh.

1785
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,640
- They were so critical about me,
- At the end...

1786
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,940
because I couldn't knock over
the pile of plates.

1787
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,550
They couldn't hit anything, though.

1788
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,750
Who are you talking to?

1789
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,950
- The viewers!
- Why are you talking to the front?

1790
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,950
- The frame is so cool.
- This time,

1791
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:25,650
I was talking to Shindong.

1792
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,320
- Oh, were you talking to me?
- Gosh, it's so cool.

1793
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:31,290
We said the judging would be based
on special standards.

1794
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:33,960
- This will help a lot.
- Is that right? Okay!

1795
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,970
Only one person from the family
can take this.

1796
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,470
- You can choose who it will be.
- Is that right?

1797
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:39,900
- Right now?
- Yes.

1798
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,570
First, the dad,

1799
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,970
- as the pillar of the family,
- Yes?

1800
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,370
should survive...

1801
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:45,740
- What? Then...
- so that later on...

1802
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,510
- Dad is getting greedy.
- They're fighting.

1803
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,450
If we give it to someone
who can't draw,

1804
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,350
it'll only lower the average.
It's better to boost our odds.

1805
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,220
- No, but those who can't draw...
- Excuse me.

1806
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,150
- How much longer must we watch?
- Putting it in the frame will be...

1807
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:59,250
- You're just taking a mere thing!
- I know!

1808
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,190
My daughter-in-law is
done digesting!

1809
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,490
She might eat the plate
at this rate!

1810
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:04,960
My daughter-in-law is
done digesting now!

1811
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,600
Don't you guys usually let
the guest have the benefit?

1812
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,260
- No, we don't do that.
- You don't?

1813
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,430
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1814
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,370
- Okay, good. Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1815
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,600
- Okay!
- Okay, you take it.

1816
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,970
- It's fine.
- Then, Haha...

1817
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:18,040
will take the frame.

1818
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,440
- Only Haha's picture will be...
- Hey, today...

1819
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,780
- put in the frame when it's done.
- We should do...

1820
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:23,850
This is so delicious.

1821
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,050
Goodness, I'm full.

1822
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,280
What could it be?

1823
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,650
- Okay, what is this now? Curling?
- What is it?

1824
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:29,720
- Curling!
- What is this?

1825
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,450
- It's curling.
- Gosh, they put something...

1826
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:33,350
- on the floor.
- Curling was fun last time.

1827
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,190
I don't think Jang Hoon will fit.

1828
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,360
Curling.

1829
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,160
- Curling is fun.
- It's curling.

1830
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,460
- It sounds fun.
- Curling is fun.

1831
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,430
Gosh,
I'm good at physical activities.

1832
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,600
- Curling is fun.
- Curling.

1833
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,630
Where did Jang Hoon go?

1834
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:46,770
- Jang...
- Where is our youngest?

1835
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:47,770
(By the way, the Kim family's
youngest is nowhere to be seen.)

1836
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,700
Where did our youngest go?
Hey, have you seen him?

1837
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,570
The youngest ran away from home.

1838
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,470
- The youngest...
- Oh, your youngest...

1839
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,940
He's nowhere to be seen.

1840
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,640
- Hey, Dad.
- Right when he arrives...

1841
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,350
Should we pretend to be playing?

1842
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,880
- A few of us should go.
- Yes, go.

1843
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,850
- Let's cheer.
- That sounds like fun.

1844
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:05,150
- I bet he never experienced this.
- That sounds fun.

1845
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:07,320
- A few of us should go.
- It sounds like fun.

1846
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,260
- Go over there.
- The same team should push.

1847
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,460
(While using the restroom, the giant
becomes the pranksters' target .)

1848
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,490
- Cheer loudly when he comes in.
- The same team should push.

1849
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,500
- Cheer.
- Let's go!

1850
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,460
All right. Let's go.

1851
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:17,970
- Here we go.
- Let's go!

1852
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:19,770
- Let's go!
- I'll be in here.

1853
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:21,370
- Be careful. Don't fall over.
- I'll go like this.

1854
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,970
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1855
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,270
Let's do this!

1856
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,580
Okay, go! Hey.

1857
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:28,940
- Let's go!
- Hey!

1858
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,550
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Okay!

1859
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:31,710
- Block him.
- Let's go!

1860
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:32,950
(How will he react
to this absurd situation?)

1861
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,250
- Let's go!
- Come on!

1862
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,420
- Let's go!
- We can do it!

1863
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,220
- That's it! Down the middle!
- Yes!

1864
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,560
(After relieving himself
and feeling refreshed,)

1865
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,960
(the shoot has already begun.)

1866
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,860
- So close!
- Yes!

1867
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,630
(Feeling awkward)

1868
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,760
(Everyone is having a blast
without Jang Hoon.)

1869
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,970
Is it okay if we fall over?

1870
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:53,000
- Is it okay if we fall over?
- Are you okay?

1871
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,840
- He's totally fine.
- What is this?

1872
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,600
Where have you been?

1873
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,370
- Where did you go?
- Hey, youngest guy!

1874
00:58:58,370 --> 00:58:59,710
- Why were you so late?
- I mean...

1875
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:00,740
We're in the middle of the shoot.

1876
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:03,710
You can't come in when we're
shooting. Leave if you want to,

1877
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,510
or come in early
if you're going to join us.

1878
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,450
- We can start over now.
- Apologize!

1879
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:10,450
- Get up. Apologize properly, punk!
- Hang on.

1880
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:13,050
- What is going on? I will.
- Apologize, punk!

1881
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,020
- Apologize.
- Hey, why are you so darn rude?

1882
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,490
He hit him.

1883
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,090
- That's it. Good job.
- Are you crazy?

1884
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,800
Seriously.

1885
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,800
That's it. Yes, that's how
an older brother should act.

1886
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,500
- I'm really sorry.
- Hey.

1887
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,570
Why would you pretend to hit him
just to swear at him for real?

1888
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,310
- Hey, what is this?
- You just wanted to swear.

1889
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,140
- What are you doing?
- He just wanted to...

1890
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:37,980
You're really happy to see me
after a long time apart, aren't you?

1891
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:40,720
It's good to see you.

1892
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:42,650
Gosh, that's funny.

1893
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:45,890
With colors, the most important part
of the drawing, on the line,

1894
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:46,960
- That's right.
- we'll start...

1895
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,390
- the Colorful Curling mission.
- Okay.

1896
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,130
When drawing the picture that will
decide who wins or loses in the end,

1897
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,960
the basic colors you will be given
are black and light peach.

1898
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,460
Just those two.

1899
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,970
This is how you can win
extra colors.

1900
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,540
You will get in the rubber tubs
and play human curling.

1901
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:04,740
You will gain
the number of colors...

1902
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:07,040
written on the spot...

1903
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,980
where your tub ends up.

1904
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,550
However, if you stop in the sections
where it says silver,

1905
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,050
you can only get silver
as your extra color.

1906
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,320
- Also,
- You can express a lot with silver.

1907
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,150
if you go completely off
the curling board,

1908
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:22,020
you may only draw with black
and light peach,

1909
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,060
the basic colors
you will be provided with.

1910
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,160
Light peach?

1911
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,060
Anyway,
this will be an individual match.

1912
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,000
- Individually.
- Okay, individual.

1913
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,230
Please choose the 3 people
who will play in the 1st round,

1914
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,270
and they can come to the front.

1915
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:35,240
- Nice. We have a good balance.
- Okay.

1916
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,370
This is an individual match.
You live your life on your own.

1917
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,870
- But how do we ride in these?
- Be careful.

1918
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:40,980
(Sliding in for a test run)

1919
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,840
Be careful. Oh, my.

1920
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,480
- Why?
- One second. My gosh.

1921
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,510
I was lifted up like this.

1922
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,750
- Okay.
- Hey, that's no joke.

1923
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,850
- You have to go right in.
- Hey, that's good.

1924
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:50,850
- My goodness.
- There you go.

1925
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:52,050
Sweetie, let's go!

1926
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,050
Let's go!

1927
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,960
- Let's go, Gi Ru!
- How much longer are we doing this?

1928
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,790
I think he's too into this.

1929
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,590
It's creepy.

1930
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,200
She said it was creepy.

1931
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:03,560
Gi Ru says Seok Jin is creepy.

1932
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,570
(The deeply immersed husband
is creepy.)

1933
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:05,630
- It's only our second meeting,
- But I think...

1934
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:06,700
- and we're married.
- I get what she means.

1935
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:08,670
Should we practice once?
Just in case...

1936
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:09,970
- Let's try it.
- Okay.

1937
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,470
- Sweetie, let's go!
- Gi Ru, let's go!

1938
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,740
Hang on. Point the wheels forward.

1939
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,210
That's good.

1940
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:16,780
- All right. Ready.
- Okay.

1941
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:17,950
One.

1942
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:19,210
(Taking a big breath)

1943
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:20,350
- One.
- Se Chan, sorry,

1944
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:21,450
but don't struggle too much.

1945
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:22,880
- It's making me uncomfortable.
- All right.

1946
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,450
- You're right by my ear.
- Oh, boy. Gi Ru.

1947
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:25,650
Did you just say, "Oh, boy?"

1948
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,460
- Seriously.
- My goodness.

1949
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:30,160
- We're not just saying this, Gi Ru.
- I'm already exhausted.

1950
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,060
- You invited me here. Gosh, what?
- Sweetie.

1951
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,260
Sweetie, let's go.

1952
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,360
- They're so cute together.
- Let's go. I'll pull you along.

1953
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,970
(Totally absorbed in his role)

1954
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:41,000
- One!
- No, we'll do it.

1955
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,370
- We can do it ourselves.
- Why? I could do it...

1956
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:43,470
with the power of love.

1957
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,310
- We're going to do it!
- Sorry!

1958
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:47,880
- It's the three of us!
- Why don't you know the rules?

1959
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,540
- Gosh, that man.
- I said it was fine, though.

1960
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,680
He must really like me.

1961
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,310
- Mister, stop that.
- What are you doing?

1962
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:53,510
- It's creepy.
- Let's go!

1963
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,980
She keeps saying it's creepy.

1964
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,490
She says you're creepy.

1965
01:01:58,490 --> 01:01:59,890
(After getting rid of her leech
of a husband, they begin practicing.)

1966
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:01,560
- I think she'll go really fast.
- Two.

1967
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,360
- I think she'll go super fast.
- I know.

1968
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,590
(Gi Ru stone manages to set off.)

1969
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,500
- Hey, this is too strong.
- Hey, how far am I going? What?

1970
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,630
- It's too strong.
- Too strong.

1971
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,570
- It's going to break.
- There you go.

1972
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:13,230
- It'll break.
- It's too strong.

1973
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:14,670
- Okay.
- Too strong.

1974
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:16,340
- With the acceleration,
- I got it.

1975
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,010
- she doesn't stop.
- It was too strong.

1976
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:20,240
- This was practice, right?
- If you go out like this,

1977
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,440
- You're out.
- you only get light peach.

1978
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,640
- Oh, okay.
- I got it.

1979
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,350
- Am I out? Was this practice?
- I get how to do this.

1980
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,350
Can you pull me all the way back?
Should I get up?

1981
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:27,780
- You should get up. I'll help you.
- Give us your hand.

1982
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:30,420
- Can you two do this?
- No, just pull her like this.

1983
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:31,790
Hang on.

1984
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,620
(Coming back holding...)

1985
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:34,990
(her father-in-law
and brother-in-law's hands)

1986
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:36,620
- Oh, we can lift her like this.
- So cute.

1987
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,930
- So cute!
- Let's do this.

1988
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:39,690
- So adorable.
- You look like people...

1989
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:41,100
- out on a walk with their cat.
- Gi Ru, you're so light.

1990
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:43,160
(Struggling to stop)

1991
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,730
- Turn me around.
- Turn around.

1992
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,500
- All right.
- A baby...

1993
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,870
She's practically a baby.

1994
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:49,170
Jae Seok, so...

1995
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,670
Play rock-paper-scissors
to decide who will go first.

1996
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,580
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors! Okay.

1997
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,680
Let them go first.

1998
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,750
- Am I going 1st?
- Gi Ru, you go 1st.

1999
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:01,350
- How about Gi Ru goes last?
- Right.

2000
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:02,780
- I think that would be better.
- She should go last.

2001
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,320
I think it'll be better for me
to push everyone.

2002
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:05,920
- Will you be able to do it?
- Yes.

2003
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:07,190
Okay. Good.

2004
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:08,620
- Do you want to go 1st?
- I'll go 1st.

2005
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:09,890
(Laughing)

2006
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,060
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2007
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:14,230
- Gi Ru, let's go last.
- Go first.

2008
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:16,230
- Hey, have Gi Ru go last.
- Okay.

2009
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:17,800
Jae Seok, you'll topple over...

2010
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,230
- if you lean back too much.
- Okay.

2011
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,540
- Go ahead.
- Here we go.

2012
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,140
- How about this speed?
- Okay. It's good.

2013
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:24,140
Is it good?

2014
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,170
- It's perfect.
- It's good.

2015
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:26,340
(Jae Seok Stone sets off.)

2016
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:27,740
I think this is great.

2017
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,240
- It's better to fall short.
- Move slowly.

2018
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,910
- It's better to fall short.
- I think he'll reach the target.

2019
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:32,410
- It's really great.
- It's really great.

2020
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:34,350
Jae Seok, it's great.

2021
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,750
(It'll be much more advantageous
to take the center first.)

2022
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,890
- It's the best.
- It's really great.

2023
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,760
(But he passes the center.)

2024
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,860
- Jae Seok, it's okay.
- Good.

2025
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:44,760
(Glancing over)

2026
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:45,890
Jae Seok, it's okay.

2027
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:47,060
- Okay.
- Come on!

2028
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,460
What's wrong with him?

2029
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,560
- Jae Seok, it's okay.
- Good.

2030
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,800
(He uses his feet to cheat.)

2031
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,830
What's wrong with him?

2032
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:53,400
- He cheated.
- That's...

2033
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,040
He put his feet down!

2034
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,640
What's wrong with him?

2035
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,170
- He cheated.
- That's...

2036
01:03:58,170 --> 01:03:59,670
- I didn't use my feet.
- He put his feet down!

2037
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:00,680
I didn't use my feet.

2038
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,440
Don't lie. We were watching.

2039
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,510
You used your feet.

2040
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,050
- Look at his facial expression.
- Push him.

2041
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,050
Look at his facial expression.

2042
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,250
I won't use my feet now.

2043
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:09,580
- For goodness' sake.
- All right.

2044
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:10,820
He's ridiculous.

2045
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,820
It'll be better for us.

2046
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:14,990
I won't use my feet now.

2047
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:15,990
Am I moving this way?

2048
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:17,530
- I'll send you to Jae Seok.
- You can use your feet.

2049
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:19,190
Just don't use your hands.
Don't pull another person.

2050
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:20,290
Here we go.

2051
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:23,000
(Kim Family's Choi Daniel,
Not good at anything)

2052
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,570
- Push hard.
- Push hard. No, it's too hard.

2053
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,070
(Daniel Stone sets off.)

2054
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:28,940
(Shindong succeeds in
aiming for Jae Seok.)

2055
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,540
- Jae Seok will get pushed off.
- Push him with your feet.

2056
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:31,640
It'll be a match.

2057
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:35,440
(If he hits Jae Seok, he'll be able
to push Jae Seok off.)

2058
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,040
- He pushed hard.
- Isn't the direction off?

2059
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,180
Push him with your feet.

2060
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,550
(Daniel pushes him.)

2061
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:41,620
Nice.

2062
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,720
(He succeeds in a takeout
with his long legs!)

2063
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,590
There you go!

2064
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:48,420
(Daniel sends Jae Seok off
and lands in a good spot.)

2065
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:50,360
(Shouting)

2066
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,790
(He goes far
from the curling sheet.)

2067
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:55,230
For goodness' sake.

2068
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,500
Gosh, what's wrong with him?

2069
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,730
Daniel, well done.

2070
01:04:58,730 --> 01:04:59,970
He's too light.

2071
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:01,670
- Yes!
- There you go!
- Gi Ru, push me.
- There you go.

2072
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:05,170
(Gi Ru's engine is on.)

2073
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,180
(Yu Family's Yang Se Chan,
Stone head)

2074
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,380
- Gi Ru.
- We need to push him off.

2075
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:11,150
- We need to push him off.
- Se Chan, push him off.

2076
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:13,310
- Push him off.
- Se Chan, push him off.

2077
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,720
- Gi Ru, your grip is no joke.
- Hey.

2078
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:16,880
You're so strong.

2079
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,690
Gi Ru. You're so scary, big brother.

2080
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,890
- Don't push too hard.
- "You're so scary, big brother?"

2081
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:21,160
- Start from the back.
- I'm scared, big brother.

2082
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,720
He's Gi Ru's favorite toy.

2083
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,790
Where am I going?

2084
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:24,860
Go! Push him!

2085
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:26,590
(Se Chan Stone goes toward Daniel.)

2086
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,700
- Go! Push him!
- Are you coming?

2087
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,730
- Push him off.
- Good.

2088
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,930
(The power is perfect.)

2089
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,700
(The direction is perfect.)

2090
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,200
- He's stopping. It's okay.
- Good.

2091
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:42,280
(He topples over
right in front of his target.)

2092
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,450
- That's your spot.
- That's your spot.

2093
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:46,910
- Oh, no.
- My goodness.

2094
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:48,120
- Get up.
- That's your spot.

2095
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,350
This is my spot.
I just need to get up.

2096
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:51,550
- Se Chan.
- That's what you get...

2097
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:52,550
for being greedy.

2098
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:54,890
Will you push Se Chan off
from the side?

2099
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,760
- Shall I send you straight to him?
- Yes, I'll get him.

2100
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:59,990
- Hey, let Haha push you.
- Okay.

2101
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:01,730
Then you'll hit Daniel behind you.

2102
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,830
(Seok Jin predicts
that Daniel will be affected.)

2103
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:07,300
- Let's go.
- The red zone is behind you.

2104
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,370
- Go.
- Hold on.

2105
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:09,570
- Push me from there.
- Really?

2106
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:10,640
- Push me from there.
- Will you go between them?

2107
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,840
- I'll push Se Chan that way.
- Okay.

2108
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,710
(Haha changes the angle
so that Daniel won't be affected.)

2109
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:15,980
Yes. That'll be better.

2110
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:17,140
- It'll be like pool.
- Father.

2111
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:19,210
- Here we go.
- Go ahead.

2112
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:20,410
- In the back...
- One,

2113
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:21,520
two...

2114
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:24,590
Good.

2115
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:26,520
Good. Let him push you.

2116
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,360
- Good.
- Gosh, it's too...

2117
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,120
(Scared)

2118
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,930
Good. Let him push you.

2119
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:33,330
Let him push you. There you go.

2120
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:34,530
- What?
- What?

2121
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:35,860
(When Haha pushes Se Chan,
Daniel gets pushed as well.)

2122
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:40,130
(Despite the calculation,
Haha took out his teammate.)

2123
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:43,340
The person in the back got pushed.

2124
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:44,840
- Gosh.
- Are you stupid?

2125
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:46,640
- You should've gone further.
- Nice.

2126
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:50,540
(Thanks to Haha,
Se Chan Stone is in a better spot!)

2127
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:51,750
- Nice.
- It's my turn now.

2128
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:53,050
Gi Ru!

2129
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,550
Push him off.

2130
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,850
(Yu Family's last big stone
is coming!)

2131
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:58,490
You're twice as heavy as him.

2132
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,090
Her facial expression is solemn.

2133
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,690
She's scary.

2134
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:03,890
Let's go.

2135
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:06,730
Why are you so weak?

2136
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:08,660
- Where are you sending me?
- Hold on.

2137
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:09,860
Why are you so weak?

2138
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,230
- Where are you sending me?
- Hold on.

2139
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,000
For goodness' sake.

2140
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:14,270
(Collapsing)

2141
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:15,740
- I need someone else.
- What are you doing?

2142
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:18,910
(His weak legs are overwhelmed.)

2143
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:19,940
- Gosh, Seok Jin.
- Help him.

2144
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:21,310
- Why are you so weak?
- Help him.

2145
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:22,540
- I thought...
- I mean...

2146
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,210
I thought my knees gave out.

2147
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:26,080
All right.

2148
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:27,750
- I need to go to the center.
- One...

2149
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:29,420
One, two, three.

2150
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,150
Her facial expression is solemn.

2151
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:32,950
- Gosh.
- You get pushed a lot.

2152
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:34,890
(She's aimed at Haha.)

2153
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:37,960
- There she goes.
- No.

2154
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:39,230
(Kicking)

2155
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:40,860
No!

2156
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,260
(Se Chan, who was in the back,
gets pushed.)

2157
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,730
(He goes out.)

2158
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:46,400
No!

2159
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:47,540
There we go.

2160
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Yes!

2161
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,340
(Due to action and reaction,
Se Chan Stone is out.)

2162
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,570
Se Chan got pushed out.

2163
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,180
- I can push back from here.
- Two stones.

2164
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,440
But Shindong is strong.

2165
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,380
The center? You'll get pushed back.

2166
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:58,880
You won't land on the scoreboard
if you push her.

2167
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,850
Okay. I'll go between them.

2168
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:01,980
- Between them?
- Yes.

2169
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:04,320
(It's his goal to go
between Gi Ru and Haha.)

2170
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,690
- I won't push her.
- Will you go past them?

2171
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,420
How will you go between us?

2172
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:09,160
The speed shouldn't be too high.

2173
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,320
- No, it shouldn't be.
- Right?

2174
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,690
The wheels are lined up nicely.

2175
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,330
(Even the wheels are lined up.)

2176
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,800
- There you go.
- Good.

2177
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,870
All right.

2178
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
- There you go.
- Good.

2179
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,070
All right.

2180
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:21,140
- Perfect.
- Good.

2181
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,270
- Good.
- He'll go between them.

2182
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:24,000
(He quickly goes toward his target.)

2183
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,140
(Ouch!)

2184
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:27,740
She's too strong.

2185
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:29,210
Good.

2186
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:32,580
(Gi Ru stops him easily
with her feet!)

2187
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:33,650
He'll go between them.

2188
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:36,920
(The camera dies
after Gi Ru's feet push it.)

2189
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,990
- She's too strong.
- That's right.

2190
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:40,390
- She's too strong.
- What?

2191
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:43,290
I just lifted my feet briefly.

2192
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,690
- Now,
- Haha, you're the only one.

2193
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:46,630
- the result of Round One is out.
- You're the only one inside.

2194
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:49,460
Only Haha acquired
one additional color.

2195
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,030
- Okay.
- She's too strong.

2196
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:52,870
(In Round 1, only Haha acquired
1 additional color.)

2197
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:53,970
- Okay.
- She's too strong.

2198
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:55,470
That dirty mustache.

2199
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:57,240
- Gi Ru, you're strong.
- That's right.

2200
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,340
- You're strong. Play again.
- Okay.

2201
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:59,610
- Go last.
- Okay.

2202
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:00,810
- Ye Eun, go 1st.
- Shall I go 1st?

2203
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:01,980
- Then I'll go next.
- Okay.

2204
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,510
Gi Ru is like a cheat code.

2205
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:05,610
They have Jang Hoon too.

2206
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:06,980
Why am I sweating?

2207
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,020
All right.

2208
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:09,480
Smooth.

2209
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:10,480
We'll begin.

2210
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,890
- Ji Hyo, I like your gaze.
- Here we go.

2211
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,920
(Kim Family's Song Ji Hyo,
She plays with her spirit.)

2212
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:15,920
- Stop.
- Don't go far.

2213
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:16,960
- Don't go far.
- That's good. Stop.

2214
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,530
It'll be better to stop there.

2215
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:20,260
(Yu Family's Ji Ye Eun,
Yeongdeok's snow crab)

2216
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:21,300
Push me gently.

2217
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,300
- There you go.
- Good.

2218
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:24,300
- Good.
- Nice.

2219
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,370
Well done.

2220
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,670
- Excuse me.
- Don't stop.

2221
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:28,870
Drone pilot, I'm sorry,

2222
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:32,510
but please make it fly higher.

2223
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:35,240
- A moment ago...
- That's right.

2224
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:37,180
A moment ago,

2225
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:39,180
- the drone passed this way.
- Jang Hoon.

2226
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:46,020
(Not considering the utility pole,
the drone was flown as usual.)

2227
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:48,590
- Jang Hoon, did it cut your hair?
- I mean...

2228
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:51,790
I'm sorry,
but please make it fly higher.

2229
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:53,730
- I thought it was a hair salon.
- I was so startled.

2230
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:55,200
Is Jang Hoon going next?

2231
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:56,630
Here comes Jang Hoon.

2232
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:58,400
Do you want to stay at the front?

2233
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,630
- Will that be better?
- What?

2234
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,370
It might be better
to stay at the front.

2235
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:02,700
- In front of Ye Eun.
- Yes.

2236
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:03,840
- Others will push you.
- That's right.

2237
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,670
Jang Hoon is so scary.

2238
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:06,810
- Send me toward Ye Eun.
- Push Jang Hoon hard...

2239
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:08,280
- so that he can push off everyone.
- I'm so scared.

2240
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:10,080
- That's right. Push him.
- Just push him.

2241
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:11,480
- Jang Hoon, you like Ye Eun.
- Go to the front.

2242
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:12,850
- Are you ready?
- You like me.

2243
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:14,550
- Are you ready?
- You like me.

2244
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,650
Go to the person you like.

2245
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,720
Go to the person you like.

2246
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:21,560
(The rock sets off.)

2247
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:23,160
- What's wrong with her?
- Push her.

2248
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:24,990
It's a bumper car.

2249
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:27,660
He's coming.

2250
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,160
- Gosh.
- All right. There you go.

2251
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,200
(He just needs to push her!)

2252
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,270
(Without pushing her,
he just laughs!)

2253
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:35,740
(The lack of attack
is quite intentional.)

2254
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,040
- What?
- All right.

2255
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:40,670
- What's up with him?
- What?

2256
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:42,140
He likes me.

2257
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,280
She stopped me.

2258
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,280
- What was that?
- Come on.

2259
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:45,710
- What was that?
- She...

2260
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:47,550
- She stopped me.
- Do you like her?

2261
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,650
- She stopped me.
- Do you like her?

2262
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,680
"Do you like her?"

2263
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,250
- Do you like her?
- For goodness' sake.

2264
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:54,460
- She stopped me.
- Are you guys dating or something?

2265
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:55,760
I stopped him.

2266
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,690
Jang Hoon isn't usually like that.

2267
01:10:57,690 --> 01:10:58,960
I know. What's up with him?

2268
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:00,060
- Good luck.
- Ye Eun...

2269
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,960
- He likes Ye Eun a lot.
- Good luck.

2270
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,500
- This is nice. We're doing well.
- This is nice.

2271
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,730
We're doing well.

2272
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:06,870
- I'll push you.
- Seok Jin.

2273
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:08,400
- Seok Jin, we can score.
- Yes.

2274
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,640
Send me between them.

2275
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,040
- Send me between them.
- Of course.

2276
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,340
- Trust me.
- I'll push Jang Hoon off.

2277
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,210
- You can break them off.
- Yes. As I break them off,

2278
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:15,480
I won't push Ye Eun too much.

2279
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:16,810
- Send me between them.
- Of course.

2280
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:18,050
- Trust me.
- I'll push Jang Hoon off.

2281
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:19,180
Okay.

2282
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:20,480
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2283
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,680
- All right.
- Seok Jin.

2284
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,280
- Let's see an explosion.
- That isn't the direction.

2285
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,620
Jae Seok, push him
with your full power.

2286
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:26,750
- Do it with your full power.
- Full power.

2287
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:27,920
- Full power is good.
- Let's go.

2288
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,420
Big Nose power!

2289
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:31,330
- Jang Hoon will fly off.
- Let's go, Big Nose.

2290
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,930
Big Nose power!

2291
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,730
- Jang Hoon will fly off.
- Let's go, Big Nose.

2292
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,160
- Good.
- Hey, where are you sending me?

2293
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,260
- What are you doing?
- What's this?

2294
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,430
(Hey, where are you sending me?
What are you doing?)

2295
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:39,730
- Good.
- Hey, where are you sending me?

2296
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:40,870
- What are you doing?
- What's this?

2297
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:43,200
(Crawling)

2298
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:45,110
(Jae Seok couldn't help
but toy with him.)

2299
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:46,710
- What's this?
- What?

2300
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:48,710
(The engine goes out
before the halfway point.)

2301
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:50,010
- What's wrong with him?
- What's this?

2302
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:51,610
(Flustered)

2303
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:52,810
- It's so...
- It suits him.

2304
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:54,680
My hands became weak.

2305
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,950
- I'm sorry, Seok Jin.
- I can't believe it.

2306
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,420
- I'm sorry.
- I can't believe it.

2307
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:00,020
- Play the next game well.
- This is...

2308
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:03,990
- Hey. "Play the next game well?"
- He's like a remote island.

2309
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,690
Why did I put these on?

2310
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:07,800
(Crying)

2311
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,000
Hey, Jae Seok!

2312
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,770
Why did I put these on?

2313
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,140
- Why did I put these on?
- Seok Jin, you never know.

2314
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:17,240
- Seok Jin, you never know.
- You never know.

2315
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,510
- Seok Jin, you never know.
- Don't be ridiculous.

2316
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,840
- It suits you so well.
- Okay. I can turn around, right?

2317
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,410
(He becomes a spectator in the end.)

2318
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,880
- I can do it.
- Precision is important.

2319
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:28,280
- Shindong, let's go! Father!
- All right.

2320
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,650
- I'm scared.
- Good luck.

2321
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:30,650
Father, good luck.

2322
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:32,420
(Jong Kook Stone sets off.)

2323
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,750
- I'm scared.
- Good.

2324
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,860
(Fast)

2325
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,360
(Kicking)

2326
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:41,900
- There you go.
- Good. There you go.

2327
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:45,600
(He quickly takes Ye Eun out.
But he ends up sliding off as well.)

2328
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,070
I'm sliding off.

2329
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:49,000
You slid off.

2330
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,340
(Unable to control his strength,
he went out of the curling sheet.)

2331
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:52,540
- I slid off.
- Both of them went out.

2332
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,710
(Only Ji Hyo is in the section
for 3 additional colors.)

2333
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,340
- Gi Ru.
- Whom shall I push? Jang Hoon?

2334
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,650
You should push Jang Hoon off
and get one point.

2335
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:00,750
Okay.

2336
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,550
- Stretch your legs to the left.
- Okay.

2337
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:04,420
Here we go.

2338
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:06,020
I'll need to kick the middle.

2339
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:08,090
Gosh, Gi Ru is scary.

2340
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:09,760
You can push very hard.
I'm going for Jang Hoon.

2341
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,190
Show us.

2342
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,430
- Two.
- Get ready.

2343
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:14,730
We'll push.

2344
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:16,460
- Okay. Let's go.
- Here we go.

2345
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:17,970
Heave-ho.

2346
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:20,200
(Gi Ru Stone sets off.)

2347
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,470
Let's go. Heave-ho.

2348
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:25,070
- Here she comes.
- Here she comes.

2349
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:27,410
- What?
- My goodness.

2350
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:28,940
(She's already fast,)

2351
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:32,280
(but she adds a booster
with her body.)

2352
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:34,450
- What?
- There she goes.

2353
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:38,290
(She pushes them off!)

2354
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:40,450
(Will they go out?)

2355
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,090
(They come back in!)

2356
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:45,230
(They spin and land
in the better sections!)

2357
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:47,130
- Good.
- Both of them came back in.

2358
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:49,230
- Seven.
- Seven.

2359
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:51,470
(Figuring out the score)

2360
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,670
Ji Hyo will acquire...

2361
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:56,300
- seven additional colors.
- Okay.

2362
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,540
As for Jang Hoon...

2363
01:13:58,540 --> 01:13:59,540
- One.
- One.

2364
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:00,640
He'll acquire...

2365
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,680
- one additional color.
- Okay.

2366
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:07,180
Thus, the ones who acquired
additional colors are...

2367
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:10,220
three members,
Haha, Ji Hyo, and Jang Hoon.

2368
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,550
(He's playing
regardless of the result.)

2369
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:13,450
- We did well.
- My team...

2370
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,320
- Let's make a cool drawing.
- Hold on. Let's do ssireum.

2371
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,190
- Ssireum.
- That's scary.

2372
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:19,460
- Let's do ssireum.
- Let's do something like that.

2373
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:20,690
The timing was perfect.

2374
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:23,260
(Hitting)

2375
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:26,070
(A collision)

2376
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,140
Stop playing around!

2377
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,310
- I'm sorry.
- Why do you keep playing around?

2378
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:33,110
Jae Seok, the utility pole
nearly fell.

2379
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:35,180
- I'm sorry.
- Can I get...

2380
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:38,150
Can I get workers' compensation?

2381
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,380
- Yes.
- For the last drawing match,

2382
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:43,050
- we'll move to the ending location.
- Okay.

2383
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:44,220
- Okay.
- That sounds good.

2384
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,450
(They move to make
the very last drawing!)

2385
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:46,590
It's time to draw.

2386
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:47,860
Will all of us draw?

2387
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,190
Okay.

2388
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:52,130
What kind of drawing
do we need to make?

2389
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:53,330
This place is really pretty.

2390
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:54,600
Look outside.

2391
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,360
- It's really pretty.
- What is this place?

2392
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,100
- It's really pretty.
- This place is really pretty.

2393
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,740
- It's really pretty.
- I mean...

2394
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,070
(The overly nice view
will give them inspiration.)

2395
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:04,770
You know, it's pretty.

2396
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:06,210
- I didn't know this place existed.
- It's like a palace.

2397
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,570
It's so pretty.

2398
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,110
Will we create some art today?

2399
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:10,740
All right. This is the last match.

2400
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,650
For the two families' pride,

2401
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:14,480
you'll have the Drawing Match.

2402
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,850
- How am I supposed to draw?
- Okay.

2403
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:17,350
For three minutes,

2404
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:19,250
- make a drawing...
- Three minutes?

2405
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:21,260
- for the theme of "Happy home."
- My home?

2406
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:23,260
Your current home. Your family.

2407
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,230
(Jae Seok's family,
Jong Kook's family)

2408
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,660
- My home.
- Yes.

2409
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:29,900
We'll collect
the completed drawings...

2410
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,800
and ask the AI, "How much
will you pay for this drawing?"

2411
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,740
The answer it gives...

2412
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:37,170
will be the price of the drawing.

2413
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:38,410
Really?

2414
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:42,240
Since the Kim Family has 6 members,
there will be 6 drawings.

2415
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:44,810
Since the Yu Family has
five members,

2416
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:46,610
please pick a member.

2417
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:48,380
The price of his or her drawing
will be doubled...

2418
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:50,150
- for the total.
- Okay.

2419
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:52,450
Please pick a member
before you start drawing.

2420
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:55,460
They'll pick either Jae Seok
or Se Chan.

2421
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:57,160
- Jae Seok is terrible at drawing.
- Really?

2422
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,160
Se Chan too.

2423
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,990
But a bad drawing
might be judged differently.

2424
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:03,260
- It might be seen as artistic.
- It might happen, right?

2425
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:05,530
- So...
- It isn't at that level.

2426
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:06,700
It's seriously bad.

2427
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:09,270
- Then pick the worst one.
- Jae Seok is the worst at drawing.

2428
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,140
- Jong Kook.
- What?

2429
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:12,910
- What?
- I mean...

2430
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:14,410
It doesn't matter since the AI...

2431
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:15,740
might focus on the artistry.

2432
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:16,780
- The soul.
- For goodness' sake.

2433
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:19,180
- The price of Jae Seok's drawing...
- Okay.

2434
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:21,210
will be doubled.

2435
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:24,120
The Yu Family won
the earlier mission,

2436
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,290
- right?
- Yes.

2437
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:27,420
Thus, 2 members
will get 2 additional minutes.

2438
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,920
They'll be able to draw
for five minutes.

2439
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,330
Then we should pick people
with potential.

2440
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:32,730
The price of my drawing
will he doubled,

2441
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:34,160
so I need to receive a high score.

2442
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,300
Grasshopper and me.

2443
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:38,800
- Haha will receive the frame.
- Okay.

2444
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:41,340
Some people acquired
additional colors.

2445
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:42,500
I want red.

2446
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,600
I want light blue.

2447
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,070
Ji Hyo can use
seven additional colors.

2448
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:46,710
Can we only use light peach?

2449
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:48,810
- Black and light peach.
- Okay.

2450
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:49,840
Get ready.

2451
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,040
- Okay.
- It's hard to use paint.

2452
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,950
This is hard.

2453
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:54,450
(They begin to draw
with the tool of their choice.)

2454
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:58,850
(Yu Family members can only use
light peach and black.)

2455
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:01,560
Home... Hold on. Home...

2456
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:02,920
My house looks strange.

2457
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,490
(The artists struggle
with the limited tools.)

2458
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:06,460
Drawing with markers...

2459
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,000
This is hard.

2460
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,160
(Drawing)

2461
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,060
My drawing is going so well.

2462
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,530
Gi Ru, I drew you.

2463
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,100
Gi Ru, I drew you.

2464
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:18,310
Why am I the size of the house?

2465
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,640
(He went beyond perspective.)

2466
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,840
I'm the size of the house.

2467
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,410
- I started with you.
- I see.

2468
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:25,550
It must be because I'm the biggest.

2469
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:29,880
(Glancing over at Gi Ru)

2470
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:33,820
- Your artwork is incredible.
- You know...

2471
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:35,690
- It's incredible.
- I like philosophical work.

2472
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:37,220
- What are you doing to your foot?
- You know,

2473
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:40,190
- I like philosophical work.
- It's incredible.

2474
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:42,460
This is a work of art.

2475
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:43,730
(Not bound by the tools,)

2476
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:46,470
(she adds a philosophical touch.)

2477
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:48,200
My work...

2478
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:50,670
We need to fool the AI.

2479
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:51,670
(What will her masterpiece
look like?)

2480
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:55,240
We need to make it look like
it has a deep meaning.

2481
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:57,380
An expert would give...

2482
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:58,810
the highest score to my work.

2483
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:04,580
(Meanwhile, the Kim Family
is absorbed in drawing.)

2484
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:08,090
(Compared to the other family,
they draw humanlike figures.)

2485
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:10,560
I'm using the cartoon style.
It's easy.

2486
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,260
The judge is the AI, right? The AI.

2487
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,100
What time is it now?

2488
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,430
That came out wrong.

2489
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:18,200
One minute and forty-five seconds
have passed.

2490
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,100
- Already?
- Already?

2491
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:22,400
This is driving me crazy.

2492
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,510
We don't have much time.

2493
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:27,570
I need to make it artistic.

2494
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,540
- We should blur the lines.
- Yes. We should do that.

2495
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,210
We should blur the lines.

2496
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:32,910
Gosh, I can't do it.

2497
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:35,250
(Rustling)

2498
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:38,250
(Absorbed)

2499
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:43,460
(This catfish goes wild
on the canvas.)

2500
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,490
We'll need more time.

2501
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:46,760
- Seriously.
- Three minutes.

2502
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,900
I don't want to draw more.
It came out well.

2503
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,060
He's confident.

2504
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:53,970
(3 minutes are up.)

2505
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:55,300
(9 members without more time
get their drawings taken away.)

2506
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,740
- Is it over?
- For goodness' sake.

2507
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,370
- I need some more time.
- Did three minutes pass?

2508
01:18:58,370 --> 01:19:00,970
- I didn't get to use any colors.
- Time's up.

2509
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:04,040
You're the one at fault
for not using any colors.

2510
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,110
Hold on.

2511
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:06,580
- Seriously.
- Gosh.

2512
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:08,780
- Come on.
- I didn't get to draw Haha.

2513
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:10,920
We needed five minutes
at the very least.

2514
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,920
Then you should've won the game.

2515
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,120
Why are you talking so much
when you're drawing so relaxed?

2516
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:18,660
Gosh, this is bad.

2517
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,030
Time passed so quickly.

2518
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,630
There's a geometric feel, right?

2519
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:23,930
It's a house with people inside.

2520
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,270
I don't know.

2521
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:26,570
- You don't know? Why not?
- No.

2522
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:28,100
I don't think you should draw more.

2523
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:29,300
Should I stop here?

2524
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,110
I think the AI...

2525
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:34,210
will give me a high score.

2526
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:37,540
I think the AI will get fooled.
Right?

2527
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:39,710
There's a bit of an artistic style.

2528
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:41,280
It looks cool.

2529
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,320
All right.

2530
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,550
- Let's stop.
- Stop.

2531
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:46,950
- Stop.
- Stop!

2532
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:50,260
- Okay.
- For goodness' sake.

2533
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,260
- What's that?
- For goodness' sake.

2534
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:54,360
I fooled the AI,

2535
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:55,460
Mine looks like Picasso's work.

2536
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,160
Look at mine. Mine has...

2537
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,170
- Really?
- Ha Jung Woo's style.

2538
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:01,430
Mine will surprise you.

2539
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,770
The AI will consider
the theme, right?

2540
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:07,440
- It's so embarrassing.
- I know.

2541
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,580
I can't show it to anyone.

2542
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:10,580
- What?
- What?

2543
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:11,850
- Your drawing?
- There isn't a stool for me.

2544
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:13,250
Didn't I get two stools?

2545
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,420
(She took 2 stools.)

2546
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:18,080
- That's right.
- Didn't I get two stools?

2547
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:20,590
Yes, you did. You got two stools.

2548
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:21,990
- I mean...
- That's right.

2549
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:23,420
- Gi Ru.
- It was comfortable.

2550
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:25,390
- You got one stool.
- One stool per buttock.

2551
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:27,090
It was really comfortable
to use one stool per buttock.

2552
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:28,930
- So...
- It was like sitting on a bench.

2553
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:31,330
I was so thankful
for their consideration.

2554
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:35,970
We'll alternate
between the two families.

2555
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:37,570
Let's first ask the AI...

2556
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:40,940
how much it would pay
for Se Chan's drawing.

2557
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:43,540
Please bring out Se Chan's drawing.

2558
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:44,640
Se Chan will go first.

2559
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:49,820
(He used his entire body to make
a drawing in Ha Jung Woo's style.)

2560
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:53,850
(Will it be as beautiful
as his performance?)

2561
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:56,720
- He drew it well.
- He did well.

2562
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,290
- He did well.
- What?

2563
01:20:58,290 --> 01:20:59,690
- Se Chan did well.
- He drew it well.

2564
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,530
(Did Se Chan draw well?)

2565
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:04,560
- What?
- Is that Se Chan's drawing?

2566
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,470
- What? Is that Se Chan's drawing?
- It's artistic.

2567
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:08,370
- It isn't half bad.
- It's artistic.

2568
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:10,370
- It looks meaningful.
- Please explain the intention...

2569
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:11,370
of your drawing.

2570
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:14,340
Picasso is one
of my favorite artists,

2571
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,440
so I paid homage to him.

2572
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,250
You did really well.

2573
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:20,050
- It isn't bad. It'll fool the AI.
- Seriously.

2574
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:21,380
- You know...
- It looks nice.

2575
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:23,580
- It looks cool.
- I didn't expect such reactions.

2576
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,420
- You guys like it.
- You drew it well.

2577
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,090
- You did well.
- It's a nice drawing.

2578
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,660
- Oh, my.
- It looks artistic.

2579
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:30,090
- What?
- You have a talent.

2580
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,390
I didn't make the faces round,

2581
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:33,690
- but square.
- Why?

2582
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:35,930
The AI might think
that the round faces are...

2583
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:37,730
- too ordinary.
- I see.

2584
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:39,100
- My goodness.
- You gave it a twist.

2585
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:40,270
It's a nice strategy.

2586
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,430
It's artistic.

2587
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:44,440
You regard your family
with love in your eyes.

2588
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,240
So the eyes are heart-shaped.

2589
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:47,870
- I drew them that way.
- Not bad.

2590
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:49,240
- It's the best.
- Really?

2591
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,080
- I don't want to go next.
- It's nice.

2592
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,550
Now...

2593
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:54,610
- They like that.
- Then we'll ask the AI...

2594
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:56,280
how much it can pay
for the art pieces,

2595
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,980
starting from Se Chan's.

2596
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:59,250
- He's good.
- People like that.

2597
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,250
It's not bad.
He did a good job
in a short period of time.

2598
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,060
- Will the AI evaluate it too?
- He did really well.

2599
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:04,560
The price of that
will show us the standard.

2600
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,830
He did really well.

2601
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:07,930
- Really?
- It almost makes you sad.

2602
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:09,500
- That's how good it is.
- You have an artistic sense.

2603
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,700
How much will you pay
for this art piece?

2604
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:17,670
- That's the question?
- That's how they'll ask?

2605
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,440
- Will it give it a price?
- It's the same.

2606
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,340
- Something is coming.
- It's so long.

2607
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:22,340
It's so long.

2608
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:25,750
The background
looks like rough pencil shading,

2609
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:29,250
with four square robot faces
that seem to be copied and pasted.

2610
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:30,920
Their eyes are drawn as hearts.

2611
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:33,850
I'm not sure if that was done
to show feeling...

2612
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:36,090
or if they were just overused.

2613
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:37,620
(It's a harsh criticism.)

2614
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:38,790
- Why, that...
- It's unsure...

2615
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:39,960
if the hearts were overused.

2616
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,660
(The evaluation isn't finished.)

2617
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:44,060
It's like the painter is saying,
"This piece is abstract,"

2618
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,730
"so just look at the feeling,"
and ends there.

2619
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:49,700
Visually, it lacks any uniqueness,
and inwardly, it's an empty shell.

2620
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,640
So how much is it?

2621
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:53,070
How much is it?

2622
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:56,180
The price of frozen food
at a convenience store is enough.

2623
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,280
Seven dollars.

2624
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,450
(7 dollars)

2625
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:02,620
It's a psycho.

2626
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:03,950
Seven dollars.

2627
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:05,350
(The AI appraiser
taught him the reality.)

2628
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:07,050
It's a chic AI.

2629
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:08,460
- It's a type T AI.
- That's right.

2630
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:10,460
- It's type T.
- Seriously.

2631
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:11,560
Seven dollars?

2632
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,290
- Seven dollars can be a high price.
- Right.

2633
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:15,400
- This is amazing.
- If this is worth that price...

2634
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,630
- The price was set...
- Seven dollars.

2635
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:17,830
- at seven dollars.
- It could be a high price.

2636
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:20,200
Seven dollars. It's quite detailed.

2637
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,670
It's different.

2638
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:24,040
- But it feels good...
- It's nice.

2639
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,040
since you think my drawing is nice.

2640
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,740
You really did well, though.

2641
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,410
- It's good.
- If this is seven dollars,

2642
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:30,010
- the rest would be worth much less.
- I'll hang it at home.

2643
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:31,810
Give that to me. I'll take it home.

2644
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:35,480
The AI's view is different
from that of humans.

2645
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,920
- I'll go with the frame.
- Okay.

2646
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:39,220
Will it give it a higher price...

2647
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,650
- if it has a frame?
- The picture...

2648
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:43,060
- Yes. This is unfinished.
- It's a bit...

2649
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:46,990
This is what happened yesterday.

2650
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:49,060
- What's that?
- How did I give him a frame...

2651
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,200
for such a drawing?

2652
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,630
- It's such a bad drawing.
- I drew what happened...

2653
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:55,570
in our family yesterday.

2654
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:57,340
I went to Yongin
for my father's birthday.

2655
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:58,740
- I got so annoyed on the way back.
- It's pretty.

2656
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:01,040
I wasn't smiling,
but everybody else was enjoying it.

2657
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,140
Right.

2658
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:03,340
It's like a commercial.

2659
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:06,450
- Everyone else but me is happy.
- Okay.

2660
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:08,880
- I say 3 dollars.
- I say 2 dollars.

2661
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,020
- Thirty cents.
- We'll ask the AI.

2662
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:13,350
- A frame for such a bad drawing.
- The frame...

2663
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:14,390
The frame may make it seem...

2664
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:15,890
- like an expensive one.
- Right.

2665
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:19,060
But I don't think that will
fool the AI.

2666
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,990
- This one. The frame...
- It's out!

2667
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:22,360
- "Well, this..."
- "Well, this..."

2668
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:25,130
Well, this is like a rough doodle...

2669
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:27,130
that was drawn
while going on a group retreat.

2670
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:28,500
- What is it?
- "Well, this..."

2671
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,800
- How much is it?
- It starts with "Well, this..."

2672
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,240
"Going on a group retreat."

2673
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:37,340
It looks like people were just
crammed into the box.

2674
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:40,050
The character on the left
has an open mouth in excitement.

2675
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:42,420
The driver on the right
has a rotten expression.

2676
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:45,490
The two contrast so much
that it gets some attention.

2677
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:47,720
That much?

2678
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,860
(He's upset.)

2679
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,060
- This piece costs 18 dollars.
- There.

2680
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,860
- How much?
- Eighteen dollars?

2681
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,030
- Eighteen dollars.
- Eighteen dollars?

2682
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:56,630
(A generous appraisal
compared to a harsh rating)

2683
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:59,030
- What is this?
- This piece costs 18 dollars.

2684
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:02,100
The drawing costs 3 dollars,
and the frame costs 15 dollars.

2685
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,300
"The frame costs 15 dollars..."

2686
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:05,370
The drawing costs 3 dollars,
and the frame costs 15 dollars.

2687
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:07,440
- Three dollars.
- Mine costs more.

2688
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,940
I guessed it correctly.
I guessed it right.

2689
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,650
(Why, you...)

2690
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:16,850
Anyway, Haha got 18 dollars.

2691
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:18,950
That's the price of the frame.

2692
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:20,820
(Still,
the frame helped Haha a lot.)

2693
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:22,320
- Anyway. Hey!
- Nice.

2694
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,960
If you took that,

2695
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:26,460
- you should have done well.
- The frame mattered.

2696
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,700
- The frame mattered.
- The frame mattered.

2697
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:32,170
It really hurts you.

2698
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:35,170
It's not sane.
People liked my drawing.

2699
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:37,570
That's not true.
Your drawing was poor.

2700
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:39,840
- I get it now.
- Next is Seok Jin's...

2701
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,240
- I'm excited.
- drawing.

2702
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,440
- This is no joke.
- Goodness.

2703
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,580
Seok Sam.

2704
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:45,950
- It's scary.
- It's scary.

2705
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,780
Is this occult? What is that?

2706
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:49,350
- I...
- What is that?

2707
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:51,620
I drew a house.

2708
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,420
I drew a house
to look like a person.

2709
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:55,690
There are hearts on the side.

2710
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:56,920
- It's there.
- Our happy house.

2711
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:00,290
It's a depiction
of a person and a house.

2712
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:01,960
- He made a sly move.
- This is...

2713
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,630
- My dream...
- He signed it.

2714
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:05,100
- The signature. The AI...
- I signed it.

2715
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:06,730
- can sign it.
- Right.

2716
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:08,170
The signing is the point.

2717
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:10,040
- But that...
- Famous artists sign their work.

2718
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,070
Let me see.

2719
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:13,340
- I say 2.5 dollars.
- It's a bit...

2720
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:14,740
- It's weird.
- It is scary.

2721
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:16,040
It's weird.

2722
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,980
- It is a bit scary.
- Horror. That's the point.

2723
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:20,350
How much will you pay
for this art piece?

2724
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:23,350
I'm not sure if the house is smiling
or the person is the house.

2725
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:25,350
It is bewildering to look at it.

2726
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:27,420
Looking at the signature,

2727
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:29,960
the artist seems to think
this is art.

2728
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,530
I'd buy that confidence.

2729
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:35,560
I added ten dollars
for the signature premium.

2730
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,660
So the piece is worth 12 dollars.

2731
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:38,800
Twelve dollars.

2732
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,470
- What?
- Twelve dollars.

2733
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:42,040
(That is worth 12 dollars?)

2734
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,140
How much?

2735
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:44,970
- The signature is ten dollars.
- A signature premium.

2736
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:47,010
- Really?
- The signature is ten dollars?

2737
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:48,810
- The signature is ten dollars?
- The signature?

2738
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:49,910
The signature is ten dollars.

2739
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:51,880
(This is worth ten dollars.)

2740
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:54,450
How would it know
that's his signature?

2741
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:55,880
- So the signature...
- I should have signed mine.

2742
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,920
It recognized
the famous artist's signature.

2743
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,190
I aimed for that.

2744
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:01,350
- This is...
- Seok Jin's piece...

2745
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:04,020
is worth 12 dollars.
Next is Jang Hoon's piece.

2746
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:05,930
- Please show it to us.
- But this...

2747
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:07,660
I'm curious to see
Jang Hoon's piece.

2748
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,460
I doubt it will be worth ten cents.

2749
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,200
(Would the drawing be as delicate
as his personality?)

2750
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,830
This is troublesome.

2751
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:14,970
What's that?

2752
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:17,470
- This is trouble.
- What is this?

2753
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,910
They gave me so little time.

2754
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,240
- But this...
- What is this?

2755
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,640
They took it from me
while I was sketching.

2756
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,780
- What are they doing?
- Are they aliens?

2757
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:26,810
- But...
- This side.

2758
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:27,980
- This is a spaceship, and this...
- No.

2759
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:29,350
Are they aliens?

2760
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:32,520
I was drawing the people
one by one at the end...

2761
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:33,750
- when they took it from me.
- But...

2762
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:36,020
I'm worried about the price
he'll get for this.

2763
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:37,220
But this...

2764
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:39,660
This is the kind of drawing
where a frustrating friend says,

2765
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:42,060
"Hey, I drew a family and house,"
and you have to force yourself...

2766
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:44,630
to say, "Yes, it's a family."

2767
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,970
The piece isn't even worth
one dollar,

2768
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:49,840
but I'll give it that
as a cleanup fee.

2769
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,700
- This is...
- But it...

2770
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:55,010
But this drawing... What is that?

2771
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:57,240
It makes a reasonable judgment.

2772
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:58,280
This...

2773
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:59,950
They're leading.

2774
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:01,550
- The signature one.
- What is that?

2775
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:03,520
Now, it's Gi Ru's drawing.

2776
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,450
- She stamped her foot.
- What's this?

2777
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:07,750
- I like philosophical things.
- You're amazing.

2778
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:09,320
I like philosophical things.

2779
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:15,290
(A philosophical painter
using her foot, Gi Ru)

2780
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:17,830
- But mine...
- The team has to win.

2781
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:20,100
Mine has a body part.
It could get a high price.

2782
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:22,040
- She stamped her foot.
- What is this?

2783
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:23,640
- That's...
- That's the worst.

2784
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,040
The worst?

2785
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,240
- This has a meaning.
- It's the worst.

2786
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,440
From home...

2787
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,940
- You all leave home,
- It's the worst.

2788
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,850
earn money, and go out to eat.
Those feet represent that.

2789
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:35,720
- What's that 110v?
- The 110v?

2790
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,080
- A pig's nose.
- That's a pig's nose?

2791
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,720
- A pork belly restaurant?
- No.

2792
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,250
Isn't that the Jangchung-dong
king jokbal?

2793
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:41,290
I say 30 dollars.

2794
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:43,560
- It's meaningful.
- I give it 30 dollars.

2795
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:44,760
How much would you pay
for this art piece?

2796
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,030
- This is worth 11 dollars.
- How much?

2797
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:47,890
- Ten dollars for the feet.
- Eighteen dollars?

2798
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:50,230
- How much?
- Ten dollars for the feet.

2799
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,200
What is that?

2800
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,630
- We have a chance.
- We have a chance.

2801
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:56,640
- It's doable.
- Shin Gi Ru.

2802
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,540
- Yours was worth 11 dollars.
- It was higher than I thought.

2803
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:00,240
It's cute.

2804
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:03,040
Worth 25 dollars for its potential
as an emotional education poster.

2805
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,240
- Twenty-five dollars!
- Twenty-five dollars! Okay.

2806
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:08,720
Jang Hoon, our youngest,
almost got scratched here.

2807
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,280
It's worth 14 dollars for being
a witness sketch of the incident.

2808
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,550
- Fourteen dollars!
- Fourteen dollars! Not bad.

2809
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:14,550
Hey!

2810
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:15,820
I couldn't draw the face.

2811
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:19,030
Worth 12 dollars as the rainbow
won diligence points.

2812
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:20,460
We're in trouble.

2813
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:23,460
- I highlighted the texture.
- It gives it a mood.

2814
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:26,370
At least an hour was put into this.
Worth 18 dollars.

2815
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:28,300
(The Kim Family made a comeback
thanks to Artist Shindong!)

2816
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,200
- What?
- Amazing.

2817
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,070
- Amazing.
- What is this?

2818
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:33,410
(Only Jae Seok and Jong Kook
are left.)

2819
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,070
- That's right.
- No way.

2820
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:37,040
- Good. We won.
- We won.

2821
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,710
- We won now.
- We won.

2822
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:40,610
- We won.
- This is over.

2823
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:42,350
- We won with that.
- They can't beat this.

2824
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,250
I think Jae Seok's
will get a high price.

2825
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,850
- Now, we'll check...
- Okay.

2826
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:47,450
Jong Kook's drawing.

2827
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:50,760
Mine. But mine is unfinished.

2828
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,560
- Jong Kook!
- I didn't finish it.

2829
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,090
- This...
- He drew well.

2830
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:56,160
- That's at least 30 dollars.
- He drew well.

2831
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,360
- He drew well.
- He drew well.

2832
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:00,170
- That's like a cartoon.
- It's pretty.

2833
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:02,670
- That's at least...
- He drew well.

2834
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:04,070
You could draw cartoons.

2835
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:05,640
- He drew well.
- I ran out of time.

2836
01:30:05,770 --> 01:30:08,340
- He drew well.
- Draw a webtoon.

2837
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:10,980
- Is the person in the middle me?
- It's you.

2838
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:12,850
- That looks so much like me.
- What?

2839
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:14,850
- Who is this baby?
- What?

2840
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:16,080
- Who is this baby?
- That's me.

2841
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,650
- This baby.
- I drew myself to look cute.

2842
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:20,390
Who is that caveman?

2843
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:21,920
A caveman?

2844
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,560
- That's obviously Jang Hoon.
- Jang Hoon.

2845
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:27,060
How could you draw me...

2846
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:28,360
like that?

2847
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,160
What's wrong?

2848
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,630
- What's wrong?
- He drew so well.

2849
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:32,670
Is that Frankenstein?

2850
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:34,200
But why doesn't Ji Hyo have a body?

2851
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,570
I was drawing Ji Hyo,
but I didn't have time.

2852
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:37,970
- He drew well.
- But...

2853
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,770
I think it will get a good price.

2854
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:41,010
- Right.
- This would be worth 50 dollars.

2855
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:42,710
- Please.
- It would be worth 50 dollars.

2856
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:44,140
But the AI doesn't know that.

2857
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:45,310
So how much is it worth?

2858
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,810
This picture has the most...

2859
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:49,780
painting-like composition
and depiction of figures...

2860
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:51,780
- that I have seen so far.
- No way.

2861
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,050
- Amazing.
- "The most painting-like."

2862
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:55,020
- Jong Kook. Look.
- Really? Hold on.

2863
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:56,290
- Give it 50 dollars.
- What is it?

2864
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:58,260
(The evaluation starts differently.)

2865
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,830
(Feeling anxious)

2866
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,160
Simple but observant.

2867
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:06,730
The biggest strength
of this painting...

2868
01:31:06,730 --> 01:31:08,030
is that viewers can tell who is who.

2869
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:09,640
- Detail.
- That's the highest praise.

2870
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:10,640
Amazing.

2871
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:12,440
- How much is it?
- What?

2872
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,210
- Please.
- How much is it?

2873
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,040
The characters' acting
drove up the price.

2874
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,310
- This drawing is worth 42 dollars.
- How much?

2875
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:20,650
- It's 42 dollars!
- Yes!

2876
01:31:20,650 --> 01:31:22,480
(The highest price ever, 42 dollars)

2877
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:23,620
(The Yu Family: 55 dollars,
the Kim Family: 102 dollars)

2878
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:25,180
(The price difference
widened in an instant.)

2879
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:26,550
- This is amazing.
- Yes!

2880
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:28,520
- It's unbelievable.
- This is good.

2881
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,960
(Painter Kim
made the stingy AI generous.)

2882
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:31,660
(We're in trouble.)

2883
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:33,130
- It's 42 dollars.
- This is...

2884
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:35,960
Let me use the AI we know.

2885
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,160
- I don't think this one is right.
- My gosh.

2886
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,570
- We did it.
- All right.

2887
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:41,600
- This is high.
- That's really...

2888
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,870
- It's precise.
- We can use it at a gallery.

2889
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:45,070
- It's detailed.
- We did it.

2890
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:46,870
Detail.

2891
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:49,110
How did he draw me like that?

2892
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:50,780
I'm so relieved.

2893
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:52,450
- We can say it's over.
- Me.

2894
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:53,710
- It's my turn.
- Yu Jae Seok's drawing.

2895
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:54,980
- We will know once we see it.
- Let's see.

2896
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:56,420
- All right.
- Let's see.

2897
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:58,080
My drawing...

2898
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,820
I should've added my autograph.

2899
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:01,650
- He should've signed it.
- Let's go.

2900
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:03,760
Things are going smoothly
with my drawing.

2901
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:05,320
I think...

2902
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:08,430
(For his precise AI targeting,)

2903
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:10,960
(Painter Yu got an extra 2 minutes.)

2904
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,330
- I'm excited.
- It might say it's artistic.

2905
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:17,040
There's no point in the drawing.

2906
01:32:17,470 --> 01:32:18,910
What's that?

2907
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:20,740
(The drawing
is like his fingerprint.)

2908
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:22,380
(Laughing)

2909
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:23,640
- What's that?
- My goodness.

2910
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:25,650
- There's no point.
- It's like a little kid's drawing.

2911
01:32:25,650 --> 01:32:27,180
There's no point in the drawing.

2912
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:29,020
- What's that?
- That counts for two people.

2913
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,380
Jae Seok's is for two people.

2914
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:32,080
All right. This is Gi Ru.

2915
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,620
Seok Sam.

2916
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:35,320
- I think I know which one is me.
- Here's Se Chan.

2917
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,390
- Everyone's here. Ye Eun.
- Okay.

2918
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:38,930
Who is the person
in the lower right area?

2919
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:40,090
Who? This one?

2920
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:42,460
- I just drew a person.
- Who is it?

2921
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:44,100
Didn't Ji Hyo draw this
when he was two years old?

2922
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:45,930
- Isn't that Mushroom Boy?
- I just drew it.

2923
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:48,270
- We will ask the AI then.
- Let's do that.

2924
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:49,540
I'm curious about this one.

2925
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:51,400
- This is really...
- I'm curious.

2926
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:52,810
Let's pull off a miracle.

2927
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:53,940
A miracle.

2928
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:56,240
Let's pull off a miracle.

2929
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:57,480
We can do this.

2930
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:58,610
Please.

2931
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:00,180
Please.

2932
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:02,350
Miracle. It's taking some time.

2933
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:03,450
It's taking a long time.

2934
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:05,720
This is what you get...

2935
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,150
after giving kids
some colored pencils...

2936
01:33:07,150 --> 01:33:09,790
and having them draw something
on a canvas.

2937
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:12,430
There's no theme,
no composition, and no focus.

2938
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:15,260
That's just too harsh.

2939
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:16,530
What does it say?

2940
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:18,100
It's hard to tell...

2941
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:20,330
if the person on the right
is an elephant or a human.

2942
01:33:20,330 --> 01:33:21,600
And the kids at the bottom...

2943
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,040
are more like...

2944
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,100
emotionless doodles
with a few lines.

2945
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:26,270
But this is...

2946
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:27,510
(Harsh criticism)

2947
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:28,870
- Why aren't you reading the rest?
- This is really...

2948
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:30,010
"This is worth six dollars.
To be honest,"

2949
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:31,380
- Six dollars?
- "it's not worth five dollars..."

2950
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:32,680
"This is worth six dollars.
To be honest,"

2951
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,050
- Six dollars?
- "it's not worth five dollars,"

2952
01:33:34,210 --> 01:33:35,510
"but I'm adding one dollar
for labor costs..."

2953
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:36,820
"since there are many people
in the drawing."

2954
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:38,080
My goodness.

2955
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:40,250
Jae Seok's drawing is six dollars.

2956
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:43,460
For your team score,
we will double his for the total.

2957
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:45,090
That's higher than I thought.

2958
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:46,530
My goodness. Seriously...

2959
01:33:46,530 --> 01:33:47,660
- I got the lowest amount.
- It's not even close.

2960
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:48,860
- Are you in last place?
- He is.

2961
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:50,430
- I got six dollars.
- Six dollars?

2962
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:51,900
- It will be doubled.
- It will be doubled.

2963
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:53,900
But your price will be doubled.

2964
01:33:54,730 --> 01:33:55,940
I'll announce the results...

2965
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:58,100
of the Between Masterpiece
and Failure Race.

2966
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:01,440
The total price
of the Yu Family's drawings...

2967
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:04,010
is 67 dollars.

2968
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:07,680
And the total price
of the Kim Family's drawings...

2969
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:09,550
- is 102 dollars.
- Yes!

2970
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:10,750
Nice!

2971
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:14,090
- The Kim Family wins the race.
- We did it.

2972
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:17,120
Kim Jong Kook,
the head of the Kim Family,

2973
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,790
the first-place winner,
excluding Kim Jong Kook,

2974
01:34:19,790 --> 01:34:20,860
Shindong,

2975
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:23,100
and the second-place winner,
Haha will receive the prize.

2976
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,300
- Okay.
- Yes!

2977
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:26,530
And,

2978
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:28,370
though his family won,

2979
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:30,100
Seo Jang Hoon drew a total flop...

2980
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,900
and came in last...

2981
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:33,240
with the price of one dollar,

2982
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,540
- so he will get the penalty.
- Penalty.

2983
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,780
- I knew it.
- Penalty.

2984
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:38,610
I had no expectations
in the first place.

2985
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:42,180
Yu Jae Seok, the head
of the losing family,

2986
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:43,680
is getting the penalty.

2987
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:45,620
- Oh, no.
- I told you...

2988
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:48,050
the 1st and 2nd place winners
will be exempted.

2989
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:49,660
The first place...

2990
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:51,460
is Ji Ye Eun with 25 dollars,

2991
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:52,560
and the second place...

2992
01:34:52,830 --> 01:34:54,860
is Jee Seok Jin with 12 dollars.

2993
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:56,700
- It doesn't have the sides.
- Milkshake

2994
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:59,270
(Chungju Ji and Jee
ranked high today.)

2995
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:01,070
So, the members
to get the penalty today...

2996
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,370
are Yang Se Chan, Shin Gi Ru,
Yu Jae Seok,

2997
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:06,710
and Seo Jang Hoon.
Those four members.

2998
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:08,570
- What's that?
- The prize is...

2999
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:11,480
- It's dragon fruit.
- a common object in paintings.

3000
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,310
It's the fruit set.

3001
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:16,480
- Nice.
- The penalty is...

3002
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,280
for those who failed
to create a masterpiece.

3003
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:21,720
They will make another piece
by taking a rubbing of their faces.

3004
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:23,720
Why are we doing this
all of a sudden?

3005
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,630
What is this? My goodness.

3006
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:27,930
This is
what Jang Hoon hates the most.

3007
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:29,860
- Right.
- The thing he hates most.

3008
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:31,060
Show them how you do it.

3009
01:35:31,330 --> 01:35:32,360
You are handsome.

3010
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,430
It's decalcomania.

3011
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:34,630
All right.

3012
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:35,730
(The face-rubbing experts
give a demonstration.)

3013
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:36,840
- Let's do this.
- It looks good.

3014
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:38,570
- Good.
- It will come out well.

3015
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,310
- It's perfect.
- It looks good.

3016
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:41,740
(Gi Ru, who left footprints,
takes a rubbing of her face.)

3017
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:43,480
- It's really big.
- Hang on.

3018
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:44,580
It's huge.

3019
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:46,480
- Why is it so big?
- By the way,

3020
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:48,810
it's all over my face.

3021
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:51,220
All right. Next.

3022
01:35:51,650 --> 01:35:52,750
He is...

3023
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:54,120
He's the guy from Japan
with a barrage of blows.

3024
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:56,190
(Patting)

3025
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:57,420
It's him.

3026
01:35:57,490 --> 01:35:59,660
- We can see him at a festival.
- Right.

3027
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:01,460
(Jang Hoon begins
his face painting.)

3028
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:03,260
Oh, no.

3029
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,460
He really hates it.

3030
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:06,700
(He really hates it.)

3031
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:08,470
(Struggling)

3032
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:09,740
How did he end up like this?

3033
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:11,870
- He's being detailed.
- He's meticulous.

3034
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,040
You are doing it with a lot of care.

3035
01:36:14,110 --> 01:36:15,440
I want to make sure
that his wrinkles are printed.

3036
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:16,510
He's so meticulous.

3037
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:18,940
Even his pores will be printed.

3038
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:19,950
- Jae Seok is really...
- Jae Seok,

3039
01:36:19,950 --> 01:36:21,250
- put it on his face thoroughly.
- He doesn't usually do that.

3040
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:23,120
- You aren't usually like this.
- Thoroughly.

3041
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,720
Put some more on his cheeks.

3042
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,650
- That's enough, Jae Seok.
- Stop it.

3043
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:28,920
- That's enough.
- You're being playful again.

3044
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:30,320
Stop it already!

3045
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,360
(Stop it already!)

3046
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:34,090
(Feeling great)

3047
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:35,160
You look so happy.

3048
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:36,700
(You look so happy!)

3049
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,300
Print two sheets.

3050
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:40,070
(Sighing)

3051
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:42,870
- There you go.
- You're doing well.

3052
01:36:42,870 --> 01:36:43,970
That's good.

3053
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:45,040
Take it off gently.

3054
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,670
- Gently.
- We will get a masterpiece.

3055
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:48,910
"Baebully Hills."

3056
01:36:48,910 --> 01:36:50,110
- All right.
- That's amazing.

3057
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:53,710
- It came out well.
- It looks good.

3058
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:55,610
- It's a good one.
- It looks annoyed.

3059
01:36:55,610 --> 01:36:57,380
His annoyed face is printed.

3060
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:58,720
He looks very upset.

3061
01:36:58,720 --> 01:36:59,750
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

3062
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:00,820
(We thank the Baebullians,
Jang Hoon, Gi Ru, and Shindong...)

3063
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:01,990
(for filling up our day.)

3064
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:05,390
(The Returning Home
in Glory Special)

3065
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,530
(Kim Min Jong, the national
judo athlete who swept the world)

3066
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:09,330
(Kim Ha Yoon, the national
judo athlete who swept the world)

3067
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:10,660
(The nation's treasured athletes
are welcomed...)

3068
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:12,230
(by the B-list PE students.)

3069
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:13,930
(The master of vault, Yang Ak Seon)

3070
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:16,100
(The fairy of Running University,
Fake Yeon Jae)

3071
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,870
(Confused)

3072
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:20,770
(The conference of the PE department
at Running University starts.)

3073
01:37:20,770 --> 01:37:22,040
Except for these two, the rest...

3074
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:23,480
(They are at the community center level
at most.)

3075
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,110
(What is this?)

3076
01:37:25,810 --> 01:37:27,150
(The fake athletes are blinded...)

3077
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,220
(by the national treasure prizes.)

3078
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:31,650
(Endless fouls)

3079
01:37:31,950 --> 01:37:33,020
(The pride of the national athlete
is completely hurt.)

3080
01:37:33,090 --> 01:37:34,120
Isn't he the Hulk?

3081
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:37,190
(Forget
about the sense of fair play.)

3082
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,690
(How will the hurtful training
of Running University end?)

3083
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:42,260
(Running Sports University
Prize Battle)
