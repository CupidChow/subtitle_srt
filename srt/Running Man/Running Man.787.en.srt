00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,080
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,950
(Running Man)

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,350
- It's so cold. - It's a little chilly.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,780
Hi. Happy New Year.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,920
(Today is the 2026 Running University...)

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,920
You're here.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,690
- Hello. - Okay!

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,990
(Orientation Day for freshmen.)

9
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,320
- We all look the same. - We're wearing the same thing.

10
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,560
- I should get changed. - You can keep it on.

11
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,890
(They are all here n their new student outfits.)

12
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,560
We all look the same.

13
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,590
Weren't you going to wear a baseball jacket?

14
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,630
This is...

15
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,960
I was told to dress like a freshman, so I put this on.

16
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,460
- How are you a freshman? - You look nothing like a freshman.

17
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,570
- I don't know. I just... - Hello, Jae Seok.

18
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,500
(Just then, the freshman representative, Jae Seok, arrives.)

19
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,230
- Hey. - Did you do this?

20
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,940
- No. - Who did this?

21
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,240
The face of SBS did it.

22
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,840
- So, it was you. - I see.

23
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,070
- I get it. - The face of SBS.

24
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,580
(The 2025 Face of SBS prepared a coffee truck.)

25
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,240
The ugly face of SBS.

26
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,940
- The face of SBS? - I see. The ugly face.

27
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,410
- The ugly face. That's touching. - Hello.

28
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,480
(It is Jae Seok's New Year's gift for the staff.)

29
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,650
The ugly face of SBS did this for us.

30
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,480
What would you like?

31
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,720
(Thanks to him, they kicked off in a good mood despite the cold.)

32
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,150
- Me? - I'll have a hot Americano.

33
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,120
I already had the signature drink.

34
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,720
The coffee is on the ugly face of SBS.

35
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,220
It should say "The Ugly Face Award" here.

36
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,530
- The Ugly Face Award? - Yes.

37
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,590
Here...

38
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,590
- The Ugly Face Award. - The SBS Ugly Face Award.

39
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,160
(They respond to the grateful gift with mockery.)

40
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,930
Write "The Ugly Face Award" in parentheses.

41
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,030
With a marker.

42
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,300
- What's this? - SBS Running Man's...

43
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,100
(The Ugly Face of SBS)

44
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,900
- Ugly Face. - I'm sending this to all my shows.

45
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,040
- Hello. - You're here!

46
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,840
(Ji Hyo also arrives.)

47
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,700
- Ji Hyo. - What's up?

48
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,240
What kind of freshman is she?

49
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,010
(Ji Hyo)

50
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,210
- You and I are the only ones. - I know.

51
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,340
We are properly dressed.

52
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,840
- It's just us. - We're the only ones.

53
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,080
- This is... - We're the only ones who care.

54
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,080
(The concept)

55
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,320
- I mean, we're... - We should get an award.

56
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,120
- We're perfect for today's theme. - Look.

57
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,790
(The 3 guys in school jackets hold hands and act proud.)

58
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,890
- Who cares about Running Man? - This is a college student.

59
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,250
- I can't do this with them. - Seok Jin.

60
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,220
- Come here. - They're not college freshmen.

61
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,920
- For our show... - Look at them.

62
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,930
- He's just a trainer. - Hey, you...

63
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,260
(The fake freshman added the jacket to his usual clothes.)

64
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,960
- Jong Kook. - Mr. Trainer.

65
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,300
- You're not a freshman. - You guys are just a cliché.

66
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,060
- That's the whole point. - This isn't just right.

67
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,500
You just don't care.

68
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,600
- What are you talking about? - What is this?

69
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,500
- You looked like this last week. - I do care about the shoot.

70
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,600
(Bold)

71
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,500
- Look at you. - What...

72
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,770
I'm wearing a jacket because I'm a freshman today.

73
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,240
- I'm wearing my department jacket. - Hey, your department jacket?

74
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,810
You should wear something obvious.

75
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,310
- A department jacket, my foot. - You need a hat like this.

76
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,210
- And... - Young people don't wear...

77
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,980
(While criticisms are being hurled at each other...)

78
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,980
hats like that.

79
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,150
Hello.

80
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,250
- Hello. - Hello.

81
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,120
I'm the face of SBS.

82
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,120
(Ugly Face and the Duffle Coat Sisters come in.)

83
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,220
- The face? - The face.

84
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,620
- What? - The face of SBS.

85
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,590
What kind of college student is this?

86
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,630
- That's not a college student. - SBS.

87
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,960
This isn't a college student.

88
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,700
You guys don't know because you've never studied.

89
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,700
- What did you say? - Don't be ridiculous.

90
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,660
- They didn't experience college. - They didn't.

91
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,200
You dropped out of college.

92
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,670
- Right. - I dropped out.

93
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,200
- I did drop out, but... - I graduated.

94
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,940
- I graduated from college. - What?

95
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,210
- I completed college. - He finished college.

96
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,940
It's not important. Just go on with what you were saying.

97
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,110
(He cuts him off and starts criticizing him right away.)

98
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,210
Just look at you.

99
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,480
- What's wrong with this? - What's this?

100
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
What are you?

101
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,050
- A study room manager, or what? - I am.

102
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,620
- You are? - I work as a study room manager...

103
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,720
- That's right. - to pay for college.

104
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,120
- That's it. - What?

105
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,860
Why are you suddenly going for humanism?

106
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,390
- This is just... - Who paid for the coffee?

107
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,390
- Hey. - What?

108
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,430
Give it back.

109
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,530
Give it back.

110
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,500
(Taking coffee from the mean freshman)

111
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,970
- This is... - How childish.

112
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,870
I prepared this for the hard-working production staff.

113
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,570
- That's right. - He's being so childish.

114
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,710
(They are 2026 times more childish from the start of the year.)

115
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,870
- Right. - Did you have some coffee?

116
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,610
- I didn't. - You didn't?

117
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,940
- I didn't. - I lost my coffee?

118
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,340
You can't have coffee.

119
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,950
- Go home. - Why?

120
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,720
Why would I go home? I won the Special Award.

121
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,650
- What award? - What?

122
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,620
(They brag about the Ugly Face Award,)

123
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,890
- The Perfect Attendance Award. - Right.

124
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,120
- Ye Eun won the Excellence Award. - She did.

125
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,590
(the Perfect Attendance Award, and even the Excellence Award.)

126
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,160
- She won the Excellence Award. - The Perfect Attendance Award.

127
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,590
Today, you guys are the freshmen of Running University,

128
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,030
(Today's concept is revealed.)

129
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,530
(They are the entering class of 2026 of Running University.)

130
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,230
- the entering class of 2026. - Really?

131
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,230
I knew it.

132
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,560
I went to college in 1991.

133
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,600
- And Seok Jin did in 1986. - In 1986.

134
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,570
- The entering class of 1986. - I was born in 1986.

135
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,310
I was supposed to go to college in 1995, but I failed the exam.

136
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,510
- So I went to college in 1998. - In 1998.

137
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,040
We're the same. I went to college in 1998.

138
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,250
- How dare you? - You startled me.

139
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,410
(Startled)

140
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,810
- He got startled for real. - Hang on.

141
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,120
He's really surprised.

142
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,580
Seriously, I got startled.

143
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,120
- Why is he so startled? - He's almost 50 now.

144
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,990
- But he always gets scolded. - By the way,

145
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,260
why does he always get scolded by the older members?

146
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,830
You're so annoying.

147
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,930
(He scolds the cocky new student.)

148
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,490
- Why? - He's so annoying.

149
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,960
We have an additional freshman accepted today.

150
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,970
(There is an additional freshman accepted today.)

151
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,330
- There's more? - Who is it?

152
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,830
Please bring the student in.

153
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,670
- Who is it? - Gosh, who would it be?

154
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,340
- Isn't it Eun Bi? - What?

155
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
Eun Bi.

156
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,140
(A family member of Running Man, Kwon Eun Bi)

157
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,610
- Eun Bi. - A new student... Hey.

158
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,240
- Eun Bi. Okay! - Eun Bi.

159
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,740
(Running)

160
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,140
- What? - She's dressed like Ye Eun.

161
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,710
- The feeling. - Eun Bi is here again.

162
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,010
It's Eun Bi again.

163
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,350
I'll start...

164
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,810
(When she was here as a CEO last time,)

165
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,080
by embezzling.

166
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,380
(she started by embezzling.)

167
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,720
My poor employees.

168
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,290
They're working so hard with all their trust in me.

169
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,590
I'll have to embezzle money right away.

170
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,820
Se Chan...

171
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,220
(She embezzled 15,000 dollars...)

172
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,360
- received two cents. - What?

173
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,730
(and gave Se Chan 2 cents.)

174
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,130
Seok Jin...

175
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,400
(Seok Jin got only 0.2 cents.)

176
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,000
received 0.2 cents in total.

177
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,200
- Amazing. - The employees worked like dogs.

178
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,400
Let's go protest in front of her building.

179
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,410
(Kwon Eun Bi, who extorts money from them, is back as a freshman.)

180
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,270
- We just worked like dogs. - I told you.

181
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,110
I told you not to come near SBS ever again.

182
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,110
Don't lie to us.

183
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,850
(A stir breaks out from the PTSD they have over Eun Bi.)

184
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,410
- Kwon Eun Bi, you... - That traitor.

185
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,380
- You are really... - You'd better not annoy me.

186
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,020
- I'm so upset whenever I see you. - Don't pull tricks on us.

187
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,180
Wait. Seok Sam, it's been a while.

188
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,320
Seok Sam.

189
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,690
(Sticking to the theme where they are agemates)

190
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,420
- Seok Sam, it's been a while. - Seok Sam.

191
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,960
Hey, don't mess with me.

192
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,490
We are all freshmen today.

193
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,820
- What? - Have you been doing well?

194
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,130
- Yes. Come here. - All right.

195
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,790
- She's good at skits. - Eun Bi.

196
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,200
- She's just brazen. - She really is.

197
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,670
- She fooled us last time. - Right.

198
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,270
- She did. - She keeps pulling tricks on us.

199
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,040
Did I fool you?

200
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,810
You don't even remember what you did?

201
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,710
You deceived Se Chan and me.

202
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,710
Do you not remember that?

203
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,880
- It wasn't just one time. - Now that it's the year 2026,

204
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,510
I'm going to be sincere today.

205
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,810
- You're lying. - Forget it.

206
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,780
- You're lying. - Forget it. My goodness.

207
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,280
(Betrayal Kwon sets up the bait again.)

208
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,920
- I don't believe her. - All right.

209
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,120
Trust me this time.

210
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,750
- Your voice is annoying. - Trust me once.

211
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,320
- You should say you're pissed. - So annoying.

212
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Should I say that?

213
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,360
- Pissed. - I'm pissed.

214
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,190
(All of a sudden)

215
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,430
Congratulations on your wedding.

216
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,160
After all this time?

217
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,600
Haven't we seen each other since my wedding?

218
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,500
I guess we aren't that close.

219
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,930
I see.

220
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,670
- I haven't seen her in a while. - Her voice is annoying.

221
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,700
I know.

222
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,140
(From the start, she takes full control of the guys.)

223
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,910
- Her nonchalant voice. - Good.

224
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,610
Today, to celebrate the orientation of the entering class of 2026...

225
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,570
(Today's race will be with Eun Bi.)

226
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,310
at Running University,

227
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,950
we've prepared the Lucky 2026 Orientation Day Race.

228
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,480
There'll be a big event...

229
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,180
- at the end of the orientation. - What?

230
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
We will hold the Lucky Face Lottery drawing,

231
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,490
(In order to greet the new students,)

232
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,420
which is advantageous to those with good luck.

233
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,490
(they will hold the Lucky Face Lottery drawing.)

234
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,060
- Face Lottery? - Yes.

235
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,860
- Only the unlucky ones are here. - It's a kind of lottery,

236
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,230
and it will be a lottery drawing.

237
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,460
(Instead of the number balls, their faces will be on the balls.)

238
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,230
But instead of numbers,

239
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,530
- we use faces. - Really?

240
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,070
There are Face Balls like these.

241
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,200
(There will be 8 different Face Balls.)

242
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,300
We'll collect these Face Balls through missions.

243
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,300
(The 8 different Face Balls will be added into the lottery box.)

244
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,640
- Face Balls? - So, at the end of the race,

245
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,710
(They will draw the final 5.)

246
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,710
- we'll draw five Face Balls. - Okay.

247
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,140
If you guess all five faces correctly,

248
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,010
(If they guess all 5, they win 1st place.)

249
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,080
you win first place...

250
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,180
and receive Onnuri gift certificates.

251
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,280
Onnuri gift certificates? It's as good as cash.

252
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,490
If you get four faces right, you get a pork set.

253
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,950
(Guess 4 right, which is 2nd place, and they will get a pork set.)

254
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,620
- Nice. - I love it.

255
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,590
If you get three faces right, you get body cream.

256
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,260
(Guess 3 right, which is 3nd place, and they will get body cream.)

257
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,890
- Body cream! - Body cream!

258
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,130
- It's Jong Kook's favorite. - I like body cream!

259
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,760
The members who fail to guess them correctly...

260
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,230
- will get a penalty. - Penalty?

261
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,100
(Those who get under 3 will all get a penalty.)

262
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,030
You'll get a penalty.

263
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,030
Hey, you should join me.

264
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,830
- Eun Bi steps up right away. - "You should join me."

265
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,670
So,

266
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,210
this is a race where your luck is important.

267
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,810
- Right. - We'll give you each an item...

268
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,040
- that will bring you good luck. - Okay.

269
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,180
It's not good if you get lucky with small things.

270
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,810
- Right. - We should get a big one.

271
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,880
It won't bring you big luck.

272
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,890
- What is this? - What is this? A golden turtle?

273
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,820
(The 8 lucky items that all look different)

274
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,990
I'll take this one.

275
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,390
Can I pick this?

276
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,690
You have to choose very carefully.

277
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,460
- Can we play rock-paper-scissors? - Let's do that.

278
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,960
- You can pick first. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

279
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,660
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Pick first.

280
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,960
I'll just pick this.

281
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,230
- I'll have what's left. - No.

282
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,630
(Swarming in)

283
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,600
- Go ahead. - The lucky bag.

284
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,930
- We should pick carefully. - I'll have what's left.

285
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,270
(Switching)

286
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,570
Hang on. Hey.

287
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,110
Hang on. Hey.

288
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,040
(Switching)

289
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,380
You congratulated me on my wedding.

290
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,440
I want the red one.

291
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,640
You congratulated me.

292
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,080
(Switching again)

293
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,480
- Why... - I think red...

294
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,550
(He got the yellow lucky bag.)

295
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,150
- brings me good luck. - Okay. It's all right.

296
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
- What is this? - Are you done picking your item?

297
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,680
- Is this it? - Yes.

298
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,090
Each item has a different meaning.

299
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,150
- Really? - I see.

300
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,960
Can we switch this later?

301
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,820
You can't switch it once you pick one.

302
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,490
(They cannot trade the items.)

303
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,160
- I like the gold color. - It's good.

304
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,260
- So, it's fixed. - Okay!

305
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,790
- I don't like this. - I got money.

306
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,600
(What is the secret behind the 8 lucky items?)

307
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,530
- That's the worst. - I know.

308
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,300
The green one is the worst.

309
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,630
I think we're doing something here.

310
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,870
(The new students gather around after getting changed.)

311
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,340
Okay. What is this?

312
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,670
This is nice.

313
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,670
Why is this here?

314
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,870
- Can I eat a mandarin? - What is this?

315
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,670
(A grill?)

316
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,370
- Pork belly. - Meat?

317
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,810
We have ramyeon here.

318
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,810
(There is ramyeon and a grill to grill meat.)

319
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,210
We have a lot of food here.

320
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,980
Why are we getting food?

321
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,850
(And also a refrigerator full of ingredients.)

322
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,620
- Are we eating? - This is an orientation.

323
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,250
(Is it food for the Running University orientation?)

324
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,080
- I want to eat ramyeon. - Me too.

325
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,220
Me too.

326
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,750
- Pork belly. - Meat?

327
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,220
- Can we eat? - You can eat.

328
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,020
(Writer)

329
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,290
- Really? - Can we eat?

330
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,960
- Right away? - Are we getting food?

331
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,390
- Don't eat it. - What's this?

332
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,760
(They get suspicious of the food that was given to them easily.)

333
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,530
- Don't eat. - Are we getting food?

334
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,090
Whatever. I'll eat some.

335
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,300
I'll have a mandarin.

336
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,930
(Staring)

337
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,800
I don't think I can eat it.

338
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,440
(Food Fighter turns down the food.)

339
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,400
I won't eat.

340
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,870
We have chicken breasts here.

341
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,070
(While everyone is busy looking at the food...)

342
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,470
- We have pork belly. - Frozen pork belly.

343
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,740
- We have frozen pork belly too. - By the way, what...

344
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,880
(A cellphone starts to ring.)

345
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,410
- I... - I didn't eat.

346
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,710
- I didn't eat. - Hello?

347
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,750
- What? Yes. - What was that?

348
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,480
- What? - Did you curse?

349
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,780
- Yes. - It's a praise.

350
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,620
Jong Kook is answering his phone.

351
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,220
Jong Kook is answering his phone.

352
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,060
(Jong Kook suddenly answers his phone during the shoot?)

353
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,160
Why are you calling me? I'm in the middle of a shoot.

354
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,460
Who is he talking to on the phone during the shoot?

355
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,060
- Well... - What?

356
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,130
- I suddenly got a call. - Why did you answer?

357
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,130
- Where are you going? - I'm sorry,

358
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,600
but I can't join the shoot for the moment.

359
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,740
- I need to answer the phone. - What?

360
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,970
Something's going on.

361
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,740
(He leaves the set?)

362
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,510
- It's a mission. - It's a mission.

363
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,540
- Hey. - What is it?

364
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,010
Why are you answering the phone while working?

365
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,580
(Baffled)

366
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,110
Where are you going in the middle of a shoot?

367
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,810
Why are you doing a mission in such an obvious way?

368
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,110
(What is it?)

369
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,310
Where are you going in the middle of a shoot?

370
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,380
It's a mission.

371
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,380
The phone... Wait. I should keep my phone with me.

372
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,020
I might get a call.

373
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,890
We will continue once Jong Kook comes back.

374
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,960
- What? - What?

375
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,160
What is he doing now?

376
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,330
- Let him return his pay. - It's a mission.

377
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,830
Haha, are you going to leave Jong Kook alone?

378
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,500
(It's strange that Jong Kook suddenly left.)

379
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,800
- Ji Hyo, today... - Do you want to go see?

380
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,960
Aren't you curious?

381
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,970
- Go. - You should go.

382
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,430
- Let's go. - Let's go and see.

383
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,740
Even if they go,

384
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,300
(Haha and Se Chan follow behind the suspicious action.)

385
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,870
- they can't do anything. - Eun Bi, come with us.

386
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,510
- What do we do? - It's strange.

387
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,110
(Eun Bi joins the squad.)

388
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,810
- This makes no sense. - Why is he being like this?

389
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,040
- I'm curious. - He doesn't...

390
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,840
(Jong Kook is acting differently.)

391
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,050
- usually take calls while working. - I know.

392
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,480
(Is something really up?)

393
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,650
- It's really strange. - I'm really surprised.

394
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,880
What on earth is he doing?

395
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,090
He's gone.

396
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,120
(They can't find Jong Kook anywhere.)

397
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,090
What?

398
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,320
He's probably talking to his wife.

399
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,520
Come here, Eun Bi.

400
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,500
(Se Chan found something?)

401
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,530
Is he there?

402
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,360
What are you doing, Jong Kook?

403
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,470
(They enter a small room in the corner.)

404
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,970
- What are you doing? - What's going on?

405
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,400
What are you doing here?

406
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,170
What on earth is he doing?

407
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,170
(What is happening?)

408
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,570
They're back. What?

409
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,470
- What was he doing? - You drew something?

410
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,210
- What? - What's that?

411
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,180
(They suddenly put on makeup?)

412
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,680
I bet Se Chan came up with something.

413
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,150
- They are... - They are plotting something.

414
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,220
(Even Eun Bi shows up with makeup for a skit.)

415
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
Something's going on.

416
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,020
What did they do?

417
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,680
Something's going on.

418
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,490
- They make it look like a mission. - It's a mission.

419
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,050
- They offer some service. - There's nothing.

420
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,420
- Have a seat. - Something happened.

421
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,030
- We should do the mission. - I bet Se Chan did this.

422
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,130
- It's Se Chan. - That's what Se Chan would do.

423
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,000
(Anyone can tell that Se Chan did it.)

424
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,700
- Se Chan drew it. - All right.

425
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,660
Those who work hard get good luck.

426
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,070
- Happy New Year! - Happy New Year!

427
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,040
- They're just doing it. - Right.

428
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,610
- I wonder what it is. - It's nothing.

429
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,270
- It's nothing. - Do you think...

430
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,410
- I'm doing this for nothing? - Eun Bi.

431
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,680
- Of course. - No.

432
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,580
- No. - I do things only for a reason.

433
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,410
- I'm sure... - She's faking this.

434
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,550
(He won't believe it.)

435
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,580
- It's fake, isn't it? - Yes.

436
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,980
(Is she just pretending to have a mission?)

437
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,220
- Hey. - Se Chan must've done this.

438
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,190
- I'm curious. - What's going on?

439
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,950
(Or is she really carrying out a mission?)

440
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,320
- What? - What did you do?

441
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,460
(While the squad has their mouths closed...)

442
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,860
What is it? I'm curious.

443
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,730
What?

444
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,730
- What's with Kim Jong Kook? - Hey, what's with him?

445
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,300
- What's that? - I'm so surprised.

446
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,870
- What's that? - What's with him?

447
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,230
- He's crazy. - What is he doing?

448
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,500
- What's that? - I'm so surprised.

449
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,970
- What's that? - What's with him?

450
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,370
(Jong Kook suddenly turned into a dog?)

451
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,410
- He's crazy. - What is he doing?

452
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,840
He looks cute.

453
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,850
(They are too stunned at his visuals to say anything.)

454
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,680
- What's that? - What?

455
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,450
- He's crazy. - What is he doing?

456
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,850
Jong Kook...

457
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,580
(Panting)

458
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,750
- It's creepy. - Hey.

459
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,990
He's scary.

460
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,890
- It's creepy. - Hey.

461
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,150
(Stunned)

462
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,260
What's that?

463
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,860
(They all avoid him due to his creepy looks.)

464
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,320
What's wrong with him?

465
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,090
- What is he doing? - Scratch his belly.

466
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,960
- There you go. - You puppy.

467
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,900
(The muscular puppy rolls over and acts cute.)

468
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,230
- Give me your hand. - All right.

469
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,560
- What's going on? - Good boy.

470
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,600
(Petting)

471
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,670
- Good boy. - What's this?

472
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,970
(Hotteok's mom gives him some love.)

473
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,470
- What's going on? - Good boy.

474
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,770
- Why is he being like this? - What?

475
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,270
Why is he doing this?

476
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,970
(They are confused by the sudden transformation.)

477
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,070
- What is he doing? - What is going on?

478
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,470
- What's all this? - Why...

479
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,210
I think we should stop him.

480
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,580
It's a mission.

481
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,810
- Good boy. - Stop him.

482
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,920
(The reconnaissance team suddenly surrounds Dog Jong Kook.)

483
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,880
Jong Kook.

484
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,220
What are you doing?

485
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,890
- Why are you being like this? - What are you doing?

486
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,720
(They have him by the arms so that he can't move.)

487
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,390
- What is it? - I don't know.

488
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,760
- What's with him? - What's this?

489
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,590
I can't help but say it's creepy.

490
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,890
(Glaring)

491
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,430
- He's scary. - Give me your hand.

492
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,460
- Hand. - Don't do it.

493
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,990
(Handing)

494
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,830
- He's good. - I'm scared.

495
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,130
(Doggy Kook listens well.)

496
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,830
- Why are you doing this? - All right.

497
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,360
Bang.

498
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,570
(He even does the bang?)

499
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,470
- Bang. - Bark.

500
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,370
Woof!

501
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
(Woof!)

502
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,770
- What was that? - Is he really doing that?

503
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,840
Woof.

504
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,570
This is a mission.

505
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,480
We shouldn't be doing this for him.

506
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,710
It's a mission.

507
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,710
- Don't do anything. - We shouldn't do this for him?

508
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,210
(They are sure that it's a mission since Jong Kook participates.)

509
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,450
There must be a mission.

510
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,750
Jong Kook succeeded.

511
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,520
- See? - What?

512
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,020
Jong Kook succeeded.

513
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,220
(Jong Kook succeeded in his mission?)

514
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,850
- See? - What?

515
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,020
See?

516
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,420
- What? - It was his mission?

517
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,390
(Was it really a hidden mission?)

518
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,290
I said we shouldn't do this.

519
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,160
Why did you do that for him?

520
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,960
We didn't do anything. We just got here.

521
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,360
I think it was scratching his belly.

522
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,700
Is it the belly thing?

523
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,930
(What was the mission that he succeeded?)

524
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,430
Was he supposed to make us say he's cute?

525
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,800
I got this.

526
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,070
(After he picked his lucky item during the opening)

527
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,300
I didn't pick it.

528
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,970
- Eun Bi switched hers with mine. - Right.

529
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,670
After the mess, I just got what was left.

530
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,110
(Jong Kook chose the yellow lucky bag.)

531
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,980
(A message that came with the item)

532
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,110
What is this?

533
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,850
(You are unlucky!)

534
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,150
"You must complete the following mission..."

535
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,310
(You must complete the following mission...)

536
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,450
"to receive a lottery ticket."

537
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,750
(to receive a lottery ticket.)

538
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,290
- I'll just pick this. - I'll have what's left.

539
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,420
(The item Jong Kook picked had a hidden mission.)

540
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,420
Go ahead.

541
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,260
At the end of the orientation,

542
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,290
(He has to complete it to get a lottery ticket.)

543
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,890
we will hold the Lucky Face Lottery drawing.

544
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,060
- Face Lottery? - Face Lottery?

545
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,330
"To receive a lottery ticket."

546
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,860
(Dress up as a dog and be loved by 2 members like a puppy.)

547
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,800
(Have them scratch your belly and your chin while adoring you.)

548
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,830
"Dress up as a dog and be loved by 2 members like a puppy."

549
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,130
(Jong Kook Mission)

550
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,800
"Have them scratch your belly and your chin while adoring you."

551
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,670
"In Vietnamese custom, the word 'giau,' meaning wealth,"

552
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,040
(Dress up as a dog and be loved by 2 members like a puppy.)

553
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,010
(In Vietnamese custom, the word 'giau,' meaning wealth,)

554
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,180
"is similar to the barking sound of a dog,"

555
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,880
(is similar to the barking sound of a dog,)

556
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,210
(so it is believed that if a dog enters your house in the New Year,)

557
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,940
"so it is believed that if a dog enters your house in the New Year,"

558
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,380
"it will bring good luck and prosperity."

559
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,110
(it will bring good luck and prosperity.)

560
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,520
Why do I have to do this?

561
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,350
(If he gets loved as a dog, the mission is complete.)

562
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,490
Okay. I'm actually good...

563
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,120
(Confident)

564
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,990
at acting cute and getting loved.

565
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,160
- We have frozen pork belly too. - I didn't eat.

566
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,290
(That's how Jong Kook got the hidden mission.)

567
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,430
- Hello? - Jong Kook.

568
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,600
You can come out to the hallway and put on a dog costume now.

569
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,100
(He heads to the makeup room that the crew told him about.)

570
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,430
I have to get changed here?

571
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,710
I have to look as cute as possible...

572
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,870
to be loved by the members.

573
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,410
My goodness.

574
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,010
(Muttering)

575
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,610
This is nice.

576
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,710
Gosh, this is thick.

577
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,020
(He tries hard, blowing air into his cheeks.)

578
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,450
I look cute.

579
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,150
(Where?)

580
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,520
Are there other members who are doing the mission besides me?

581
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,120
- Hang on. - What are you doing?

582
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,830
- What are you doing here? - Why all of a sudden?

583
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,860
Why are you here?

584
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,700
(The reconnaissance team found Jong Kook getting dressed.)

585
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,960
- What are you doing? - What's going on?

586
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,060
- What is this? - Why are you here?

587
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,200
- Why are you putting on makeup? - Why did you come here?

588
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,530
What is he doing?

589
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,770
(Full of suspicion)

590
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,540
I should do this to get good luck.

591
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,270
(Being vague)

592
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,870
- It brings good luck. - What is it?

593
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,770
Is it something like, "It's a blessing to live as a dog?"

594
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,340
(Getting it wrong)

595
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,270
- Is that what you think? - Come here. I'll draw on you.

596
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,910
- With what? - I'll draw something simple.

597
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,480
(Eun Bi gets tempted by the promise of good luck.)

598
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,010
I don't think I should.

599
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,350
- I'll keep it simple. - No. Draw on yourself.

600
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,680
It'll look better on you two.

601
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,920
- Draw on yourself. - It'll suit you.

602
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,380
(Bickering)

603
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,050
- No, you. - Come here.

604
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,080
Why would I draw on my face?

605
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,120
- I'll suit you. - I'll keep it simple.

606
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,720
(Jong Kook concentrates on his own makeup.)

607
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,420
Why would I do this?

608
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,760
- Draw some snot. - Remember your original mindset.

609
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,360
(They somehow began drawing on their faces on their own.)

610
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,890
- Remember your original mindset. - That's important.

611
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,790
- Why am I doing this? - What she said is important.

612
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,130
- I love it. - Find your original mindset.

613
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,630
You look cute, Eun Bi.

614
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,630
- Really? - Yes.

615
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,660
Take a look.

616
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,630
(The reconnaissance team left without figuring anything out.)

617
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,270
- You look adorable. - You really look cute.

618
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,240
To look even cuter...

619
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,370
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook is busy trying to make himself look cute.)

620
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,670
(He puts on blush and lipstick.)

621
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,340
I need to look the cutest.

622
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,480
I look adorable.

623
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,510
(Transformed into Puppy Kook)

624
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,340
Nice.

625
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,380
(Trotting over to them, toes turned out)

626
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,650
Because I look absolutely adorable...

627
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,880
- What... - What's with him?

628
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,380
- What is he doing? - Scratch his tummy.

629
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,480
(Puppy Kook's fatal cuteness)

630
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,920
- Good boy! - Hey, it's a puppy.

631
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,060
(Seok Sam and Ji Hyo ran over right away.)

632
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,090
- Paw! - There you go.

633
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,560
(Dress up as a dog...)

634
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,820
- Good boy. - Nice.

635
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,190
(and be loved by 2 members like a puppy.)

636
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,560
Jong Kook, you succeeded.

637
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,000
(Jong Kook succeeds in the mission.)

638
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,860
See?

639
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,100
- What was it? - Was that his mission?

640
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,060
You shouldn't have played along.

641
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,270
They couldn't resist my cuteness.

642
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,200
(Jong Kook wins a lottery ticket.)

643
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,110
(Did anyone else get a mission?)

644
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,070
What now? Is it over, then?

645
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,410
Is Jong Kook done with his mission?

646
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,840
- What was he successful at? - That's right.

647
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,050
- I was told I was unlucky. - We can't tell you that just yet.

648
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,650
- I get it. - What was he successful at?

649
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,080
- We should've stopped him. - We should've stopped him.

650
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,420
(So that he fails.)

651
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,990
- We shouldn't have played into it. - I was too cute...

652
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,250
for you to resist.

653
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,890
I said it was eerie.

654
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,820
- I said that too. - I said he looked scary.

655
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,030
- Seriously. - After receiving this mission,

656
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,460
I couldn't get why this was a challenge.

657
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,360
It's not like I had to work for it.

658
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,260
(It was so easy.)

659
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,160
Mrs. Kim would probably find this adorable.

660
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,530
Who are you calling Mrs. Kim?

661
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,300
(She can be funny.)

662
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,300
Who are you calling Mrs. Kim, you brat?

663
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,040
You'll continue on the next mission dressed as a dog.

664
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,780
(He will go on with the first mission dressed like a dog.)

665
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,440
Please call me a puppy, not a dog.

666
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,110
- Why would you call me a dog? - A dog.

667
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,110
We'll start with the first session of today's orientation.

668
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,450
(Period 4, Face Lottery Draw)

669
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,250
This will help build teamwork.

670
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,250
(Period 1, Teamwork Building)

671
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,220
Draw the Adjective.

672
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,450
(2026 Lucky Day Orientation Day, Draw the Adjective)

673
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,690
Draw the Adjective?

674
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,420
Yes, you'll be split into two teams...

675
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,460
and compete against each other.

676
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,620
- Really? - Got it.

677
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,130
Three members from one team...

678
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,030
will hear the adjective we give you...

679
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,160
(Adjective?)

680
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,430
and draw something to express it.

681
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,130
(The 3 members will draw for 7 seconds...)

682
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,430
Let's say the word was "pretty."

683
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,700
(after seeing the adjective keyword.)

684
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,070
- The three will draw... - Like a flower.

685
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,670
- what they think represents it. - Exactly.

686
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,910
- Right, an adjective. - The remaining player...

687
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,210
(The remaining member will guess the adjective.)

688
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,040
will try to guess the word.

689
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,310
There are a few people who don't know what adjectives are.

690
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,580
I only have four fingers.

691
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,810
Please tell us...

692
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,580
how adjectives are defined these days.

693
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,790
Each team will try to guess three words.

694
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,490
The team that guesses more will win,

695
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,020
and the winning team...

696
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,360
will be given a benefit that'll up their chances...

697
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,190
- of winning the lottery. - Okay.

698
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,760
- The lottery. - Sort yourselves into two teams...

699
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,800
as you see fit.

700
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,700
- Are you good at drawing? - I draw just fine.

701
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,470
- I don't trust you. - She can't be trusted.

702
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,730
- You can't trust her. - Hold on.

703
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,770
(They can't trust the tiger moth.)

704
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,800
The guesser should be someone who knows what adjectives are.

705
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,910
(Writer)

706
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,840
Exactly! Adjectives...

707
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,140
- Ma'am! - Of course.

708
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,410
(Upset)

709
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,910
"Smooth." I know what adjectives are.

710
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,950
- Flat and even. - Smooth.

711
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,580
(The trend will end here.)

712
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,310
Smooth. I know what it is.

713
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,680
Uneven and bumpy.

714
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,780
We should be on different teams.

715
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,980
- We... - Meanwhile, Jong Kook and...

716
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,520
(After splitting the teams...)

717
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,490
Haha and Jong Kook should be on different teams.

718
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,730
(Teams: Team Jae Seok, Team Jong Kook)

719
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,250
We have to guess the adjective.

720
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,520
- Smooth. - Smooth.

721
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,760
Flat and even.

722
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,390
After we give you the word,

723
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,000
(Team Jae Seok will go first.)

724
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,460
you'll have seven seconds.

725
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,530
- What? That's not enough. - Seven seconds?

726
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,430
You'll have seven seconds to draw.

727
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,300
- Seven seconds. - Jae Seok, who will guess the word,

728
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,900
- will keep his eyes closed. - I'll close my eyes.

729
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,100
(The one guessing will close his eyes and wait.)

730
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,600
We'll begin if you're ready.

731
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,180
(Which adjective will they get?)

732
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,240
It's difficult to draw adjectives.

733
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,380
- Exactly. - How do you draw adjectives?

734
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,480
Here's your word.

735
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,610
(The first question)

736
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,710
Ready, go.

737
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,920
(Adjective: Scary)

738
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,320
Seven, six...

739
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
five, four...

740
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,350
(Seok Sam immediately begins to draw.)

741
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,250
Six, five...

742
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,090
- four, three... - What's that?

743
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,220
(Her pen looks lost.)

744
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,030
Six, five, four...

745
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,930
(Why is he wearing that expression?)

746
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,700
Three.

747
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,700
Two, one.

748
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,400
(How did they express the word "scary?")

749
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,970
- They did great. - Can I look?

750
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,300
(The 7 seconds are up.)

751
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,770
- Go? - Time's up.

752
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,040
- Can I look? - Yes.

753
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,810
What's that?

754
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,840
- What's that? - Show us your drawing.

755
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,980
What on earth is that?

756
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,380
(The drawings could mean anything.)

757
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,980
Wait, that's awesome!

758
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,980
- Haha's great at drawing. - Right.

759
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,320
(Adjective: Scary)

760
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,950
- Look. - Wait, that's awesome!

761
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,690
- You get it, right? - Right.

762
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,220
(Artist Ha pays homage to "The Scream" by Munch.)

763
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,820
What on earth is that?

764
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,290
(Jae Seok recognizes it.)

765
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,120
You get it, right?

766
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,690
You know what it is.

767
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,960
(Are they enough for him to guess the adjective?)

768
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,330
You get it, right?

769
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,630
Let me answer.

770
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,130
Scary!

771
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,830
Scary!

772
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,700
That is correct.

773
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,940
(He got it right on his first attempt!)

774
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,470
- Didn't I do great? - You did.

775
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,910
(Key player Haha's drawing was crucial.)

776
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,470
- Didn't I do great? - Nicely done.

777
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,880
You got it, right? I did great.

778
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,680
How is that scary?

779
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,180
- I was going to draw "The Scream." - You should draw the action.

780
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,350
I was going to draw "The Scream,"

781
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,050
but the hands turned into ears.

782
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,690
- Here's the next one. - I'll guess it.

783
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,420
(Haha will guess the next one.)

784
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,050
I'll guess the next one.

785
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,460
It'll be tough since they're all bad at drawing.

786
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,390
(You're right!)

787
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,030
It'll be tough since they're all bad at drawing.

788
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,370
(They're all bad at drawing, and that's worrying.)

789
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,500
- I guess it's easier for dogs... - Here we go.

790
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,470
(Noticing something)

791
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,430
- to sit that way. - Right.

792
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,170
- Dogs... - What you wear...

793
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,870
(Puppy Kook is on the floor.)

794
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,610
- can change you. - Right?

795
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,640
- A difference in attitude. - It changes you.

796
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,710
I'm acting differently.

797
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,910
- Please close your eyes. - Sure.

798
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,640
(The second question)

799
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,080
Here's your word.

800
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,550
- Seven, six... - How do I draw this?

801
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,610
(Adjective: Brave)

802
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,710
- Seven, six... - How do I draw this?

803
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,750
(It is a bit difficult to draw.)

804
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,350
- Seven, six... - How can you draw this?

805
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,220
- Six, five... - Draw the main idea of the word.

806
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,460
- Five, four... - What do I do?

807
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,860
(Seok Sam just starts to draw.)

808
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,060
- Hold on. - Draw the main idea of the word.

809
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,190
(The two bad drawers are scrambling.)

810
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,760
How are we supposed to draw this?

811
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,760
- Help me get a syllable then. - One!

812
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,800
- Your time's up. - This is the feeling of the word.

813
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,030
(How did the three of them express the word "brave?")

814
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,170
- Darn. - Your time's up.

815
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,400
(Adjective: Brave)

816
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,830
- Help me get a syllable then. - This is the feeling of the word.

817
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,900
This is how the word feels.

818
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,140
(Is that an ax?)

819
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,310
I can't say I did a good job.

820
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,070
- What... - What's that?

821
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,470
(At that moment...)

822
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,980
- Jae Seok's drawing is no joke. - What's that?

823
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:13,450
(Adjective: Brave)

824
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,710
- Here. - This is how the word feels.

825
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,480
I can't say I did a good job.

826
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,980
- Jae Seok's drawing is no joke. - What's that?

827
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,890
It feels...

828
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,020
- What's that? - What on earth is that?

829
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,490
- No way. - Isn't that a live hairtail?

830
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,960
Isn't that a live hairtail?

831
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
(A live hairtail?)

832
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,590
- Hey! - That's a gondola.

833
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,560
(A gondola?)

834
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,830
What on earth is that?

835
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,160
(It's hard to pinpoint the artist's intention.)

836
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,030
Jae Seok's drawing is no joke.

837
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,360
Isn't that a live hairtail?

838
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,830
(He gets it.)

839
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,470
- Is that allowed? - Hey!

840
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,300
- That's what we can do. - Only look at this.

841
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,330
(Changing his stance)

842
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,340
- This is how it feels. - I'll draw mine like that.

843
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,100
He drew a dragon and a persimmon.

844
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,410
He drew a dragon and a persimmon.

845
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,440
(What Jae seok drew)

846
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,580
(Dragon)

847
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,210
Jae Seok's drawing is no joke.

848
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,710
(Persimmon)

849
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,310
Hey, don't look at theirs. Only look at mine.

850
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,720
This is how it feels.

851
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,980
(Seok Sam didn't get Jae Seok's trick.)

852
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,020
- Yes, this feels like the word. - We didn't have enough time.

853
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,420
- We all did great. - Right?

854
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,650
Mine provides a lot of clues too.

855
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,760
- Don't look at his. - Don't look at his.

856
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,920
(Focusing only on Seok Sam's drawing)

857
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,130
Angry, shouting,

858
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,460
persuading.

859
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,860
- They're not the same size. - They're different sizes.

860
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,600
- What? - They're different sizes.

861
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,470
- Hey! - He's rebelling.

862
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,640
- Wait. - Five,

863
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,200
- four. - Look at this.

864
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,470
- Hey! - He's rebelling.

865
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,040
(Puppy Jong Kook starts counting down.)

866
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,410
- Two! - Rebelling against a senior.

867
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,280
(He needs to answer now.)

868
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,680
- One! - Wait.

869
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,780
Rebelling!

870
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,280
- Incorrect. - What?

871
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,310
Rebelling!

872
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,750
- Incorrect. - Is that an adjective?

873
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,480
- Darn. It's "brave." - It's brave.

874
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,820
How is "rebelling" an adjective?

875
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,020
(Haha doesn't seem to know what an adjective is.)

876
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,390
- Rebelling. - Look.

877
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,950
This is a dragon and a persimmon.

878
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,420
Are you kidding me?

879
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,290
(He finally gets it.)

880
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,090
- Brave. - A dragon and a persimmon!

881
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,690
How is that a dragon?

882
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,800
(His drawing skills didn't live up to his trick.)

883
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,100
Jae Seok, that's not good at all.

884
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,600
I should be one of the people to draw.

885
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,870
Exactly.

886
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,140
(The ace, Artist Ha, returns to the drawing zone.)

887
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,800
I'm not good at drawing so...

888
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,900
Yours was easier to figure out.

889
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,370
- A dragon and a persimmon. - That was better.

890
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,370
It was easy to guess.

891
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,610
Here's the next word.

892
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,380
(Last question for Team Jae Seok)

893
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,540
- It'll be your last one. - Sure.

894
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,680
Ready, go.

895
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,050
(Adjective)

896
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,250
Seven...

897
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,080
(Drawing)

898
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,250
Is it gimbap?

899
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,450
(Is Ye Eun drawing gimbap?)

900
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,490
Three, two, one.

901
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,890
(Seok Sam's drawing is completely different.)

902
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,820
Time's up. That's enough.

903
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,890
- That's enough. - Stop!

904
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,760
- I need to draw some feet. - Stop!

905
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,330
(The puppy next door plops itself next to him.)

906
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,800
- Who do you think you are? - Here!

907
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,160
- Here. - Don't look at mine.

908
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,730
- Look at hers. - Look at mine.

909
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,030
- Look at mine. - Look at hers.

910
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,570
(What is the key point to Ddochi's drawing?)

911
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,300
- Let's see. - She did it justice.

912
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,600
Ye Eun got it right.

913
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,370
No, look at mine.

914
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,740
- What's that? - This isn't easy.

915
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,040
Look at both Ye Eun's and Seok Jin's.

916
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,880
(Seok Jin, Ye Eun)

917
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,380
What's that?

918
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,780
Look at both of ours.

919
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,410
I'm clueless.

920
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,780
(Guessing along)

921
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,410
Don't you get it?

922
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,980
- Mine's right. - What's that black thing?

923
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,680
(These two combined will be the answer?)

924
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,080
What's that?

925
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,350
What's that black thing?

926
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,320
Don't mouth the word to him. Keep your mouths shut.

927
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,490
Hold on.

928
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,620
What kind of dog is that arrogant?

929
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,230
These are arms.

930
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,960
- Don't you dare. - Jae Seok, what's the word?

931
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,000
(Adjective)

932
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Thick.

933
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,830
Thick.

934
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
(Is that the correct answer?)

935
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,800
- That is correct. - Okay!

936
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,870
(It is correct!)

937
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,340
- How did you get it? - How did you know?

938
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:53,840
(Adjective: Thick)

939
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,640
- Didn't I do great? - Nice.

940
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,940
Thick arms.

941
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,010
- Thick. - Thick arms.

942
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,250
How did he get that?

943
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,150
From a thin line,

944
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,380
(The line is thicker.)

945
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,420
- it got thicker. - That's it.

946
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,750
- The arms were thick. - The arms.

947
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,250
(It was the arms.)

948
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,880
Thick arms.

949
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,320
How did he get it?

950
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,590
(With their sharp observations,)

951
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,250
Team Jae Seok guessed two words correctly.

952
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,220
(Team Jae Seok got 2 correct.)

953
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,190
- Good job. You guys did great. - Nicely done.

954
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,720
- Great job. - Ye Eun did great.

955
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,330
(The bad drawers did quite well.)

956
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,490
- Didn't I do great? - That was so smart of him.

957
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,730
Jong Kook, you need to be the one to draw.

958
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,860
Go ahead for now.

959
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,930
I'll guess the word.

960
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,100
I think we'll do great.

961
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,530
(Puppy Kook wants to guess.)

962
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,300
- Let's do this. - Let's do a good job.

963
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,440
Can he guess correctly when he has the brain of a dog?

964
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,670
Seriously? A brain of a dog?

965
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,010
- Dumb like a dog. - Dogs are smart.

966
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,780
(Confident)

967
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,480
- Yes, they're smart. - They understand words...

968
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,780
- and simple commands. - Good.

969
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,080
- Let's go. - Let's do this.

970
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,510
(Just then)

971
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,380
Let's do this.

972
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:33,220
(You can hear a phone vibrating.)

973
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,150
Is that someone's phone?

974
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,590
(Everyone checks their phones.)

975
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,020
- Hello? - What?

976
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,320
She answered her phone. Is she going to leave too?

977
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,430
We won't be able to play the game then.

978
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,960
Why is she answering her phone?

979
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,960
(She takes the phone call without excusing herself.)

980
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,930
- Sure. - What?

981
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,970
What are we supposed to do when people take phone calls...

982
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,970
without putting the phone on speaker?

983
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,370
Can't you tell us to just leave?

984
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,740
(At this rate)

985
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,570
What on earth is this?

986
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,710
What is Eun Bi doing?

987
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,570
(What is going on?)

988
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,140
Eun Bi.

989
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,980
I'll see you later, Mom.

990
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,240
Was that your mom?

991
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,580
You don't have your mom's number saved.

992
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,150
Was that your mom? You took a call from her...

993
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,280
while filming?

994
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,620
Eun Bi...

995
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,580
(What was the call about?)

996
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,250
- Three? - Are you supposed...

997
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,850
to make us lose this game?

998
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,920
(The mission)

999
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,920
Of course not, Ji Hyo.

1000
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,860
That's not true. You have to believe me.

1001
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,360
- Sure. - What?

1002
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,990
(Just then)

1003
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,090
- Sure. - What?

1004
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,090
(Ring)

1005
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,460
What's that?

1006
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,500
- Hey! - What now?

1007
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,560
(Suddenly, a bell chimes.)

1008
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,230
Don't react to it.

1009
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,400
(Tense)

1010
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,830
- Stay still. - Don't react to it.

1011
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,700
What's that?

1012
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,570
- What? - Don't react to it.

1013
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,640
(Scared)

1014
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,270
What?

1015
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,280
(Why did Eun Bi suddenly pick on Ssaebssaeb?)

1016
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,310
- Don't be intimidated. - What happened?

1017
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,610
What's going on?

1018
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,840
Hurry up.

1019
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,310
(Standing up)

1020
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,280
What's going on?

1021
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,620
(She heads somewhere instead of playing the game.)

1022
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,280
- What's going on? - What's going on?

1023
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,820
She's doing a mission.

1024
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,750
Don't be intimidated.

1025
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,790
(Whack)

1026
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,320
What mission...

1027
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,330
(She picked on the dog.)

1028
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,790
I'll pretend to like it.

1029
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,690
(And then...)

1030
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,630
I'll pretend to like it.

1031
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,530
(Stuffing her face with a mandarin)

1032
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,530
She's acting suspiciously.

1033
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,230
- What's she doing? - Shouldn't we stop her?

1034
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,200
Or should we eat as well?

1035
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
What's she doing?

1036
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,610
(As well as a mandarin, she eats some snacks too.)

1037
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,710
- What is she doing? - What's she doing?

1038
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,870
What's she doing?

1039
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,710
I noticed that she picked on you and then me.

1040
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,250
(Guess 1: Picking fights with everyone)

1041
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,980
She must do something when the bell rings.

1042
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,380
- What's that? - What's that?

1043
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,420
She must get scolded.

1044
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:16,150
(Guess 2: Getting yelled at by someone)

1045
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,920
- A scolding. - Let's praise her.

1046
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,450
- Praise her. - Oh, you're doing so well!

1047
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,690
(Rummaging)

1048
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,460
Shouldn't we stop her from eating?

1049
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,290
(She is doing something that makes them want to slap her.)

1050
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,320
You're eating so well.

1051
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,060
I bet she needs someone to ask for a piece of something to eat.

1052
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,060
(Guess 3: Make someone say, "Give me some")

1053
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,730
- "Give me some." - No, she needs praise.

1054
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,370
- She wants us to be angry. - To get angry?

1055
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,670
(Standing still)

1056
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,470
- Eun Bi. - She looked at them desperately.

1057
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,470
(She's eating just as well as Ha Jung Woo.)

1058
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,210
Go get your instructions.

1059
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,110
Eun Bi. Shall we sit down so we can play a game?

1060
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,780
(The bell has finally stopped ringing.)

1061
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,480
- It looks like she failed. - Eun Bi failed.

1062
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,780
(She returns to her seat after the bell stops ringing.)

1063
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,650
- I think something went wrong. - Let's play a game.

1064
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,810
What was the mission? I can't tell.

1065
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,850
(What was her hidden mission?)

1066
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,950
- Let's do this. - It's the next team's turn.

1067
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,920
- What was it about? - Let's do this mission.

1068
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,250
(Team Jong Kook carries out their mission.)

1069
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,720
Ready, go.

1070
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,490
(Keyword)

1071
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,020
Seven...

1072
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,020
(Glancing)

1073
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,230
Six, five,

1074
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,900
(Ssaebssaeb was inspired by someone.)

1075
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,960
four, three,

1076
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,960
two, one.

1077
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,800
(They show their drawings.)

1078
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,030
Okay!

1079
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,630
- All right. - It's easier than ours.

1080
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,640
- It's easy. - It's really easy.

1081
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,740
Oh, gosh...

1082
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,010
(Looks just like Big Nose)

1083
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,110
Don't test your options. Answer right away.

1084
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,010
Oh, gosh...

1085
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,380
Answer quickly.

1086
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,550
What's the answer?

1087
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,780
Oh, okay. I got it.

1088
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,350
I got it completely.

1089
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,390
- What is it? - The word describes Seok Jin.

1090
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,490
He's really sickly,

1091
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,230
and he's very... Like he'll die soon.

1092
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,490
(Hesitant)

1093
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,330
He's lying down.

1094
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,530
Why would you say I'll die soon?

1095
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,100
- What's the answer? - The answer is...

1096
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,800
(What's the keyword inspired by Seok Sam?)

1097
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,100
What is it?

1098
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,730
- Five, four, - Four,

1099
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,200
- three, two, - three, two,

1100
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,240
- Weak. - one.

1101
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,440
That's correct.

1102
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,170
(Correct)

1103
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,340
(Ticked off)

1104
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,640
You got it completely right!

1105
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,610
Hey! I almost went with "infirm!"

1106
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,750
- "Infirm." - Why did you draw Seok Jin?

1107
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,320
(The dog managed to get it right.)

1108
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,020
- He's infirm. - He's weak.

1109
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,250
- Switch now. - What for?

1110
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,680
(Switch the person who has to get the answer right.)

1111
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,450
- Switch. - Switch.

1112
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,750
- I can't draw! - Switch.

1113
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,150
- I can't draw. - Why can't you draw?

1114
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,160
I have four fingers!

1115
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,820
- Take turns! - Switch!

1116
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,630
- You, move. - That makes it fun.

1117
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:05,100
(The dog is so smart that he's kicked out.)

1118
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,190
- Good job. - Let the puppy play.

1119
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,960
- Switch. - I'll use my hunch.

1120
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,260
(Ssaebssaeb, who is less smart, will guess the answer now.)

1121
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,700
Jong Kook, I'll rely on my hunch.

1122
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,870
- Let's see how it goes. - Here's the next word.

1123
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,200
(They'll try to answer the 2nd question out of the 3 correctly.)

1124
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,840
Ready, go.

1125
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:18,710
(Keyword: Embarrassed)

1126
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,170
- Seven... - I think I can draw that easily.

1127
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,810
Like this.

1128
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,940
You can draw this face.

1129
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,180
- Stop. - The time's up.

1130
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,980
(The key is the rosy cheeks.)

1131
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,010
- That looks like... - Yes...

1132
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,150
She drew a drunkard.

1133
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,050
This means something happens to someone's face here.

1134
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,690
(He noticed that they're blushing.)

1135
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,450
The answer is "embarrassed."

1136
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,920
That's correct.

1137
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,690
(Team Jong Kook got 2 questions right.)

1138
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,190
Didn't I do well?

1139
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:37,160
(Praise me.)

1140
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,060
Didn't I do well?

1141
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:41,000
(With 1 question to go, they're tied with Team Jae Seok!)

1142
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,530
The two teams are tied right now.

1143
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,570
- Ji Hyo, you're up. - What?

1144
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,970
- Ji Hyo. - Let her have a go.

1145
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,200
- She should. - Let her play.

1146
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:48,170
(Let Ji Hyo answer!)

1147
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,040
- She should have a go. - She's a teammate too.

1148
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,240
- She should play. - Everyone should have a go.

1149
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,840
(He doesn't trust her.)

1150
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,970
- Ji Hyo can guess. - What's up with you, puppy?

1151
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,480
- She could get it right. - Sit down.

1152
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,710
(If she gets it right this time, Team Jong Kook will win.)

1153
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,440
- Let's try. I could get it too. - Sit down.

1154
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,650
- Why not? - Yes, she can do it too.

1155
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,480
Draw the most important part.

1156
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,580
(In the final round, Godmother of Empty Heads will guess the answer.)

1157
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,880
Okay, then. Ready, go.

1158
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,590
(Flustered)

1159
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,250
Seven,

1160
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,650
six,

1161
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,490
(Keyword: Feeling wronged)

1162
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,260
- What? - Seven, six,

1163
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:10,330
(It's a difficult adjective to express.)

1164
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,790
- five... - What is the word?

1165
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,230
- I missed it. I'll guess too. - I didn't see. I'll guess.

1166
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,360
Two, one.

1167
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,700
(Can they get this one right?)

1168
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,770
It's hard.

1169
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,270
(Very simple)

1170
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,530
It's right there.

1171
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,100
Shoot. It's hard.

1172
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,570
- It's hard. - It's right there.

1173
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,570
- Isn't it easy? - Isn't this really easy?

1174
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,010
(All of them drew crying faces.)

1175
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,880
It'll be a bit tough.

1176
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,210
- There are tears. - Yes.

1177
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,650
They're sad, and something feels unfair.

1178
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,250
Something feels unfair.

1179
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,320
It's so hard.

1180
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,150
(She touched on the answer.)

1181
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,320
Something feels unfair,

1182
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,250
but Se Chan drew something extra.

1183
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,390
He did.

1184
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,620
- There's some sorrow. - Yes.

1185
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,760
Are you reading a fortune?

1186
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,530
Are you reading a fortune?

1187
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,900
(Ji Hyo said the right answer, but chose to take the long way around.)

1188
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,830
What's the answer?

1189
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,630
It won't be "sad" because that is too simple an answer for that.

1190
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,970
(Will she get it right without feeling wronged?)

1191
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,700
- It won't be that. - Five,

1192
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,700
- four, three, - That's it.

1193
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,700
Feeling unfair.

1194
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,810
- That's correct. - You did it!

1195
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,680
(Including Ji Hyo, all of them got it right.)

1196
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,280
- You got it. - "Feeling wronged." Yes.

1197
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,850
That's incredible. You knew that word?

1198
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,650
(Feeling proud of her)

1199
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,450
No way. Good for you.

1200
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,350
- I'm in shock. - You're an adjective genius.

1201
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,520
We won.

1202
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,050
The puppy's team won.

1203
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,020
(Team Jong Kook won by getting all 3 right.)

1204
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,220
Wasn't I great?

1205
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,490
- What a shame. - What a shame.

1206
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,620
Wasn't I great?

1207
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,090
Ji Hyo did so well.

1208
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,430
(Vibrating)

1209
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,590
It was more than just crying.

1210
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,630
It's not "sad."

1211
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,770
(Se Chan receives a call too.)

1212
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Hello?

1213
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,040
- Se Chan. This is a crew member. - Okay.

1214
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,710
You have from now until the end of lunch...

1215
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,910
- to complete your mission. - Okay.

1216
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,850
(What must Ssaebssaeb do to ward off his misfortune?)

1217
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,810
This is it. This is mine.

1218
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,250
Can I take the bill?

1219
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,620
Okay, good. I'll take the bill.

1220
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,890
(Roast and eat as many black beans as your age.)

1221
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,490
What's this? I must do this in secret?

1222
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,090
Black beans? I have to eat them too.

1223
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,020
(Japanese custom: Eat roasted beans to wish for a long, healthy life.)

1224
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,360
Seok Jin said...

1225
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,760
I'm 39 based on the new age system.

1226
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,460
(In international age)

1227
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,670
You have from now until the end of lunch...

1228
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,870
(Explaining a detailed mission he has to carry out)

1229
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,530
to complete your mission.

1230
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,970
You must eat exactly 41 beans as that is your age this year.

1231
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,700
(Se Chan's mission: Roast and eat as many beans as your age.)

1232
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,140
The soaked beans are in a jar on the condiment shelf,

1233
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,180
(There are beans among the condiments.)

1234
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,580
and the wok is with the cooking utensils.

1235
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,780
(There are frying pans on the lower shelf.)

1236
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,940
Okay.

1237
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,310
(He received his mission.)

1238
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,650
- Jong Kook. - She hit me as she went by.

1239
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,590
(Sneaking)

1240
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,220
- The dog. - Yes.

1241
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,550
(Eyes rolling about)

1242
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,520
(Ssaebssaeb looks for his chance.)

1243
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,120
I failed.

1244
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,690
- Look. - Ssaebssaeb.

1245
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,730
- He got a mission. - He's glancing like crazy.

1246
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,930
- Ssaebssaeb. - Hey.

1247
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,360
- He did this. - He got a mission.

1248
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,230
His eyes were like...

1249
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,030
(The dog caught on.)

1250
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,870
- Your heart's racing. - Right now...

1251
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:34,670
(Will he be able to roast the beans when everyone is watching him?)

1252
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,240
- He got a mission. - This is madness.

1253
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,640
I have a different question. Is Eun Bi still doing something?

1254
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
- A mission? - A mission.

1255
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,210
(Writer)

1256
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,140
- She failed, right? - She failed, right?

1257
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,180
- A mission? - A mission.

1258
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,210
(What was Eun Bi's mission?)

1259
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,680
- She failed, right? - She failed, right?

1260
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,250
- Here's your card. - Okay.

1261
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,050
(She chose hers because she liked red.)

1262
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,950
"You are unlucky?"

1263
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,590
"At each ring of the bell, you must eat a grape, 12 in total?"

1264
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,630
"Eat a grape, 12 in total?"

1265
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,260
(At each ring of the bell, you must eat a grape, 12 in total.)

1266
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:01,930
"The 12 tolls mean 12 months, and they wish for good fortune."

1267
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:01,970
(Spanish custom: They eat a grape at each toll of the bell.)

1268
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,170
- Who gives me the grapes? - We'll give you the rules.

1269
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,610
You must eat 12 grapes before the bell stops ringing.

1270
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,270
(The crew member called during the game.)

1271
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,840
- The grapes are in the fridge. - I understand.

1272
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,380
(Eun Bi's mission: Eat 12 grapes before the bell tolls 12 times.)

1273
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,710
- What's she doing? - Shouldn't we stop her?

1274
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,250
(She managed to open the fridge.)

1275
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,810
(She puts a grape in her mouth,)

1276
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,510
You're eating so well.

1277
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,650
(then masks it with another snack.)

1278
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,150
Eun Bi. Shall we sit down so we can play a game?

1279
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,350
(The bell stopped tolling while she put up a smoke screen.)

1280
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,660
It looks like she failed.

1281
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,890
(She failed to eat 12 grapes.)

1282
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,960
- I think something went wrong. - Let's play a game.

1283
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,830
- What did we need to say? - "Are you crazy?"

1284
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,590
(What was your mission?)

1285
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,960
- "Are you crazy?" - Was that it? "Are you insane?"

1286
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,160
- No. - "Aren't you full?"

1287
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,130
- "Is that good?" - I had to eat 12 grapes.

1288
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,470
- What? - What?

1289
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,630
- Eat 12 grapes. - For real?

1290
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,640
- No, she's lying. - That's a lie.

1291
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,370
No one believes me now?

1292
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,010
(Feeling wronged)

1293
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,340
- It's a lie. - Why would she hit you, then?

1294
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,140
(They have no trust in her.)

1295
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,640
- Why would you... - I had to eat 12 grapes.

1296
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,840
- Don't lie. - That's nonsense.

1297
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,210
Why did you eat a strawberry, then?

1298
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,810
- That would be too easy. - Right.

1299
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,810
I failed. I had to eat one each time the bell rang out.

1300
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,050
Oh, at a certain moment?

1301
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,180
(As she already failed the mission, she revealed the truth.)

1302
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,550
At the exact moment.

1303
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,950
- Twelve grapes? - Don't you lie.

1304
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,720
- It's the truth. - Why eat a strawberry, then?

1305
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,760
They'd never give you a mission like that.

1306
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,620
They'd never give you a mission like that.

1307
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,630
- It's true. Please believe me. - It's a lie.

1308
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,890
You ate a strawberry.

1309
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,930
(Cold)

1310
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,730
- It's true. - You ate a strawberry.

1311
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,170
I'm telling the truth. Tell them for me!

1312
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,730
- Let's forget about it. - I won't believe you.

1313
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,700
(I'm telling the truth this time.)

1314
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,740
- It's the truth. - Drop it now.

1315
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,540
- That's enough, Eun Bi. - It's true.

1316
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,040
(They don't believe Eun Bi even when she's telling the truth.)

1317
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,510
- Stop it, Kwon Eun Bi. - Yes. That's enough, Eun Bi.

1318
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,370
But it's true.

1319
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,480
- What's wrong with you? - Come on.

1320
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,640
- Stop it. - Come on.

1321
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,280
- Enough. - She lied so often...

1322
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,750
- that no one believes her. - Don't lie.

1323
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,550
The Spanish believe eating 12 grapes brings good luck.

1324
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:28,420
(This is the consequence of her habitual lying.)

1325
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,550
- That's enough. - You be quiet now.

1326
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,750
Team Jong Kook won this mission,

1327
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:34,460
(Benefits for Team Jong Kook that won the mission)

1328
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,260
so you get a benefit.

1329
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,760
- Darn it. - Oh, okay.

1330
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,060
Right now, the lottery box...

1331
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:39,130
(The lottery box is empty.)

1332
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,730
for the Lucky Face Lottery is empty.

1333
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,330
The winning team can put two Face Balls in the box...

1334
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,640
that belong to whoever they think is unlucky.

1335
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,900
- "Unlucky?" - The two...

1336
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,440
can't be of the same people.

1337
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,570
(They must choose different people.)

1338
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,610
Do you mean we must pick the people we can't stand?

1339
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,610
No.

1340
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,750
- It's unrelated to looks. - The unfortunate.

1341
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,480
Who we think is unlucky today.

1342
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,150
(So it's unlucky people.)

1343
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,650
It's unlucky people, not ugly people, right?

1344
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,980
- Okay. - Gosh.

1345
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,450
The winning team gets to choose two people,

1346
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:06,990
(They can predict which ones are more likely to be chosen...)

1347
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,960
- That's right. - so you have a better idea...

1348
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,260
of whose balls are in there.

1349
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:11,430
(because they know whose balls they put in the box.)

1350
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,960
- That's right. - Oh, I see.

1351
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,530
So you have an advantage when it's time to draw.

1352
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,030
(Eun Bi: Chosen)

1353
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,960
Yes, there's an advantage.

1354
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,100
Eun Bi, pick someone.

1355
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,470
(Eun Bi chooses Face Balls first.)

1356
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,540
I didn't like this person today.

1357
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,510
(She chose Kim Jong Kook.)

1358
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,140
Why did you pick him?

1359
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,070
The doggy face suits him too well.

1360
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,610
(It's a problem if it's too good a look.)

1361
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,580
(Her second choice...)

1362
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,850
And him. I'll go with these two.

1363
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,150
(is Jee Seok Sam.)

1364
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,480
What don't you like about Seok Sam?

1365
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,920
He's just...

1366
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,150
He's just here.

1367
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:42,630
(Eun Bi chose those who irked her.)

1368
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,460
- Okay. - Thanks.

1369
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,500
(Ssaebssaeb is up next.)

1370
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,830
My first pick is Haha.

1371
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,470
I don't like the color of his face.

1372
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:54,500
(He chooses Haha who looks grim.)

1373
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,440
Haha is one. His face is poop-colored.

1374
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,110
And then Ye Eun.

1375
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,110
She always gets picked. She has rotten luck.

1376
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,710
She's bound to get drawn, so I'll go with her.

1377
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,050
Okay.

1378
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,150
(Poor Ddochi is added to the mix.)

1379
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,220
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo pick too.)

1380
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,820
They're bad luck.

1381
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:13,320
(Number of Face Balls)

1382
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,620
Seok Jin and Se Chan.

1383
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,960
Anyone would see this photo and dislike it.

1384
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:17,490
(Vibrating)

1385
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,560
(Jae Seok gets a call as well.)

1386
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Hello?

1387
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,830
(She sees him taking a call.)

1388
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,200
- Yes? - Be honest. Next month...

1389
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,740
Yes.

1390
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,700
(Looking around warily)

1391
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,340
- You have to do that. - He's taking a phone call now.

1392
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,940
Yes, okay.

1393
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,180
(Hurriedly hanging up)

1394
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,880
- He's sitting, wearing hanbok. - What?

1395
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,110
What was that call about?

1396
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,980
- Well, it was from home. - Did you get a phone call?

1397
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,550
- I got a call from home. - You got a call from home?

1398
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,580
- You're actually answering today. - Someone asked me to move my car.

1399
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,750
- Oh, to move your car? - Yes.

1400
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,220
- How many cars do you have? - It was about the parking.

1401
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,750
- Someone asked me to move my car. - He got a mission.

1402
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,660
(Everyone's attention is on Jae Seok.)

1403
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,520
- Grasshopper got a mission. - What are you saying?

1404
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,390
(Se Chan's mission: Roast and eat as many beans as your age.)

1405
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,860
(Ssaebssaeb quietly enters the kitchen.)

1406
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,430
It's not that. Haha's hat...

1407
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,360
Hey, Se Chan is up to something.

1408
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,770
(Acting innocent)

1409
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,300
- Don't react to him. - You're right.

1410
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,100
- The sound... - That's annoying.

1411
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,370
Did you get a call?

1412
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,070
- No. - Not yet? You want to, right?

1413
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,280
(Seok Sam wants to get in on a mission.)

1414
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,510
- Oh, dear. - What are you doing?

1415
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,810
- Hey, what is it about? - What?

1416
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,350
(Bothering)

1417
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,150
I'll tell you what you want to hear.

1418
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,180
My mission is to take this frying pan...

1419
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,620
and hit someone in the head.

1420
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,920
So, just go away.

1421
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,260
- I should run away. - Yes.

1422
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,320
Run away.

1423
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,460
(He gets rid of Seok Sam and puts the pan on the stove.)

1424
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,630
- What is it? Did you get a call? - No, I didn't.

1425
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,360
- Ye Eun will knock it in. - Twelve times.

1426
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,230
(But then,)

1427
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,200
- I can knock it in. - Of course.

1428
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,370
(Seok Sam gets a phone call too.)

1429
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,930
But it's for real.

1430
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,100
What's wrong with you?

1431
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,900
- Gosh, seriously? - Hey, the call you got...

1432
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:35,040
(Happy)

1433
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,900
wasn't something like this, was it?

1434
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,970
I think it was, Seok Jin.

1435
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,210
(Did I get a mission call too?)

1436
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,210
- It's not like this, is it? - Not like that.

1437
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,140
- This is spam, right? Do I take it? - Seok Jin.

1438
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,010
(Potential Spam)

1439
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,810
- Should I not? - Seok Jin, that's voice phishing.

1440
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,910
(It's spam.)

1441
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,080
- Is this a spam call? - It's for real.

1442
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,250
Seok Jin, there are voice phishing scams for those over 60.

1443
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:46,680
(Scam targeting the elderly)

1444
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,580
- That's what this is. - I mean,

1445
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,120
- this isn't from the staff, right? - Seok Jin.

1446
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,550
(Disappointed)

1447
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,490
Don't just take any phone call.

1448
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,550
- But look at this. - It's voice phishing.

1449
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,820
(Worried)

1450
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,760
- Don't take any phone call. - It's voice phishing.

1451
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,490
- I think my number was leaked. - Yes, it's voice phishing.

1452
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,090
- I get these five times a day. - You know,

1453
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,230
- I gave it out to everyone. - I don't get those very often.

1454
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,030
- Really? - Next on the orientation schedule,

1455
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,300
(The next event on Running University Orientation Day)

1456
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,900
- it's lunch. - Okay!

1457
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,300
(Period 2: Lunchtime)

1458
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,430
You can use any ingredients freely to cook.

1459
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,740
(The freshmen will cook for themselves.)

1460
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,840
- Do we eat now? - We can eat.

1461
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,870
- Can we eat? - Let's go.

1462
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:11,710
(Jae Seok and Se Chan must finish their missions before lunch ends.)

1463
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,040
- See? - Do we eat now?

1464
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,340
- Can we eat? - Yes.

1465
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,740
Hey, let's eat pork belly!

1466
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,010
See? I told you it was eating pork belly.

1467
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,650
- Yes. - Let's eat ramyeon too!

1468
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,080
- Eat anything. Let's just eat. - It sounds delicious.

1469
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,410
(He naturally goes to the kitchen.)

1470
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,150
Oh, Shin Ramyeon would be good too.

1471
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,850
(It's a great chance for Se Chan to roast the beans!)

1472
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,650
- Let's make ramyeon. - I should have some ramyeon.

1473
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,790
Jae Seok, I'll grill the pork belly.

1474
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,990
(In no time)

1475
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,020
- All right, ramyeon. - I really don't know.

1476
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,390
I think it is about eating pork belly.

1477
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:27,890
(The hidden mission)

1478
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,560
- I think it is the pork belly. - It's not the pork belly.

1479
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,960
- I think it is the pork belly. - Hey, how does that make sense?

1480
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,090
(Ssaebssaeb is standing in front of the stove.)

1481
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,490
Ramyeon. Let's make ramyeon, everyone.

1482
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,960
Hang on, ramyeon.

1483
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,330
Should we stop him from grilling it?

1484
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,230
(He starts cooking.)

1485
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,030
It makes no sense for this to be a mission.

1486
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,030
Gosh, I'm dying to go to the restroom, but I keep...

1487
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,140
Wait, let me step out for a bit.

1488
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,140
(A quick break to use the restroom before the meal)

1489
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,940
- I'm going to the restroom too. - Oh, we can use this.

1490
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,410
- Ye Eun is going to the restroom! - No.

1491
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,510
(Glancing)

1492
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,010
- Water. - Can I go to the restroom?

1493
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,740
- Ji Ye Eun, did you get a mission? - Where is it?

1494
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,680
(Jae Seok follows Ye Eun out of the kitchen.)

1495
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,310
You got a mission, didn't you?

1496
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,410
Ye Eun, where are you going?

1497
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,750
Ji Ye Eun?

1498
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,350
- I'm going to the restroom! - Ji Ye Eun!

1499
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,420
I'm going to the restroom.

1500
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,250
- Ji Ye Eun, where are you going? - The restroom.

1501
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,020
(Looking around)

1502
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,960
(Eyeing the others)

1503
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,190
(Scurrying)

1504
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,860
(The petty thief hides himself among the crowd.)

1505
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,300
Oh, it's there.

1506
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,670
(A scroll and ink?)

1507
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,310
Jae Seok, you chose a tiger.

1508
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,410
(Jae Seok's hidden mission after choosing the tiger)

1509
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,640
What is this?

1510
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,980
"You are unlucky."

1511
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
"Draw a tiger and magpie painting and have it approved by AI?"

1512
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:28,220
(Korean custom: Believes painting of tiger and magpie brings good luck)

1513
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,550
A magpie and a tiger?

1514
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,080
Gosh, this is too hard.

1515
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,020
(The mythical creature featured in "KPop Demon Hunters...")

1516
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,890
- Got it. - You chose the tiger.

1517
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,520
- Oh, is this the painting? - Yes.

1518
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,850
(was inspired by the Korean tiger.)

1519
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,920
But I can't draw. How am I supposed to paint this?

1520
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,130
(Monkey, Ji Ye Eun, giraffe, Son Heung Min)

1521
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,130
You're making me paint a tiger and magpie when I'm bad at art.

1522
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,460
- Okay. - But you chose the tiger.

1523
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,930
(He's given a drawing mission even though he's bad at drawing.)

1524
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,900
I shouldn't have chosen this one.

1525
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,470
Gosh, I should've picked something else.

1526
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,530
Oh, it's there.

1527
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,900
Turn it off, punk!

1528
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,870
(First, he obtains the supplies.)

1529
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,110
(He goes straight outside.)

1530
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,510
(Moving to the building next to the studio with his supplies)

1531
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:03,920
(Jae Seok's mission: Draw tiger and magpie painting, get AI approval)

1532
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,680
Gosh, how am I supposed to paint a tiger and magpie?

1533
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,050
I've never painted this before.

1534
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,760
(He takes the scroll out for now.)

1535
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,230
I've never painted this before. How am I supposed to do this?

1536
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,190
(But he's clueless from the beginning.)

1537
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,230
So, a tiger and a bird...

1538
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,760
And a magpie...

1539
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,260
(Right then,)

1540
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,870
(Jae Seok hears someone coming.)

1541
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,270
(Haha appears.)

1542
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,840
What is it?

1543
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,240
(Throwing it aside)

1544
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:27,480
(He hurriedly hides the painting supplies first.)

1545
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,080
- What is it? - What?

1546
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,680
(Nervous)

1547
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,480
Why are you here?

1548
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,920
What? I am a member. That's why I'm here.

1549
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,720
(One second)

1550
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,550
What are you looking for?

1551
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,520
(Rummaging in his bag)

1552
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,330
Go and get yourself a snack.

1553
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,200
(Trying to appease him by opening his wallet)

1554
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,960
Come on. What is this, Jae Seok?

1555
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,970
I'll help you. Then, you can also...

1556
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,770
(Short Kid won't take it and leave.)

1557
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,670
Jae Seok, help me out too.

1558
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,300
- Take ten dollars and get a snack. - Forget it!

1559
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,740
What are you talking about?

1560
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,710
- If you tell me what yours is, - Yes?

1561
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,540
I'll help you get through it.

1562
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,780
- You can help me with mine too. - Okay, I'll help you.

1563
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:05,510
(Haha, who is good at drawing, can help him with the mission.)

1564
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,910
Okay, what is it?

1565
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,820
No, you tell me yours first.

1566
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,880
I haven't gotten mine yet.

1567
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,320
You don't have to if you don't want, but I'm sure I can help you out.

1568
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,590
But you have to help me out in return.

1569
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,960
- For real? - Yes.

1570
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,320
- For real. - Will you really help me?

1571
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:16,190
(Jae Seok and Haha formed an alliance.)

1572
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,890
- Really. What is it? - Then,

1573
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,630
I have to draw something. Can you draw it for me?

1574
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,060
What is it? A drawing of what?

1575
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,330
A tiger and magpie painting.

1576
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,460
What's that?

1577
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,770
A tiger...

1578
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,870
(Draw a tiger and magpie painting and have it approved by AI.)

1579
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,900
and a magpie with a pine tree.

1580
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,800
(With Haha's help, he won't have to worry about drawing.)

1581
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,600
Gosh, if you don't know what that is,

1582
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,740
you'd fail this mission.

1583
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,640
- That's right. - Yes.

1584
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,640
- So, please paint it for me. - Where is it?

1585
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:36,880
(Revealing his hidden supplies)

1586
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,910
But I'll help you in return.

1587
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,220
You have to paint it on this?

1588
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,280
Hey, but I'm saying I'll help you in return.

1589
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,320
Come here.

1590
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,290
(Picking things up)

1591
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,120
(Betraying him immediately)

1592
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,320
Why, that little...

1593
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,760
Why, that little...

1594
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,830
(Coming back from the restroom, Ye Eun joins in.)

1595
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,870
(Grasshopper caught up.)

1596
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,200
- Take this and run! Go! Run! - Okay.

1597
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,270
Run away!

1598
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,400
Ye Eun, give me that.

1599
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,710
- Hey! This is a mission! - Rip it up!

1600
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:09,080
- Painting a tiger and magpie... - Rip it up!

1601
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,150
Hey, something must be going on.

1602
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,520
(Jee Seok Sam also sets off!)

1603
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,280
They have something.

1604
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,020
Rip it up!

1605
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,620
(Snatching)

1606
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,820
A tiger and magpie...

1607
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,890
(He gets the scroll back,)

1608
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,490
- Hey. - What is this?

1609
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,820
(but Little Ha is right on his tail.)

1610
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,220
He has to paint a tiger and magpie!

1611
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,590
The mission!

1612
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,030
(Peekaboo)

1613
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,730
They have something!

1614
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,730
What are you drawing?

1615
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:30,870
Hey, what...

1616
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,570
(The three of them cling to each other.)

1617
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,070
What does he have?

1618
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,840
Ye Eun.

1619
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,240
(Laughing excitedly)

1620
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,770
(Giant Ji confiscates the ink and brush.)

1621
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,910
(Pulling)

1622
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,880
(Then, an unexpected person takes the scroll.)

1623
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,920
Darn it.

1624
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,350
It's right here!

1625
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,120
Darn it.

1626
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,860
(His supplies were stolen by the weakest, Mr. Jee and Ms. Ji.)

1627
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,320
- Here. Hide this. - Hey.

1628
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,830
- Jong Kook, please hide this. - In calligraphy...

1629
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,330
It's empty!

1630
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,900
It must be writing something in calligraphy.

1631
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:02,100
(Everyone knows what Jae Seok's hidden mission is now.)

1632
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,430
- Like "Happy New Year?" - It's his mission.

1633
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,570
- Gosh, this is funny. - The mission is...

1634
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,630
- Ye Eun. - Gosh, this is funny.

1635
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,700
You are...

1636
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,210
You. Today, I'm going to...

1637
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,970
(He threatens revenge.)

1638
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,310
Gosh, the mission is hard.

1639
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,680
(Laughing)

1640
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,480
Oh, my belly hurts.

1641
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,080
Gosh, the mission is hard.

1642
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,550
(Seok Sam has the brush and the ink.)

1643
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,510
- Oh, my belly hurts. - You have to grind the ink...

1644
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,750
- I'll help you out. - What?

1645
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,320
- In return, let me have these. - But we just...

1646
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,020
caught what you were up to. You can't do this now.

1647
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,320
- Sure, I can. - On here?

1648
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,920
All right, then. Give me that.

1649
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,690
- Why? - Give it here since I can't do it.

1650
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,530
(Passing it back and forth)

1651
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,500
(He takes the scroll back even though it's crumpled.)

1652
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,560
You should write it in your own blood.

1653
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,530
- Gosh, this is so funny. - It really is.

1654
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,400
It must be writing something in calligraphy.

1655
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,130
(Meanwhile, Se Chan has been keeping quiet.)

1656
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,900
- Like "Happy New Year?" - It's his mission.

1657
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,970
Gosh, this is funny.

1658
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,940
(They're beans!)

1659
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,010
(He's blatantly roasting them, but nobody knows.)

1660
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,480
(Se Chan's mission: Roast and eat as many beans as your age.)

1661
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,020
(When everyone was busy earlier,)

1662
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,450
- We have to make some ramyeon. - I'm not getting a call.

1663
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:00,790
(Se Chan quietly got the black beans.)

1664
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,790
Hey, I'll add garlic to the pork belly!

1665
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,390
(He said it loudly for no reason.)

1666
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:09,200
(After adding garlic to go along with the pork belly,)

1667
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,270
The ramyeon...

1668
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,300
(he sneakily added the beans as a topping.)

1669
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,940
(Just like that, the snot-nosed kid dreams of the perfect crime.)

1670
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,340
(Will he be able to succeed in roasting and eating 41 beans?)

1671
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,650
Hey, who makes ramyeon like that?

1672
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,310
No, I added the soup base first.

1673
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,450
- What? - Where are the chopsticks?

1674
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,980
(He starts eating them openly.)

1675
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,720
- Chopsticks. - Is it fully cooked?

1676
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,820
It's taking so long to cook.

1677
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,890
(The other guys are distracted,)

1678
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,590
I told you it wasn't boiling.

1679
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,790
(and he's stir-frying pork belly and garlic with the beans.)

1680
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,220
Induction stove tops are fast.

1681
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,620
Hey, I'm in charge of the meat!

1682
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,890
Look at this. It spilled over on the sides.

1683
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:37,230
(Thanks to that, he's smoothly proceeding with his mission.)

1684
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:37,930
Come on, Seok Jin.

1685
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,930
(This time, he eats 4 whole beans.)

1686
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,360
Oh, let me throw out the trash.

1687
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,530
(He chews on them.)

1688
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,630
Gosh, Yang Se Chan...

1689
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,440
Se Chan, you have to roast and eat these, right?

1690
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:48,070
(It's the mission, isn't it?)

1691
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,510
- You added beans? - Black food.

1692
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,240
I mean, there are beans in the pork belly, Seok Jin.

1693
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,310
(Food Fighter caught him.)

1694
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,810
Seok Jin, these days, black foods are all the rage.

1695
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,950
Why are you roasting beans?

1696
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,980
(Everyone knows he's roasting beans now.)

1697
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,110
You added beans?

1698
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,450
Hey, there's the saying on roasting beans in lightning.

1699
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:01,180
That punk must be roasting beans.

1700
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,020
Hey, it must be for real!

1701
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,250
I mean, for real...

1702
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,960
There are beans in here.

1703
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,920
- Why... Oh, he has to roast beans. - Don't let him eat the beans.

1704
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,030
(He starts picking up the beans in the end.)

1705
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,760
Seok Jin.

1706
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,960
Hey, don't let him eat the beans.

1707
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,960
Hey, Ye Eun. Seok Jin.

1708
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,730
(He's eating in the meantime.)

1709
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,600
Hey, don't let him eat them!

1710
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,930
Hey, these beans... No way.

1711
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,000
(He eats again.)

1712
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,430
- These beans... - Why are there beans in here?

1713
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,840
- Don't. - I bet he has to eat 12 beans.

1714
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,270
(He got it roughly right.)

1715
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,240
- Hey. - Guys, don't.

1716
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,910
If his mission is to eat 12 beans,

1717
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,540
then my mission to eat 12 grapes makes sense too.

1718
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,010
You're right.

1719
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,440
I need to eat 100 of them,

1720
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,380
(He only has to eat 41 beans.)

1721
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,580
- but I can't. - He has to eat 12 of them.

1722
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,450
(He starts telling a convincing lie.)

1723
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,880
- Stop him from eating beans. - Seok Jin...

1724
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,950
Stop him from eating beans. He has to eat 100 of them.

1725
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,750
(Falling for it)

1726
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,290
He has to eat 100 beans.

1727
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,760
(The others easily fell for his lie.)

1728
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,460
Hey.

1729
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,830
Stop him from eating these.

1730
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,830
(He leaves after taking some of them out.)

1731
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,230
Hey. Stop him from eating these.

1732
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:46,300
Wait.

1733
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:49,330
(Thanks to that, quite a lot of beans are left.)

1734
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,960
That's not a mission I expected.

1735
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,730
Why am I not getting my phone call?

1736
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:52,970
All I got was spam.

1737
00:43:53,400 --> 00:44:05,010
(Se Chan's mission: Roast and eat as many black beans as your age.)

1738
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,020
Thanks, Jong Kook.

1739
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,380
(While the puppy adds pepper to the meat)

1740
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,750
He's still eating beans.

1741
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,850
(He inhales bean number 41.)

1742
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,320
Okay, done.

1743
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,160
(Se Chan successfully warded off bad luck.)

1744
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,160
- You ate all 100 of them? - Already?

1745
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,660
I bet he has to eat only 12 of them.

1746
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,260
(Se Chan wins a lottery ticket.)

1747
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,730
Black food is good for you. All done.

1748
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,960
I'll add more garlic.

1749
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,000
(He prepares lunch feeling at ease now.)

1750
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,500
- Should I do that? - Would you like to take over?

1751
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,430
(Some beans are still left from his mission.)

1752
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,440
(The puppy is in charge of cooking ramyeon.)

1753
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,470
I can't believe I can do this with furry hands.

1754
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,510
You'll get fur in the ramyeon!

1755
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,610
(He's already immersed in playing a puppy.)

1756
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,280
Stop it. Go away.

1757
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,350
I can cook with furry hands.

1758
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,950
I'll do it. Don't get fur in here.

1759
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,650
Dog owners occasionally eat food with dog hair in it.

1760
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:41,820
No one's pet dog...

1761
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,620
cooks ramyeon for them.

1762
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,820
(While he puts in seasoning powder with his paws)

1763
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,090
- How many is that? Four? - Four?

1764
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,090
Yes, four.

1765
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,090
Where's the locust?

1766
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,530
(By the way)

1767
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,230
Jae Seok took off to do his mission.

1768
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,830
(Jae Seok disappeared again?)

1769
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,860
Where did the locust go?

1770
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,960
Haha, that dirty rat.

1771
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,700
(Draw a tiger and magpie painting and have it approved by AI.)

1772
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,100
That mustache man plays dirty.

1773
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,600
(He starts taking action with the scroll in his hand.)

1774
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,170
Jong Kook, let's stop Jae Seok from completing his drawing.

1775
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,910
The ink stick is here.

1776
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,440
(The ink that has been stolen earlier)

1777
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,840
He could draw it with something else.

1778
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,480
Doesn't he have to use an ink stick?

1779
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:07,880
Let's hurry.

1780
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,480
Is there a marker?

1781
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,680
(Haha is right.)

1782
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:11,610
- A marker? - Yes.

1783
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,950
(Jae Seok is looking for a marker,)

1784
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,580
Where's Jae Seok?

1785
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:17,120
(and Haha is looking for Jae Seok.)

1786
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:15,650
Where's Jae Seok?

1787
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,720
Jae Seok?

1788
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,590
(Draw a tiger and magpie painting and have it approved by AI.)

1789
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,960
That mustache man plays dirty.

1790
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,360
(But Jae Seok is in the building!)

1791
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,120
I have to draw a tiger and magpie painting.

1792
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:27,200
(He must draw the painting before he's caught.)

1793
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:26,200
I'm terrible at drawing, though.

1794
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,270
Here you are. What were you up to?

1795
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,370
(Just then)

1796
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:34,940
Here you are.

1797
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,740
What were you up to?

1798
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,480
(He draws only a single dot before Free Meals Siblings charge at him.)

1799
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:38,540
Go away.

1800
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:42,880
Ye Eun, take it from him.

1801
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,250
- Should I rip the paper? - Yes, rip it.

1802
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,810
(Should I rip the scroll?)

1803
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,080
- Rip it. - Scissors...

1804
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:48,780
That's not my mission.

1805
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,790
(Right then, she spots scissors.)

1806
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,220
I'm sorry!

1807
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,750
- Hold on. Yes, that's it. - I'm sorry.

1808
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:53,790
You guys...

1809
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,490
(She cuts the paper in half with scissors she happened to find.)

1810
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,530
- I'm sorry, Jae Seok. - I had no other choice.

1811
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:00,700
(At the coffee truck)

1812
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:59,500
If only you hadn't taken my beverage from me.

1813
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,930
- Then I wouldn't have... - I'm sorry.

1814
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,570
Go. Ye Eun, you should go.

1815
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:08,470
(The giant leaves with the damaged scroll.)

1816
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:15,180
(They battle it out for a small piece of the scroll.)

1817
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,680
You darn jerks.

1818
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:17,910
I will finish this mission, no matter what.

1819
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,250
Guys, come here!

1820
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:23,890
(Ssaebssaeb comes by after hearing his yelling.)

1821
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,420
- Are you done? - Yes.

1822
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,350
- It's over for me. - What's that?

1823
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,320
I can't complete my mission now that this is ripped.

1824
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,620
I'll rip it up some more.

1825
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,090
Yes, do it.

1826
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,730
(Haha holds Jae Seok still.)

1827
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,200
Yes, rip it into little pieces.

1828
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,800
(They ruin the scroll in front of Jae Seok.)

1829
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,530
Nice!

1830
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,570
(Cackling)

1831
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,700
You dirty rats.

1832
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,570
- You dirty rats. - He could still draw it here,

1833
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,610
so rip it up some more.

1834
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,310
- You dirty rats. - Ruin it completely!

1835
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:51,680
(The scroll is ripped and torn.)

1836
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,280
You dirty rats.

1837
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,220
(Sighing)

1838
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,280
- What's that? - Hold on.

1839
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,690
- What did you do? - Is it over?

1840
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,420
(Panting)

1841
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:01,820
- You know... - Did he have another one?

1842
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,360
Just like in the movies, he always shows up late.

1843
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,730
- Right? - Exactly.

1844
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:10,670
(By the time Seok Sam chimed in, it was already over.)

1845
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:07,630
So that was his mission.

1846
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:08,630
- Check this out. - He's hilarious.

1847
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,130
- You know... - That was fun.

1848
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,030
No one will be able to succeed at this rate.

1849
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,400
- Right. - It's not doable.

1850
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:15,140
(Checking his phone again)

1851
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,670
I want to get my mission.

1852
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,350
(Jae Seok keeps the hope alive.)

1853
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,650
I knew it.

1854
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,580
You're trying to draw on that.

1855
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,390
(He doesn't let him slide.)

1856
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,150
I knew it!

1857
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,750
Let's go, okay?

1858
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:33,290
(Sick and tired)

1859
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,020
No wonder you let us leave so easily.

1860
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,820
There's no way I can complete my mission now.

1861
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,760
- Let's go. - See? You still have...

1862
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,160
- that piece of paper. - Let's go.

1863
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:42,430
(Is Jae Seok really giving up?)

1864
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:39,830
Unbelievable.

1865
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,760
I can't complete my mission, but neither can you.

1866
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,430
I'm telling you now. I won't let you succeed.

1867
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:46,970
Is the ramyeon done?

1868
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,300
(In the meantime, lunch is ready.)

1869
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,240
- Yes, the ramyeon is done. - Chopsticks!

1870
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,280
Just so you know, lunchtime will be over in 30 minutes.

1871
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:55,110
(Lunch will be over in 30 minutes.)

1872
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,610
- Really? - In 30 minutes?

1873
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,580
- Really? - In 30 minutes?

1874
00:47:55,310 --> 00:48:01,480
(Then Jae Seok only has 30 minutes to complete his mission.)

1875
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,710
- We just got started. - It'll be over?

1876
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,820
We should hurry up and eat.

1877
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,850
Yes, get eating.

1878
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,420
- We should eat. - Eat if you're ready.

1879
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,120
Look at this ramyeon!

1880
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:10,090
(The highlight of the orientation day is pork belly and ramyeon.)

1881
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,650
- We'll enjoy. - Have some ramyeon.

1882
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:07,560
This feels like an episode of "Culinary Class Wars."

1883
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,620
Good work, guys.

1884
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,860
I'll get you some.

1885
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,160
(Running around made Jae Seok hungry.)

1886
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,900
Jong Kook, your fur is everywhere.

1887
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:20,740
(Pet Puppy Jong Kook eats ramyeon getting fur all over the place.)

1888
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:23,570
Gosh, that's good.

1889
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:31,750
(The pork belly in lettuce wrap tastes as sweet as honey.)

1890
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,410
Why is the meat burned?

1891
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:30,480
You grilled a lot of meat.

1892
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,880
Seok Jin, that's how it should be.

1893
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,580
That's how you have grilled pork belly.

1894
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,650
- Really? - It should be crisp.

1895
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,420
This certain feeling

1896
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,720
- There's something here. - A dangerous feeling

1897
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,960
- Is that Eun Bi's song? - Yes.

1898
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,090
It's not.

1899
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,330
- She says it's not. - Roller coaster

1900
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:48,160
- That's Chungha's song. - That's by Chungha.

1901
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,560
(Oh, right)

1902
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,200
(Top 100 Ears made a big mistake.)

1903
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,500
- Can you... - Did you sing Chungha's song?

1904
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:51,800
Can you sing one of mine too?

1905
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,140
I will. Hold on.

1906
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,400
Can you sing it now?

1907
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,040
I will after I eat.

1908
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,370
Sing it now!

1909
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,980
Sing it now!

1910
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,610
(The Queen of Waterbomb Festival is pissed off.)

1911
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,710
Eun Bi, I'm sorry.

1912
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,350
She's changed a lot...

1913
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,620
and has returned as a warrior.

1914
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,650
It's the mustache and beard.

1915
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:13,420
Underwater, underwater

1916
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:15,690
(This time, he really sings one of Eun Bi's songs.)

1917
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,120
- Underwater - Water

1918
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,630
- Isn't that all he knows? - That's...

1919
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,860
(Suspicious)

1920
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:23,600
(He hums the chorus as if on cue.)

1921
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:22,600
- Of course we know the song. - You sang...

1922
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,200
the lyrics to Chungha's song,

1923
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,970
(Wait.)

1924
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,830
- so why... - Can't we eat in peace?

1925
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,900
- Why are you only humming mine? - Unbelievable.

1926
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,540
Why are you only humming mine?

1927
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:33,010
You should have delivered the lyrics better.

1928
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,810
Then I'd know the lyrics.

1929
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,950
(Dodging a crisis by being brazen)

1930
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,750
- Underwater - Underwater

1931
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,350
(Unbelievable)

1932
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,320
- Underwater - Underwater

1933
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,390
I'm full.

1934
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:48,060
(There's only 15 minutes of lunchtime left.)

1935
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:46,960
Why did you...

1936
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,190
That was a great meal.

1937
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,390
- You can have it all. - Are you done?

1938
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,500
(Jae Seok finished his meal first.)

1939
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,100
- Thanks, Eun Bi. - Don't mention it.

1940
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,700
Hey, there's some ramyeon left.

1941
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,570
- Yes, there's some left. - Can you give me some?

1942
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,740
That was a great meal.

1943
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,240
(Eyeing Jae Seok carefully)

1944
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,540
- The puppy sure likes ramyeon. - Right.

1945
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,570
(Haha gives him the look, and Se Chan receives.)

1946
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,440
Growing up, we fed our dogs this.

1947
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:11,210
(Jae Seok is acting unnaturally.)

1948
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,040
- Absolutely. - Exactly.

1949
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,810
- I'll give you some of the soup. - I'd like that.

1950
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,880
(Haha keeps his eyes only on Jae Seok.)

1951
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,490
When I was young, our dog ate all the food that we ate.

1952
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,090
- I'm full. - Exactly.

1953
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,720
- They ate leftovers. - They ate what we ate.

1954
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,190
(Out of nowhere)

1955
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,920
The pork belly was grilled nicely.

1956
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,130
- It's tasty. - Right?

1957
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,430
- They were grilled nicely. - Exactly.

1958
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,860
(He suddenly praised the pork belly,)

1959
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,090
- They weren't burned. - They weren't.

1960
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,760
- They were grilled perfectly. - They weren't burned.

1961
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,160
- That's how it should be. - That...

1962
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,270
(then left awkwardly.)

1963
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,570
- Pork belly... - Can you pass me a tangerine?

1964
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,770
- It should be crispy. - Are you done?

1965
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:32,970
Pass me a tangerine.

1966
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,370
(Smiling)

1967
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:36,840
- I'm not done. - Yes, a tangerine.

1968
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,070
Please stand still.

1969
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,710
(As suspected, Jae Seok gets a new scroll.)

1970
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,810
He keeps eating more garlic...

1971
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:46,420
and breathing on me.

1972
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:50,720
(Immediately dispatched)

1973
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,420
What now?

1974
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,960
(Jae Seok's not giving up.)

1975
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:01,230
(But Haha and Se Chan are relentless.)

1976
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,060
There's no way Jae Seok will complete his mission.

1977
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:07,070
(The three-man battle resumes.)

1978
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,270
Jae Seok, give it here.

1979
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,310
- You're not doing this. - Guys.

1980
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,310
- Give it here. You know the drill. - Stop.

1981
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,080
(Grasshopper is trapped.)

1982
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:13,980
- Not a chance. - You know the drill.

1983
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,610
- Guys. - Don't let it get nasty.

1984
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,250
- I'll give you 50 dollars each. - Fifty?

1985
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,880
(He tries to bribe them.)

1986
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,850
- Really? - Yes, really.

1987
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:22,080
If you let me draw the tiger and magpie painting,

1988
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,590
I'll give you 50 dollars each.

1989
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,720
When?

1990
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:25,890
Today, after I'm done.

1991
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:26,820
(Making eye contact)

1992
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,290
- No way. - I mean it.

1993
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,790
(Making eye contact)

1994
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,190
- Pay us first. - It's not like you win anything.

1995
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:32,530
- Pay us first. - The mission...

1996
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:36,870
(Draw a tiger and magpie painting and have it approved by AI.)

1997
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:33,900
isn't about just drawing the tiger and magpie painting.

1998
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,730
- Is there more? - It needs to be approved.

1999
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:36,970
My mission is a tough one.

2000
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,570
- Do a good job drawing it. - Okay.

2001
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,940
- Promise to give us 50 dollars. - Yes, promise us.

2002
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,440
(He took care of the kids with a 50-dollar bribe.)

2003
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,740
Got it. I'll pay up.

2004
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:54,720
(He finally gets the chance to draw the tiger and magpie painting.)

2005
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,320
I'm bad at drawing as is...

2006
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:58,720
Darn it.

2007
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:05,230
(What?)

2008
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:13,270
(Given his drawing skills, they didn't need to run interference.)

2009
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,300
What? How can you draw that?

2010
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:19,310
(But he's doing his best.)

2011
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:16,670
I don't think I can do this.

2012
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,610
You're doing better than expected.

2013
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,880
Seriously?

2014
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,450
(Stealing the scroll)

2015
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:34,090
(The heinous Ssaebssaeb Duo won't let it slide.)

2016
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,860
- I can't believe them. - Look at Jae Seok.

2017
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,260
(It's his fault for trusting them.)

2018
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,630
- As if we need 50 dollars. - Not a chance.

2019
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:41,930
- Exactly. - Right?

2020
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:46,540
(He gets fooled for multiple times.)

2021
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,200
Those jerks...

2022
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:54,510
(Is he going back without his scroll?)

2023
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:58,880
(Hold on.)

2024
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,880
Don't I just need approval from the AI app?

2025
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,420
The tiger and magpie painting...

2026
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,120
- I just need its approval. - You just need its approval.

2027
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,220
- Are you going to draw on this? - Yes.

2028
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:13,700
(He begins to draw on one of the prop tables.)

2029
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,060
The painting's in my head.

2030
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:21,040
(He starts sketching what he has memorized by now.)

2031
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,200
It's in my head.

2032
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:25,040
(His drawing has even gotten better.)

2033
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:25,740
- I can just see if I pass. - Yes.

2034
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,810
- Right? Yes. - You can ask AI.

2035
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:32,010
(If only I can pass just like this...)

2036
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:30,480
That's all I need.

2037
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:35,120
Those punks are coming back.

2038
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,050
- Seriously... - What is this?

2039
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,190
(Here comes the Ssaebssaeb Duo again.)

2040
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,820
What are you drawing on?

2041
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:44,160
(Dragging)

2042
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:52,230
- One, two! - One, two!

2043
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,370
(The Ssaebssaeb Duo steals the whole table with perfect teamwork.)

2044
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,600
He thought to draw it on here.

2045
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,570
- This makes no sense. - It makes no sense.

2046
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,610
Let's go and show them.

2047
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,940
This won't work. This isn't the mission.

2048
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:03,240
(They proudly come back after annoying Jae Seok.)

2049
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,810
This makes no sense. Who would draw it on here?

2050
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:02,880
Hey, Seok Jin!

2051
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,780
- I don't have much time now. - Time is up now.

2052
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:08,480
I don't have much time. I need approval anyway I can.

2053
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,280
(But Jae Seok doesn't give up until the end.)

2054
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,720
Jae Seok, you have three minutes left.

2055
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:13,390
(3 minutes until lunchtime is over)

2056
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,490
All right. One second.

2057
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,660
Hush. Come in. Hurry up.

2058
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:16,860
(Hiding from the members...)

2059
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:17,960
Hurry up! Get in!

2060
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,860
(in a corner room)

2061
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:22,230
My passion for art.

2062
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,230
(This will be his last chance.)

2063
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:24,670
I can't draw it on there. I'll be ruined.

2064
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:29,800
Hang on. Is there a sheet of drawing paper?

2065
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:33,070
(But this room doesn't have a single sheet of paper.)

2066
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,950
Can you erase this later?

2067
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,010
Okay.

2068
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,350
Be sure to erase this.

2069
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,850
(Jae Seok has lost his mind.)

2070
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:45,090
(He tries it on the door so that no one can steal it!)

2071
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,390
(Right then)

2072
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,360
(Peekaboo)

2073
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,960
What was that ripping sound?

2074
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,930
What on earth did you rip?

2075
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:00,570
(The Grim Reapers followed him until the end.)

2076
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,970
You're drawing on here?

2077
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:59,970
Hey, are you kidding me?

2078
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,840
- What is this? - Hey, why are you...

2079
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,300
He said he'd erase it.

2080
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,870
- Even the door... - Can you erase this?

2081
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:08,880
(The bad guys made him lose his motivation to fight.)

2082
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:07,010
Yes, I'll erase it for you.

2083
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,310
- But the time... - I mean, why are you doing this?

2084
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:11,980
We can't let you succeed in your mission.

2085
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,150
We'll leave you alone if you draw it on your body.

2086
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,380
Draw it on your body.

2087
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,690
- Stop it now. - Stop, seriously.

2088
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,690
- It's over. - Let's go inside.

2089
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:22,590
Grab him. Let's tie him up. This won't do.

2090
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:26,360
(Jae Seok tried the mission as many as 6 times.)

2091
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:26,430
Gosh, you punks. You're seriously ridiculous.

2092
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:31,770
(He ended up being bound in humiliation.)

2093
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:30,230
So, why aren't you letting me do this?

2094
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,500
- In case you... - Lunchtime is over.

2095
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,040
(The mission to ward off bad luck is finished.)

2096
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,300
- I mean... - The end!

2097
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,210
I mean, the mission... You just can't do it!

2098
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,570
Jae Seok, you won't be able to do it today.

2099
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:39,870
We caught you.

2100
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,480
Hey, do you know what he resorted to?

2101
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,380
He went crazy whenever he saw something white.

2102
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:45,650
- He was drawing on the wall. - You can't do that.

2103
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:47,480
Now, Jae Seok had...

2104
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,380
- He failed, right? - a Korean custom.

2105
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:54,960
(Draw a tiger and magpie painting and have it approved by AI.)

2106
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,590
A tiger, which wards off bad luck,

2107
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:53,790
and a magpie, the bearer of good news, in one painting.

2108
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:54,820
- That's hard. - He had to draw that...

2109
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:55,820
and have AI say...

2110
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:00,060
(Of all the missions, Jae Seok chose a tough one.)

2111
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,490
- it's a tiger and magpie painting. - That's hard.

2112
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:59,660
- It was a hard mission. - I couldn't do it anyway, but...

2113
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,930
It's a hard mission.

2114
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,960
- So, you've failed. - Okay.

2115
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,430
(Jae Seok failed in the end.)

2116
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,830
- It was fun. The process was fun. - The rest of you...

2117
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,740
Eating 12 grapes?

2118
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,870
(Among the 4 who got missions to get rid of bad luck,)

2119
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,570
What is this? Does it mean I have to do this?

2120
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:11,070
(only Se Chan and Jong Kook got lottery tickets.)

2121
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:11,510
- In secret? - I'm really good at acting cute.

2122
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:14,240
"You're lucky. You get a lottery ticket."

2123
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:19,710
(The 4 lucky ones got lottery tickets without missions.)

2124
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,640
- What? - That's a good thing, right?

2125
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,010
I'm picked a good one.

2126
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:18,110
Yes.

2127
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,750
- You'll get it at the end. - Okay, got it.

2128
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:22,620
You didn't have a mission, but ate garlic and made us smell it?

2129
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:23,950
(Number of lottery tickets)

2130
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,220
- Why did you do that? - Why'd you do that?

2131
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,260
Like so, we'll proceed with the second...

2132
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,390
- lucky item draw. - Okay. There's more.

2133
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:30,930
- Is there more? - You must complete this mission...

2134
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,860
by the end of the orientation.

2135
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,560
- I want to do one. - You must choose wisely...

2136
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,830
- this time as well. - Gosh, we must choose well.

2137
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,630
(The lucky items appear.)

2138
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,000
Then, should we play rock-paper-scissors?

2139
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,030
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2140
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:40,500
- I want to do this one. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2141
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,270
(Haha grabs one.)

2142
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,270
- I'll take this. - I want this.

2143
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,810
- No, wait. - Are we just picking them?

2144
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,870
(It's 1st-come, 1st-served again.)

2145
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,670
- Hey, why are you just choosing? - What are you guys doing?

2146
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,740
I should pick this one.

2147
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,910
- Why are you just picking? - The red one.

2148
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,250
What? Do I get the leftover again?

2149
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:54,480
(They picked lucky items without fighting.)

2150
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:52,850
- I got the leftover again. - Darn it.

2151
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,480
- But... - Again,

2152
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,980
- There were only a few left. - please spread out.

2153
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:56,990
- Okay. - We'll tell you...

2154
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,120
- Will you tell us again? - what each of your items means.

2155
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:01,620
(Which lucky item will bring a lottery ticket this time?)

2156
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,920
I get a feeling.

2157
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,390
Yes, thank you.

2158
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,260
(Haha chose the black gourd.)

2159
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,330
What's up with me?

2160
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,590
(Amazing)

2161
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:09,030
(Good luck twice in a row?)

2162
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,130
"The following mission..." It says I'm lucky, so why...

2163
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,430
(You're lucky!)

2164
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,670
(You must complete the following mission to get a lottery ticket.)

2165
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,370
(What kind of mission did the lucky guy receive?)

2166
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,370
I don't get it.

2167
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:16,200
(Write 4 Lucky Letters and deliver them.)

2168
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:17,310
A lucky letter.

2169
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:18,870
(British custom: It's bad luck...)

2170
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:21,680
"First started in Britain..."

2171
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,110
(if you don't copy and send the letter...)

2172
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,980
(exactly as it says...)

2173
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,050
There. A lucky letter.

2174
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,680
(right after you receive it.)

2175
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,420
This will bring me bad luck! What is this?

2176
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,650
If you see it, you must write it. If not, you'll have bad luck!

2177
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:32,190
I was going to pretend like I didn't see it.

2178
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,090
Please read the letter inside the envelope.

2179
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:37,060
(Lucky Letter: Originated in the UK, it made its way around...)

2180
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:36,360
When will I write all this?

2181
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:41,500
(He must write 4 of these to get a lottery ticket.)

2182
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:38,890
I have to write all of this?

2183
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:42,700
This is too much.

2184
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,700
(Meanwhile, Seok Jin chose the gold bar charm.)

2185
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,940
What's this?

2186
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:48,470
I'm lucky?

2187
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,070
(You're lucky! You must complete the following mission...)

2188
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,100
(to receive a lottery ticket.)

2189
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,170
(Twist a straw rope to the left and hang it up.)

2190
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:53,680
"Twist a straw rope to the left and hang it up?" Darn it.

2191
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,480
(Korean custom: A straw rope...)

2192
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:55,680
What is this?

2193
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,550
(twisted to the left is hung on doors...)

2194
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,310
Gosh, this is hard.

2195
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:59,710
(to keep out evil spirits.)

2196
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:02,750
As you see in the photo, you twist straw to the left to make the rope.

2197
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:04,790
(The rope is twisted to the left.)

2198
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,020
Then, you add pieces of paper and hang it on the door.

2199
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,420
(He has to attach it to a door.)

2200
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,420
- On any door? Like this one? - Yes.

2201
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,660
- Can it be on the inside? - Yes.

2202
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,360
- Oh, okay. This... - I'll give you the straw,

2203
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,490
traditional paper, and tape now.

2204
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:12,490
Okay.

2205
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:15,230
Do you know how to make rope?

2206
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:17,470
(Actual rice straw appears.)

2207
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,300
Wait, I'll try to make it.

2208
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:24,970
(Seok Jin recalls his memories from childhood.)

2209
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:23,470
What do I do after this? Do I use this?

2210
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:28,740
I switched with Ye Eun and got the colorful jeogori.

2211
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,310
(Is there anyone else who received a mission to ward off bad luck?)

2212
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,610
Let's get things organized and move on with the schedule.

2213
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:33,920
(They have a short break while the staff members eat.)

2214
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,180
Let's get organized.

2215
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,420
- I have constipation. - Oh, really?

2216
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,120
(Taking a picture)

2217
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,950
I'm sorry. What is she doing?

2218
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:37,990
(Taking a picture)

2219
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:41,020
- Eun Bi. - I thought I looked really cute.

2220
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,790
- Oh, you love yourself so much. - Eun Bi.

2221
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:43,960
- Jong Kook, take one with me. - Okay.

2222
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:48,960
(Those with funny makeup are taking selfies.)

2223
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,960
Jong Kook, this is no joke right now.

2224
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:51,970
Hang on. Isn't this a mission?

2225
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,400
- No, I really thought I was cute. - Hey, this is a mission.

2226
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,010
- Gosh, this is... Forget it. Stop. - But...

2227
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,870
(Eun Bi is suspicious no matter what she does.)

2228
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,140
- I just... - Hey, this is...

2229
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:01,140
- I nearly fell for it! No. - I'm really taking it...

2230
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,280
- because I'm cute! - No!

2231
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,950
- Gosh, this is... - You're the one who loves yourself.

2232
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,910
(Running away)

2233
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:05,950
Gosh, I almost...

2234
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:09,080
- I really just think I'm cute! - I almost fell for it!

2235
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:11,820
(Is it the hidden mission? She's busy taking selfies.)

2236
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,820
- Gosh, she's really smart. - Gosh, this is so awesome.

2237
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:15,960
(Haha gets started right away.)

2238
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,560
When will I write all of these?

2239
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,630
(Haha's mission: Write 4 Lucky Letters and deliver them.)

2240
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:20,760
Is there a door to go outside here?

2241
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,270
(He heads to the empty backyard.)

2242
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,940
This is going to drive me crazy. When will I write all of these?

2243
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,110
"It began..." Darn it.

2244
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:45,450
(He must write this long letter 4 times.)

2245
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,250
"In a year..."

2246
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:52,030
(He barely wrote enough to fill three lines.)

2247
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,220
When will I write all of these?

2248
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,890
It's too long.

2249
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:54,500
If you miss any words or get it wrong...

2250
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,730
(The two guys from Antenna meet up.)

2251
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,130
Hey.

2252
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:01,070
You, seriously... You helped Haha out?

2253
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,100
But Jae Seok, I can't help it.

2254
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:05,270
(His anger won't go away.)

2255
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,210
If you give me something this time...

2256
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:07,510
If you give me something this time, I'll tell you.

2257
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:09,410
- Okay. - I'll help you. I'm saying it now.

2258
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:12,480
(Is Yang Ssaeb going to cooperate with Jae Seok this time?)

2259
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,610
- All right. - I'll help you. For real this time.

2260
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:14,980
- Okay. - If you tell me, I'll help.

2261
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:17,920
(Will the Antenna Alliance work out?)

2262
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:18,620
Where is Haha?

2263
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,520
One second.

2264
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:25,460
(He goes to find Haha.)

2265
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,600
What are you doing?

2266
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:34,300
(An unexpected scene from a museum)

2267
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,700
What are you doing?

2268
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:38,740
(Seok Jin's mission: Twist a straw rope to the left and hang it up.)

2269
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:38,310
What? First, I have to twist a rope...

2270
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,980
(Surprised and spilling the beans)

2271
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:42,380
Just pretend like you didn't see anything for now.

2272
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:44,780
- Just... No, don't. - Seok Jin.

2273
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:46,950
Just don't do anything. For now...

2274
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:48,380
- Just do that for now, Seok Jin. - Anyway...

2275
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,650
It won't be easy.

2276
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:55,190
(He sets off to find Haha again out of respect for his elder.)

2277
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:57,960
(The back door is open.)

2278
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,630
(Spotting him right away)

2279
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:06,200
What are you doing?

2280
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:08,500
(Caught in the act)

2281
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,900
- I won't give it to you. - What is it?

2282
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,540
(He bumps into his old comrade.)

2283
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,100
- I won't give it to you. - Well, what is it?

2284
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,510
- Well, I just won't give it to you. - Hey.

2285
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,110
You know I'll rip it all up. What is it?

2286
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:14,980
- Just come here. - Well, I won't give it to you.

2287
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:17,410
- Jae Seok! - Hey, just hold on.

2288
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,150
- Did you really... - Why do you do that?

2289
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:20,580
- Do you want me to yell? - You became weird...

2290
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:21,920
- since you joined Antenna. - What?

2291
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,050
You didn't use to be like this. You were much closer to me.

2292
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:27,290
I can't let you succeed in this mission. Come on.

2293
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:28,860
(It turns into a childish lover's quarrel.)

2294
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:28,960
It's not about letting me succeed.

2295
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,690
I won't give it to Yu Jae Seok, the guy you cherish so much.

2296
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:32,860
- Jae Seok! - Hey. Just hold on.

2297
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,200
Hey, he's over here.

2298
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:35,260
(Right then)

2299
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,960
- Jae Seok! - Hey. Just hold on.

2300
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:39,400
(The real Jae Seok comes out.)

2301
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,200
- Hey, he's over here. - Hey.

2302
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,640
Ruin it completely!

2303
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:44,070
(He was brushing his teeth, burning with revenge.)

2304
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,370
He's over here, Jae Seok.

2305
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:44,510
Jae Seok, he was right here.

2306
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:45,970
- I won't give it to you. - He was here.

2307
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,410
- What is it? - For real. This is a lucky letter.

2308
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:49,380
- He's lying. - I won't give it to you. For real.

2309
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,410
- He's lying. - It's really a lucky letter. Look.

2310
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:52,450
- Let me see. - It is. See?

2311
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:54,920
- Let go of it. We can check. - It really is.

2312
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,780
(Jae Seok takes it in the end.)

2313
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,290
I just came outside to see what was up while brushing my teeth.

2314
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,820
(Mumbling)

2315
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,620
- Take it. - Yes, this letter...

2316
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:01,820
- But Jae Seok. - You have to rip it.

2317
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,220
No, don't rip it. Jae Seok!

2318
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,790
(Ripping)

2319
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:08,660
(He returns exactly what he received.)

2320
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:09,700
Hey, Antenna. We were a team. Hey.

2321
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,670
- Yang Se Chan. We were a team! - Rip it.

2322
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:14,370
(The original lucky letter)

2323
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,370
Hey.

2324
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,100
Just tear it all up, Jae Seok.

2325
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:21,280
(He rips the original letter into pieces and leaves.)

2326
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:19,970
He doesn't have anything now.

2327
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,150
(Picking up)

2328
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:25,850
Darn it.

2329
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,950
(Those adorable guys!)

2330
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:32,890
I can do the same and write on any white surface.

2331
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:35,960
Watch me.

2332
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:38,830
(He comes back inside with nothing.)

2333
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,530
I'm furious.

2334
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:41,430
Seriously, I'm so angry.

2335
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,400
Is there any tape?

2336
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:47,470
(He's trying to put the torn pieces together.)

2337
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,970
(Peekaboo again)

2338
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,340
Hey.

2339
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:54,110
- Hey, get lost. - Jae Seok!

2340
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:55,280
Hey, you...

2341
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,280
(When Se Chan sets off the alarm,)

2342
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,210
Jae Seok!

2343
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,210
I told you to get lost.

2344
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:00,110
- He actually came. - Look at him.

2345
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:02,250
(Clingy Jae Seok appears.)

2346
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,220
- Why do you keep coming? Move! - I mean...

2347
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,320
- Move! - Stay there.

2348
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:08,660
(He ran off as if he'd seen a ghost.)

2349
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,460
I'm so angry.

2350
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:13,790
Gosh, when will I write all of these?

2351
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,470
Writing one will be hard enough. Seriously.

2352
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:20,400
(He's getting exactly what he has done.)

2353
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,940
(Peeking)

2354
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:26,470
(Seok Jin becomes nervous as people shout outside.)

2355
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,210
I won't be able to do it here.

2356
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:27,610
I'll have to do it outside!

2357
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:33,380
(He escapes to the outdoor parking lot.)

2358
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:39,290
(He crosses the parking lot...)

2359
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,330
(and hides behind the prop truck.)

2360
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,930
It's hard to get started.

2361
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:52,400
(When he holds the straw, it's like a scene from a documentary.)

2362
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:59,370
(He works slowly as his body remembers.)

2363
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,310
I twist it to the left.

2364
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,180
It's coming along pretty well.

2365
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:10,790
(It's becoming a straw rope.)

2366
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,720
Look, it's coming along.

2367
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,590
It's coming along pretty well.

2368
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:13,590
It's my first time making it.

2369
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,860
(It's his first time twisting a straw rope.)

2370
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:17,930
The straw rope is coming along.

2371
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:20,130
(He's good!)

2372
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,430
Okay.

2373
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:21,860
- Seok Jin, you're good at it. - What?

2374
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,760
I know. It's my first time making it.

2375
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,530
(Amazed)

2376
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,900
I didn't know I had such a talent.

2377
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:32,370
(His hands remember his past life.)

2378
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:36,610
I just need to make it like this. I'll succeed in the mission.

2379
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:36,440
(Will Slave Jee be able to complete the best mission for him?)

2380
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,510
Seok Jin!

2381
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,950
Hey.

2382
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,090
(The mission destroyer finds him.)

2383
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,620
Just act like...

2384
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,520
- you haven't seen anything. - What?

2385
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,720
- You haven't seen anything. - Let me see it.

2386
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:50,590
- Show me what you have. - You haven't seen anything.

2387
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:52,360
- Show me before I shred it. - What?

2388
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,730
- I'll call them over. - What?

2389
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:55,760
- I'll call people over. - Don't do that.

2390
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:57,530
I still need to...

2391
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:59,130
Jae Seok!

2392
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,100
Hey!

2393
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,270
- What's wrong with you? - Jae Seok!

2394
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,540
It isn't like that.

2395
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:04,540
I still have a long way to go.

2396
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,010
(Se Chan doesn't let other people do a mission.)

2397
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:07,910
Come on.

2398
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:09,340
- Jae Seok! - This is... Hey.

2399
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:11,550
- I'll call him over. - It took me 30 minutes to do this.

2400
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:12,750
So hurry up and give it to me.

2401
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,750
- Jae Seok! - You can't take it.

2402
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:15,720
(He starts shouting again.)

2403
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,250
- Hurry up and give it to me. - Okay.

2404
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,850
- Let me run away. - Okay.

2405
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:20,250
(Pouty Mouth lets it slide, which is unusual.)

2406
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:18,890
Run away.

2407
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:20,220
- Let's make that situation. - Okay. Run away.

2408
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,420
I'll go after five seconds.

2409
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:23,490
He's here. Jae Seok is here.

2410
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,390
(Jae Seok is here.)

2411
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,960
He's here. Jae Seok is here.

2412
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:26,390
(Laughing)

2413
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,330
Hurry up.

2414
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,870
(Even Ye Eun joins in.)

2415
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:32,830
No!

2416
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:34,900
It took me so long to come this far.

2417
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,100
Bring scissors.

2418
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,240
Hey!

2419
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:40,070
(He steals the rope in the end.)

2420
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,540
- Scissors. - Bring scissors.

2421
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:42,010
(Laughing)

2422
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:41,680
That straw rope...

2423
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:46,280
Why is everyone going around with a flushed face?

2424
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,180
(Seok Jin loses his rope and returns with a flushed face.)

2425
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,220
By the way,

2426
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,420
are you brushing your teeth during the shoot?

2427
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:53,620
- Who? - Ji Hyo.

2428
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,160
- Brushing her teeth? - I'm...

2429
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,960
(Grabbing)

2430
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,530
- It's a mission, right? - Good.

2431
01:05:58,530 --> 01:05:59,860
- It's a mission, right? - No.

2432
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:02,500
- It has to be a mission! - Teeth-brushing isn't my mission!

2433
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,430
(He takes it out on Ji Hyo who's brushing her teeth.)

2434
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,300
- It has to be a mission! - I brush my teeth often!

2435
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:06,730
- No! - She was brushing...

2436
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:07,900
She was brushing... What's going on?

2437
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,400
Why are you carrying scissors?

2438
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,940
Everyone is acting strangely.

2439
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,870
(Lunatic)

2440
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,370
I'm going to cut everything.

2441
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:14,240
Why are you carrying scissors?

2442
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,840
(While everyone is crazy about the mission,)

2443
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:19,150
(Haha looks for a place to hide.)

2444
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:21,320
(Glancing over)

2445
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,920
(He approaches a parked car.)

2446
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:29,790
(He goes inside the car to stay out of sight.)

2447
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:32,960
When will I write this?

2448
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,300
I'll write it no matter what.

2449
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:42,040
(While Haha writes letters in hiding)

2450
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:45,310
Where's Haha?

2451
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:48,040
- We need to catch Haha. - Where did he go?

2452
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:51,250
(Protruded Brothers begin to search for Haha.)

2453
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,220
(Haha inside the car, Jae Seok and Se Chan)

2454
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:58,890
(They turn in Haha's direction.)

2455
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,220
Where is he?

2456
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:00,990
Where is he?

2457
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:03,660
(They begin to run.)

2458
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,230
(Anxious)

2459
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:14,970
You won't be able to do it either.

2460
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:18,540
(Will he be able to write the letters before getting caught?)

2461
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:24,150
(He needs to finish writing the letters before getting caught!)

2462
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:28,320
You won't be able to do it either.

2463
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:29,950
(Jae Seok is out for blood.)

2464
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:33,550
(Haha is determined to succeed in the mission.)

2465
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,660
All right.

2466
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,860
(I found you, Ha Dong Hoon.)

2467
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:40,060
This letter...

2468
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,900
- Haha. - Hold on!

2469
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:46,270
- Haha. - Hold on!

2470
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,340
(In a rush)

2471
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,700
Hold on!

2472
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:48,940
Hold on! Let's do this.

2473
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:52,210
(He's totally insane.)

2474
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,840
I won't do anything to the two of you.

2475
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,670
Hold on. I won't do anything to the two of you.

2476
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:53,910
I mean it. I swear.

2477
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:55,040
I mean it.

2478
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,650
(In the end, he loses his letters.)

2479
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:56,440
Hey.

2480
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:59,480
Se Chan, rip them up.

2481
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:01,780
Hey!

2482
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:03,580
(Ripping)

2483
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,080
Hey!

2484
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:05,250
Hey!

2485
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:08,460
Hey!

2486
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:10,930
(Haha's blood, sweat, and tears scatter in the air.)

2487
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,230
(Upset)

2488
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,230
(Picking up)

2489
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:21,940
(He picks up the pieces in case Haha tapes them together.)

2490
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:27,110
(Meanwhile, Haha runs with the original.)

2491
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:33,810
(He hurriedly hides behind a car.)

2492
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,450
(Screaming)

2493
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:36,780
Why did you follow me?

2494
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,650
- Se Chan! - For goodness' sake!

2495
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:40,150
- Se Chan! - Yes?

2496
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:42,220
(The brothers are persistent.)

2497
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,890
- Hurry over here. - Where are you?

2498
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,390
Where are you?

2499
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:45,360
(He shoves the original letter into his pants.)

2500
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,130
- What are you doing? - Take it out.

2501
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,230
Take it out. It's down there.

2502
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:50,970
It's inside his pants.

2503
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,500
- Okay. - It's by the left leg.

2504
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:54,400
Let go of me!

2505
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,940
Let go of me, you Antenna punks!

2506
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,110
(Poking)

2507
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,470
Let go of me!

2508
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,580
No!

2509
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:08,380
(The original letter gets destroyed as well.)

2510
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,020
No, Se Chan!

2511
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:10,820
No, Se Chan!

2512
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:15,520
(Rummaging)

2513
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,790
(Annoyed)

2514
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:16,960
- Let go! - Letter writing paper.

2515
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:18,730
- There's nothing. - Letter writing paper.

2516
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:20,030
(Thorough)

2517
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:20,360
- Letter writing paper. - There's nothing.

2518
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:23,230
You evil villains!

2519
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:24,830
(Haha loses everything due to Protruded Brothers.)

2520
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,370
I can't believe it.

2521
01:09:25,570 --> 01:09:26,570
What's going on?

2522
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:28,100
- What did you do with my straw? - Why?

2523
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,540
(Seok Sam, another victim, is here.)

2524
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,400
- Hurry up and bring my straw. - Why would I do that?

2525
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,740
- What did you do with my straw? - It was so funny...

2526
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,710
(Victim 1, Victim 2)

2527
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:34,840
to see you twist a straw rope by yourself.

2528
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:36,580
Was he twisting a straw rope?

2529
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:38,410
Seok Jin is good at it.

2530
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,380
- It's because he has done it. - It's because he's ancient.

2531
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,450
He's good at it.

2532
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:43,020
He does this with his legs.

2533
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,150
(But Slave Jee's challenge was moving.)

2534
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:44,990
- He does this. Yes. - Really?

2535
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:46,050
It's impressive.

2536
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:47,490
Let's disperse.

2537
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:48,960
Okay. Do your thing, Seok Jin.

2538
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,960
It's reorganization time now.

2539
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:53,360
The orientation schedule will begin in ten minutes.

2540
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:55,500
- Is it time for reorganization? - You'll have a mission later.

2541
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,660
Now isn't the time.

2542
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:58,370
- Now isn't the time. - Okay.

2543
01:09:58,370 --> 01:09:59,400
- Now isn't the time. - I see.

2544
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,400
(It's an official break.)

2545
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,430
- It's a break. - It's a break.

2546
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,640
- It's a break. - I see.

2547
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:06,570
(Will they be able to rest?)

2548
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,200
Since it's a break,

2549
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,210
- don't do a mission. - Okay. Of course not.

2550
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:06,970
- Get some rest. - Don't do a mission.

2551
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,680
(The running tricksters finally brush their teeth.)

2552
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:13,810
How nice.

2553
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:15,520
All right.

2554
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:19,020
Everyone is busy, but I'm going to get some rest.

2555
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:22,760
(They start taking a rest.)

2556
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,420
Get some rest, Ji Hyo.

2557
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:23,390
It's flat

2558
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,570
(One person is still walking around.)

2559
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:32,600
I need to take out...

2560
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,070
- It's in the makeup room. - my straw.

2561
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:35,300
- Why? - A tiger is guarding it.

2562
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,370
Why is Jong Kook there?

2563
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,970
(His straw is right next to the tiger.)

2564
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:43,610
(For goodness' sake)

2565
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:45,010
Let's look for the straw Jae Seok took.

2566
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,920
It's smooth

2567
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:52,320
(He decides to look for the straw Jae Seok took.)

2568
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,290
It's flat

2569
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:59,860
Why am I not getting any cameramen?

2570
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:03,960
(He does the mission by himself without the cameras.)

2571
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:05,970
How will I...

2572
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,040
How will I find the straw?

2573
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:10,400
(But he can't find straw anywhere.)

2574
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:14,710
(Seok Sam returns to the waiting room in the end.)

2575
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:14,910
- Seok Jin, you must be cold. - What?

2576
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:18,650
- What? - What?

2577
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,050
(Approaching)

2578
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:20,250
- There's straw. - You keep... What?

2579
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:21,850
What are you doing? What?

2580
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:24,350
(He makes a bold move in front of everyone.)

2581
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:23,480
- Seok Jin, if you take it... - You're taking it.

2582
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:24,820
Seok Jin, it's breaktime.

2583
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,620
- We'll go once you're nearly done. - No.

2584
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:28,320
(If you take it now)

2585
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,690
It'll be fun for us to destroy it...

2586
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:30,220
- if you've worked hard on it. - Yes.

2587
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:31,430
How aggravating.

2588
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:33,690
Why are all of them there?

2589
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:35,860
I can't even use the restroom.

2590
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,270
I just need to stay hidden.

2591
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:40,330
I just need to stay hidden.

2592
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:43,970
(He plans to hide well so that they can't take it.)

2593
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:43,640
Gosh.

2594
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,280
(He looks for a place no one will find.)

2595
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:55,880
(Seok Jin sits down behind an empty building.)

2596
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:55,650
I don't know.

2597
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:58,190
There isn't much time, right?

2598
01:11:57,250 --> 01:12:00,690
(There are about 7 minutes left for the break.)

2599
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,920
There isn't much time.

2600
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,160
I'll finish it...

2601
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:04,360
(He's planning to finish making the rope in the meantime.)

2602
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:03,920
before they come.

2603
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:09,560
(He begins to get to work.)

2604
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:11,670
(Groaning)

2605
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:13,400
(Now that he's used to it,)

2606
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:16,170
(he can make the straw rope quickly.)

2607
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,500
I need to hurry up.

2608
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:18,710
I must've twisted a lot of ropes in my past life.

2609
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:22,080
(Twisting with the memory from the past life)

2610
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,210
Let's twist it.

2611
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,010
(The last rope of hope)

2612
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:24,650
Come on.

2613
01:12:25,150 --> 01:12:27,820
Why am I so good at lengthening it?

2614
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:28,450
(Amazed at himself)

2615
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:29,880
Look at this.

2616
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,650
(It's grown more than two hand-widths.)

2617
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:33,290
I need to get it to a certain length to win.

2618
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:36,160
I'm definitely good at this.

2619
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,430
(Will he be able to protect it until the end?)

2620
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:41,700
(Meanwhile, Haha)

2621
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,870
Would you hide me in here?

2622
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:47,570
Please shut the door.

2623
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:49,770
(Haha hides in the truck.)

2624
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,270
Hurry up and get in.

2625
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:50,440
What will you write?

2626
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:51,840
The lucky letters.

2627
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,210
With the photo you took?

2628
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:55,580
- With the photo you took? - He needs to get in.

2629
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:57,180
(Did he take a photo of the lucky letter?)

2630
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,010
Please shut the door.

2631
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:59,080
I'll take a photo.

2632
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,780
One, two...

2633
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,320
(Haha took a photo of the letter before the letter was torn.)

2634
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:07,020
- Shut the door. - I'll do that.

2635
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:08,820
(Haha will try again by writing the words in the photo.)

2636
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,660
(He hides perfectly behind closed doors.)

2637
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,190
All right.

2638
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:11,730
- Do you have a pen? - We hid together.

2639
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:14,130
(Haha has no intention to give up.)

2640
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:12,930
A pen?

2641
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,260
- Where is Haha? - Where is he?

2642
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,600
(Right then)

2643
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,000
(Protruded Brothers have smelled Haha who's gone.)

2644
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:19,330
Where did Haha go?

2645
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,170
He didn't go to do the mission, did he?

2646
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:23,100
Where did Haha go?

2647
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,670
(Startled)

2648
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:25,010
He didn't go to do the mission, did he?

2649
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,570
Gosh, is he in his car?

2650
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,940
- He isn't in his car. - No?

2651
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:29,940
No.

2652
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:34,350
(They circle the truck in which Haha is hiding.)

2653
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,220
What exactly is his mission?

2654
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,450
He needs to write something.

2655
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:37,720
- Really? - I don't know.

2656
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:39,550
Jae Seok, I'll call you if I find him.

2657
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:42,220
(Protruded Brothers leave without finding him.)

2658
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:40,690
Okay. Let me know.

2659
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,320
(Thank goodness.)

2660
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,760
(However,)

2661
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,000
(the truck door opens.)

2662
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
(Peek-a-boo)

2663
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:56,740
- Jae Seok! - Yes?

2664
01:13:58,470 --> 01:13:59,510
What are you doing?

2665
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,010
You were in here.

2666
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:04,950
(They'll chase him to the end of the earth.)

2667
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:06,480
(The letters get confiscated.)

2668
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:07,010
You little...

2669
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,380
You little...

2670
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:13,020
You should stop already, okay?

2671
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,360
(The unsent letters get confiscated again.)

2672
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:15,060
You should stop already.

2673
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,760
Life is all about challenging yourself...

2674
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:20,490
and finding the will to do something.

2675
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:22,100
That's why I'm doing this.

2676
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:23,800
When you have the will,

2677
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:25,100
(Father Seok Sam is realizing the meaning of life...)

2678
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,900
there's nothing you can't do.

2679
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:27,130
(while twisting the rope.)

2680
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:27,940
Look at this.

2681
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:30,340
(He's almost done with the straw rope.)

2682
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,970
I just need to trim it.

2683
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:33,540
I just need to trim it. Look at this.

2684
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:35,810
I just need to trim it.

2685
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:38,250
(He's skilled in trimming as well.)

2686
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:38,280
Here. See? I'm trimming it.

2687
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:44,520
- Jae Seok! - For goodness' sake! Hey!

2688
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,650
(Se Chan appears.)

2689
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,990
Jae Seok!

2690
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:47,690
All right.

2691
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:50,120
Hey, I'll give you 20 dollars.

2692
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,660
- What? - I'll give you actual money.

2693
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,030
Jae Seok!

2694
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,030
I'll give you 30 dollars.

2695
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,060
Jae Seok!

2696
01:14:55,230 --> 01:14:57,400
(Jae Seok appears while he negotiates.)

2697
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:59,530
You monsters!

2698
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,570
I put so much work into it.

2699
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,940
(Dangling)

2700
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,110
Let's take him.

2701
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:10,380
You monsters!

2702
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:10,540
(Taking him with the twisted straw rope)

2703
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:11,710
Do you have a lighter?

2704
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:14,110
No!

2705
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:16,980
- He's good at twisting ropes. - No!

2706
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:18,820
(My precious straw rope...)

2707
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,720
- How did he do it? - Seriously.

2708
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,790
Isn't it what you get at a store?

2709
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:21,490
- I... - Take it.

2710
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:21,760
(It gets stolen in the end.)

2711
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:27,030
(Since he failed the mission, he'll make sure everyone fails.)

2712
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:30,730
Who knew I'd be so good at it?

2713
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:31,160
(He gets separated from his straw rope.)

2714
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:32,030
- We'll move. - Okay.

2715
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:33,970
(The break is over.)

2716
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:33,970
- We'll move. - I give up.

2717
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,500
(Running University Orientation Schedule)

2718
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,240
Is the break over?

2719
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,400
- Okay. - I didn't even use the restroom.

2720
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:38,340
(Improving physical fitness)

2721
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,970
Is it over? Will the shoot resume?

2722
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,510
- When Team Antenna catches you... - Team Antenna.

2723
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:42,140
(Gossiping before the next schedule)

2724
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:42,040
When Team Antenna catches you,

2725
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,410
- you can't do anything. - Antenna is cutthroat.

2726
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:46,010
I can't do anything because of the Antenna punks.

2727
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:46,610
(Sick and tired)

2728
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,380
- Antenna. - Antenna members...

2729
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:49,680
(The straw rope old man is upset.)

2730
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:48,580
- formed a team. - The two of them...

2731
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,050
- Team Antenna. - Seriously.

2732
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,890
When a strong one and a speedy one team up...

2733
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,620
(The group of victims)

2734
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:53,390
Seriously. The two of them...

2735
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:54,520
We need to get one of them.

2736
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,960
Are you working on your mission?

2737
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,360
- Haha is done. - I'm done.

2738
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,960
- It's over, right? - No.

2739
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:58,960
(To the crew)

2740
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,860
We didn't tell you that it was over.

2741
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:03,500
(They can go for the hidden mission until the end.)

2742
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,460
- Okay. - Okay.

2743
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:04,730
- Let's keep trying. - Okay.

2744
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,100
(What will be their ending?)

2745
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,270
I don't think it'll lead to a good result.

2746
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:08,840
Does anyone want water?

2747
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:09,970
(Haha wets his throat.)

2748
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:13,140
(Coughing)

2749
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,710
You choke on things more often when you age.

2750
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:20,480
Aged people cough when they eat tiramisu.

2751
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:25,920
(At that moment)

2752
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:32,490
(Haha spots a green bottle with the R mark.)

2753
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:32,860
What's that?

2754
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,230
I don't know. It was here. It has the R mark.

2755
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:37,030
Hide it. Put it somewhere up there.

2756
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:42,440
(Is it someone's hidden mission?)

2757
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,600
There's a way.

2758
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,700
What's this?

2759
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:42,200
This is...

2760
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:45,910
Throw away the water.

2761
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:50,540
(He empties the water onto the floor.)

2762
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:51,880
Does it belong to anyone?

2763
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:53,050
What's that?

2764
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:56,350
(He asks the entire group.)

2765
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:55,020
- Does it belong to anyone? - What's that?

2766
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,180
There's the R mark.

2767
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:57,820
- Haha found it. - Isn't it Ji Hyo's?

2768
01:16:58,420 --> 01:16:59,850
I think it's Ji Hyo's. It's a soju bottle.

2769
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:02,790
(Is it a mission for Ji Hyo since she loves to drink?)

2770
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:01,520
Where did you find it?

2771
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,760
- I emptied it. - The next orientation schedule...

2772
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,890
(They carry out the mission for now.)

2773
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,830
is the Neck-and-Neck Dice of Luck.

2774
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:10,330
(Neck-and-Neck Dice of Luck)

2775
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:08,930
- What's that? - What's that?

2776
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:11,330
- You'll be divided into two teams. - Okay.

2777
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,730
Each team will send out...

2778
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,700
- two representatives. - Okay.

2779
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:18,070
Everyone will be tied at the waist.

2780
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:20,310
(They will be tied at the waist on the soapy floor.)

2781
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:20,370
They'll be tied,

2782
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:22,440
and there'll be balloons.

2783
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,780
Inside each balloon is a dice.

2784
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:25,910
My goodness.

2785
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:27,150
When you pop a balloon,

2786
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:28,780
- you'll get a dice. - I see.

2787
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:30,220
Bring the dice...

2788
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:33,050
to the front and throw it inside...

2789
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:34,690
- your section. - You throw it.

2790
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,720
If you roll the dice...

2791
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,820
(Team Red, Team Blue)

2792
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,430
inside your section,

2793
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:41,230
the number will get added...

2794
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:43,260
to the team's score.

2795
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:46,270
- If a team gets 25 points 1st, - My goodness.

2796
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:48,340
- the round will end. - Those are many points.

2797
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:49,770
- There'll be two rounds. - Okay.

2798
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:52,070
The team with a higher score will win.

2799
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:54,110
Is it okay if the dice go to the neighboring section?

2800
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,480
If you throw them badly...

2801
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,480
and they enter the other team's section,

2802
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,010
their score will go up.

2803
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,010
That'll be the worst.

2804
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:02,120
- That'll be the worst. - We'll need to throw...

2805
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,380
- carefully. - It'll be the most aggravating.

2806
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:05,290
- That'll be the worst. - It sounds hard.

2807
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:07,420
(They're divided into teams of 4.)

2808
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:07,520
- Come up with 2 teams of 4. - Shall we do that?

2809
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:11,320
(Team Blue, Team Red)

2810
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,920
- Eun Bi is strong. - Eun Bi is really strong.

2811
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,160
- Eun Bi and Ye Eun. - Okay.

2812
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,560
- Okay. - Go to the same team.

2813
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:14,830
(They put in protective gear.)

2814
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,160
"Underwater."

2815
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:16,660
- These socks are nice. - It isn't Se Chan's.

2816
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:17,830
(The green bottle)

2817
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,200
It isn't my mission.

2818
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,100
What?

2819
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:22,470
Okay!

2820
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:27,370
(Haha suddenly comes outside.)

2821
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,650
Why do I keep seeing this mark?

2822
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:34,450
(This time, he finds a wine bottle with the R mark.)

2823
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:37,220
Why do I keep seeing objects with the R mark?

2824
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:38,250
Let me see it.

2825
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:40,520
Why do I keep seeing objects with the R mark?

2826
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,590
Let me see it.

2827
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,460
- For goodness' sake. - What's that?

2828
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:44,560
Someone needs to break it.

2829
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,460
- Hold on. - There's water inside.

2830
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,960
(He pours out the water again.)

2831
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:51,030
- Why are you touching my thing? - Is it yours?

2832
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:51,730
(Getting angry)

2833
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:52,830
What is it for?

2834
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:54,770
(Is it Eun Bi's hidden mission?)

2835
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:58,170
I switched it with Seok Jin's. What is it?

2836
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:57,740
(Eun Bi picked a gold item.)

2837
01:18:58,410 --> 01:19:00,310
- "You are lucky." - Gosh.

2838
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:02,610
(Eun Bi's hidden mission involved drinking water in liquor bottles!)

2839
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:02,010
Is it French?

2840
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,380
(French tradition of bringing good luck...)

2841
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:04,640
There's water inside the liquor bottles?

2842
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:06,050
(by drinking all the liquor in the house...)

2843
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:07,550
Inside the liquor bottles? Where are the liquor bottles?

2844
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:07,850
(in the new year.)

2845
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:10,680
(Including the bottles Haha has found,)

2846
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:10,250
- In here? - Yes.

2847
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:13,890
(there are a total of 12 bottles filled with water.)

2848
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:12,620
Yes.

2849
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,790
(She needs to drink 5 or more to succeed in the mission!)

2850
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,090
Okay.

2851
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:22,330
(Eun Bi already lost 2 bottles. Will she be able to succeed in it?)

2852
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:19,260
There's the R mark.

2853
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:23,360
Send out two players from each team.

2854
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,400
- Seok Jin and I will enter. - Yes.

2855
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:26,100
(Round 1 player sets off.)

2856
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,470
Okay.

2857
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:28,970
It'll be a waste of talent if you play against Seok Jin.

2858
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:31,370
That's right. It'll be a waste of talent.

2859
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,410
That's annoying.

2860
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:33,840
Hey, come on out. Crawl here.

2861
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,380
Seok Jin versus me.

2862
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,510
- Ji Hyo. - Eun Bi versus Ji Hyo.

2863
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,680
(Seok Sam, Ji Hyo versus Jae Seok, Eun Bi)

2864
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:37,940
- They have power. - We have a chance of winning.

2865
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:38,950
Blue?

2866
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:41,080
(There will be a total of 2 rounds.)

2867
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:40,780
- From here... - We're Team Blue.

2868
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:42,920
- Avoid Team Red's section. - Mr. Power, let's go!

2869
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:44,220
(The team with a higher score of Rounds 1 and 2 will win.)

2870
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,150
Let's go!

2871
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:45,920
- If you're ready, - Okay.

2872
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,560
(Ready)

2873
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,990
- we'll begin. - The body weight...

2874
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:50,520
Ready, set...

2875
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:53,230
(Start)

2876
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:52,790
Ouch.

2877
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:55,360
Ouch.

2878
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:57,400
Get down.

2879
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,900
(It's neck and neck.)

2880
01:19:58,270 --> 01:19:59,570
There's more weight.

2881
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:01,300
- Pull together. - Don't do that.

2882
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:02,400
Come on!

2883
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:03,700
- Pull together. - Seok Jin,
- hurry up. - Ji Hyo is too strong.

2884
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:05,910
- Come here. - Pull.

2885
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:06,940
Seok Jin, pull.

2886
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:08,280
(Pulling)

2887
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,480
- Where is it? - Let's go.

2888
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,210
(Ji Hyo uses her muscles.)

2889
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:10,710
What are you doing?

2890
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,210
- Pull together. - What are you doing, Eun Bi?

2891
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:15,550
- The weight classes... - They aren't the same.

2892
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:17,080
They're in the heavyweight class.

2893
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:18,820
(Right then, Jae Seok counterattacks.)

2894
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,720
Good. Eun Bi, bring it.

2895
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:21,120
Good. Eun Bi, bring it.

2896
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,890
- Bring it. - You need to pull.

2897
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,960
(Dragged)

2898
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,190
- Eun Bi, bring it. - They aren't...

2899
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,590
(Strong Ji Hyo takes over in a second.)

2900
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:25,960
- They aren't heavy enough. - Hey.

2901
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,800
Jae Seok is getting dragged by Ji Hyo.

2902
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:30,500
(Giving an excuse)

2903
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,060
It's so slippery.

2904
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,070
Ji Hyo.

2905
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:35,640
(Laughing)

2906
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:35,500
Right now...

2907
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,070
Why is Ji Hyo so strong?

2908
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,640
Why is Ji Hyo so strong?

2909
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,770
(Team Blue gets close to the balloons.)

2910
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:40,670
- Collapse. - Come on.

2911
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:41,940
- No! - Eun Bi.

2912
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:43,310
(Popping)

2913
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:45,280
(Seok Sam gets the green die.)

2914
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:44,810
Come here.

2915
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:46,710
- No! - You know,

2916
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:48,080
- you can steal it. - Steal it.

2917
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:48,380
(Ji Hyo got it too.)

2918
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,180
- Steal it. - Steal it.

2919
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:50,650
- You can steal it. - Steal it.

2920
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:52,590
(She ate it?)

2921
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,450
- It'll be better to steal it. - That's right.

2922
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:53,520
What is Ji Hyo eating?

2923
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:55,660
Ji Hyo put it in her mouth!

2924
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:56,890
- Hold on. - Ji Hyo is eating something.

2925
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,830
It'll be better to steal it.

2926
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,160
(Popping)

2927
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,090
(Meanwhile, Seok Sam popped another balloon.)

2928
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:00,860
I don't know.

2929
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:04,660
No, you can't take it.

2930
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,170
(Jae Seok stole it.)

2931
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:07,630
- You can't take it. - She put it in her mouth.

2932
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:10,400
(He steals a blue die from Seok Jin.)

2933
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,100
- Steal it. - We're allowed to steal it.

2934
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,340
- No. - We're allowed to steal it.

2935
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,570
(He throws it!)

2936
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:16,640
(5 points)

2937
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:21,050
(Ji Hyo takes it out of her mouth and throws it.)

2938
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:20,750
- Throw it. - Be careful.

2939
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:23,480
- Throw it. - Be careful.

2940
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:25,190
It went in.

2941
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:26,420
Okay!

2942
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,120
(Oh, no)

2943
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,960
It went in. Okay!

2944
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,590
(She gave 4 points to the other team.)

2945
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,290
It's a success.

2946
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:31,630
Okay!

2947
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:35,430
(Round 1 score, Team Blue: 0 versus Team Red: 9)

2948
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:33,760
It's a success.

2949
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,030
- It needs to go into our section. - I mean...

2950
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:36,260
- Good. - I got it.

2951
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:39,200
(Right then, Seok Sam gets ready to throw a die.)

2952
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,370
Good.

2953
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:39,900
Seok Jin, get closer.

2954
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:41,870
(He throws it carefully.)

2955
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:42,070
Hey.

2956
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:45,240
(Team Blue, Team Red)

2957
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:44,270
- Hey. - Eun Bi, be careful.

2958
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,610
(What?)

2959
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:46,870
Eun Bi, be careful.

2960
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:49,340
(This time, Jae Seok makes a mistake!)

2961
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:51,380
(Eun Bi makes a mistake as well.)

2962
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:51,440
Don't throw it there.

2963
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:54,910
(Jae Seok gave 6 points to the other team.)

2964
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:55,650
Don't throw it there.

2965
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:57,180
- Eun Bi. - Hurry up.

2966
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:59,220
(Thanks to that, Team Blue turned the tables.)

2967
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,550
Eun Bi, give it here.

2968
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,490
- Give it here. - I'm exhausted.

2969
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:03,190
Give it here.

2970
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:03,160
(Seok Jin pops a balloon.)

2971
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:06,890
(Jae Seok steals it!)

2972
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,030
Seok Jin is so...

2973
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,900
- Where did it go? - Seok Jin is so...

2974
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,600
- Forget it. - Eun Bi, give it to me.

2975
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:12,930
(Eun Bi has a die in her hands too.)

2976
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:12,970
- Here. - Dunk it.

2977
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:15,140
- Jae Seok, it's here. - Eun Bi, give it to me.

2978
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,900
- Hold on. - Throw it.

2979
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:18,140
(Ji Hyo took it!)

2980
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,770
You have to throw the die!

2981
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,540
(There are many pips on the die!)

2982
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:21,740
Throw it!

2983
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:24,010
You have to throw the die!

2984
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:25,780
(She puts it in her mouth.)

2985
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:26,080
No way. She put it in her mouth.

2986
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,710
- If you put it in the mouth... - That's cool.

2987
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,920
- Right. - Amazing. I can't argue with that.

2988
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:30,350
(A dragon going forward with the pearl)

2989
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,250
- Ji Hyo is amazing. - I'm impressed.

2990
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:33,750
(Dragging the three people)

2991
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,990
- She's pulling three people. - I'm so impressed!

2992
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:35,320
She's pulling three people.

2993
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:36,560
I can't believe she put it in her mouth.

2994
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,660
(Grabbing the mat)

2995
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,460
- Spit it out. - You're doing great!

2996
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:39,460
- Ji Hyo... - Okay, throw it!

2997
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:41,090
(Pulling with all her might)

2998
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:40,930
- Throw it like a hydra! - Spit it out!

2999
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:41,960
Spit it out!

3000
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,100
Ji Hyo is really amazing.

3001
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,570
Go!

3002
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:47,370
Go a bit further!

3003
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:47,470
(Right when she took out the die,)

3004
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:49,540
(Jae Seok tries to interrupt.)

3005
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:49,670
- No. Aim lower. - Goodness.

3006
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,440
Throw it!

3007
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,470
(She threw the die!)

3008
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:54,240
(Team Blue, Team Red)

3009
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:56,210
(It went right into Team Blue's square.)

3010
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,440
- Okay. Nice. - Well done.

3011
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:59,410
(Round 1 scores: Team Blue: 22, Team Red: 9)

3012
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,710
- Nice. - Good!

3013
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:01,080
- Well done. - Nice.

3014
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,320
- Nice. - Good!

3015
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:03,520
(Clumsy Jae Seok fails to throw it.)

3016
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:03,850
There are more balloons.

3017
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:07,990
(The round will end if Team Blue scores 3 more points.)

3018
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:09,890
Look at Ji Hyo.

3019
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,490
(Shouting)

3020
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:14,360
- Hold on. - Seok Jin has got power!

3021
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:16,260
(The icon of self-care squeezes out all his strength.)

3022
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:18,160
You're good. You're really young.

3023
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,670
Here!

3024
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,100
(He acquires the die with 12 dots.)

3025
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,940
(While Jae Seok is held captive by Ji Hyo)

3026
01:23:25,070 --> 01:23:27,070
- It's really scary. - Ji Hyo.

3027
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,980
(Seok Sam gets ready to throw.)

3028
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:28,740
- No. - Throw it from there.

3029
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:31,280
- You shouldn't do it like that. - You have to throw the die.

3030
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:33,050
(If he throws it in, the round ends!)

3031
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,350
No!

3032
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,380
No!

3033
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:36,780
Okay!

3034
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:37,880
(It went in!)

3035
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,180
- No! - Okay!

3036
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:41,760
(Round 1 scores: Team Blue: 34, Team Red: 9)

3037
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:39,350
Nice.

3038
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:41,860
- Team Blue won. - Yes!

3039
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:43,020
- Okay! - Yes!

3040
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,960
(Team Blue takes the lead with a wide score gap.)

3041
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,760
Yes!

3042
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,460
- It's... - Ji Hyo is too strong.

3043
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:48,090
Ji Hyo is on another level.

3044
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:49,630
(Ji Hyo played a big part in putting them in 1st place.)

3045
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:49,530
Can you play one more game, Ji Hyo?

3046
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:50,760
- Go on, you can do it. - Okay.

3047
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:51,770
(She makes it to the final round again.)

3048
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,770
- Ji Hyo. - Will Ji Hyo play again?

3049
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,500
- Ye Eun should go. - Ye Eun.

3050
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:56,700
(The long-legged Ye Eun is up against her.)

3051
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,370
- Ye Eun! - Come on, Ji Ye Eun.

3052
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:58,640
You have to rise above Ji Hyo!

3053
01:23:58,640 --> 01:23:59,870
- Don't be afraid. - Ji Hyo...

3054
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:01,170
Come out, Ji Ye Eun!

3055
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,710
She's a strong woman.

3056
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:05,580
- That's it. Gosh... - It's really hard.

3057
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:09,150
(The gibbon warms up.)

3058
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:08,380
- What... - It's really hard.

3059
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:13,450
Nice. That's nice.

3060
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:15,320
(Warming up in a weird pose)

3061
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:14,990
- What... - Nice!

3062
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,290
- What is that? - You're stretching well.

3063
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,860
(Trainer Kook is satisfied.)

3064
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:19,290
Nice. Nice!

3065
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:25,270
(Just as Giant finished her noisy warm-up...)

3066
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:24,800
- I have to warm up. - You should, or you'll get hurt.

3067
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,530
I'll get cramps.

3068
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:30,740
(Haha crawled out again.)

3069
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:29,970
What is he up to?

3070
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:32,270
- He's doing something. - He went to write the letter.

3071
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:34,740
- It's not easy. - There's no writing paper.

3072
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:38,750
(Ha Dong Hoon doesn't give up.)

3073
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:39,980
Come here.

3074
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,220
(Inspector Jae Seok sets out again.)

3075
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:42,480
- Haha. - Okay.

3076
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,020
Come here.

3077
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:48,020
(That moment)

3078
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:47,420
Really?

3079
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,860
(Find and drink 5 out of 12 liquor bottles filled with water)

3080
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,290
Really?

3081
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:52,760
(Kwon Eun Bi secretly started her mission.)

3082
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,660
(She downs it without hesitation.)

3083
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,470
There are many liquor bottles.

3084
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,100
(She found the second bottle.)

3085
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:11,740
(She found the third bottle in the drawer.)

3086
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:20,020
(She quickly emptied 4 bottles!)

3087
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:19,390
When are they coming?

3088
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:21,590
"When are they coming?"

3089
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:22,720
Come inside.

3090
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:26,730
(Right then, the letter phising man is caught.)

3091
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:24,960
Stop doing this now.

3092
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:26,630
All right.

3093
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:28,800
Where are you going? What is this?

3094
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:30,330
(Eun Bi stops her mission midway.)

3095
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,830
- What is this? - What is this?

3096
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:32,300
Are you looking for items with the R sticker?

3097
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:37,470
(Will she be able to finish the remaining bottle and succeed?)

3098
01:25:33,470 --> 01:25:34,530
The last game.

3099
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:36,970
We should play the game. Come on!

3100
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,470
- You should be here when we play. - You should be here when we play.

3101
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,370
(The dragged Round 2 begins.)

3102
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:41,010
Let's begin the mission.

3103
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:42,480
- The second round. - Get ready.

3104
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:44,910
(Round 2: Se Chan and Ji Hyo veruss Jong Kook and Ye Eun)

3105
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,810
Ready, set...

3106
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:46,780
(Start)

3107
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:47,780
- Let's go! - Join forces!

3108
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:49,020
Pull together!

3109
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,280
(Shouting)

3110
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:51,480
Pull together!

3111
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,250
- Go. - One, two, three!

3112
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,420
Go first!

3113
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:56,660
Shorten your grip.

3114
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:57,520
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo are pulling,)

3115
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,330
(but Jong Kook doesn't move.)

3116
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:59,160
Shorten your grip.

3117
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,090
Take it from him.

3118
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,430
(They already got the first die.)

3119
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,260
- Where is it? - Jong Kook.

3120
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:05,060
That's an important die!

3121
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:09,200
(Ye Eun is hanging like a knot.)

3122
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:07,200
- It's important. - What are you doing, Ye Eun?

3123
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:09,500
What are you doing, Ye Eun?

3124
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,370
That's right.

3125
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:14,770
(Ssaebssaeb changed his plan.)

3126
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:15,510
That's right.

3127
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,380
Okay. He got it.

3128
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,910
(Going for the balloon on the side)

3129
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:25,120
(He failed to throw it because of Jong Kook.)

3130
01:26:26,290 --> 01:26:27,920
(Jong Kook is already on his 3rd balloon.)

3131
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:31,060
(Right then, Se Chan gets eliminated.)

3132
01:26:29,290 --> 01:26:30,390
Darn it.

3133
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:35,360
(Jong Kook comes with 3 dice.)

3134
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,860
- Where do we throw it from? - Stop him.

3135
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:35,800
- The red one. - Is ours red or blue?

3136
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,430
Is ours red?

3137
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:39,570
(He throws it.)

3138
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:39,030
- Okay. Nice. - The red one.

3139
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:40,470
Nice!

3140
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,340
No one is interfering.

3141
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:46,570
Okay. Nice.

3142
01:26:46,770 --> 01:26:51,580
(He comfortably throws them like tossing lucky coins.)

3143
01:26:46,770 --> 01:26:47,910
Nice!

3144
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,140
No one is interfering.

3145
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,810
Nice. Nice!

3146
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:53,110
(Struggling)

3147
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:56,650
(Round 2 scores: Team Blue: 0, Team Red: 8)

3148
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:55,620
No one is stopping me.

3149
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:59,390
(Meanwhile, Team Blue is struggling.)

3150
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,490
Come on!

3151
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:00,550
You're doing well!

3152
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:01,890
You're doing well!

3153
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:05,220
(They acquire the die with 12 dots!)

3154
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:03,560
This...

3155
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:06,660
- This... - All the faces have six dots.

3156
01:27:07,630 --> 01:27:10,230
(The protein monster starts to move.)

3157
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:13,230
(Screaming)

3158
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:16,240
(Se Chan was being pulled around.)

3159
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,500
(He throws the die!)

3160
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,340
- No! - What are you doing?

3161
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:23,510
(He gave the other team 12 points as a present.)

3162
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:23,240
No!

3163
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:25,880
No!

3164
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,150
(Round 2 scores: Team Blue: 0, Team Red: 20)

3165
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:26,880
Hey!

3166
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,110
Hey!

3167
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:30,880
(Team Red has only 5 points until the round is over.)

3168
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:30,020
- Hey! - No!

3169
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:31,080
You should have put it in!

3170
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,090
No!

3171
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:33,920
(Ji Hyo also throws it.)

3172
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:33,990
- Hey! - You should have put it in!

3173
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:37,120
Why are you on top of me?

3174
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:40,430
(They score a modest 1 point.)

3175
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:40,490
- No! - You should have put it in!

3176
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:42,660
- No! - You should have put it in!

3177
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:45,230
(Right then, Jae Seok receives a call.)

3178
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,800
This is the production crew of Running Man, Jae Seok.

3179
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,400
This is the production crew of Running Man.

3180
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,400
Yes.

3181
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,440
Please come out through the glass door at the back.

3182
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,840
Okay.

3183
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:55,680
(Jae Seok quietly leaves.)

3184
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:55,640
Pull.

3185
01:27:56,310 --> 01:27:59,250
(It looks like he's going out to get a hidden mission.)

3186
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:00,780
Jong Kook!

3187
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:02,980
(Meanwhile, the two teams are still fighting.)

3188
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,650
Okay, nice. Not the blue one.

3189
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:05,220
I can't do this.

3190
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:07,790
Where is Jae Seok?

3191
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:10,260
Where is Jae Seok?

3192
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,390
(He came back wearing floral-patterned pants!)

3193
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:12,790
(Suddenly, an EDM track starts playing,)

3194
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:15,090
(and he's holding a water gun.)

3195
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:14,190
Hey!

3196
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:15,400
He's doing something now!

3197
01:28:15,630 --> 01:28:17,860
(Jae Seok's mission...)

3198
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,800
To match the festive atmosphere,

3199
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,830
you'll wear an outfit and enter the studio.

3200
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:24,670
(He needs to shoot all the members' faces or heads with a water gun.)

3201
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:22,600
You have to shoot all the members.

3202
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,400
- What? - On the head or the face.

3203
01:28:25,610 --> 01:28:27,770
(The water gun party starts!)

3204
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:28,340
- Hey! He's doing something now! - What?

3205
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:32,310
(He succeeded.)

3206
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:30,680
- Hey! He's doing something now! - What?

3207
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:32,450
- He's doing his mission. - What?

3208
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:34,380
(Succeeded in getting rid of 3 as soon as he begins)

3209
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:34,680
It's a mission!

3210
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,550
What are you doing?

3211
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:38,920
(Exclaiming)

3212
01:28:37,950 --> 01:28:39,090
It's a mission!

3213
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:40,850
(He dances to the EDM track...)

3214
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:43,160
(and shoots everyone with the water gun.)

3215
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:42,590
Is this a mission?

3216
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:44,020
- Is this a mission? - What's wrong with him?

3217
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:47,930
(Jong Kook keeps throwing even in the middle of this.)

3218
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:48,230
- Is this a mission? - What's wrong with him?

3219
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,560
(He shoots the crowd in their backs again.)

3220
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,400
(Exclaiming)

3221
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:56,040
(The Queen of Water Bomb responds.)

3222
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,130
I guess this is a mission.

3223
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,370
- I guess this is a mission. - It's a mission!

3224
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:59,340
(Carrying out his mission in the midst of chaos)

3225
01:28:58,270 --> 01:28:59,440
Let's go!

3226
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:01,770
(Pretending like he's enjoying the party)

3227
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:00,910
Who's doing the mission?

3228
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:03,380
Okay. Nice.

3229
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:05,310
(The whistle blows.)

3230
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:05,850
What is this?

3231
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:10,120
(The mission will be evaluated first.)

3232
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:11,480
First, Team Red...

3233
01:29:10,150 --> 01:29:14,090
(Team Blue: 4, Team Red: 33)

3234
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,590
won.

3235
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:14,620
- Okay! - Yang Se Chan!

3236
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:16,120
(Team Blue: 38, Team Red: 42)

3237
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:16,190
Okay!

3238
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:21,330
(After tallying the scores, Team Red wins overall!)

3239
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,030
Yang Se Chan!

3240
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:21,190
- Why did you attack me? - You...

3241
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:23,600
- Jae Seok also succeeded. - Okay!

3242
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:25,830
(Jae Seok's water gun mission was also successful!)

3243
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:26,700
What was that?

3244
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:28,970
(Seok Sam is still twisting the straw rope.)

3245
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:28,300
Seok Jin!

3246
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,270
- That one. - Okay.

3247
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:30,670
(Reporting)

3248
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:31,370
Okay.

3249
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,710
(The enforcement team approaches again.)

3250
01:29:31,870 --> 01:29:32,870
Hey.

3251
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:34,610
I was next to you...

3252
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:35,810
Hold on.

3253
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,380
You...

3254
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:38,680
(Keeping it in an ugly place)

3255
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:38,380
What is that?

3256
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,450
- Seriously. That's too much. - Stop it now.

3257
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:48,590
You have good stamina. Antenna...

3258
01:29:45,790 --> 01:29:49,820
(Seok Jin's mission fails in the end because of the clinging Jae Seok.)

3259
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:51,820
The team that won can add Face Balls...

3260
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:55,660
for two people whom they think are unlucky.

3261
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:57,430
- Let's go. - Let's go.

3262
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:59,100
- Go first. Should I go first? - Yes.

3263
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,830
If I pick the people I picked, the changes will go up.

3264
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:02,970
- That's right. - Right?

3265
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:06,240
Then I'll pick myself and Haha.

3266
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:08,410
(Jong Kook's pick)

3267
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:08,810
I'll pick these two. Okay?

3268
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:10,510
I'll pick these two.

3269
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:15,310
(Jae Seok's pick)

3270
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:14,550
They're the two people who gave me the hardest time today.

3271
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:18,450
(Ye Eun's pick, Eun Bi's pick)

3272
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:17,480
I think he's unlucky.

3273
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:18,620
These two.

3274
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:19,490
(Current Status of Face Balls)

3275
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:20,620
- Me too. - I should go with the probability.

3276
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:22,790
(Their Face Balls are added in the end.)

3277
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,690
I should go with the probability.

3278
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:25,590
Before beginning the biggest event,

3279
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:27,760
(Revealing the mission result on the lucky items...)

3280
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:27,530
the Lucky Face Lottery,

3281
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,960
- you picked the lucky items. - Yes.

3282
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,860
(before drawing Face Lottery)

3283
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:33,730
(Eun Bi's mission to draw bad luck away)

3284
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,100
Kwon Eun Bi...

3285
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:33,870
- What was hers? - She kept drinking water.

3286
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:36,540
(Find and drink 5 out of 12 liquor bottles filled with water)

3287
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:36,470
There was water in the liquor bottles.

3288
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:38,770
She had to drink the water.

3289
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:40,740
(She succeeds only if she finishes all 5 bottles.)

3290
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:40,240
She had to drink.

3291
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,840
Eun Bi succeeded.

3292
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:42,910
She succeeded?

3293
01:30:42,910 --> 01:30:44,640
- Here... - She succeeded?

3294
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:47,410
But I had this with me.

3295
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:48,780
I poured the water there.

3296
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:50,080
- This one. - I guess there were many bottles.

3297
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,520
(He hid the bottle to get in the way.)

3298
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,390
- Here... - There were many bottles.

3299
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:55,450
(Eun Bi succeeded in the mission despite all the disruption.)

3300
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:54,090
I...

3301
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:55,120
How did she do it?

3302
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,820
When did she succeed?

3303
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:59,390
- Team Blue won. - Okay!

3304
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:59,260
(After Round 1 ended)

3305
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:01,830
(Eun Bi found a bottle right in front of her.)

3306
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:00,830
Twelve.

3307
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:02,960
This is really...

3308
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,530
(She takes advantage of the post-game chaos...)

3309
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,670
It was surely hard like this.

3310
01:31:05,530 --> 01:31:07,570
(to grab the 5th bottle.)

3311
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,330
I'm thirsty.

3312
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:11,840
(She drinks it straight down.)

3313
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,140
The weight...

3314
01:31:12,610 --> 01:31:14,210
Kwon Eun Bi.

3315
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:15,470
(Eun Bi gets 1 lottery ticket.)

3316
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:16,680
That's why I kept this with me all along.

3317
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,210
(The custom)

3318
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,280
Which country is that from?

3319
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:19,480
- France. - France.

3320
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,510
Do you want to go there?

3321
01:31:20,650 --> 01:31:21,750
Why all of a sudden?

3322
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:23,450
- Because of the liquor? - No.

3323
01:31:23,450 --> 01:31:25,250
- I think it's a great custom. - You want to drink...

3324
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:29,790
(While Ji Hyo learns about the new custom)

3325
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:26,350
- all the leftover drinks? - Will Ji Hyo go to drink...

3326
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:27,450
all the leftover drinks?

3327
01:31:27,450 --> 01:31:29,890
Before the lottery,

3328
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:31,860
I'll give you the lottery tickets you earned.

3329
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:33,730
(Distributing a ticket each to those who earned it)

3330
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,730
You all get one ticket each.

3331
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:35,760
- Do we write our names? - Yes.

3332
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:35,660
(Running Face Lottery Ticket)

3333
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:39,000
(5 names of those who expect to pick are written down.)

3334
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:38,330
- You picked the Face Balls earlier. - Yes.

3335
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:40,900
You'll see those and write the name of the person...

3336
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:43,770
(It'll be drawn 5 times. 1 face per name)

3337
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:42,970
who you think has a higher chance, like the lottery.

3338
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:44,500
- We'll pick the face. - It's about luck.

3339
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:48,040
(They win 1st place if they get all 5 faces correct.)

3340
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:46,340
Do we need to get all of them correct?

3341
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:47,740
- No. - That puts you in first place.

3342
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:48,880
- First place. - Second place if you get four.

3343
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:52,450
(2nd place: 4 faces, 3rd place: 3 faces)

3344
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,280
- Right. - Third if you get three.

3345
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:51,640
How are we supposed to guess that?

3346
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:55,380
Only the people who won put in the balls.

3347
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:56,380
You have to go with probability.
- The same. - Right. With probability.

3348
01:31:56,820 --> 01:32:00,220
(Jong Kook added the same faces to increase the chances.)

3349
01:31:57,380 --> 01:31:59,590
Then I'll pick myself and Haha.

3350
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,260
You can't tell us whose Face Balls are in here.

3351
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,720
Let's go with probability.

3352
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:06,030
(He writes the names that he put in the box.)

3353
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:06,930
- Can I show this to others? - I'm done.

3354
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:07,860
(Jong Kook, Haha, Haha, Jong Kook, Jae Seok)

3355
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:12,030
Then I'll write Seok Jin in all of them.

3356
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:18,600
(Those who couldn't add the balls just pick the unlucky people.)

3357
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:14,470
Hold on. Those who put them in earlier...

3358
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:22,240
(They get a penalty if they don't get 3 or more.)

3359
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:20,210
I don't think Eun Bi is in there.

3360
01:32:20,210 --> 01:32:21,810
I don't think Jong Kook is in there.

3361
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,340
He's the unlucky one.

3362
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:26,150
(They carefully make a guess on the Face Balls.)

3363
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:24,610
I should believe it.

3364
01:32:24,710 --> 01:32:25,750
I should believe in myself.

3365
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:29,550
(Drawing Face Lottery Ticket)

3366
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,610
This is too difficult.

3367
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:29,220
I should go with the odds.

3368
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:33,550
Now, we will find out the unlucky ones picked by you guys.

3369
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,420
(Guessing the 5 unlucky people)

3370
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:35,420
- Eun Bi, - Good. Eun Bi should draw it.

3371
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:38,120
(Eun Bi will draw.)

3372
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:37,160
- pick five Face Balls. - All right.

3373
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:39,360
- Pick one at a time. - Don't look, Eun Bi.

3374
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,230
Don't try to pull any tricks again.

3375
01:32:41,130 --> 01:32:44,600
(Whose face will be picked first?)

3376
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:44,630
Pick one at a time. Show us the first unlucky face.

3377
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:46,030
All right. Who is it?

3378
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:48,940
- I can't see. - All right. Who is it?

3379
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:51,700
(Eun Bi)

3380
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,200
The unlucky... What?

3381
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,970
I got rid of Eun Bi's name. My gosh.

3382
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:53,710
(She got it right.)

3383
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:53,740
- I didn't write down Eun Bi's name. - She picked herself?

3384
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:55,310
- Yes! - I didn't write down Eun Bi's name.

3385
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:55,780
(Golden Hand Ji Hyo got it right.)

3386
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:58,280
- I got rid of Eun Bi's name. - I was going to add her name.

3387
01:32:55,780 --> 01:33:00,610
(The rest didn't get their first Face Balls.)

3388
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,610
- Who added Eun Bi's face? - I got rid of her name.

3389
01:33:00,710 --> 01:33:02,450
The second face.

3390
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:03,680
(Second draw)

3391
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:05,080
I told you. I was going to write Eun Bi's name.

3392

(Running Face Lottery Ticket)

3393
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:06,650
Don't look.

- Haha. - Haha.

3396

- Haha. - Haha.

3397
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:13,760
- I should've added Haha. - Haha.

3398
01:33:13,890 --> 01:33:15,330
- Haha. - I'm unlucky.

3399
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:16,730
You brat.

3400
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:19,400
- Pick the third face. - I had Eun Bi's name.

3401
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:20,100
(Third draw)

3402
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:22,840
Eun Bi, pull yourself together. Who is it?

(Running Face Lottery Ticket)

3404
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:23,870
Yes!

3405
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:25,370
- Kim Jong Kook! - Kim Jong Kook!

3406
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:26,810
- Is it Jong Kook? - It's Jong Kook.

3407

(Jong Kook: Haha)

3408
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:28,570
- Kim Jong Kook! - Kim Jong Kook!

3409
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:30,840
(With his odd-based strategy, Jong Kook has gotten 2 right.)

3410
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:32,110
(Feeling proud)

3411
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:32,240
I added it.

(Eun Bi also has already gotten 2 names right.)

3414
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:34,850
I got rid of Jong Kook's name.

3415
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:36,350
I added it.

3416
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:37,880
- The fourth face. - All right.

- Me! - Me!

3426
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:49,130
- It's the last face. - We have one ball left.

3427

(5 people got 2 faces.)

3428

- Nice. - Except for these two,

3469

- all of you will get the penalty. - Nice. It's the penalty.

3470
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:47,090
The penalty is to make the jewel keychain...

3471
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:49,420
that will ward off bad luck.

3472
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:51,360
- Okay. - That's the worst.

01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,160

Let's go!

3485
01:35:08,010 --> 01:35:10,140
That annoying thing is back.

3486
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,380
Bye.

3487
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:13,310
(Teasing)

3488
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:15,750
Seriously, that darn brat...

3489
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:16,080
(Upset)

3490
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:16,880
Goodbye.

3491
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,120
- Goodbye. - See you.

3492
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:19,750
How can we be good?

3493
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:20,020
(Angered)

3494
01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:21,450
This is horrible.

3495
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:22,020
(Even while they're complaining,)

3496
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:22,590
This is too much.

3497
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:25,690
(they chase away bad luck while putting in their effort.)

3498
01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:23,620
- This is really... - What do I do with this?

3499
01:35:23,620 --> 01:35:25,790
- It's going everywhere. - I'm really fast.

3500
01:35:25,790 --> 01:35:27,560
- Jae Seok hates this. - Where's the glue?

3501
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:29,360
- The glue is on the bottom. - Here.

3502
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:30,500
(We thank Kwon Eun Bi for giving us a big laugh today.)

3503
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:32,200
There's a legend...

3504
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,330
that has been passed down through Fox Valley.

3505
01:35:34,330 --> 01:35:36,100
I'm a 1,000-year-old 9-tailed Fox.

3506
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,100
(A 1,000-year-old 9-tailed Fox appears?)

3507
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:37,340
I'm losing hair here.

3508
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,570
You're losing hair?

3509
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:40,610
(But the Fox Valley is filled only with crazy foxes.)

3510
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:42,340
What kind of Nine-tailed Fox is this?

3511
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:43,480
- By any chance... - Nice.

3512
01:35:43,710 --> 01:35:46,710
Se Chan, I'm a big fan. Could you give me one tail, please?

3513
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:46,610
(A sly fox captivates the crazy foxes with her charm.)

3514
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:48,410
(Ready to give his everything)

3515
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:47,850
Tell me what you like about me.

3516
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:51,020
- Hye Yoon. - She's pretty.

3517
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:50,950
(A sly, charming fox, Kim Hye Yoon)

3518
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:52,490
There you go.

3519
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:54,090
(And an outstanding, tall guy next to Fox Hye Yoon)

3520
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,020
(Flashy foot skills)

3521
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:58,290
(A tall and handsome fox, who rules the fox scene, appears.)

3522
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:57,960
Good job!

3523
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,830
- Lomon! - The fighter from the zombie thing.

3524
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,730
(A tall, b-boying fox, Lomon)

3525
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:02,730
- For one tail, - Really?

3526
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:04,960
(A class war between foxes over their tails)

3527
01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:04,900
- one menu. - Okay!

3528
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,130
Give me the tail!

3529
01:36:06,330 --> 01:36:07,330
(That thug fox.)

3530
01:36:07,330 --> 01:36:10,040
(The fox's beauty is working hard to make a Nine-tailed Fox.)

3531
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:09,440
- My goodness. - He looks so cool.

3532
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,200
- Lomon! - It's annoys me that he looks cool.

3533
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:12,840
Your chin is slightly sunken.

3534
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:15,440
(You don't need your pride as long as you can get a tail.)

3535
01:36:15,370 --> 01:36:16,380
The king of braise.

3536
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:17,540
Chef Choi Kang Rok.

3537
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:17,580
(Even a secret disguise)

3538
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:19,110
No, no, no, no, no

3539
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:19,110
(In the fierce war of the tails, who will become a Nine-tailed Fox?)

3540
01:36:19,210 --> 01:36:21,150
(Starting From Today, I'm a Nine-Tailed Fox)

3541
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:21,250
She's a lot cuter!

3542
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:26,620
(Running Man)
