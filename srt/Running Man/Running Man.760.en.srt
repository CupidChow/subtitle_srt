1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,780
I'm tired.
This is the worst penalty ever.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,380
Seriously.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,550
I bet Haha feels the same way.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,080
I thought it was the worst
in the morning.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,020
I had to wake up an hour earlier
than usual because of this.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,620
This is the worst penalty ever.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,760
(The reason Jae Seok packed
something so early in the morning)

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,020
(It was the penalty
from last week's shoot.)

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,190
(Making a handmade breakfast)

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,860
(Haha gets the penalty.)

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,200
(Jae Seok gets the penalty.)

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,610
(The two people were picked
to get the worst penalty.)

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,510
I woke up at 5:30 a.m. today.

14
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,640
I had to buy the bread too.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,680
This is the worst penalty ever.

16
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,580
- Breakfast.
- That's our breakfast.

17
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,850
Seriously,
this is the worst penalty.

18
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,880
- Did you make this?
- Yes. It was really...

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,890
This is amazing.

20
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,090
- I know why he says it's the worst.
- You know what?

21
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,120
- It's the worst penalty.
- What?

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,930
- This is amazing.
- My gosh.

23
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,230
It looks really good.

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,630
This is great.

25
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,460
It looks so delicious.

26
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,100
- Jong Kook.
- Yes.

27
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,130
While making sandwiches,

28
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,500
I remembered
that you asked for peanut butter.

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,770
But peanut butter
doesn't taste good with eggs.

30
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,510
- It doesn't?
- So, for Jong Kook...

31
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,510
Did you make it differently?

32
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,780
- I brought a chicken breast.
- Yes!

33
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,940
Actually, when I saw this...

34
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,010
- But this is too easy to prepare.
- My goodness.

35
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,410
- No.
- If I eat one...

36
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,280
I made a peanut butter sandwich
for Jong Kook.

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,450
(Even a peanut butter sandwich
specially made for Jong Kook)

38
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,550
- It looks delicious.
- Really?

39
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,090
It would've been nice
if it had more peanut butter.

40
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,590
Come on, Jong Kook.
It has sugar in it.

41
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,190
- You shouldn't eat too much of it.
- I think...

42
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,700
- And soybean milk.
- I bet it's delicious.

43
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,800
- Soybean milk.
- It's like a course meal.

44
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,130
- I bet it tastes good.
- Nice.

45
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,200
- Did you make this?
- I said I made it.

46
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,740
Did you make all these yourself?

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,270
(Fried eggs, cheese, blueberry jam)

48
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,970
(Jae Seok's morning sandwich
for the other members)

49
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,680
- Did you put an egg in it?
- Yes.

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,710
- This is amazing.
- Thank you, Jae Seok.

51
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,110
- Thank you.
- Did you put an egg in it?

52
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,380
- Yes.
- Jae Seok. It's delicious.

53
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,110
- It's good, isn't it?
- It's really delicious.

54
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,620
- It's good, right?
- It's so good.

55
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,520
I used to make it for Ji Ho...

56
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,120
when he was younger.

57
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,150
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

58
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,420
It's called
the Young Master sandwich.

59
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,290
Jae Seok, are you sure
you made all these yourself?

60
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,290
Yes. Of course, I made it myself.

61
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,660
- It's delicious.
- It's good.

62
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,300
- The combination...
- It's delicious.

63
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,770
- It can't taste bad.
- It tastes really good.

64
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,000
- It's a perfect breakfast, right?
- Yes.

65
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
- Hey.
- My gosh.

66
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,400
Haha.

67
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,940
- It's good, isn't it?
- My goodness.

68
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,570
- It looks good.
- It also has cheese in it.

69
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,510
- Yes. It tastes so good.
- I swear...

70
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,110
this is the worst penalty.

71
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,210
- Haha.
- It was really bothersome.

72
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,610
- Seriously, it's the worst.
- It's the worst.

73
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,920
I mean, Nevis Swing is better.
Seriously, this is...

74
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,120
- Really?
- At least, I get more screen time.

75
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,920
- But this is the worst.
- Did you film it?

76
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,820
- This is a penalty, you know.
- Do you have evidence?

77
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,290
- I do.
- You do?

78
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,860
I want to make something filling
for breakfast.

79
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,960
Something simple but filling.

80
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,100
It's fried tofu rice balls.

81
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,240
Dream, have you ever seen your dad
cook for us in the morning?

82
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,300
No.
(Tutting)

83
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,570
Yes.

84
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,210
He said, "Yes."

85
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,640
(A variety-show family
who makes a good skit together)

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,710
We have good teamwork, right?

87
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,980
Like this.

88
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,580
I think this will do.

89
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,510
It's too squished.

90
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,920
That's for Seok Jin.

91
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,420
And this one is for Jong Kook.

92
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,650
This is for Ji Hyo.

93
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,990
This is for Se Chan.

94
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,530
I should've just given them
instant rice and dried laver.

95
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,260
The breakfast is done.

96
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,830
It's done.
I will never get the penalty again.

97
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,930
- What?
- My goodness.

98
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,640
- My gosh.
- Amazing.

99
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,140
(As a dad of three kids,
Haha made a cute breakfast.)

100
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,270
- What did you make?
- What?

101
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,470
Haha, what is all this?

102
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,910
- This is...
- What?

103
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,580
fried tofu rice balls
with Cheongyang chili peppers.

104
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,280
- And this is...
- Plain.

105
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,110
This is a basic one,
but I seasoned it a little.

106
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,680
I bet it will taste good.

107
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,090
- It's delicious. It's good.
- I like fried tofu rice balls.

108
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,650
- Isn't it good?
- It's just...

109
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,060
- My gosh.
- The Cheongyang chili is good.

110
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,090
- It's delicious.
- It really is.

111
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,090
(Food Fighter loves it too!)

112
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,490
- It really is.
- It's filling.

113
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,700
- Haha, it's tasty.
- It's good, isn't it?

114
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,900
The Cheongyang chili is good.

115
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,370
- You didn't have to do this.
- What's that?

116
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,840
- I have to take the forks home.
- Why?

117
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,370
Give me my containers back.
I should bring them home.

118
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,210
I need to take the forks back.

119
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,840
- Give me.
- They are househusbands.

120
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,680
You'll be scolded
if you don't take them, right?

121
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,250
- I'll be scolded.
- I should bring them.

122
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,280
This is...

123
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,380
- It tastes so good.
- It's so nice to have breakfast.

124
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,920
- Right.
- It's really nice.

125
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,950
I love it.

126
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,920
- Thank you for the breakfast.
- Thank you.

127
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,260
You worked hard for this.

128
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,660
- Yes. You too.
- Yes.

129
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,730
I'm full.

130
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,660
- Hello.
- Hello.

131
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,030
- Hello.
- I'm back in Deungchon-dong...

132
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,900
- after a long time.
- Hello.

133
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,770
- Yes.
- All right.

134
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,140
- It's been a long time.
- I know.

135
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,670
- I know. It's been a while.
- Energy, up.

136
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,610
- Didn't you do the music show here?
- Yes.

137
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,710
- Right.
- It's "SBS Inkigayo."

138
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,650
- They still do it here.
- They still do?

139
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,810
This is where I took 1st place
on a music show for the 1st time.

140
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,810
- Was it here?
- Yes.

141
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,180
It was a long time ago.

142
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,280
We did "X-Man" here.

143
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,290
- Right.
- Yes.

144
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,290
Didn't you do
"People Looking for a Laugh" here?
It was here.

145
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,920
I did "Truth or Dare" here.

146
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,260
- "Truth or Dare" was filmed here.
- Yes.

147
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,990
- "Star King."
- "Star King."

148
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,590
- "Challenge 1,000 songs."
- We have a lot of memories.

149
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,460
We have pleasant guests for today.

150
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,200
- We have guests?
- Please bring in...

151
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,370
- the first guest.
- Do we have guests?

152
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,670
- Who is it?
- First?

153
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,640
- Who are they?
- So we have more than one.

154
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,300
- Is that her?
- There?

155
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,570
- Come on out.
- She's coming from the back.

156
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,110
- Hey.
- Hyun Young.

157
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,280
(Running Man's family,
Joo Hyun Young)

158
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,480
- It's Hyun Young.
- What?

159
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,780
(That's my friend.)

160
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,780
Hyun Young.

161
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,020
- Hello.
- Hi, Hyun Young.

162
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,550
(I'm senior to you.)

163
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,690
(Right. You're senior to me.)

164
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,620
(She's 2 years younger,
but she sets the discipline as a senior.)

165
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,560
(Can't you do that much
on your own?)

166
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,660
(Sullen)

167
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,830
(Hyun Young, who disciplines
Chungju Ji and Jee, is here.)

168
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,470
Hello.

169
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,970
- Hi, Hyun Young.
- Hello.

170
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,740
- What's with you?
- Why are you dressed so cool?

171
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,370
- Hyun Young.
- What?

172
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,380
(Old Daniel is surprised.)

173
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,210
(Embarrassed)

174
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,980
- What?
- What?

175
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,120
- The outfit looks airy and crisp.
- Hey.

176
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,720
- What's with her?
- Hold on.

177
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,190
- Why are you in a bathing suit?
- Hyun Young.

178
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,220
What's up with you?

179
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,650
- Hyun Young.
- Are you okay?

180
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,920
This takes me back to the moment...

181
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
- You're in a bathing suit.
- I saw Ji Hyo's bare stomach...
for the first time...

182
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,260
after all those years
of knowing her.

183
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
Her bare stomach.

184
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,700
In my case, it's my bare back.

185
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,030
- Her bare back.
- Hyun Young's bare back.

186
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,800
That was unexpected.

187
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,170
- That was unexpected.
- That was unexpected.

188
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,330
Her unexpected exposed back.

189
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,540
- It's bare.
- I didn't expect that.

190
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,600
Yes, it's my bare back.

191
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,740
Her unexpected exposed back.

192
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,570
- It sure is unexpected.
- It's unexpected.

193
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,380
Whenever we have Hyun Young
or Ah Young on the show,

194
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,810
- Ye Eun...
- She tenses up.

195
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,810
- Why?
- I don't.

196
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,980
Why are you tense?

197
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,110
- Are you tense?
- I haven't tensed up.

198
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,350
- No way.
- Also,

199
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,880
when we say something about them,

200
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,490
she adds her own opinion.

201
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,050
"Why are you in a bathing suit?"

202
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,320
Why are you in a bathing suit?

203
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,460
(The junior colleague is engaged
in a power play of her own.)

204
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,230
Ye Eun's being a bit territorial.

205
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,660
- I know.
- Do I look pretty today?

206
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,430
- Do I look pretty?
- I agree.

207
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,270
- A little.
- Do I look pretty today?

208
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,770
Meanwhile, Ye Eun's clothes are...

209
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,300
- from the junior section.
- The junior section?

210
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,740
Exactly. So compared to her...

211
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,400
- That's not true.
- Actually...

212
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,340
She wears clothes
that are too small for her.

213
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,740
It won't look so bad
if her feet were up here.

214
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,080
Check this out.

215
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,080
- Even this would work.
- You're right.

216
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,450
(Dressed like a 5-year-old girl)

217
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,250
- You're right.
- That's so true.

218
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,720
I hate how...

219
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,320
she's so skinny now.

220
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,960
My goodness.

221
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,020
- What's your problem?
- What is it?

222
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,260
- That came out of nowhere.
- No way.

223
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,090
- What did I say?
- The band will disband.

224
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,500
She's too skinny now.

225
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,930
- Seok Jin.
- Is this the end for our group?

226
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,330
It's fine.
I can hang out with Hyun Young.

227
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,930
- But her surname...
- I'll hang out with Hyun Young.

228
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,340
- That's it.
- Sure.

229
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,470
You can perform with Hyun Young.

230
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,470
- Nice.
- Sure thing.

231
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,510
Look at her.

232
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,540
What'll happen now?

233
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,440
Ye Eun, if you don't have time
to perform at events...

234
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
Will you be free?

235
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,780
- Hyun Young, can you perform?
- Yes?

236
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,850
- Of course.
- Can you perform on stage?

237
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,950
You won't have to pay me.

238
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,480
Why did it have to be
in front of Hyun Young?

239
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,550
Why would you humiliate me
in front of her?

240
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,890
I wasn't trying to humiliate you.

241
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,450
I was just reminded...

242
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,660
of your chubby face back when
Hyun Young was on the show.

243
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,620
- She's now missing her pouch.
- You looked so cute.

244
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,460
Back when she had pouches
on her cheeks.

245
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,430
- Exactly. Back then...
- She looked better.

246
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,900
- Have I lost a lot of weight?
- You?

247
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,260
- You've blossomed.
- Hey!

248
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,600
(Once again, Hyun Young
is toying with Jee and Ji.)

249
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,300
There are more guests
we should bring out.

250
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,710
- Are there more?
- There are more?

251
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,970
Actors?

252
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,980
It's BABYMONSTER.

253
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,280
It's BABYMONSTER.

254
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,650
Welcome!

255
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,150
Come on in.

256
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,880
BABYMONSTER!

257
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,220
- It's BABYMONSTER.
- It's BABYMONSTER.

258
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,760
- Welcome!
- BABYMONSTER.

259
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,390
- Hello.
- Hi.

260
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,230
- No way.
- Hello.

261
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,400
- They have such clear voices.
- They're moving away.

262
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,260
- They look like models.
- I know.

263
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,430
- They're K-pop idols.
- No way.

264
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,030
- Hello.
- The moment they stepped in,

265
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,030
these two moved away.

266
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,370
Hyun Young, why are you moving away?

267
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
- Why are you moving away?
- Hello.

268
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,010
You're here in a bathing suit,
remember?

269
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,840
- Forget it.
- You're in a bathing suit.

270
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,980
That won't help me at all.

271
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,280
- I won't wear this again.
- Anyway,

272
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,350
please welcome Asa and Ahyeon
of BABYMONSTER.

273
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,410
- Asa!
- Hello. I hope we get along.

274
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,620
Ahyeon.

275
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,380
- Asa.
- That's right.

276
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,650
- Hi.
- Hi.

277
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,350
We're BABYMONSTER.

278
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,720
- I'm Ahyeon.
- And I'm Asa.

279
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,090
- Hi.
- Last time,

280
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,630
- we had Rami...
- That's right.

281
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,190
- on the show.
- And Rora.

282
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,200
- That's right.
- Right.

283
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,360
It's been a while, but we're here...

284
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,630
- with BABYMONSTER again.
- Right.

285
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,270
(300 million views and counting
on YouTube!)

286
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,040
(Aiming for a spicy summer,
the group returns with "Hot Sauce.")

287
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,240
(The group returns with a spicy song
that will dominate the summer.)

288
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,340
("Hot Sauce" by BABYMONSTER)

289
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,440
They're nothing like us.

290
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,740
(Amazed)

291
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,850
They're nothing like us.

292
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,610
Their movements...

293
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,650
(Light)

294
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,320
- Nice.
- They're so different from us.

295
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,150
- That's tasty.
- Nice.

296
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,490
- They're so different from us.
- It's hot.

297
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,120
This is great.

298
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,190
I love it.

299
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,390
(Addictive heat and spice)

300
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,830
"Hot Sauce!"

301
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,970
Their feet are so light.

302
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,000
No, I don't want to.

303
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,040
- Let's hear "Milkshake."
- No, don't.

304
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,770
(Followed by sweet flavors
that will dominate this summer)

305
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,240
- Let's hear from the rookie group.
- You're so mean.

306
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,370
- Then...
- I don't want to.

307
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,740
- Then...
- I'll perform "Milkshake."

308
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,240
- "Milkshake."
- Perform "Milkshake."

309
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,610
(Sweet like a milkshake)

310
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,180
- Milkshake.
- How does it go? Teach me.

311
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,520
- How does it go?
- Milkshake...

312
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,380
(Get lost!)

313
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,020
What do you think you're doing? Hey.

314
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,720
- She dragged Hyun Young out.
- Get lost.

315
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,190
This is mine.

316
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,030
- Enjoy a milkshake
- Enjoy

317
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,460
- Won't you play the song for them?
- Milkshake

318
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,760
The song won't play for them.

319
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
(An unfiltered live performance)

320
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,200
(Reacting for now)

321
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,770
Hold on.
I say this because I'm embarrassed.

322
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,470
- From what I see...
- You two sound different.

323
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,140
That was nothing like
the recorded version.

324
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,240
They're going up
against Chungju Ji and Jee.

325
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,910
- They're going head to head.
- Their promotional tours overlap.

326
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,280
You're right.

327
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,080
- There's a rivalry.
- "Hot Sauce" versus "Milkshake."

328
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,180
No way.

329
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,020
- Our promotional tours overlap.
- Right.

330
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,390
- You're right.
- No way.

331
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,590
Spicy versus sweet.

332
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,760
Were you aware...

333
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,460
that Chungju Ji and Jee debuted?

334
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,790
- I haven't heard about it.
- No, I wasn't.

335
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,090
- You haven't heard about it?
- Right.

336
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,760
The music industry...

337
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,000
- had no idea.
- They had no idea.

338
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,330
I'll make sure to listen
to the song.

339
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,470
(I'll make sure to listen
to the song.)

340
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,670
You'll soon know about us.

341
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,110
They're going head to head.

342
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,670
I hear that you're both...

343
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,880
- in high school.
- Really?

344
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,610
- What?
- Really?

345
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,680
- How old are you?
- I'm older...

346
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,050
- than the normal age...
- of high school seniors.

347
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,410
- Is that so?
- Yes.

348
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,520
"Older than the normal age
of high school seniors."

349
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,220
Yes, consider me graduated.

350
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,950
- Ahyeon, what year were you born?
- How old is Ahyeon?

351
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,350
- I was born in 2007.
- What?

352
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,690
- That's possible.
- And Asa...

353
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,390
(Laughing hysterically)

354
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,430
- I debuted in 2005.
- That's possible.

355
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,360
Are you Japanese?

356
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,700
- Me?
- No, I'm Japanese.

357
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,300
- Asa.
- Asa?

358
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,040
- You're Japanese?
- She has that vibe.

359
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,300
- Are you Japanese?
- That's right.

360
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,770
- She must've rubbed off on you.
- Well, I...

361
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,840
Get over there.

362
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,040
No, thanks.

363
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,680
(- Get over there.
- No, thanks.)

364
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,710
Get over there.

365
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,180
I'd rather stay here.

366
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,380
Hold on a second.

367
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,750
Why are you standing over here?

368
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,620
- What's with you two?
- Why are they standing over there?

369
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,950
Why are you two over there?

370
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,920
- It's all right.
- Actually...

371
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,690
- You're a guest today, so go on.
- Please come here.

372
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,190
- She's right.
- Exactly.

373
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,560
But obviously...

374
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,800
Please come this way.

375
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,300
Please tell us
about your upcoming movie.

376
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,660
- Exactly.
- It's "Ghost Train."

377
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,770
That's right. A horror movie...

378
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,270
called "Ghost Train"
will hit theaters in early July.

379
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,400
(Joo Hyun Young debuts in movie
with "Ghost Train.")

380
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,740
- Early July?
- We should watch it.

381
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,410
- This summer?
- That's right.

382
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,770
I love...

383
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,680
- scary movies.
- Is that so?

384
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,840
- I should watch "Ghost Train."
- Right.

385
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,350
I play the role
of a horror YouTuber.

386
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,620
- It suits you.
- That's so cool.

387
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,220
- A YouTuber.
- Yes, a zoomer.

388
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,360
(The bubbly Hyun Young transforms
for her role in a horror movie.)

389
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,120
- That sounds like fun.
- That sounds entertaining.

390
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,330
It's a lot like that movie,
"The Twilight Zone."

391
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,230
Anyway, Hyun Young's movie,

392
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,300
"Ghost Train," will hit theaters
in July.

393
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,770
- Please go and watch it.
- I'm sure she'll be good in it.

394
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,370
Today,

395
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,340
joined by zoomers...

396
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,010
on summer break,

397
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,510
you'll compete
in A Creepy Vacation Thriller Race.

398
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,040
- Creepy?
- It'll be a scary one today.

399
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,080
- No way.
- To the three of them?

400
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,210
Are you serious
about having a scary episode?

401
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,310
Will it be scary today?

402
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,950
We asked the guests...

403
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,050
what they wanted to do on vacation.

404
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,120
To the three of them?

405
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,790
- Yes.
- We collected their ideas...

406
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,960
and upgraded them
for a three-course vacation.

407
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,020
Really?

408
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,460
Once you've heard
about all the courses,

409
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,760
feel free to choose one...

410
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,360
you know you can handle
and enjoy it.

411
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,430
(Course 2:
They may choose one to enjoy.)

412
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,770
(Course 3)

413
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,070
By volunteering to enjoy a course,

414
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,070
you'll get an additional prize ball.

415
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,740
If not, you'll randomly choose...

416
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,950
a gold or black ball,
with equal probability.

417
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,480
A gold ball means
you're exempt from the course.

418
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,520
You'll also receive two prize balls.

419
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,550
- So we need gold balls.
- I see.

420
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,720
If you draw a black ball,

421
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
you will experience the course...

422
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,460
- Oh, no.
- and receive two penalty balls.

423
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,560
- That's the worst.
- That's bad.

424
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,590
You can either volunteer
to take the course...

425
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,530
or try your luck with a 50-50 draw.

426
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,660
It's either a hit or a miss.

427
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,800
- Or take a random chance.
- Or we can draw a ball.

428
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,100
Those who rode the Nevis Swing
will volunteer.

429
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,870
Of course, we should
experience the course.

430
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,340
We should do that.

431
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,670
At the end of the day,
balls will be drawn.

432
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,580
Two people whose names were drawn...

433
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,380
will win a hotel buffet voucher.

434
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,680
- A hotel buffet voucher?
- That's right.

435
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,180
A hotel buffet?

436
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,750
You'll move out
after deciding on the teams...

437
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,190
- for the first game.
- Yes.

438
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,690
- Sure.
- Nice.

439
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,990
- We'll decide with mukjjibba.
- Really?

440
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,420
- Aren't there too many people?
- There are too many of us.

441
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,890
- We'll keep dividing the groups.
- Like this?

442
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,160
Rock-paper-scissors.

443
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,430
- Who has scissors?
- Who has paper?

444
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,130
- Four scissors?
- Who has rock?

445
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,530
- See?
- It actually worked.

446
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,570
- Let's do it.
- Is it us three?

447
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,200
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

448
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,240
- No way.
- Over there.

449
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,600
- Okay.
- The spotlight will be hers.

450
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,240
She doesn't look too happy.

451
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,470
- The spotlight will be hers.
- She doesn't look too happy.

452
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,080
Hyun Young, the spotlight
will be yours.

453
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,210
- The spotlight will be yours.
- That's true.

454
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,310
- It's true.
- You'll be in the spotlight.

455
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,280
- That's true.
- You're the lady of the hour.

456
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,020
What... What was the movie again?

457
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,520
- "Ghost Bus?"
- No, "Ghost Train."

458
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,720
Okay!

459
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,750
(What kind of creepy activities
await them?)

460
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,420
Please sit with your teams.

461
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,520
With our teams.

462
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,860
Ahyeon, who did you want
to meet the most?

463
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,990
- Me?
- Yes.

464
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,030
- You.
- It's okay.

465
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,430
- You don't have to lie.
- I mean that.

466
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,400
Let's hear why.

467
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,630
- Tell us why.
- Why?

468
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,670
Before, we...

469
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,470
- What?
- We met...

470
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,470
on "Men on a Mission."

471
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,840
- "Men on a Mission?"
- Back then...

472
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,870
Wait, was that not you?

473
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,240
- I don't think it was. I'm sorry.
- Wasn't it him?

474
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,380
I don't think it was you.

475
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,880
- Wasn't it him?
- It wasn't him.

476
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,310
- Hold on.
- She got confused.

477
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,550
- It wasn't him. It wasn't Haha.
- Wasn't it Haha?

478
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,350
- It wasn't Haha.
- It might not have been Haha.

479
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,820
Isn't he who you thought he was?

480
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,750
- Who does he resemble?
- Lee Sang Min?

481
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,520
Gosh, I'm so sorry!

482
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,490
Rap for her like Sang Min.

483
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,930
- I'm so sorry.
- Rap in his style.

484
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,360
(An upsetting crying rap)

485
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,060
- I mean...
- I'm so sorry.

486
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,600
- They wear similar glasses.
- I'm so sorry.

487
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,930
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

488
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,970
- I'm sorry.
- Ahyeon, it's all right.

489
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,000
- Ahyeon.
- I'm sorry about that.

490
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,430
They have identical glasses,
so don't worry.

491
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,500
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

492
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,400
Glasses people wear
are almost identical to mine.

493
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,840
- It's understandable.
- Ahyeon, it's fine.

494
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
It's all right.

495
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,610
Even celebrities look alike.

496
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,810
- Asa. Is that your real name?
- Yes?

497
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,010
My name is Enami Asa.

498
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,210
- Enami Asa.
- Enami Asa.

499
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,950
- How long have you lived in Korea?
- Exactly.

500
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,220
It's been about six years now.

501
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,120
- That's a long time.
- You've been here long.

502
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,460
I knew it.

503
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,590
No wonder, right?

504
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,330
- I'm jealous.
- Did you graduate schools here?

505
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,590
- Of course not.
- She's been here six years.

506
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,900
- She probably went back and forth.
- I'm a kindergarten graduate.

507
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,000
- Kindergarten?
- Kindergarten?

508
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,100
- Yes.
- You only graduated kindergarten?

509
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,730
- Kindergarten?
- Really?

510
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,870
I've never heard anyone say
they're a kindergarten graduate.

511
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,040
It's a first for me too.

512
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,070
- I only graduated kindergarten.
- Only kindergarten?

513
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,240
Asa, did you only
graduate kindergarten?

514
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,740
- I've never heard of that.
- I was a trainee...

515
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,510
while going to elementary school
in Japan.

516
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,040
- Really?
- Since elementary school?

517
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,350
- No way.
- That's astonishing.

518
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,450
What does "asa" mean in Japanese?

519
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,480
- It means "morning."
- "Asa."

520
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,920
- "Morning."
- That's what "asa" means.

521
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,490
- "Morning."
- Right. It means "morning."

522
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,720
- You knew?
- I studied Japanese.

523
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,960
- You studied Japanese?
- Nice.

524
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,630
- It sounds refreshing.
- Hyun Young studied Japanese.

525
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,200
- She speaks Japanese well.
- Right.

526
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,360
- A little.
- Is that right?

527
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,870
- Just a little.
- Wait.

528
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,470
- Just a little.
- I've been wanting to meet you.

529
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,540
- What?
- I've been wanting to meet you.

530
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,840
- Meet?
- Meet.

531
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,570
- Hey!
- You got stuck right away.

532
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,480
- What was that?
- You can't say a sentence.

533
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,080
- What was that?
- What?

534
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,780
- What did you say?
- You can't...

535
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,310
- speak Japanese.
- I said I wanted to meet her.

536
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,480
- What?
- She looks like that Japanese girl.

537
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,820
- "What" is all she keeps saying.
- She keeps saying "What."

538
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,320
What? I...

539
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,620
I've seen you on many shows,

540
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,160
- so I've been wanting to meet you.
- Wanting to meet me, right?

541
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,830
- What?
- What did you just do?

542
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,500
- You just copied her.
- She did.

543
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,300
- What was that?
- I've seen a lot of her shows.

544
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,330
- My listening skills are bad.
- So I've been wanting to meet her.

545
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,670
- What was that, Hyun Young?
- She's bad.

546
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,000
- I have bad listening skills.
- Can you speak Japanese?

547
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,770
- I can speak a little bit of it.
- She's not a native.

548
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,270
- She's not a native.
- She's not.

549
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,840
There's a mission.

550
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,610
- There's a mission.
- There is something.

551
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,410
You are seated with your teammates.

552
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,780
- Right.
- The mission is called,

553
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,120
- Hello Memory Monster.
- I'm good at memorizing.

554
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,450
Ahyeon, you've got to do well.

555
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,490
Monster!

556
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,660
Watch the video of idol greetings
from different generations...

557
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,860
- and memorize them.
- No way.

558
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,890
I can't memorize.

559
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,860
(Idol greetings come in...)

560
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,130
(all kinds...)

561
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,740
(of hand signs and phrases.)

562
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,400
Then, you will do...

563
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,540
the right greeting
when you hear just the group name.

564
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,940
The greeting.

565
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,010
On the bus, you will be given time
to watch the clips and memorize.

566
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,450
We will give the questions
when we arrive at the destination.

567
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,650
You have to copy
the gestures exactly...

568
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,820
- Really? How?
- to qualify as correct.

569
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,250
- That's tricky.
- Yes.

570
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,560
- We have the advantage.
- We do.

571
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,160
I used to be
an idol trainee, you know!

572
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,220
(Surprisingly, it's true.)

573
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,160
- I will memorize.
- Here you are.

574
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,900
(They are given the tablet pc
that has the greeting clips.)

575
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,100
- I hope it's a group I know.
- What's yours?

576
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
- BABYMONSTER's.
- We don't have one.

577
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,900
We just say,
"Hello, we're BABYMONSTER."

578
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,670
- Let's watch it.
- Are we starting with TWICE?

579
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,900
One in a million!

580
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,710
- One in a million.
- Hello, we are TWICE.

581
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,710
- One in a million!
- What did they say?

582
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,870
One, two, three.

583
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,910
(The unique gesture is the key.)

584
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,210
- One in a million!
- One in a million!

585
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,020
One in a million!
Hello, we're TWICE.

586
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,050
- One in a million.
- Ready and go.

587
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,050
- One in a million!
- One in a million!

588
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,090
- Hello, we are TWICE.
- They're one in a million.

589
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,290
- We have to practice.
- Hello, we're TWICE.

590
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,620
- One in a million!
- One in a million!

591
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,560
- Hello, we are TWICE.
- One in a million.

592
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,160
Which hand goes first?
The left hand or the right hand?

593
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,560
- Let's watch it again.
- We need to watch that.

594
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,990
- It has to be the left hand.
- One, two, three.

595
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,230
- It's the right hand.
- It's the right hand.

596
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,170
(They meticulously check
the hand direction too.)

597
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,130
- Two, three. Happiness!
- Happiness!

598
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,140
- Hello, we're Red Velvet.
- Happiness!

599
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,300
- Happiness!
- Smile.

600
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,910
(Current idol and ex-trainee
leading intense practice)

601
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,080
- Smile.
- Hello, we're Red Velvet.

602
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,280
Found you, OH MY GIRL!

603
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,610
(Copy and paste)

604
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,910
- Is this "found you?"
- Hello.

605
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,320
- We're OH MY GIRL.
- Right hand or left hand?

606
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,780
- Is it this one?
- Found you.

607
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,980
- The right hand.
- The right hand.

608
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,550
- What?
- You have to put in harmonies.

609
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,860
Hello. We're MAMAMOO.

610
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,520
- Mama moo
- Mama moo

611
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,730
- I say mama mama moo
- I say mama mama moo

612
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,800
- Hello. We're MAMAMOO.
- Hello. We're MAMAMOO.

613
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,360
I say mama mama moo

614
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,470
Mama mama moo

615
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,200
Mama moo?

616
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,940
- I say mama mama moo
- Mama mama moo

617
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,940
- Hello. We're MAMAMOO.
- Hello. We're MAMAMOO.

618
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,480
(The students follow along
quite well.)

619
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,650
- Hello. We're MAMAMOO.
- Hello. We're MAMAMOO.

620
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,550
(Team Pink is practicing hard too.)

621
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,580
It's "happiness."

622
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,250
- Happiness!
- Happiness! We're Red Velvet.

623
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,850
- Happiness!
- Happiness!

624
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,490
(IVE's clip plays.)

625
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,690
"Dive into?"

626
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,720
- What did they say?
- Happiness.

627
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Looks like they’re
just shouting the chant.

628
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,000
- Two, three. Dive into IVE.
- Dive into IVE.

629
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,030
- Hello. We're IVE.
- Hello. We're IVE.

630
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,800
- Hello. We're IVE.
- Dive into IVE.

631
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,000
- Dive into IVE.
- Dive...

632
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,900
- Dive into IVE.
- Time.

633
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,070
It's "Dive into IVE."

634
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,070
- Dive?
- Dive into IVE.

635
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,670
- Two, three.
- What?

636
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,280
- "Dive into."
- Hello. We're i-dle.

637
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,680
- What is this now?
- Hello.

638
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,880
- It's hard.
- Wait. This is...

639
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,410
- One, two. I.
- I.

640
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,420
- Hello. We're i-dle.
- Hello. We're i-dle.

641
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,880
(1. Thumbs-up while saying "I")

642
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,420
(2. Joining the thumbs at "i-dle")

643
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,350
Dive into IVE. Hello. We're IVE.

644
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,160
- I.
- I.

645
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,090
- Blah, blah. I.
- I.

646
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,660
- Hello. MAMA...
- I...

647
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,100
(Hello, MAMA...)

648
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,530
(Brain meltdown from the crazy
complex idol greetings.)

649
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,240
- I. Hello.
- I. Hello.

650
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,400
- We're i-dle.
- We're i-dle.

651
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,170
Hello. What's up! We're 2NE1.

652
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,470
You've got to mumble the words.

653
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,940
- What's up! We're 2NE1.
- What's up! We're 2NE1.

654
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,680
What's up! We're 2NE1...

655
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,580
- What's up! We're 2NE1.
- What's up!

656
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,650
- What's up, yo!
- What's up! We're 2NE1.

657
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,090
- What's up, yo! We're 2NE1.
- What's up! We're 2NE1.

658
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,050
(Road Man goes wild
at the sound of "What's up!")

659
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,460
- It's here.
- Here.

660
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,820
Hello. What's up! We're 2NE1.

661
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,630
- What?
- What's up-ee... What?

662
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,490
Hello. What's up! We're 2NE1.

663
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,030
- Hello. What's up!
- What's up-ee!

664
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,570
- No.
- "What's up-ee?"

665
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,870
- That's not it.
- What's up-ee.

666
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,570
- Who's that?
- It's not "What's up-ee."

667
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,840
- Is it "Wan-sup-ee" then?
- Hello.

668
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,040
- Is it "Wan-sup-ee" or what?
- Hello.

669
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,340
- What's up?
- What's up.

670
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,240
- We're 2NE1.
- Right.

671
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:44,050
(Finally, they get the greeting.)

672
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,180
- I got it. What's up!
- Hello. What's up!

673
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,750
- We're 2NE1!
- We're 2NE1!

674
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,450
Two, three. Happiness!

675
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,290
- Smile.
- Happiness.

676
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,760
- Hello. We're Red Velvet.
- Red Velvet is about the smile.

677
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,260
- Happiness.
- Hello. We're Red Velvet.

678
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,890
Red... Let's memorize it this way.

679
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,630
Red smile.

680
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,000
- No.
- Red Velvet.

681
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,470
- This is...
- We need to say "happiness."

682
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,670
- Happiness.
- It's "happiness."

683
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,070
- It's "happiness," not "red smile."
- Red happiness.

684
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,870
- Hello. Happiness.
- Happiness.

685
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,440
(Seok Sam keeps going astray.)

686
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,750
OH MY GIRL? OH MY GIRL...

687
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,910
It's "Found you, OH MY GIRL,"
isn't it?

688
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,680
- Watch it again.
- Let's look at the gesture.

689
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,880
Is it "Found you, OH MY GIRL?"

690
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,980
(The okay gesture is the highlight.)

691
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,790
- Hello. We're OH MY GIRL.
- "Found you."

692
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,590
Found you, OH MY GIRL!
Hello. We're OH MY GIRL.

693
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,290
- Found you, IVE.
- That's it.

694
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,420
- Found you, IVE.
- Found you.

695
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,090
- It's not IVE. It's OH MY GIRL.
- Found you, OH MY GIRL!

696
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,490
- Found you, OH MY GIRL!
- OH MY GIRL!

697
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,260
OH MY GIRL. "My girl."

698
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,970
He found "my girl."

699
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,830
- Right.
- Found you,

700
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,570
- Found you, OH MY GIRL!
- OH MY GIRL!

701
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,770
- Hello. We're OH MY GIRL.
- Hello. We're OH MY GIRL.

702
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,770
(They arrive at the destination.)

703
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,580
- Hello. We're MAMAMOO.
- Hello. We're MAMAMOO.

704
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,440
It's hard.

705
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,780
How can we memorize it all?
Found you.

706
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,610
- Mama mama...
- Sit with your team.

707
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,120
Team Blue can sit in the middle.

708
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,280
- Okay.
- Sit with your team.

709
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,520
My team will sit here.

710
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,620
One in a million?

711
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,320
- Hello. We're IVE?
- Hello. I am Jee Seok Sam.

712
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,220
Before you forget,

713
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,030
we will start
the Hello Memory Monster mission.

714
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,330
The two people
sitting in the front row...

715
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,760
will participate in the game.

716
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,170
The person who will decide
if you got the answer or not...

717
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,440
is our youngest writer,
who knows a great deal...

718
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,170
about idols.

719
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,270
- Great.
- Okay.

720
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,840
Once you hear the group name
and you know the greeting,

721
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,080
- you will shout "Let me answer."
- Let me answer.

722
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,780
The group is BTS.

723
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,910
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

724
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,520
(The signature move
is a finger gun gesture.)

725
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,990
(Team Yellow tried hard
to memorize it too.)

726
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,420
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

727
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,930
- Ready, go. Bang.
- Tan!

728
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,200
Bang. Why can't you
get the timing right?

729
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,230
- Bang.
- Tan!

730
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,530
(Disqualified because
of the off-beat timing)

731
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,900
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

732
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,000
- No "two, three."
- Start.

733
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,710
- Bangtan! Hello. We're BTS.
- Bangtan! Hello. We're BTS.

734
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,410
- Let me answer!
- That's wrong?

735
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,880
- It's wrong?
- Get set and go.

736
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,940
That's not it.

737
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,240
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

738
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,250
- We got this.
- Get set and go.

739
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,980
- Bangtan! Hello. We're BTS.
- Bangtan! Hello. We're BTS.

740
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,980
Yes!

741
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,850
- What?
- Wait.

742
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,650
- How is that any different?
- What's wrong?

743
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,860
You have to do it
at "tan," not "bang."

744
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,160
Right. You have to do it at "tan."
Bangtan!

745
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,630
(The gun should be raised...)

746
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,270
(at "tan.")

747
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,130
(Team Blue scores the first point!)

748
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,340
- Bangtan! Like this.
- Bangtan!

749
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,540
That's how you do it.

750
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,000
But that's...

751
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,240
(Team Pink was so close.)

752
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,040
We're lost for words.

753
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,610
Right. Okay.

754
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,810
You're right.

755
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,450
- She's judging super strictly.
- She is.

756
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,620
- Very detailed.
- "Bangtan." We were right.

757
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,420
- Hyun Young, you should stay.
- Should I? Okay.

758
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,550
(The team that got the answer
has to switch seats around.)

759
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,360
You have to say the answer quickly.

760
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,660
- You have to say it first.
- We got this.

761
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,160
- Asa should sit here.
- Asa, you sit there.

762
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,230
I will move to the back.

763
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,730
- Here's the next question.
- Sit there, Asa.

764
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,760
The group is IVE.

765
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,030
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

766
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,330
- Two, three. Dive into IVE!
- Dive into IVE!

767
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,170
- Hello. We're IVE.
- Hello. We're IVE.

768
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,970
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

769
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,340
- Let them go.
- Let me answer!

770
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,640
- Take it slow.
- Let's start.

771
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,940
- Dive into... IVE!
- Dive into IVE!

772
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,980
No.

773
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,610
(Fail)

774
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,010
- Dive int... IVE!
- Dive into IVE!

775
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,350
(Their game anxiety
is kicking in again.)

776
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,920
What’s got you so nervous?

777
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,480
- "Dive into IVE!"
- Relax, Jae Seok.

778
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,580
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

779
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,220
- We got it.
- It's us.

780
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,090
- We will go. Start.
- One, two, three.

781
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,920
- We're Dive into IVE.
- Dive into IVE! No.

782
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,060
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

783
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,590
- Is it wrong?
- "Dive into IVE!"

784
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,660
"Dive into IVE!"

785
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,630
- Dive into IVE! Hello. We're IVE.
- IVE.

786
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,570
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

787
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,840
- Let me answer!
- Ready, set, go.

788
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,640
- Dive to IVE!
- Dive into...

789
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,870
Let me answer!

790
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,880
(Seok Sam got
the words and gestures wrong.)

791
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,280
It doesn't stick.

792
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,910
(Jae Seok snatches the chance.)

793
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,550
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

794
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,350
- You can take your time.
- Slowly. Let's start.

795
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,680
- Dive into IVE!
- Dive into IVE!

796
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,820
- Hello. We're IVE.
- Hello. We're IVE.

797
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
Okay.

798
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,090
- We got it.
- We got it.

799
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,890
IVE doesn't greet like that!

800
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,460
They sound so lifeless.

801
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,290
You have to shout quicker.

802
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,560
I will be quicker.

803
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,330
- Everyone is so quick.
- Lifeless.

804
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,530
She's so strict.

805
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,000
- She is strict.
- It's okay. Let's take it slow.

806
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,900
- Here's the next question.
- Let's give it a go.

807
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,140
- The group is OH MY GIRL.
- Hey.

808
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,440
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

809
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,980
(The "found you" hand gesture
is the highlight.)

810
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,450
OH MY GIRL. "My girl."

811
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,150
He found "my girl."

812
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,250
(Once you know the meaning,
the gesture is easy to remember.)

813
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,350
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

814
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,390
Two, three.

815
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,720
- Found you, OH MY GIRL!
- You... OH MY GIRL!

816
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,460
- Hello. We're OH MY GIRL.
- Hello. We're OH MY GIRL.

817
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,030
- Found you, OH MY GIRL!
- You... OH MY GIRL!

818
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,730
- Hello. We're OH MY GIRL.
- Hello. We're OH MY GIRL.

819
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,530
I said it right.
"Found you, OH MY GIRL!"

820
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,400
- What's up with this girl?
- Why are you laughing?

821
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,430
(She muted the first word.)

822
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,970
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

823
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,740
- Team Blue.
- Let's take it slow.

824
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,770
- Ready, go!
- Ready, set, go!

825
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,610
- Found you! IVE...
- Found you! OH MY GIRL!

826
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,710
(Fail)

827
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,680
(The greetings got mixed up again.)

828
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,580
- Wait.
- Let me answer! Us!

829
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,550
- "Found you, OH MY GIRL."
- Ready, go.

830
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,950
- Found you, OH MY GIRL.
- Found you, OH MY GIRL.

831
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,150
- Hello. We're OH MY GIRL.
- Hello. We're...

832
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,020
- Wrong.
- Oh, come on!

833
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,260
- He didn't say it.
- Let us answer!

834
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,960
- Let us answer!
- Let us answer!

835
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Let us answer!

836
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,030
- Let us answer!
- Let us answer!

837
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
Two, three.

838
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,360
- Found you, OH MY GIRL!
- Found you, OH MY GIRL!

839
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,930
- Hello. We're OH MY GIRL.
- Hello. We're OH MY GIRL.

840
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,300
That's correct.

841
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,070
- Come on over.
- Oh, my gosh.

842
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,170
It's us again?

843
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,840
- We're doing good.
- Focus.

844
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,080
- Here's the next group.
- You need to get it.

845
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,880
- MAMAMOO.
- Let us answer!

846
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,050
Let us answer. Okay.

847
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,610
- Ready, go.
- "I say."

848
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,650
- Ready, go.
- How does it go?

849
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,050
- Ma...
- I say...

850
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,050
(Team's ace Asa makes a mistake.)

851
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,550
- "I say."
- Keep quiet.

852
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,620
- Wrong!
- Let us answer!

853
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,990
- Let us answer!
- Let us answer.

854
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,220
Ready, go. I say...

855
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,860
- mama mama mama moo
- Mama mama mama moo

856
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,090
- Hello. We're MAMAMOO.
- Hello. We're MAMAMOO.

857
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,830
- What's wrong?
- Mama mama mama moo.

858
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,560
(They got it wrong
by saying "mama" 3 times.)

859
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,070
- Let us answer!
- Let us answer!

860
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,870
- Go on.
- Ready, go.

861
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,770
- I say mama mama moo
- I say mama mama moo

862
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,040
- Hello!
- Hello!

863
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,040
- I'm MAMAMOO!
- Let us answer!

864
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
- It's "we're MAMAMOO!"
- Let us answer!

865
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,410
- Seok Jin...
- In 1, 2, 3.

866
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,410
- Let us answer!
- Let us answer!

867
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,980
(It's Team Yellow's chance.)

868
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,450
- Let us answer!
- Let us answer.

869
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,450
- MAMAMOO.
- Go.

870
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,750
One, two, three.

871
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,520
- I say mama mama moo
- I say mama mama moo

872
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,690
(I say mama mama moo.
Hello. We're MAMAMOO.)

873
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,690
(What?)

874
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,830
- Hello. We're MAMAMOO.
- Hello. We're MAMAMOO.

875
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,060
- They left one out.
- Yes.

876
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,600
- They left one out.
- Okay!

877
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,570
(They left out one "mama.")

878
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,870
- Mama mama...
- It's it...

879
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,040
- It's "mama mama mama moo."
- You said it twice.

880
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,070
(Team Pink said mama
just 2 times at first.)

881
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,440
(Hey, mama mama mama)

882
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,180
(They joked around
and it turned into 3 mamas.)

883
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,350
(And it stuck.)

884
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,990
- It's twice.
- It's twice?

885
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,050
Mama mama moo.

886
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,520
I think we got it right.

887
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,260
"I'm MAMAMOO."

888
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,130
- You were too nice.
- Okay.

889
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,560
- That's all the ones I know.
- Good.

890
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,760
Here's the next group.

891
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,770
- It might be hard.
- This is crazy.

892
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,130
- Is it...
- It'll be hard.

893
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,870
- i-dle.
- Let us answer!

894
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,170
- This is a hard one.
- Let's do it.

895
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,400
- One, two. I.
- I.

896
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,570
(It's the one
with the hard gesture!)

897
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,440
(Will Instructor Joo
and Pupil Jee get it right?)

898
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,840
- This is a hard one.
- Ready, go.

899
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,250
- I.
- I.

900
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,980
- Let us answer!
- Let us answer!

901
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,820
(Red Velvet's smile)

902
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,720
- Seok Jin.
- I. Hello.

903
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,050
- Let us answer!
- Let us answer!

904
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,460
- Ready, go.
- Seok Jin.

905
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,760
- I. Hello. We're i-dle.
- I. Hello. We're i-dle.

906
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,460
- That's it!
- That's it!

907
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,830
- Looking good!
- Let's keep going!

908
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,830
- Let's go!
- We got it.

909
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,460
- Wait!
- Let's go.

910
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,930
He did this when it's this.

911
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,930
- No.
- He did this.

912
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,940
- Jae Seok did this.
- No.

913
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,840
- It should be this.
- It's like this.

914
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
- I.
- It must be done right.

915
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,140
- This is the letter I.
- It's all about this motion.

916
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,140
- It's the letter I.
- This could be a problem.

917
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,340
- It's not fun.
- No, wait.

918
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,550
Some do this, and some do this.

919
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,980
No, no way.

920
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,750
Anyway, our new writer
practiced this for three days.

921
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,080
- Yes.
- Okay, then.

922
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,990
Let's see the new writer do it.

923
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,250
Let's see the new writer do it.

924
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,220
(Haha wants to know
how good the professor is.)

925
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,430
- Let's see you do i-dle.
- How good are you at it?

926
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,260
The next group is ONF.

927
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,860
- Let us answer!
- Let us answer!

928
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,030
- Let us answer.
- Let us answer.

929
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,430
- Lights on. Hello.
- Lights on. Hello.

930
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,430
- We're ONF.
- We're ONF.

931
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,340
- Okay!
- Correct.

932
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,000
- You're really good.
- We didn't learn that.

933
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,810
- Hello. What's up! We're 2NE1.
- Hello. What's up! We're 2NE1.

934
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,310
- Hello. We're 2NE1.
- Okay!

935
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,380
Not again.

936
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,250
- We're tied.
- This is the last one.

937
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,420
- We need to get this right.
- Yes.

938
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,250
- Please.
- Are you ready?

939
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,250
- "Hello."
- Okay.

940
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,250
It's the last one. It'll be hard.

941
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,360
The group is Red Velvet.

942
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,960
- Let us answer!
- Let us answer!

943
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,460
(The smiling gesture is key.)

944
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,560
- Let us answer!
- Let us answer!

945
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,200
- Three...
- Ready, go.

946
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,430
- Happiness! Hello, we're Red...
- Happiness! Hello, we're...

947
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,200
(MAMAMOO's mustache)

948
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,310
Ji Hyo, it's this.
You can't do this.

949
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,510
Happiness.

950
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,770
(A huge mistake right before
cementing their first-place win!)

951
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,610
Happiness! Hello, we're...

952
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,610
- Us!
- Ji Hyo.

953
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,850
- Let us answer!
- Let us answer!

954
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:36,850
Ready, go.

955
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,450
(Team Yellow wins
if they get it right.)

956
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,690
- Happiness! Hello.
- Happiness! Hello.

957
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,050
- We're Red Velvet.
- We're Red Velvet.

958
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,260
Okay!

959
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,630
(What a shame.)

960
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,860
- Sit down.
- It's over.

961
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,230
As a result of this mission,
in first place,

962
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,530
- Team Yellow with four answers.
- Okay!

963
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,300
- And...
- Well done.

964
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,500
Well done.

965
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,540
The first place team gets...

966
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,410
one prize ball each.

967
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,740
The second place team
gets one prize ball...

968
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,810
- and one penalty ball.
- Okay.

969
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,310
Seok Jin's team came last.

970
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,150
- Hey, still...
- The third place team...

971
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,580
will get one more penalty ball each.

972
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,220
- Okay.
- Here.

973
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,660
The mission is over.

974
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,790
- Do you want to know where we are?
- Yes.

975
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,990
The first vacation course...

976
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,830
is something we set up
because Ahyeon said...

977
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,130
she wanted to go to a place
you usually don't go on vacation.

978
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,600
It's a must in the summer months.

979
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,200
(A scary experience
is must in the summer.)

980
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,840
It's a scary experience.

981
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
In a place like this?

982
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,740
- Wait...
- In the city center?

983
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,480
It's a scary experience.

984
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,880
- In a place like this?
- I can't...

985
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,310
- In the city center?
- I didn't ask for something scary.

986
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,810
What's going on, Ahyeon?

987
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,050
I didn't know
it was a scary hot-spot.

988
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:50,650
This place uses realistic media
to provide a new kind...

989
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,790
of scary experience,
and it's popular with the Gen Z...

990
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,790
who keep coming.

991
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,960
- It's scary?
- Yes.

992
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,700
- You'll be chilled for 20 minutes.
- I hate scary stuff.

993
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,160
It should cool you right down.

994
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,830
I'll have a heart attack. Seriously.

995
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,830
This is insane.

996
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,130
- Ye Eun...
- Suck it up and do it.

997
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,500
I'll wet myself.

998
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,670
What?

999
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,870
- It's not that bad.
- I'm serious.

1000
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,810
- I'm serious.
- Go to the toilet first.

1001
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,640
- Use a catheter.
- I really can't do it.

1002
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,880
We get another penalty ball
if we don't do it.

1003
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,550
- We must do it.
- If you think...

1004
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,850
you can handle the fear,
we'll take volunteers to go in...

1005
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,620
and get one prize ball in return.

1006
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,050
- Okay.
- I'll go in.

1007
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,220
- Or...
- I'll go.

1008
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,060
you can draw lots
to decide who goes.

1009
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,630
(You can rely on your luck.)

1010
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,460
If you get the gold ball,

1011
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,260
we'll play the other team's screams
as they go through...

1012
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,430
- while you enjoy a coffee.
- Coffee?

1013
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,700
And you get two prize balls.

1014
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,940
- Two prize balls.
- Two prize balls.

1015
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,470
- I'll go in.
- I like that.

1016
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,970
If you get the black ball,

1017
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,910
you go through the scary experience
and get two penalty balls.

1018
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,510
- Yes. I'll do that.
- We never know.

1019
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,950
- I'll do that.
- That's better.

1020
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,820
You get two prize balls
if you pick the gold ball.

1021
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,050
But you don't know
if you'll get it or not.

1022
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,720
You either play safe or gamble.

1023
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,290
- We must gamble.
- The experience and a penalty.

1024
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,720
Within a team, can we volunteer
or draw randomly if we want?

1025
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,990
- It's up to you.
- It's on you.

1026
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,730
- It's up to is?
- Yes, you decide for yourself.

1027
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,760
You're no longer a team.

1028
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,860
- Okay.
- Okay, then.

1029
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,400
- Oh, no.
- I'll go in.

1030
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,470
Good job.
You got a bus ride out of it.

1031
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,600
You did well.

1032
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,770
I want to pick randomly.

1033
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,540
- I'll pick randomly.
- Have a scare and...

1034
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,510
- I think...
- We must pick.

1035
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,540
- Ye Eun, last time...
- We might not have to go.

1036
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,940
What will you do, Asa?

1037
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,310
I'll choose a ball.

1038
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,780
(Gold: Coffee, 2 prize balls,
Black: Get scared, 2 penalty balls)

1039
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,550
- Asa should have a go.
- The 50-percent probability.

1040
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,620
- I'll bet on that.
- Ye Eun should go.

1041
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,520
Test your luck.

1042
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,720
- You'll test your luck?
- Fifty percent?

1043
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,820
Yes, I will...

1044
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,560
- Life is about challenges.
- Yes, life is...

1045
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,330
If you want to volunteer yourself,
raise a hand on three.

1046
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,460
One, two, three.

1047
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,930
Jong Kook is the only volunteer...

1048
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,130
- for this round.
- What?

1049
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,400
(Jong Kook is the sole volunteer.)

1050
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,870
When would I get to do this again?

1051
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,940
Jong Kook will go for
the scary experience...

1052
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,410
- and get one prize ball too.
- Okay.

1053
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,740
We should choose randomly.

1054
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,710
- Of course.
- Yes. This is...

1055
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,850
- Either way, we die.
- Yes.

1056
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,580
I really can't do this.
I'll pass out.

1057
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,620
- I'll pass out.
- Choosing the ball...

1058
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,860
There are just two balls in there.

1059
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,060
- Ye Eun...
- For real?

1060
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,360
- Shall we go first?
- What?

1061
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,090
- Asa will go first.
- Sure.

1062
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,730
- Asa!
- Asa!

1063
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,260
- Asa! Go for it!
- Asa! Good luck!

1064
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,830
(They root for her
with corny cheers.)

1065
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,830
- Let's go.
- A 50-percent probability.

1066
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,300
A 50-percent probability.

1067
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,600
- It's 50 percent.
- Yes.

1068
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,070
- Are there really two?
- This is...

1069
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,270
- There are just two.
- Do they feel the same?

1070
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,980
- This is driving me crazy.
- Hang on.

1071
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,950
- Does anything feel different?
- This is madness.

1072
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,950
(Will Asa's adventure succeed?)

1073
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,220
This one. I choose this one.

1074
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,350
- I hope we all choose black.
- On the count of three,

1075
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,950
pull it out.

1076
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,450
- One, two, three.
- Let it not be gold.

1077
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,960
- Please. Let it not be gold.
- One, two, three.

1078
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,390
One, two, three.

1079
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,060
Come on, gold.

1080
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,330
- She got the gold ball.
- You did it?

1081
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,430
(Asa's gamble paid off.)

1082
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,430
- It's gold.
- She got the gold ball.

1083
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,400
- You get two prize balls.
- That's crazy.

1084
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,300
And you get a coffee,
and you don't have to go inside.

1085
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,170
What is she, really?

1086
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,440
- It's one or the other.
- Who will go next?

1087
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
- Ye Eun.
- You?

1088
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,510
- Shall I go? No, you go first.
- Ye Eun?

1089
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,610
Ye Eun, one ball will be warmer.
Pick that one.

1090
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,850
- The warmer one.
- Ye Eun...

1091
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,950
- The one Asa held.
- Ye Eun!

1092
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,450
- You...
- Choose the warmer ball.

1093
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:10,250
- You'll get the penalty.
- I smell black ink on you.

1094
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,790
- I smell black ink.
- I think it's this one.

1095
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,160
Pick the ball that's warmer.

1096
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,430
- Pull it out on three.
- The variety deity helps.

1097
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,960
(What is Bladder Girl's fate?)

1098
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,660
I'll really wet myself.

1099
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,960
One hundred percent.

1100
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,460
(It's black.)

1101
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,830
She got the black ball.

1102
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,100
You'll get scared,
and you'll get two penalty balls.

1103
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,470
Oh, come on.

1104
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,440
Kwang Soo used to have
that kind of bad luck.

1105
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,610
- Ye Eun's really something.
- There's no helping you.

1106
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,680
- You're in trouble, Ye Eun.
- Gosh, Ye Eun.

1107
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,250
- I really can't. Please...
- You have to.

1108
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,820
It's okay, Ye Eun.
Before you go in, pray to the Lord.

1109
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,520
My gosh!

1110
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,120
(Next up,)

1111
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,790
(it's Haha,
the guy who hates ghosts.)

1112
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,860
One of these is slightly heavier.

1113
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,900
This is lighter,
and this is heavier.

1114
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,060
- Are they the same?
- Please.

1115
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,130
Please pick the black one.

1116
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,300
- Please pick the black one.
- This one?

1117
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,570
I really can't go there.

1118
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,640
Haha's chances are 50-50.

1119
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,040
Please pick the black one.

1120
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,340
- The black one.
- Will you go with that one?

1121
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,910
- It's the black one. Haha.
- This one?

1122
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,880
Haha, you have to switch.
You must have the black one now.

1123
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,380
Hey, don't say that.

1124
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,550
- Haha will...
- This one?

1125
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,150
- Please pick the black one.
- Pick the black one.

1126
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,450
Okay, pick it up
on the count of three.

1127
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,490
- He'll get the penalty for sure.
- One,

1128
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,920
- Switch.
- two, three.

1129
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,420
Yes!

1130
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,760
- What? You put it back in there?
- He dropped it back in.

1131
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,990
- You have to do it again.
- It's back in there.

1132
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,090
What? You put it back in there?

1133
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,330
- You have to do it again.
- It's back in there.

1134
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,730
- Hey!
- You saw it!

1135
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,060
- You put it back in.
- But you saw it!

1136
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,100
- We didn't see it.
- Hey.

1137
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,430
- I didn't see it.
- We didn't see it either.

1138
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,730
- You saw it!
- Not me.

1139
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,870
- Did you see it?
- Pick it again.

1140
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,070
- Don't do that.
- What are you doing?

1141
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,070
- You saw it!
- We didn't see it.

1142
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,510
- You did too! I saw it...
- We didn't.

1143
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,970
- I saw it, then I dropped it in.
- We didn't see it.

1144
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,070
- We didn't see it.
- No, we didn't.

1145
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,410
- Why are you trying to scam us?
- You should've pulled it out.

1146
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,780
- You should've held it up.
- You have to show it to us.

1147
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,080
- Why would you drop it back in?
- Hey, right now...

1148
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,280
- For real?
- Why didn't you take it out?

1149
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,610
- You want me to pick it again?
- Why did you do that, man?

1150
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,750
You didn't see it?

1151
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,420
(They end up checking
the video footage.)

1152
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,790
(They even check
the high-speed camera.)

1153
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,920
(It was so fast that
it wasn't even caught on camera,)

1154
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,990
(but he says he checked the color.)

1155
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,430
- Did you really not see it?
- Haha.

1156
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,560
Why didn't you show it to us?

1157
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,660
That's because I didn't want...

1158
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,470
- the people in the back to know.
- You were too quick.

1159
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,170
- It was too fast.
- Yes, you were too quick.

1160
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,430
- But...
- Hey.

1161
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,900
- Haha is so speedy.
- Did you really not see me?

1162
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,140
- We didn't.
- All right.

1163
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,740
- Chan Hee, didn't you see me?
- Well, so...

1164
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,440
For real? All right.

1165
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,740
- Oh, dear.
- I saw it.

1166
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,940
- I did too.
- For real?

1167
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,280
You'll be punished for eternity.
Did you really not see it?

1168
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:18,850
Punished for eternity?

1169
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,050
You will all be punished
for eternity. You didn't see it?

1170
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,680
- We didn't see it.
- Okay.

1171
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,320
How could you say
we'll be punished for eternity?

1172
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,920
Haha, you should let the staff get
a shot after you pick the ball.

1173
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,220
- Okay.
- Right, you should.

1174
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,820
- Haha, I really didn't see it.
- Me either.

1175
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,160
- Darn it!
- I really didn't see it.

1176
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,060
Darn it!

1177
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,930
- Did you see that?
- We did.

1178
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,560
- Did you see that one?
- Yes.

1179
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,800
Okay, you chose the black ball.

1180
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,670
You saw that one?
Okay, I guess you did.

1181
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,670
- All right. Gosh, that hurts.
- I love it.

1182
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,770
Gosh, I love it
whenever we get more people.

1183
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,780
- Hyun Young.
- Yes?

1184
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,380
- You have to pick the black one.
- Come on.

1185
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,810
- You should get some screentime.
- Right, Hyun Young.

1186
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,810
- To be honest...
- You're good...

1187
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,080
- I'm so mad.
- You're okay with...

1188
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,450
I hope I get the black one.

1189
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,850
- Oh, she wants the black 1.
- Now, she'll get the gold 1.

1190
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,080
- She'll pick the gold ball.
- Hey, now...

1191
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,450
- It's this one.
- Right.

1192
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,090
- Hey, just pull 1 out.
- On the count of 3,

1193
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,090
- You can't pick.
- pull it out.

1194
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,160
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

1195
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,760
- Okay!
- Yes.

1196
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,890
(Black)

1197
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,460
You chose the black ball.

1198
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,800
- Are you happy?
- You're happy, right?

1199
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
She's been saying that she wanted...

1200
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,670
- to get the penalty.
- You get two extra penalty balls.

1201
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,270
- Oh, okay.
- Two more?

1202
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,870
You went through all that trouble
for nothing.

1203
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,540
- Gosh, I should've volunteered.
- I'll go.

1204
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,710
I should've volunteered.

1205
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,870
I'll go.

1206
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,580
- I should've volunteered.
- I...
- Just pull one out right away.
- I am...

1207
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,780
really lucky with stuff like this.

1208
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,350
- Haha, you know how lucky I am.
- I do.

1209
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,880
I drew the huge rib before.

1210
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,180
- I'm really lucky.
- One, two, three.

1211
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,350
- Don't pick one. Just go.
- Right away.

1212
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,350
- Right away?
- Yes, pull it out.

1213
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,720
(He gets the black ball.)

1214
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,120
You chose the black ball.

1215
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,790
- This time, it'll definitely...
- You'll get two more penalty balls.

1216
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,960
It'll definitely be gold
this next time.

1217
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,630
Why? They got three blacks in a row.

1218
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,030
Since there were three blacks,

1219
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,600
- this next one will be it.
- Gosh, seriously.

1220
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,800
- There were three blacks.
- Turn it to the side.

1221
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,930
- Bring it in front of us.
- It's over.

1222
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,670
This is why.
There were three blacks, right?

1223
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,270
- So, it's about time for the gold.
- Isn't it obvious?

1224
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,210
(Numbers 1 and 2 when it comes to
Running Man's biggest cowards)

1225
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,980
Why is it moving like that?

1226
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,380
(The ghosts' most beloved guest)

1227
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,180
(What will be
the two cowards' fate?)

1228
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,920
- Three.
- Even if I want to choose...

1229
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,120
- Let's go.
- You have to pick one.

1230
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,390
Just go for it.

1231
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,990
There we go!

1232
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,330
(Somehow,
they both picked the golden ball.)

1233
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,390
That's it.

1234
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,460
Hey, that's no fun.

1235
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,230
- Pick one right away.
- Two, three.

1236
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,270
Okay!

1237
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,570
It's black.

1238
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,670
- There we go.
- Okay.

1239
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,270
Ahyeon should get the black one...

1240
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,410
(As Ji Hyo and Ahyeon
both choose the black ball...)

1241
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,440
- Anyone could tell it was black.
- Hey, but...

1242
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,740
can we all go in?

1243
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,180
You'll be split into...

1244
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,740
- groups of 4 and 3.
- Okay!

1245
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,710
First, we'll have Jong Kook,
Hyun Young, Ji Hyo,

1246
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,750
- and Ahyeon go in together.
- But I want to go with...

1247
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,450
But I want to go with Jong Kook.

1248
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,580
The remaining three,

1249
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,490
Haha, Ye Eun, and Daniel,
will go in together.

1250
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,750
- This is the worst.
- It's the worst.

1251
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,260
- That's the worst.
- The worst!

1252
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,390
(The cowardly trio is complete.)

1253
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,890
- This is the worst. I mean,
- It's the worst.

1254
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,360
- I know this guy.
- Seriously!

1255
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,490
- I hate this.
- Hey.

1256
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,060
Among these guys,
I'm practically Kim Jong Kook.

1257
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,200
But I wanted to go...

1258
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,830
- with Jong Kook.
- I know how this guy is.

1259
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,170
Haha is a huge coward.

1260
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,230
- They put the cowards together.
- I seriously...

1261
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,440
I will literally wet my pants.

1262
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,700
You're going to wet your pants?

1263
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,670
- I'm being so serious.
- Hey, don't pee for real, though.

1264
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,010
- I'm going to go to the restroom.
- Go to the restroom.

1265
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,310
- I really have to go.
- Seriously?

1266
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,610
- Hey, don't actually pee.
- I will seriously pee my pants.

1267
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,580
- For real?
- Once, back in the day,

1268
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,650
- Did you pee your pants?
- in middle school,

1269
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,280
I really peed my pants
after a test of nerves.

1270
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,720
Gosh, you're so...

1271
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,920
- Hurry up and go.
- It'll be a huge ordeal.

1272
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,250
- Hey.
- Hurry up and use the restroom.

1273
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,990
- Where is the restroom?
- We won't have to...

1274
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,090
I'm going to the restroom too.

1275
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,990
- I'll take you. Watch out.
- Okay.

1276
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,930
- It's not that bad.
- Why did I put it in so quickly?

1277
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,960
By the way, Haha,

1278
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,100
you're really speedy.

1279
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,500
I must've been trying to
trick people.

1280
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,960
I think I wanted to confuse
the people in the back.

1281
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,570
- Oh, it's finally here.
- Thank you.

1282
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,630
Thank you.

1283
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,000
- An Americano.
- Thank you.

1284
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,040
Oh, you're giving us these.

1285
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,210
- This is the best.
- This is so...

1286
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,010
Gosh, this is...

1287
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,940
A moment's choice
makes such a big...

1288
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,180
(As the coffee team
gladly quenches their thirst...)

1289
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,210
Oh, that's nice.

1290
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,450
You must be really worried.

1291
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,580
- Let's go.
- I'm so...

1292
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,580
- You have to do it.
- No, please. Just this once.

1293
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,750
- Just a moment.
- Ye Eun, give us lots of laughs.

1294
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,320
Can you cheer for us once?

1295
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,020
Good luck!

1296
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,790
- Ye Eun, you can do it!
- Yes.

1297
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,230
- Chungju!
- Ji and Jee!

1298
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,430
- Cross. Yes.
- Good luck!

1299
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,060
Oh, man. Shoot.

1300
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,300
(They enter the experience zone.)

1301
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,170
- Shoot.
- It's going to start soon.

1302
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,700
- Darn it.
- Why? What?

1303
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,000
- This is...
- I...

1304
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,970
- I can't protect you.
- Please.

1305
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,080
Come inside,

1306
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,680
- and please look at the monitor.
- My gosh.

1307
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,850
- My gosh.
- What is this?

1308
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,080
- Gosh, please.
- It'll be okay.

1309
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,920
- I don't like this.
- Come to the middle.

1310
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,020
- The middle.
- This is too much.

1311
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,050
Hey, but...

1312
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,120
- Ye Eun, I'm not okay either.
- Just this once.

1313
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,250
I'm not good at this either.

1314
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,960
- Daniel, please.
- Okay.

1315
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,560
How scary is this?

1316
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,660
Why is it shaking so much?

1317
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,760
- Is it normally this shaky?
- Yes.

1318
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,230
- Are we going down?
- Thank you for...

1319
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,060
(Right then, they hear instructions
coming from the monitor.)

1320
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,830
(It's saying they just have to find
the door with the logo on it.)

1321
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,700
- With the logo on it.
- This is driving me crazy.

1322
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,740
(It's saying they just have to find
the door with the logo on it.)

1323
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,170
(Solemn)

1324
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,670
- Don't do stuff like that.
- It's opening.

1325
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,080
I really don't like this.

1326
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,280
Okay, come on. Go.

1327
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,480
I'm going to close my eyes.

1328
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,510
I'm really going to close my eyes!

1329
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,180
- Darn it.
- It won't end if we don't go.

1330
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,920
Oh, gosh!

1331
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,490
- What was that?
- Don't do stuff like that.

1332
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,920
- Gosh, this is so...
- Seriously.

1333
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,890
- Choi Daniel!
- Gosh, I'm sorry.

1334
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,790
- Do we have to watch something?
- We're watching something?

1335
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,930
Oh, hang on.

1336
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,060
Do we watch this?

1337
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,460
No, Ye Eun. Don't do that.

1338
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,830
Hey, we must sit here.

1339
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,730
Oh, this is us.

1340
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,170
I don't like stuff like this.

1341
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,940
- I don't like it.
- Less scary if you plug your ears.

1342
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,240
Gosh, what was that?

1343
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,840
(What happened all of a sudden?)

1344
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,010
Gosh, what was that?

1345
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,580
(Daniel jumped at the sight of
the staff's camera.)

1346
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,880
Why, you little...

1347
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,420
- Hey, you really scared me.
- You're so annoying!

1348
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:28,190
- Seriously, why would you do that?
- Hey, you made me bite my tongue.

1349
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,930
- Don't do that.
- Don't do it.

1350
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,860
You big coward.

1351
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,960
- Come here. Let's pray.
- Seriously, don't do that.

1352
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,200
- Hurry up. Dear Lord...
- Don't be startled.

1353
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,530
Please protect us...

1354
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,400
I have to go pee.

1355
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,170
I have to go.

1356
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,010
- I saw something moving.
- Don't do that.

1357
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,180
- My heart will literally burst.
- Did you go to the restroom?

1358
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,380
Did you go pee?

1359
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,580
I did, but I have to again.

1360
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,780
I didn't use the restroom.

1361
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,050
I did, but I'm going to pee again.

1362
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,220
Can we pee in here?

1363
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,280
(Can we pee in here?)

1364
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,720
Right now, these guys are...

1365
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,120
I mean,
you can't turn the camera like that.

1366
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,790
- Don't do stuff like that.
- I was so scared.

1367
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,260
- Don't do that.
- Haha, look.

1368
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,330
- I can't help you...
- By the way, Haha.

1369
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,330
- Ye Eun, don't worry.
- We have to go in there?

1370
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,560
This is no big deal.

1371
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,960
- Haha, do we go in here?
- This is nothing.

1372
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,100
- We have to go in.
- We have to go in?

1373
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,200
- Why do we have to go in?
- I'll go first.

1374
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,270
- I don't like it.
- Hey.

1375
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,570
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

1376
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,770
All right. Get behind me.
It's scarier if you grab me like this.

1377
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,640
- Daniel.
- Grab me from behind.

1378
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,840
- You can stay in the middle.
- Haha.

1379
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,640
- Why? I want to be in the middle.
- Okay. Get between us.

1380
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,050
(After taking precautions
with his short legs,)

1381
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,580
(they step inside.)

1382
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,750
- I can't do this!
- Hey.

1383
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,720
- What? Why?
- Hey, we can't go in.

1384
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,150
- Why not?
- There's someone in there.

1385
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,290
(Flailing about)

1386
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,320
- I can't go in.
- Is someone there?

1387
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,360
- I feel like I'm going to pee.
- Don't do that.

1388
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,130
- I feel like I'm going to pee.
- No.

1389
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,900
- Can't I go to the restroom?
- Haha.

1390
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,460
Haha,
I'm good at this kind of thing.

1391
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,200
Earlier, I was just startled
by the cameraman.

1392
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,730
Go and tell us what happens.

1393
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,940
- Yes, I'll go first.
- We'll stay here.

1394
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,140
- I'll go first.
- Go.

1395
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,770
- I'm really about to pee.
- There's someone up ahead.

1396
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,740
- I don't want to...
- There's someone in there.

1397
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,010
Really, let's not do this.

1398
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,140
Darn it.

1399
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,180
- Haha, there's someone there.
- There is.

1400
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,950
(Two friends are studying
on a stormy night.)

1401
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:02,080
Hey, we can't go in.
What are we going to do?

1402
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,820
Hey, we'll just take
two more penalty balls each.

1403
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,390
Hang on.

1404
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,590
- Ye Eun, do you want to see?
- Okay, let me...

1405
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,890
- Let's go together.
- Just take a look.

1406
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,530
Look over my shoulders.
I'll open the door.

1407
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,760
- One, two, three. Look.
- One, two, three.

1408
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:11,890
- Darn it.
- It's okay.

1409
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,330
- Hello.
- Are they fake?

1410
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,000
- Hey, greet them cheerfully. Hello!
- Smile.

1411
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,500
- Hello!
- Let's interview them.

1412
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,870
- Hello.
- Do you like Running Man?

1413
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,170
Hello, I'm Ji Ye Eun.

1414
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,940
- Hello.
- Watch the door.

1415
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,940
I'm Ji Ye Eun.

1416
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,440
- Come in.
- Should I just not go?

1417
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,440
- Hurry up and come in.
- Let's not go.

1418
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,080
(Flashing)

1419
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,380
- That scared me.
- Don't do that.

1420
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,850
Hey, how many people are there?
Are there two?

1421
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,280
Ye Eun, look around slowly.

1422
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,820
All right. Haha.

1423
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,180
(Right then)

1424
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,180
(Haha shuts the door behind her.)

1425
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,950
What's wrong with you?

1426
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,720
- Gosh, seriously?
- For real. Don't do that.

1427
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,860
Hurry up and look ahead.

1428
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,890
- Look ahead.
- Something is coming down.

1429
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,190
- It's just...
- Oh, it's...

1430
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,560
- Gosh, Haha. Hang on.
- I told you not to do that.

1431
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,700
- Hang on. What do we do?
- Don't do that.

1432
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,170
- Wait. Your head...
- What...

1433
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,870
- I don't think it's a real person.
- Hello.

1434
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,170
- Hello.
- Is it fake?

1435
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,570
- I think it's fake.
- It's fake.

1436
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,570
- Haha.
- Is it fake? Come on.

1437
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,140
That's fine.

1438
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,410
(Tapping)

1439
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,780
- Is it fake?
- It's fake.

1440
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,910
This isn't going to work.
I can't do this.

1441
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,120
- It's fake.
- It's fake.

1442
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,520
- It's okay. They're fake.
- Let's go.

1443
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,020
- We have to go.
- Why? What is it?

1444
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,090
- We have to go.
- Hey, kick this.

1445
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,160
Kick it.

1446
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,390
- Kick it.
- Kick it.

1447
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,230
- Is it a person?
- What? Is it a person?

1448
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,400
What is it?

1449
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,630
What is that?

1450
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,400
(Pounding)

1451
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,540
Gosh, what is that?

1452
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,810
(Scared out of his mind)

1453
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,180
(Screaming)

1454
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,350
- Hold on.
- Wait. What is it?

1455
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,010
What was that? What's over there?

1456
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,480
- What was that?
- Don't do that!

1457
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,020
(Just then,
Haha makes a run for it!)

1458
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,190
Was that a person?

1459
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,290
- Over here.
- Was that a person?

1460
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:48,760
- Was that a person behind us?
- Please, don't.

1461
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,990
I want to pee.

1462
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,030
- Come on.
- Wait.

1463
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,360
- Let's go.
- What... Stop it!

1464
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:56,100
- No, don't go.
- Hurry!

1465
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,930
- Don't go. I'm drooling.
- Ye Eun.

1466
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:59,840
Hurry over here.
It's okay. We're almost done.

1467
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,140
I'm going.

1468
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,270
- Was that a person or what?
- Over there.

1469
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,770
(Doing her best
until the last moment)

1470
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,610
- Ye Eun, don't grab my collar.
- Hold on.

1471
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,780
I found the exit.
You'd better thank me.

1472
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,810
Haha, gosh.

1473
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,210
Stop that.

1474
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,820
(Entering the next room
while seeking credit)

1475
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,950
- What now?
- Go.

1476
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,050
- Keep going.
- Are those people?

1477
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,560
Can you stop grabbing me
by the collar?

1478
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:22,120
- Hey, guys!
- What?

1479
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,160
- Why?
- What is it?

1480
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,760
- The eyes!
- That's fine. I'm fine with that.

1481
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,730
- They're fake anyway.
- Haha, those aren't real.

1482
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:30,270
Don't frighten me out of nowhere.

1483
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,630
Hold on. You can't strangle me.

1484
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,100
What now?

1485
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,270
(Moving forward little by little)

1486
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,440
I hate this.

1487
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,240
- What now?
- Cover your ears.

1488
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,780
What is it?

1489
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,650
(Something grabbed Ye Eun's ankle!)

1490
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,980
(Sliding and thud!)

1491
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,320
What?

1492
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,160
- What's wrong? What was it?
- There's something down below.

1493
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,020
- I'm sorry, but this hurts.
- I'm going to pee.

1494
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,020
Did you pee?

1495
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,930
I want to pee.

1496
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,300
- Something grabbed my ankle.
- I saw that too.

1497
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,330
Let's get out of here fast.

1498
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,870
- Come on. Get up.
- I honestly can't get up.

1499
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,200
- You have to get up.
- Are you dying over there?

1500
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,040
This is why it hurts for you.

1501
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,340
Please don't do that.

1502
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,910
- Do what?
- Don't grab my foot.

1503
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,110
Seriously.

1504
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,010
Since we're scared,
let's curse at them.

1505
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,280
(Screaming profanities
at the top of their lungs)

1506
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,190
(Boo-hoo)

1507
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,420
Good job. Nicely done, Ye Eun.

1508
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,760
It's much better now.

1509
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,160
- Let's get out of here fast.
- Yes, let's go.

1510
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,490
- Let's end this fast.
- Let's go.

1511
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:32,830
Darn. I hate this the most.

1512
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,400
No one is fond of this.

1513
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,500
(While the three scaredy-cats bond)

1514
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,830
- They just cursed.
- You get over here.

1515
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,570
I get scared easily,
but Ye Eun and Haha...

1516
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,400
Someone's throwing up.

1517
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:44,710
- Someone's throwing up.
- He's retching.

1518
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,140
How far along are they?

1519
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:48,680
They have about a third left.

1520
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,350
Shouldn't we drag them out?

1521
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:53,250
Why don't we go in there
and scare them?

1522
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,380
Should we head inside?

1523
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,450
- Why don't we...
- Let's do that.

1524
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,590
Can you give us a camera
to film their faces?

1525
00:46:58,590 --> 00:46:59,760
- Are you heading inside?
- Hold on.

1526
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,190
- Where are they entering?
- Do you think you can go in there?

1527
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,160
- Over there.
- Can you actually do this?

1528
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,490
- At the entrance right here.
- Can you do this?

1529
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,700
- We'll be right here.
- We're going to surprise them.

1530
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,360
- Jae Seok, this is a good spot.
- I think so too.

1531
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,900
- Jae Seok.
- Gosh, this is scary.

1532
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:14,640
This is terrifying.

1533
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,910
This is scarier than I thought.

1534
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:19,110
(The lights go out one by one.)

1535
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,980
What the...

1536
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,280
(Tapping sounds)

1537
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,510
(Peeking)

1538
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,350
I'm too terrified to go in there.

1539
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:27,980
- I can't.
- I know. It's scary.

1540
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,250
- I can't see anything. Hold on.
- This is terrifying.

1541
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,150
- This is scary.
- Why did they turn off the lights?

1542
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:35,490
I'm sorry, but this is scary.

1543
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:38,060
Why are you coming back out?

1544
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,390
- Seriously?
- Why are you coming back out?

1545
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,130
- We couldn't go any further.
- Get back in there.

1546
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,170
- Is it that bad?
- We couldn't go any further.

1547
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,630
- I knew it.
- I mean...

1548
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,000
- You scaredy-cats!
- We heard helicopters.

1549
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,340
(Chopping and whirring)

1550
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:49,340
- Whirring.
- That's what we heard.

1551
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,440
- That's what we could hear.
- You scaredy-cats.

1552
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,440
- We couldn't go in there.
- We couldn't go any further.

1553
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,180
Unbelievable. I'm sweating.

1554
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,880
- You scaredy-cats.
- It was better than expected.

1555
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,010
Gosh, why are you sweating so much?

1556
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,480
They were even scarier.

1557
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,820
- It wasn't too bad.
- Right?

1558
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,890
Exactly. It wasn't too bad.

1559
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:05,350
Don't team us up ever again.

1560
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,090
- You were supposed to be better.
- Are you okay?

1561
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:09,660
- I could manage that much.
- Are you all right?

1562
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,430
- I'm good.
- Do you know what Ye Eun said?

1563
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,730
After dropping
to the floor screaming, she said,

1564
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,300
"I wet myself."

1565
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,070
I asked if she was okay...

1566
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,330
and if I should call the staff.

1567
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:20,340
No way.

1568
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,000
She must have urinary incontinence.

1569
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,410
- Are you kidding me?
- And he's such a wuss.

1570
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:26,070
- He's such a wuss.
- Haha, no way.

1571
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,080
- Guys.
- Did you wet yourself?

1572
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,810
- That's not true.
- Why are you sweating so much?

1573
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,280
He's the worst
out of everyone I know.

1574
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,410
This is just vapor.

1575
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,450
- He...
- Look at his sweat.

1576
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,480
I'm not the only one sweating.

1577
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,550
- Look at him sweat.
- He's sweating so much.

1578
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,820
- You took a long time.
- I wasn't startled by anything.

1579
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,090
There was only that one time.

1580
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:42,190
- He overshadowed me.
- Hardly.

1581
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:43,630
You've found your partner, Jae Seok.

1582
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:44,730
- Really?
- Yes.

1583
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:47,360
Just so you know, I've been
to the Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

1584
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,170
Jae Seok, you threw a fit
at the exit a short while ago.

1585
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:51,770
I definitely heard you throw a fit.

1586
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,970
You bunch of wusses.

1587
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:55,740
So this is how it's done.

1588
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,710
Doesn't this seem like a museum?

1589
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,810
- Right?
- Yes.

1590
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,780
They did a good job
designing this maze.

1591
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,680
- I get it now.
- This looks good.

1592
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,110
This wasn't designed
only to scare you.

1593
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,550
You have to find the door.

1594
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,090
- Find the hidden door.
- Are you kidding me?

1595
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,050
- This is entertaining.
- What's that?

1596
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,990
- My gosh!
- What is it?

1597
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:15,890
- What's wrong?
- I was shocked by my own face.

1598
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:18,730
Someone's being chopped up.

1599
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:22,930
This will attract ghosts for sure.

1600
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,930
I'm worried I might see this
in my sleep.

1601
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:27,440
- We have to get out of here.
- Hold on. Let's take a look around.

1602
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,900
- Sure.
- The youngest goes first.

1603
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,010
Let's take a look.

1604
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,040
(What's the next activity
on the vacation?)

1605
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,110
Go through there already.

1606
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,580
Hold on.

1607
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,550
It can't be a vacation
without meals.

1608
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,710
For the second course,

1609
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,020
you will have what Hyun Young chose
as the dish she wanted...

1610
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,350
on vacation.

1611
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:44,050
- You'll be having...
- Was that necessary, Jae Seok?

1612
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,420
- malatang.
- Malatang?

1613
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,390
I haven't had malatang before.

1614
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,720
- I had no idea.
- What game will we be playing?

1615
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,290
With its spicy and hot broth,

1616
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,460
you'll break a sweat
and beat the heat.

1617
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,700
For this next course,
you can enjoy a vacation...

1618
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,430
- that tackles fire with fire.
- No, not malatang.

1619
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:59,530
- Malatang for me...
- I can't have malatang.

1620
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,940
After all that sweating?

1621
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,870
Before you eat, you'll play a game.

1622
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,480
- Which is?
- The game you'll play...

1623
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,540
is Sorry I Couldn't Eat.

1624
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,250
All team members will compete
to fish out the fruit...

1625
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,350
from the water tank
using only their mouths.

1626
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,280
Each team will get three minutes.

1627
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,320
The next member will get to go...

1628
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,360
after the member before them
decides to stop.

1629
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,390
The team with the most fruit...

1630
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:24,560
will win a prize ball.

1631
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,090
The runner-up will receive...

1632
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,830
one prize ball and one penalty ball.

1633
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,170
The losing team
will receive a penalty ball.

1634
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,770
- Okay!
- Some are at an advantage...

1635
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,540
- thanks to their teeth.
- Their front teeth.

1636
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,540
- Hold on.
- Those two.

1637
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,140
- Wait a second.
- Those with protruding mouths.

1638
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,380
Seriously?

1639
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,910
Our teeth are just like
everyone else's.

1640
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,780
- Ours don't stick out that much.
- Exactly.

1641
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,280
- They stick out a lot.
- They really stick out.

1642
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,750
- You're at an advantage.
- They stick out a lot.

1643
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,990
Split into teams
of 4, 4, and 3 members each.

1644
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,420
I want Jae Seok on my team!

1645
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,920
I'm teaming up with Jae Seok.

1646
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:55,990
Then I'll take Se Chan.

1647
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,560
- First...
- You two can choose the teams.

1648
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,000
- You two...
- Choose the teams.

1649
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,160
- He's right.
- Why us?

1650
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,770
- Who else has a protruding mouth?
- Se Chan and...

1651
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,570
I almost forgot.
Ji Hyo's a former haenyeo.

1652
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,940
(An official diver who filmed
a documentary on haenyeos)

1653
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,310
- You're right.
- She'll hold her breath well.

1654
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,810
- Ji Hyo will be good at this.
- I'll do a good job.

1655
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,140
Ji Hyo, Se Chan, and I
will choose the teams.

1656
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,410
- Sure.
- Yes, do that.

1657
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:16,450
- Is that okay?
- Sure.

1658
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:19,410
- She's a former haenyeo.
- Then we have two fish...

1659
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,850
- and a haenyeo.
- A haenyeo.

1660
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:22,280
- Fish?
- It's my job to catch them.

1661
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,320
- A mudskipper.
- I'll be choosing the squid.

1662
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,690
- You go first.
- Sure, the octopus.

1663
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,390
Why is Hyun Young showing
her front teeth?

1664
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,390
(Flirting by showing
her front teeth)

1665
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,730
Flirting by showing her front teeth.

1666
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,000
I choose Hyun Young.

1667
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,360
Hyun Young will be on my team.

1668
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,170
You can choose next.

1669
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,030
I'll choose next, so...

1670
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,270
- Asa.
- Asa, nice!

1671
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:43,740
(Teams for Mission 2: Team Ji Hyo,
Team Jae Seok, Team Se Chan)

1672
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,340
Are those the tanks?

1673
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,310
You'll need a big mouth
to fish those out.

1674
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:52,180
It won't be easy to bite into them.

1675
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,720
- Team Ji Hyo will go first.
- Okay.

1676
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,490
The four-member team will go first.

1677
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,690
Daniel, always have your glasses on.

1678
00:51:58,690 --> 00:51:59,890
(Player number 1:
The eternal weakest link, Daniel)

1679
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,290
You need to grab them
from down below.

1680
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,330
Grab them from the bottom
of the tank.

1681
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,330
Will I get an adult tooth
if my baby tooth falls out?

1682
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,200
(Player number 3:
Ahyeon with the baby tooth)

1683
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,560
Veneers can fall off.

1684
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,100
Veneers can fall off.

1685
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:11,330
Get ready.

1686
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,770
(Go)

1687
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,200
That won't work.

1688
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:17,770
Hold on.

1689
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,280
- Hurry up, will you?
- Unbelievable.

1690
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,540
I told you.
He can't get anything done.

1691
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:26,480
(The tall and sloppy Daniel is
bringing the team down again.)

1692
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,280
(Just then)

1693
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,690
- Unbelievable.
- He...

1694
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,020
(He fished out an apple!)

1695
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,360
- He has a big mouth.
- He's good at this!

1696
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,820
Wait.

1697
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:37,690
(Thump)

1698
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,460
Watch where
you're putting your head.

1699
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,970
- What's happening?
- He's good at this.

1700
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,400
- He's good at this.
- He's so good!

1701
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,670
- He found something he's good at.
- There's a game he's good at.

1702
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,040
He's really good at this.

1703
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,310
He's really pushing himself.

1704
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,280
(An unusual talent
with no obvious use)

1705
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,310
- What on earth?
- How is he so good at this?

1706
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,310
- He's really good at this.
- What's happening?

1707
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,550
- No way.
- He's like a monster.

1708
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,450
- Daniel, breathe!
- How is he this good?

1709
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,660
(Outdoing BABYMONSTER is
none other than MISTERMONSTER.)

1710
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,590
There's a game he's good at.

1711
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,830
(The water tank is
almost empty already.)

1712
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,300
Nicely done.

1713
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:16,870
(After getting all 7 out,
he flashes his foolish grin.)

1714
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:19,670
- He's so good.
- Really get your head in there.

1715
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:22,740
(Ji Hyo's up next.)

1716
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:23,970
Nice.

1717
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,440
(Biting down)

1718
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,610
(She sank her teeth in right away.)

1719
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:29,240
She's really good as well.

1720
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,910
- She's a former haenyeo.
- Right, a haenyeo.

1721
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:33,180
- The haenyeo.
- The former haenyeo.

1722
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,350
(Harvesting with her mouth
as if she's picking abalones)

1723
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:37,090
How can she bite down on them
like that?

1724
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,490
How is she this good?

1725
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,860
A minute has passed.

1726
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,160
- Pass.
- Pass it along.

1727
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:44,490
Next!

1728
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,830
Do I need to keep my eyes open?

1729
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,060
Yes.

1730
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,170
- How do I do this?
- You can do it.

1731
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:51,700
- How... How do you do it?
- Go, Ahyeon.

1732
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,030
Ahyeon, you've got this.

1733
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,340
- Ahyeon, let's go.
- Ahyeon, you've got this.

1734
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,110
- Bite down.
- Here she goes.

1735
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,440
- Go, Ahyeon.
- Dunk your head in there.

1736
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,610
You really have
to get your head in there.

1737
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:00,840
Get your head in there.

1738
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,640
(She immediately comes back out.)

1739
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,610
- Not like that. Dunk it in there.
- Dunk it in.

1740
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:07,150
- Go deeper than you expected.
- Get your head in there.

1741
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,380
- Even the back of your head.
- Not like that.

1742
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,390
Dunk it in here.

1743
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:13,360
Not like that.
Pass if you can't do it!

1744
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,760
(Pass if it seems hopeless.)

1745
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:15,890
Pass.

1746
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:18,390
(Just then, Ye Eun dives in.)

1747
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,200
(Aiming
with her sharp, white veneers)

1748
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,000
- Ye Eun, wait.
- Ye Eun!

1749
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,500
- Just drink the water too.
- Drink, drink!

1750
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,640
(Attacking fiercely
with the fake teeth her doctor gave her)

1751
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,970
Just drink the water!

1752
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,280
Oh, she got one.

1753
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,710
Hey, just drink up all the water!

1754
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,210
Oh, hey.

1755
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,110
- Oh, what?
- Hey.

1756
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,550
- Hey, that's hard.
- My gosh.

1757
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,320
- Did she just do that?
- She's so good.

1758
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,920
- Nice, Ye Eun. Let's go.
- She's doing so well.

1759
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,760
Hey, that's impressive.

1760
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,820
(This time, she dribbles the fruit
with her naturally flat nose.)

1761
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,630
- Gosh, Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun, let's go.

1762
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:53,660
She's good at this.

1763
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,400
How is she doing that?
She has such a tiny mouth.

1764
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,930
- How is she doing that?
- Oh, my.

1765
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,740
- I guess she can bite into it.
- Nice.

1766
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:05,010
- Oh, no.
- You have five seconds left.

1767
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,370
- Don't eat it!
- Five,

1768
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:07,810
- Food Fighter, don't eat it!
- four,

1769
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,380
- Bite down on it.
- three,

1770
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:13,550
(Will she be able to move
the last one?)

1771
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,580
- She's eating it.
- You can do it!

1772
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,020
Hey, she's good at this.

1773
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,720
(She adds 1 last fruit
with a buzzer beater.)

1774
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,390
- Gosh, that was great.
- She's good.

1775
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:21,820
(They automatically give her
a standing ovation.)

1776
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,860
She's good.

1777
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,630
So, this team successfully moved
a total of 15 fruits.

1778
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,300
- Gosh, 15.
- Are you okay?

1779
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,960
(Team Ji Hyo starts off
with a surprising record of 15 fruits.)

1780
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,700
Daniel is way too good.

1781
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,230
Seok Jin, did you see that?

1782
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,300
They got 15?

1783
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,970
- I mean, Daniel is really good.
- We should do more than that.

1784
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:37,710
Come on, Jae Seok.

1785
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:38,740
- It'll be easy.
- Do you want to switch?

1786
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:42,210
I'll switch with you.
I have never gone to the dentist.

1787
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,210
- That's it.
- I never needed dental treatment.

1788
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,380
- Healthy teeth.
- I have healthy teeth.

1789
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,020
Hey, there's a reason why
I have buckteeth.

1790
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,120
- Of course.
- Right.

1791
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,450
(Player number 2,
Sawtoothed Jae Seok)

1792
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,220
- Well, we have a fish among us.
- All right.

1793
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,630
Asa,
you just have to dunk your face.

1794
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:58,930
- Yes.
- Okay, let's go!

1795
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,160
- Let's do this!
- All right.

1796
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,500
- Everybody. One...
- Okay.

1797
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,560
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1798
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,630
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1799
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:04,630
(We refilled the bowls
with fresh water.)

1800
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:05,670
Ready.

1801
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:07,570
(Start)

1802
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,240
- There you go.
- Go for it.

1803
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,110
(He dives as soon as they start.)

1804
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,310
- Hey, what are you doing?
- What is he doing?

1805
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,180
What are you doing?

1806
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,480
- Breathe.
- Hey, what are you doing?

1807
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:20,480
- That was so...
- What was that?

1808
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,850
- We're in trouble.
- Are you putting on a water show?

1809
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:23,920
We're done for already.

1810
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,520
- I mean...
- What was that?

1811
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,550
(He tries again.)

1812
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,020
I mean, what is...

1813
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,590
(He sticks his tongue out again.)

1814
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,890
Gosh, what are you...

1815
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:34,830
- This is hard.
- Seriously,

1816
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:36,260
- He's flustered.
- what do you think you're doing?

1817
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,730
Gosh, what is he doing?

1818
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:38,730
There you go.
(Then, he succeeds consecutively.)

1819
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,900
- Nice. That's it.
- Hey.

1820
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,270
Push it all the way down.

1821
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,810
Tiger has got the hang of it now.

1822
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:47,240
He got it.

1823
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,980
- He got it.
- He's like a motor.

1824
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,410
He got it. There you go.

1825
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:54,420
Hey, what?
Just pass it on if you can't do it.

1826
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,120
- You can do it.
- This won't work.

1827
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,420
(The exercising bachelor
doesn't know how to give up.)

1828
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,120
- No.
- You have to bite it.

1829
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,260
- You can pass.
- There you go.

1830
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:03,560
Nice.

1831
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:06,130
- We still have time.
- There's enough time.

1832
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,130
Gosh, nice.

1833
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,200
Jong Kook dunked his whole head in.

1834
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,200
(Diving up to his neck)

1835
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,900
Just do two more. Good.

1836
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,010
Okay, go. Keep going.

1837
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,840
Just do it. Get all of them.

1838
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,340
Hey.
(Spitting it out)

1839
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,650
- Why are you eating right now?
- Don't rush.

1840
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:27,820
- It's because he's a carnivore.
- Okay.

1841
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,720
That's enough. Just pass it on.

1842
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,820
(Scrunching up his entire face)

1843
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,350
- Okay.
- That's it. He got all of them.

1844
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,490
- They break apart in the water.
- Gosh, these guys...

1845
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:37,460
(Next, it's Jae Seok's turn.)

1846
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:40,130
Indeed.

1847
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,200
They break apart in the water.

1848
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,200
(It only takes him 3 seconds.)

1849
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,210
(Again,
it only takes him 3 seconds.)

1850
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,840
(The Sawtooth's strength
is truly amazing.)

1851
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,580
Hey, that's cheating.

1852
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,940
- He's different.
- Hey, that's cheating.

1853
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,310
He's different.

1854
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:58,850
The Korean melon.

1855
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,850
(He's on a whole other level.)

1856
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,350
The fish is built differently.

1857
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:02,350
- A fish is...
- Jae Seok.

1858
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,720
The Korean melon is hard.

1859
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,820
(Jae Seok speeds ahead
with his animal-like instincts.)

1860
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,090
Jae Seok grabs the Korean melon
with his beak...

1861
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:10,090
which is stronger than his claws.

1862
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:11,990
(They've seen this scene
in the savanna.)

1863
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,490
- Nice. Indeed, he's different.
- My gosh.

1864
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,760
A fish sure is different.

1865
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,200
Although he may look ugly to humans,

1866
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,270
no other weapon is
as precisely polished...

1867
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:22,000
in the competitive ecosystem.

1868
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,070
I mean, look at his front teeth.

1869
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,880
His chaotic teeth
are a weapon he was born with...

1870
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,140
- and can't be obtained with effort.
- He's different.

1871
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:30,250
- The predator has...
- Okay.

1872
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,280
- a filling day today as well.
- Let's go.

1873
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,310
(He clears his bowl in no time
with his superior genetics.)

1874
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,420
It's only been a minute and a half.

1875
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,520
(He got all 7 within 25 seconds,
about 1 fruit per 3 seconds.)

1876
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,150
- What do we do?
- Go for it!

1877
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,420
Let's go!

1878
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,820
(Now, they'll be tied
with Team Ji Hyo with just 1 more fruit.)

1879
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,660
- He got it.
- a minute and a half.

1880
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,730
(Wiping)

1881
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:47,130
- Oh, dear. Father.
- Go for it.

1882
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,900
- Father!
- Father.

1883
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,230
- Father...
- There's no time to wipe your eyes.

1884
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,530
There's no time to wipe your eyes.

1885
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,800
I think Father is going to cry.

1886
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,540
- Father.
- Go for it.

1887
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,340
- The Korean melon is hard.
- Hurry up!

1888
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,340
(Just getting 1 fruit seems hard.)

1889
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,640
- Hurry up!
- Get the Korean melon later.

1890
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:01,110
- Hurry up!
- That's it!

1891
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:02,210
- You can do it!
- Father.

1892
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:03,750
- Oh, Father.
- You have to bite it.

1893
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:04,750
(Right then...)

1894
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,350
(Team Ji Hyo's highest record
was 15 fruits.)

1895
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:08,120
There's no time to wipe your eyes.

1896
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,150
Just go!

1897
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,390
- Dad's challenge!
- Father.

1898
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:13,620
(Team Jae Seok: 17)

1899
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,820
You have to get
the Korean melon later.

1900
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,360
- Father...
- Go for it!

1901
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:19,430
Bite down on it.

1902
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:21,500
- Do that later... You got it.
- That's it.

1903
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:22,660
- Go!
- Go!

1904
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,900
The next person can go.

1905
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,000
Asa!

1906
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:27,370
- Asa!
- I still got a lot.

1907
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,840
- Gosh, Asa.
- My gosh!

1908
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:29,970
She's doing well.

1909
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:32,570
- Good job. Asa, let's go.
- Hey.

1910
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,210
You have to open your eyes.

1911
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,510
- Asa, go for it!
- Where are they?

1912
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,150
- The apple.
- Hey, hurry. I should've done more.

1913
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,020
I should've done more.
Okay, a bit more. It's okay.

1914
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,020
- Where are they?
- Asa.

1915
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,450
Do you think this world is so easy?

1916
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,220
- Do it! Overcome it!
- That's it. Go.

1917
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,360
- That's it!
- Bite down on it, Asa.

1918
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,390
Bite it, Asa.

1919
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:50,890
- Bite until you hear a crunch!
- Let's go.

1920
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,130
Let's go.

1921
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:54,030
Gosh, I wish I could do it for her.

1922
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,730
- There you go. Go!
- Nice. Go.

1923
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:58,170
- Let it go.
- Go back in.

1924
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,200
- Four, three, two...
- There you go.

1925
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,900
- Two. The last one!
- Grab it!

1926
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,270
If you do one more,
it'll be amazing.

1927
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,340
- My goodness.
- It's okay.

1928
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,840
- It's okay.
- You did well.

1929
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,380
- Good job.
- You did well, Asa.

1930
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:09,440
Asa, you did a great job.

1931
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,910
- Agreed.
- This team...

1932
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:13,850
successfully fished out 20 fruits.

1933
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:15,980
- Nice.
- Gosh, that was funny.

1934
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,550
Indeed, for people with buckteeth...

1935
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,820
- Gosh, this is...
- I bit it, but it broke.

1936
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,860
This guy pulled out an octopus
with his teeth.

1937
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,230
Hey, you're right.

1938
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,530
On "Infinite Challenge."

1939
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:29,100
(Player number 1:
Testosterone Man Haha)

1940
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,270
The team of three has
the same amount of time,

1941
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:34,570
and you have the same number
of fruits total.

1942
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:35,600
Okay.

1943
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,810
Ready.

1944
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:39,710
Go slowly. It's okay.

1945
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:40,710
(Will Team Se Chan be able to
scale the great wall of 20 fruits?)

1946
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:41,980
(Start)

1947
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:44,480
See? It's not easy.

1948
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,450
(The octopus man sets off smoothly.)

1949
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:47,650
He's an octopus indeed.

1950
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,490
Indeed.

1951
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:52,190
- He's using the side of the bowl.
- Yes.

1952
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,190
(He gets through 3 in no time.)

1953
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:55,760
You have to push it up
against the side or the bottom.

1954
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,990
Gosh, that looks like...

1955
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,760
Hey, it looks like seaweed.

1956
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,600
- That's seaweed.
- Wet seaweed.

1957
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,630
(Even when they bother him
by washing his wet seaweed hair)

1958
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:03,800
- It looks like seaweed soup.
- Seaweed...

1959
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Seaweed stems.

1960
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,530
Hey, he's good.

1961
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,600
He's fast.

1962
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,100
We keep saying, "Indeed,"
so he has to keep going.

1963
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,170
(Panting)

1964
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:13,270
- The mood is...
- He's out of breath.

1965
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,540
- Go slowly.
- He's out of breath.

1966
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,540
Bite it.

1967
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,850
- Haha.
- No, you have to bite it.

1968
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:19,850
There you go.

1969
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:21,580
Keep going.

1970
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,080
(He spurts at the end
with his two hearts racing.)

1971
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,720
- But even if they do well...
- He's working so hard.

1972
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,520
- My gosh!
- All right.

1973
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,560
(Roaring)

1974
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:30,660
(The beast cleared out 9 fruits
in 45 seconds.)

1975
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,900
Hey, what was...

1976
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,500
Hey, is that a whip?

1977
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,130
- He's a fish too.
- Hey.

1978
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,140
- He's a fish.
- That's incredible.

1979
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:43,070
- He's a fish.
- Seriously, is he a fish or what?

1980
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:44,570
Hey, you're doing well.

1981
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:45,910
- Hey, he's just different.
- My gosh!

1982
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,110
- My goodness.
- Amazing.

1983
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:49,140
Is he a fish from the Mesozoic era
or something?

1984
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,580
Gosh, you're doing well.

1985
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,180
(He seems like a legendary sea monster
that survived the ice age.)

1986
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,520
- With his protruding front teeth...
- It's so easy!

1987
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,350
This is like watching art.

1988
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:59,220
He's going so fast. My gosh.

1989
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:01,290
He's just built differently.
You're finished!

1990
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:03,220
- He got all of them.
- There aren't any.

1991
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:04,860
He's a monster.

1992
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:05,930
- There aren't any.
- You're done.

1993
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:06,960
There aren't any?

1994
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,500
(Se Chan clears all 9 too.)

1995
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,200
(They'll be tied
if they just get 2 more.)

1996
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:13,370
Gosh, that was funny.

1997
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,900
- All right, Hyun Young.
- You can do it, kid!

1998
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:16,900
Okay!

1999
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:18,910
All right. You're doing well.

2000
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:20,370
- Keep going until the end.
- Bite it!

2001
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:23,880
- Bite it.
- Bite!

2002
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:26,280
- Bite it.
- You can do it.

2003
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,920
Hyun Young, you can do it.

2004
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,820
- Go for it.
- You can do it. Take a breath.

2005
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:32,190
That one is far away.
Get the one here first.

2006
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,990
- It's not easy.
- Corner it over here.

2007
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:35,390
Go down!

2008
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:36,720
- Go down more. There you go!
- Bite down on it.

2009
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,590
(Team Jae Seok's highest record
was 20 fruits.)

2010
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:41,060
Go down. Corner it over here. Go.

2011
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:43,260
There you go. Bite it!

2012
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,600
- Sink your front teeth in!
- Bite!

2013
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,730
You can do it!

2014
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,700
- Hey, breathe!
- Pull yourself together.

2015
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,010
(Pull yourself together.)

2016
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:52,510
(Joo Hyun Young, you can do it.)

2017
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,110
- Pull yourself together! Let's go!
- Go!

2018
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:55,410
- This one. The apple.
- Bite it!

2019
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:59,510
(Right then, she sinks
her front teeth into the apple.)

2020
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,180
- That's not enough.
- Pass!

2021
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,850
(They'll be tied for 1st place
if she just lifts this one.)

2022
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:06,590
- Washing her face was funny.
- That's it!

2023
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:08,220
(She did it!)

2024
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:09,920
Good. Keep going.

2025
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:11,590
- You're doing well.
- Inhale, exhale.

2026
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,160
(Strangely, they keep rooting for
their competing teams too.)

2027
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,100
- Go!
- Let's go!

2028
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,100
(They'll turn the game around
if they get one more!)

2029
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,370
- Bite it.
- Bite.

2030
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:22,840
No, don't eat it. Spit it out!

2031
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:26,270
- Inhale, exhale!
- Bite it!

2032
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:28,810
- Take your time.
- Slowly.

2033
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,180
- There you go.
- Oh, nice.

2034
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,580
- Here she goes.
- Breathe.

2035
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:32,980
- There you go.
- That's it!

2036
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,220
Slowly. Breathe!

2037
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,380
- Push it down. Yes, one more.
- That's it!

2038
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,390
Last one.

2039
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,920
You can do it.

2040
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:41,020
- You're okay. Don't cry!
- You're almost there.

2041
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,990
- Come on! Stop crying!
- You're almost done.

2042
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,590
- Nice.
- Okay!

2043
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:46,360
My gosh. Nice!

2044
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,730
- That's it!
- Okay!

2045
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:49,160
(The coach and player are in tears
after giving it their all.)

2046
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,500
- Gosh, you did great.
- We won!

2047
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,170
- We did so well!
- Yes!

2048
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:53,170
- You guys won.
- You won.

2049
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:54,700
- Gosh, Joo Hyun Young is so cool.
- The team of three...

2050
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,270
successfully fished out
a whopping 24 fruits.

2051
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:58,270
(Team Se Chan
successfully got 24 fruits out.)

2052
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:00,610
The team of 3 wins 1st place.

2053
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:04,110
(The honor of 1st place)

2054
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:06,450
Gosh, Hyun Young was amazing.

2055
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,720
This team comes in 2nd
with 20 fruits.

2056
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,520
- Okay.
- Team Jae Seok.

2057
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,990
In last place, with 15 fruits,

2058
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:14,490
it's Team Ji Hyo.

2059
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:16,120
Gosh, I should just volunteer.

2060
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,590
Me too. I'll eat this time.

2061
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:21,030
So, we've prepared
some unusual ingredients...

2062
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:22,300
- for a special vacation.
- What are they?

2063
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,800
- Unusual ingredients?
- What are they?

2064
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,200
- What are they?
- What could they be?

2065
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,000
- What? Oh, unusual ingredients.
- My gosh.

2066
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,100
- We must eat this.
- Gosh, what is that?

2067
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,210
- I hope they're not frog eggs.
- Is that cilantro?

2068
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,540
- Pig brain?
- This is scary.

2069
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:33,740
What's this?

2070
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,440
- This is insane.
- I can't believe it.

2071
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,580
There's cilantro.

2072
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,950
I can't eat cilantro. Seriously.

2073
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:39,680
Duck blood is...

2074
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,950
- Jae Seok, there are frog legs.
- Frog legs?

2075
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,850
- Why is beef tongue...
- Why are the slices so thin?

2076
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:45,450
- Pig brain?
- Pig brain?

2077
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:48,060
We brought the ingredients
that are actually sold...

2078
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:51,060
- at a malatang restaurant.
- I see.

2079
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,660
- This wasn't what I wanted.
- There's pig brain.

2080
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,760
- There's pig brain.
- Frog legs.

2081
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,060
They're cute.

2082
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,300
- I think they worked out.
- Yes.

2083
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,970
- Right? They have strong thighs.
- Look at the thighs.

2084
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:01,600
- Beef tongue,
- Beef tongue.

2085
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,670
omasum, and chicken gizzard
are fine.

2086
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:05,840
- We can eat them.
- Chicken gizzards are fine.

2087
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,780
- Chicken gizzards are fine.
- This is like cow blood.

2088
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,880
- Duck blood is fine.
- Duck blood.

2089
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,550
- Duck blood?
- Seok Jin, there's brain!

2090
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,850
I really can't eat frogs.

2091
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:15,220
(Pig brain is
an unfamiliar ingredient.)

2092
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:16,780
- What's up with the brain?
- Pig brain?

2093
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:17,890
I can't eat brain.

2094
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,450
- Pig brain?
- Beef tongue.

2095
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,760
I can't eat it.

2096
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,490
How will we eat pig brain?

2097
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:24,790
You'll enjoy a special malatang...

2098
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:27,400
that contains
these exotic ingredients.

2099
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,730
If you volunteer for this course,

2100
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,730
the spiciness will be Level Two.

2101
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,840
It's about the spiciness
of Shin Ramyun.

2102
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:36,570
This malatang
will contain vegetables,

2103
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:37,740
frog legs,

2104
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,040
duck blood,

2105
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,340
and cilantro.

2106
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,880
- I'll volunteer.
- You'll eat half a bowl.

2107
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,480
- I can't eat it.
- Half a bowl?

2108
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,780
Frog legs?

2109
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,110
- How will we eat frog legs?
- Frog legs.

2110
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,220
If you go for a draw...

2111
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,020
and get a black ball,

2112
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:53,090
you'll need to eat
one full bowl of malatang...

2113
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:55,090
that has the spiciness
of Level Three...

2114
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:57,160
and all the exotic ingredients.

2115
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:00,630
If you get a black ball and get
the malatang with everything,

2116
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:02,560
you need to finish the bowl, right?

2117
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,500
- That's right.
- Of course. You should finish it.

2118
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,830
Everyone had better finish it.

2119
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:08,570
If you get a gold ball,

2120
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:10,400
you'll eat a bowl of malatang...

2121
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,170
- Please...
- that has the spiciness level...

2122
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:16,140
and ingredients of your choice
as well as sweet and sour pork.

2123
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,050
Will we get sweet and sour pork?

2124
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:20,410
- What will we get?
- We'll get sweet and sour pork.

2125
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:22,750
Sweet and sour pork is
such a tempting deal.

2126
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,850
If volunteering still gets us
duck blood and such,

2127
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,650
it'll be better to draw a ball.

2128
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:27,760
Hey, let's go for a draw.

2129
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,790
Let's add all the ingredients.

2130
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:30,590
- I'll aim for a gold ball.
- Of course.

2131
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:32,760
I'll need to get a gold ball
no matter what.

2132
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,990
- Yes.
- I must get a gold ball.

2133
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,600
If there's anyone
who wants to volunteer...

2134
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,260
for the course,

2135
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:38,570
- please raise your hand.
- I must go for a draw.

2136
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:39,930
Jong Kook will volunteer
alone again.

2137
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:42,900
Seriously, he's unbelievable.

2138
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,340
- I'll volunteer.
- He likes to play it safe.

2139
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:46,440
- I want the frog legs.
- In that case,

2140
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,940
Jong Kook will eat...

2141
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,680
half a bowl of malatang
that contains frog legs, duck blood,

2142
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,310
- cilantro, and vegetables.
- I must go for a draw.

2143
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:56,350
The rest of the members
will have a draw.

2144
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:57,990
- Come out one at a time...
- I can't eat frog legs.

2145
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:59,450
- and pick a ball.
- Duck blood.

2146
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:00,790
- Ye Eun, go.
- Ahyeon should go.

2147
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:01,860
- No.
- Ahyeon.

2148
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,220
- Ye Eun should go.
- Ahyeon should go.

2149
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,290
- Ye Eun should go.
- Ahyeon.

2150
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:05,330
- Ahyeon.
- Ye Eun, go ahead.

2151
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:06,830
Ahyeon.

2152
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:08,030
(Using a cute voice)

2153
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,960
Ahyeon.

2154
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:13,230
- Ahyeon.
- Okay.

2155
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,370
- Let's go, Ahyeon.
- Ahyeon.

2156
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:17,300
- Did you pick a black one earlier?
- Yes.

2157
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,110
(Ahyeon got a black ball
at the first draw.)

2158
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:21,110
(What will be the result
of this draw?)

2159
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:22,210
Raise it.

2160
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:24,950
(Black ball)

2161
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:27,080
You got a black ball.

2162
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:28,980
- Black.
- Black.

2163
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,120
- That's the probability.
- Probability.

2164
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,150
- If another black ball comes out,
- Okay.

2165
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:32,390
- the next one will be gold.
- Gold.

2166
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:34,020
- Daniel.
- Ye Eun, you should go next.

2167
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,190
- No.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2168
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:36,590
- Come on.
- No.

2169
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:38,090
(They urge each other to go first.)

2170
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,660
- Hey, they look cute together.
- Yes.

2171
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,100
- They look cute together.
- They'll kiss at that rate.

2172
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:43,200
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

2173
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,670
For goodness' sake.

2174
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:45,770
- Daniel.
- Daniel, you're the man.

2175
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:46,900
It's just this once.

2176
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:47,970
I won't do it again.

2177
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:49,340
- I really can't eat cilantro.
- Let's go.

2178
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,500
- All right.
- You can do it.

2179
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,670
- Pick one right away.
- Go.

2180
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:53,070
It's too late.

2181
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:54,180
- Go. Just go.
- Shall I go?

2182
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,280
- Pull it out.
- Shall I go?

2183
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:56,780
- See?
- Okay.

2184
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:58,750
I'll go next.

2185
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,080
- You picked a black ball.
- I really can't eat cilantro.

2186
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,120
- I'll go next.
- I'm serious.

2187
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,150
I really can't eat cilantro.

2188
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:03,980
It looks like Running Man will be
successful.

2189
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,290
- I really can't eat it.
- Who wants to go next?

2190
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,190
- Seok Jin, go ahead.
- Gold will come after two blacks.

2191
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:08,260
Seok Jin.

2192
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,590
- No. You can't go next.
- Why not?

2193
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:10,930
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

2194
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:11,990
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Those who want to go next.

2195
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,060
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2196
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:14,230
(At that moment)

2197
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:15,930
(Sticking his hand in)

2198
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:17,400
- It's too late.
- The probability of gold is high.

2199
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:19,200
- I got it.
- You dropped it.

2200
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,840
- You dropped it.
- You need to do it again.

2201
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:22,100
- Haha.
- But...

2202
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,600
- You need to do it again.
- That's ridiculous.

2203
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,740
- It should count.
- You can't do that.

2204
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,580
- You can't do that.
- Why are you only strict with me?

2205
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:29,210
- Wait for your turn.
- Wait for your turn.

2206
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:30,510
- Wait for your turn.
- Don't get worked up.

2207
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:32,010
You lose if you get worked up.

2208
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:34,150
- Who wants to go next?
- Haha, go ahead.

2209
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:35,780
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

2210
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:36,880
- Do you want to go next?
- Go ahead.

2211
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:40,420
(Which one will he choose
this time?)

2212
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:42,590
- Yours is black.
- You picked...

2213
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:43,620
(He gets a black ball.)

2214
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,960
You picked a black ball.

2215
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,590
There's a good chance
the next one will be gold.

2216
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:48,630
- Haha picked a black ball.
- A black ball.

2217
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:50,730
- Why doesn't a dropped ball count?
- Go.

2218
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:53,930
- Why doesn't a dropped ball count?
- A dropped ball doesn't count.

2219
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,170
It wasn't your turn.

2220
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:56,440
(The world gives Haha a hard time
2 times in a row.)

2221
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,340
- Go.
- This is driving me crazy.

2222
01:08:58,710 --> 01:08:59,710
Ye Eun, go ahead.

2223
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:00,840
- The probability of gold is high.
- A dropped ball...

2224
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,280
- I'll go next.
- Ye Eun.

2225
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,380
I'll go next.

2226
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:05,310
- Please.
- This is it.

2227
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,750
- This is driving me crazy.
- Go with the first one you catch.

2228
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:10,820
(Ye Eun gets a gold ball.)

2229
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,920
(The queen of penalties
chose a good one for once.)

2230
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,190
- This is insane.
- Food Fighter!

2231
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:17,460
- Did you shout, "Here I go?"
- Why didn't you shout, "Here I go?"

2232
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:18,890
- That's ridiculous.
- Why didn't you shout...

2233
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:20,290
- Did you shout, "Here I go?"
- Why didn't you shout, "Here I go?"

2234
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:22,060
- That's ridiculous.
- Why didn't you shout, "Here I go?"

2235
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,200
- Hey.
- No way. This is...

2236
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,500
- You didn't shout it.
- You need to shout it.

2237
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,170
- You need to go, "Here I go."
- It's a must.

2238
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:27,800
- You need to go, "Here I go."
- It can't be helped.

2239
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,300
It's a long-standing rule
of Running Man.

2240
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,940
Hey, you can't play a game
without saying, "Here I go..."

2241
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,210
- It's impossible.
- on Running Man.

2242
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,510
- You can't do it.
- You have to say, "Here I go."

2243
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:34,740
It doesn't count
if you forget to say, "Here I go."

2244
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:36,680
Even if it had been a black ball,
we would've told you...

2245
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,550
- to pick again.
- You have to do things right.

2246
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:39,950
(Sighing)

2247
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:41,480
- Shall we resume?
- Let's get a gold ball again.

2248
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,650
- Let's get it again.
- Say, "Here I go."

2249
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:43,680
- Here I go.
- There you go.

2250
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,150
- I can feel your sincerity now.
- You're set.

2251
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:46,820
- This is the real deal.
- I'll pick one again.

2252
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:48,490
- Seriously.
- Take one out right away.

2253
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:49,920
- That's it. Do it.
- It'll be a gold ball.

2254
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,290
Yes. That's it.

2255
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:53,360
(She gets a black ball.)

2256
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,500
That's it.

2257
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,960
Ye Eun, that's it.

2258
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,970
(In the end, Ye Eun gets
a black ball 2 times in a row.)

2259
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,500
(This is unbelievable.)

2260
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,440
- Give it a go.
- Here I go.

2261
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,540
Go ahead.

2262
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:04,910
- One, two. This is it.
- Yes.

2263
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:06,740
(Se Chan and Seok Jin
get a black ball.)

2264
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:09,680
(Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, Hyun Young,
and Asa get a gold ball.)

2265
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,850
- It's a matter of probability.
- The ones who got a black ball...

2266
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:14,580
are Seok Jin, Ahyeon, Daniel,

2267
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:16,950
Haha, Ye Eun, and Se Chan.

2268
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:19,450
Seriously, things are going
quite well today.

2269
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:21,960
- This is my day.
- Seriously.

2270
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:24,060
- Grasshopper.
- I'm lucky today.

2271
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,530
Why is he so lucky today?

2272
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:26,960
It's a rare occasion for me.

2273
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,100
Those who picked a gold ball
will go and pick...

2274
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,070
- the ingredients.
- Shall we pick the ingredients?

2275
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:32,100
- Okay.
- Those who picked a gold ball.

2276
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,200
(The ones who picked a gold ball
go to get the desired ingredients.)

2277
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:34,540
I want to eat it.

2278
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:35,600
It's malatang.

2279
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,600
I'm so happy.

2280
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,410
(There are fresh vegetables.)

2281
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:40,240
- It looks delicious.
- It's fen hao zi.

2282
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,410
You have to try it. Niu jin mian.

2283
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,610
- In that case...
- Gosh,

2284
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,880
- I don't know what to pick.
- I'm so happy.

2285
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,750
- I want mung bean noodles.
- I want mung bean noodles too.

2286
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:50,720
- You need a lot of them, okay?
- Mung bean noodles.

2287
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:54,460
- I'll add an enoki mushroom too.
- That's right.

2288
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,060
(Yes!)

2289
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,260
Do you like cilantro?

2290
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:59,990
- Yes, I like it.
- It's here.

2291
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,730
What's up with me today?

2292
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:03,900
Jae Seok.

2293
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:04,930
(It's rare
to see Jae Seok so lucky.)

2294
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:07,100
- You're so lucky today.
- I'm so lucky today.

2295
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,640
What are these?
Aren't these corn noodles?

2296
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,100
- They're corn noodles.
- Yes, they're corn noodles.

2297
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:11,640
(The noodle enthusiast
can't pass by corn noodles.)

2298
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,970
I must eat them.

2299
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,410
You have to try it. Niu jin mian.

2300
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:16,910
- Shall I try this as well?
- Yes.

2301
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:18,850
- What's that?
- It's called niu jin mian.

2302
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:19,880
It's tasty.

2303
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,520
- Then I should try it.
- It's chewy.

2304
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,280
- Here comes a volunteer's food.
- A volunteer.

2305
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,490
- A volunteer.
- Is it one bowl per person?

2306
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:25,620
What a character.

2307
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:27,590
- It's half a bowl.
- There's so little food.

2308
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:30,090
- The quantity is small.
- It's small.

2309
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,730
Do we need to eat together?
Can I start eating it?

2310
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,330
Jong Kook, show us how it looks.

2311
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:35,030
- Let's see the frog legs.
- Chicken drumsticks.

2312
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:36,560
- Let's see them.
- Yes.

2313
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:37,930
What's that?

2314
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:39,230
- A frog leg?
- A frog leg.

2315
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:40,570
- It's soft.
- Hey,

2316
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:42,300
it's so well-cooked
that it breaks apart.

2317
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,640
It looks tasty.

2318
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:44,810
What's this?

2319
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:46,570
- I could eat frog legs.
- What's this?

2320
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:47,570
It looks like fish roe.

2321
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:49,640
It isn't an ingredient
we're familiar with.

2322
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,510
- Shall I eat it?
- Yes.

2323
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,420
- It's protein.
- How is the frog leg?

2324
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:55,750
- It's tasty.
- Is it tasty?

2325
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:56,980
- How does it taste?
- Is it like a chicken drumstick?

2326
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,050
- It's like a chicken drumstick.
- A chicken drumstick?

2327
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:59,150
- I heard that it was like chicken.
- Yes.

2328
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,150
(It tastes like boiled chicken.)

2329
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,160
He gave me hope.

2330
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,220
Frogs aren't so bad.

2331
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:04,220
- Frog tastes like chicken.
- Really?

2332
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:05,760
It tastes like a chicken wing.

2333
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,700
- I see.
- A chicken wing.

2334
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,200
- It's tasty.
- You know,

2335
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,000
he's the only one
who keeps volunteering.

2336
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:14,330
- He keeps volunteering.
- It's tasty.

2337
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,670
- Try the duck blood.
- Duck blood.

2338
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:16,770
- Duck blood.
- Duck blood.

2339
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:20,270
I'll put a piece of bok choy
on the duck blood.

2340
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:22,480
It looks like beef.

2341
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,180
- Vegetable and duck blood.
- That's a nice way of eating it.

2342
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:27,720
(Eating)

2343
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,850
- Is it good?
- Is it like cow blood?

2344
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:29,980
- It's like cow blood, right?
- Yes.

2345
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:31,220
- Is it like cow blood?
- Yes.

2346
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,150
- Doesn't it smell?
- It doesn't smell at all.

2347
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:34,460
It doesn't smell at all.

2348
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:36,820
- Compared to cow blood...
- It's softer than cow blood.

2349
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,160
- Is it like pudding?
- Yes.

2350
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:40,860
- You know,
- It's like pudding.

2351
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:43,300
those who picked a black ball
will get much more than that.

2352
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:45,030
It's here.

2353
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,470
- Give us the brain.
- What should I do?

2354
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:48,300
- Hey, are we getting...
- The frog legs are so tasty.

2355
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,570
the bad ingredients?

2356
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:51,770
It already smells spicy.
Seok Jin, will you be okay?

2357
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:53,740
I'm more worried about
the smell of cilantro.

2358
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:55,110
How will I eat it?

2359
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:56,240
How nice.

2360
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:58,350
Frog legs, pig brain,

2361
01:12:58,350 --> 01:12:59,480
beef tongue, omasum...

2362
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,610
- There's everything.
- Does the dish...

2363
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,280
- normally contain noodles?
- Noodles.

2364
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,780
What does it normally contain?

2365
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:05,390
- Noodles and meat.
- It's spicy.

2366
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:06,950
- Is it very spicy?
- It's spicy.

2367
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:07,960
What will I do
if it's spicy for you?

2368
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:08,990
It's spicy.

2369
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:10,220
- It's spicy.
- I can't eat spicy food.

2370
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,990
It'll come out the other way
right away.

2371
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:14,630
It's spicy.

2372
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:16,830
- It's spicy. Mine is spicy too.
- How spicy is it? Is it very spicy?

2373
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,870
It's very spicy. I like spicy food.

2374
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,570
What will I do
if it's spicy for you?

2375
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,300
- Oh, my.
- It's spicy.

2376
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,510
It's so spicy.

2377
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,040
Who wanted to come here?

2378
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:28,810
- It's spicy.
- It's tasty, but spicy.

2379
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,340
I could eat it
if it didn't have cilantro.

2380
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:33,310
(The two cilantro haters
can't even drink the soup.)

2381
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:34,350
Cilantro...

2382
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:35,850
- Sweet and sour pork.
- Sweet and sour pork.

2383
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:37,180
(Sweet and sour pork
goes to the wrong table.)

2384
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:39,890
- Ahyeon.
- It's for us!

2385
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:41,090
(Hyun Young loses it when she sees
sweet and sour pork.)

2386
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:42,960
(She suddenly becomes embarrassed.)

2387
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,590
- Sweet and sour pork.
- Hyun Young, don't get angry.

2388
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:47,490
I participated in the draw for this.

2389
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,300
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2390
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,900
(The gold ball members get
the customized malatang.)

2391
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,500
Look at these corn noodles.

2392
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,540
(It's full of noodles
other people didn't get.)

2393
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,670
It smells so good.

2394
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:01,940
(The noodle enthusiast
eats the corn noodles first.)

2395
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:08,550
(Hyun Young picks up a lot of meat.)

2396
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:09,820
Corn noodles.

2397
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:12,090
(Eating)

2398
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,320
(Asa enjoys the sweet and sour pork
that came with a gold ball.)

2399
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,360
Chicken gizzards are tasty.
Sweet and sour pork is good, right?

2400
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,730
(Humming in approval)

2401
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:20,030
It looks tasty.

2402
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:21,460
It looks tasty.

2403
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,100
Asa, it's what you recommended
earlier.

2404
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,200
- What?
- This one.

2405
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:25,470
It's niu jin mian. That's right.

2406
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:26,470
(Asa recommended niu jin mian.)

2407
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,570
Niu jin mian is tasty.

2408
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,840
Right?

2409
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:33,370
This place makes tasty food.

2410
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:36,340
I haven't had malatang in a while.

2411
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,310
Gosh.

2412
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:43,320
- It's so tasty.
- It's so tasty.

2413
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,320
(While the lucky members
enjoy the delicious food)

2414
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,020
- It's spicy.
- It's spicy.

2415
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,320
It's spicy. It's very spicy.

2416
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,630
- It's so spicy.
- Mine too. Level Two is spicy too.

2417
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:53,130
(Haha tries a frog leg.)

2418
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:54,960
- It's spicy.
- I can't eat it.

2419
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:57,160
- It's spicy.
- Haha, how is it?

2420
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,300
Is it spicy?

2421
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,230
What? It isn't half bad.

2422
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:01,700
- I told you that it was tasty.
- It's tasty.

2423
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,300
I told you that it was tasty.

2424
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,500
(The taste makes him embarrassed
about being intimidated.)

2425
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,940
It's much more tender
than a chicken drumstick.

2426
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:07,410
- It's much softer.
- Yes.

2427
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:10,810
Once it's fried, kids won't be able
to tell it apart from chicken.

2428
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,880
It's really tasty. It's good.

2429
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,580
(Everyone gains courage
and tries it.)

2430
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:17,890
- Is this pig brain?
- It's pig brain.

2431
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,720
- It's tasty, right?
- The frog leg is good.

2432
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:21,890
It's tasty.

2433
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:25,360
I want to add rice.

2434
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,030
- Oh, my.
- We need rice.

2435
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:28,630
I'm full. It was a good meal.

2436
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:30,700
Hey, hurry up and eat duck blood.

2437
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:31,730
I can't eat duck blood.

2438
01:15:31,730 --> 01:15:33,330
- Hey, hurry up and eat duck blood.
- What's this?

2439
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:34,400
Duck blood.

2440
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,870
Se Chan will eat duck blood.

2441
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:37,070
(Shouting)

2442
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:38,110
(Hurry up and eat duck blood!)

2443
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:39,410
- Duck blood.
- Se Chan,

2444
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:41,010
- eat duck blood.
- The three of us will eat it.

2445
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:42,340
- Duck blood.
- All right.

2446
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:43,940
- Eat some more.
- Duck blood.

2447
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:46,210
- The piece is big enough.
- Eat more, you punk.

2448
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,350
Don't waste food.

2449
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:49,680
One, two, three.

2450
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,050
(They replenish their iron level
at the same time.)

2451
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,260
Haha, hurry up and eat it.

2452
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:58,390
- Beef tongue is a bit...
- It's like jelly.

2453
01:15:58,730 --> 01:15:59,730
I think it's nice.

2454
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:00,760
- Beef tongue is a bit...
- It's like jelly.

2455
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:02,500
- It's like jelly.
- I told you that it was good.

2456
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:09,370
Haha, hurry up and eat it.

2457
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:10,640
(He gets a spoonful of soup.)

2458
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,970
It's like jelly.

2459
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:13,370
I told you that it was good.

2460
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:14,910
(Swallowing)

2461
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,950
- Hey, are you swallowing a pill?
- I don't think I can do it.

2462
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,150
- I don't like the texture.
- He swallowed without chewing.

2463
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:23,380
(Meanwhile, Ahyeon)

2464
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:25,150
(Frog leg)

2465
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:27,520
(Duck blood)

2466
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:30,360
(She's eating the dish quietly
by herself!)

2467
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,890
(She eats beef tongue in one bite.)

2468
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:35,760
She eats it well. Look at Ahyeon.

2469
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,660
- She just enjoyed duck blood.
- She ate duck blood too.

2470
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:39,830
- Ahyeon, you eat with gusto.
- Look at Ahyeon.

2471
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:41,470
- Ahyeon, you eat it well.
- It tastes okay.

2472
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,900
- Ahyeon, isn't it tasty?
- It's tasty.

2473
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:44,910
It's tasty.

2474
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:46,640
Is this the brain by any chance?

2475
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,640
What's the brain?
- It looks like it.
- It must be the brain.

2476
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,840
- It must be the brain.
- It's the brain.

2477
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:50,840
- That's right.
- Is this the brain?

2478
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,280
(He finds the pig brain,
the most unfamiliar ingredient.)

2479
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,680
- It's the brain.
- It's spicy.

2480
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,120
You're right. Eat it.

2481
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,750
- Eat it.
- What did we do so wrong?

2482
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:58,990
(He becomes upset.)

2483
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:01,790
How could you do this to us
just because we picked a black ball?

2484
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:04,660
(Daniel explores the unknown taste.)

2485
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,830
They're eating it
as if they're taking a pill.

2486
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:08,060
- I mean...
- The texture is strange.

2487
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:09,960
- This is...
- Give it to me. It's okay.

2488
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,770
(The unfamiliar texture
feels like an electric shock.)

2489
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:14,840
(Somewhere
between silken tofu and liver)

2490
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,140
Gosh, I don't like
this kind of texture.

2491
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:20,240
Se Chan is trying the brain.

2492
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:21,980
(Se Chan showed confidence earlier!)

2493
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,780
It's like he's taking a pill.

2494
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:27,880
(He swallows it again.)

2495
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:30,420
(He swallows
the nutritious food whole.)

2496
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:32,550
Gosh, I like the brain.

2497
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:35,220
- I like the brain.
- You punk.

2498
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:38,360
- Hey!
- I like the brain. It's tasty.

2499
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,530
(They finish enjoying
the second vacation course!)

2500
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,360
It's so hot.

2501
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,830
Gosh, it's hot.

2502
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:46,570
It's time
for the last vacation course.

2503
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:47,700
It's so scary.

2504
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,000
Jae Seok and Haha...

2505
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,170
- We've been on it.
- have ridden it before.

2506
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,340
It's so scary.

2507
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:54,810
Asa wanted to try
an electrifying activity.

2508
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,340
So we prepared a course
of riding a hot air balloon...

2509
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:57,840
- that floats in the Seoul sky...
- It's so nice.

2510
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,050
- like the moon.
- It's nice.

2511
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:00,380
- I love it.
- I want to ride it.

2512
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,820
- What? Is it a hot air balloon?
- It's nice.

2513
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:04,920
- I mean...
- It's so big.

2514
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,620
- It goes up very high.
- On a hot and stuffy summer day,

2515
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:09,920
- you'll go up 130m...
- What?

2516
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,830
- and enjoy the cool air...
- I can't do it.

2517
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:13,130
through this aerial activity.

2518
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:16,300
You'll get a view
of Seoul's skyline.

2519
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,460
I can't do it.

2520
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,530
You can go for a draw.

2521
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:21,170
- It's the same. If you volunteer...
- Is it the same?

2522
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,540
for the last course,

2523
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:25,140
you'll ride the hot air balloon
and receive one prize ball.

2524
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,170
I'll ride it.

2525
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:27,840
If you participate in a draw...

2526
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,040
and get a gold ball,

2527
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,550
you'll watch the members ride
the hot air balloon...

2528
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:33,250
- and receive two prize balls.
- This one is better.

2529
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,510
But if you get a black ball,

2530
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:37,780
you'll ride the hot air balloon
and receive two penalty balls.

2531
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:40,920
The only one who'll volunteer
is Jong Kook.

2532
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,590
I want to ride the hot air balloon.

2533
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,930
- Do you want to ride it?
- Ahyeon wants to ride it.

2534
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:48,030
- Ahyeon wants to ride it.
- Ahyeon, do you want to ride it?

2535
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:49,060
Yes.

2536
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,800
- I like heights.
- Okay.

2537
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,500
- Aren't you scared?
- No. I like such rides.

2538
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,770
- Really?
- Yes.

2539
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:56,800
(Will someone other than Jong Kook
volunteer this time?)

2540
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,210
- I can't do it.
- Does anyone want to volunteer?

2541
01:18:58,210 --> 01:18:59,510
(Raising hands)

2542
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:01,580
(Kim Muscle raises his hand
right away.)

2543
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,010
- Me!
- Me!

2544
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:04,380
Ji Ye Eun.

2545
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,980
- What's good about volunteering?
- Let's go.

2546
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,150
- Me!
- Let's go.

2547
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:08,450
- Me too!
- Me!

2548
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:10,550
I'm confident.

2549
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:12,720
I've ridden a hot air balloon.

2550
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,920
- I'm confident.
- It makes you fart nonstop.

2551
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:16,460
- What?
- I like farts.

2552
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:18,490
- Farts?
- Really?

2553
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:19,790
I like farts.

2554
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:21,460
- It goes like this.
- Do you like farting?

2555
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,660
I like farting and smelling farts.

2556
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:24,930
Nice.

2557
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:26,430
- I want to fart.
- It's nice.

2558
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:27,430
I hate heights.

2559
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:28,670
(People are beginning to exhibit
unusual behaviors.)

2560
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,200
- You must be drunk.
- Everyone,

2561
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,170
Ye Eun lost her mind.

2562
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,640
- She's drunk.
- "I want to fart."

2563
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:35,880
- What's up with her today?
- Do you want to fart?

2564
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,810
Let's let out a refreshing fart!

2565
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:40,780
(Let's let out a refreshing fart!)

2566
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:43,920
(The masculine girl is showing
various physiological phenomena.)

2567
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,690
- Nice.
- Do you want to fart?

2568
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:47,350
- Ye Eun, do you want to fart?
- How refreshing.

2569
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:49,290
- Let's fart.
- How refreshing.

2570
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:50,490
- How refreshing.
- Good.

2571
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:54,560
So people who raised
their hands earlier will volunteer.

2572
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:57,330
- The rest will draw a ball.
- Okay.

2573
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:58,900
- Let's go.
- This is driving me crazy.

2574
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:01,700
- When else will you go on this?
- You should ride it.

2575
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:04,100
- You just need a gold ball.
- Let's go.

2576
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:05,570
You'll need to ride it
if you pick a black ball.

2577
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:06,670
You'll need to ride it
no matter what.

2578
01:20:06,810 --> 01:20:08,210
- You should go on it.
- You keep getting...

2579
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:09,240
black balls today.

2580
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,310
Did you say, "Here I go?"

2581
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,280
- Here I go.
- Let's all get a black one for fun.

2582
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:16,020
(What will happen to Haha
after getting a black ball twice?)

2583
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:18,050
- Gold!
- It's a gold one.

2584
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,590
- You put it back.
- You saw it.

2585
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:23,120
(Putting it back right away)

2586
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:27,160
(Haha made the same mistake.)

2587
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:28,560
- What's wrong with you?
- Hold on.

2588
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,730
- What's wrong with him?
- Here's the thing.

2589
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:31,260
- This one is warmer.
- Why do you keep putting it back?

2590
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:32,530
- This one is warmer.
- Listen.

2591
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:34,570
- Haha.
- We needed to check it.

2592
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:37,170
You should've shouted, "An insert,"
for the camera crew.

2593
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:39,310
- I picked one as I was asked to.
- This one is warmer.

2594
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:40,570
- Really?
- Don't be like that.

2595
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,280
- That won't do.
- Do it again.

2596
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:43,640
Use the balls of the same color.

2597
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,010
- Put them in the ice.
- This one is warmer.

2598
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:46,610
- No picking.
- Then we'll use the same color...

2599
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:47,880
- and mark one ball.
- Let's do that.

2600
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,320
- Put a V-sign.
- That's a good idea.

2601
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,780
(Haha's gold ball gets returned
3 times in a row.)

2602
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,850
When we tell you to do something,
please listen.

2603
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:54,990
Don't act like you don't know.

2604
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:56,320
- A mistake is a mistake.
- That's right.

2605
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,560
You've done it 3 or 4 times.

2606
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,130
I'm sure it's a hassle
for the camera crew.

2607
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:00,860
- Right?
- Seriously.

2608
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:02,760
They wasted tapes because of you.

2609
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,100
- The one with an X...
- O or X.

2610
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,270
- The one with an X is black.
- Okay.

2611
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:07,600
The one with an X is black.

2612
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,170
- Go ahead.
- The one with an X is black.

2613
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:10,900
- Justice will triumph.
- Go ahead.

2614
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,910
- Here I go.
- We gave you another chance.

2615
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:14,410
- All right.
- You gave me another chance?

2616
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:15,510
- That's right.
- Of course.

2617
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:17,380
All right.

2618
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:19,010
(Keeping his eyes wide open)

2619
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,750
(What will be the result
of the draw...)

2620
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:23,720
(that left no room for objection?)

2621
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:25,150
O.

2622
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:26,990
- You picked a gold ball,
- O.

2623
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:28,460
- Haha.
- Justice triumphs.

2624
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,860
- All right.
- Okay. He picked it.

2625
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:31,260
- Yes!
- All right. Go, you punk.

2626
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:33,360
(The higher power felt bad for him
and finally gave him a gold ball.)

2627
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,130
You won't need to go
since you picked a gold ball.

2628
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:36,230
I won't need to go.

2629
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:37,500
- Seok Jin.
- Shall I go?

2630
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,330
- Say, "Here I go."
- Here I go.

2631
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,540
(Did he catch a ball with an X?)

2632
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:46,210
He dropped it again.

2633
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:49,010
(What will be Seok Jin's fate?)

2634
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:50,140
(It's another gold ball!)

2635
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:51,810
You picked a gold ball.

2636
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:54,010
(He moves close for an insert
as per the manual.)

2637
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:55,250
- You did well.
- Congratulations, Seok Jin.

2638
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,280
I have no objection.

2639
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,690
(The 2 consecutive gold balls
make them anxious.)

2640
01:21:58,690 --> 01:21:59,820
You have no objection, right?

2641
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:00,820
- I have no objection.
- You have no objection.

2642
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:02,620
- Daniel and I remain, right?
- Me too.

2643
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:03,760
- Se Chan too.
- All right.

2644
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,790
- We volunteered.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2645
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:05,860
- We volunteered.
- Jae Seok.

2646
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,930
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors

2647
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:09,630
- Please.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2648
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,670
Shall I go first or not?
You should decide.

2649
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:13,070
Shall I go first or not?
You should decide.

2650
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:14,330
- Jae Seok, you should decide.
- Go first.

2651
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:16,840
(The loser goes first since it's
about time a black ball comes out.)

2652
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,470
- Here I go.
- Grab one right away.

2653
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:19,670
I'm saying, "Here I go"
as per the manual.

2654
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:21,940
It's this one. Boom.

2655
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,080
X. Boom.

2656
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,510
(He gets a ball with an X
without hesitation.)

2657
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:28,080
(It was the model example
of a draw!)

2658
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:31,580
(Se Chan will ride
a hot air balloon.)

2659
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:34,290
(That serves you right.)

2660
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:36,190
(The remaining ones are
Jae Seok and Daniel.)

2661
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:37,490
- Daniel.
- Shall I go first?

2662
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:39,030
- Go 1st.
- Do you want to go 1st?

2663
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:41,030
If we consider the probability,
the next one will have an X.

2664
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:42,830
- All right.
- Jae Seok,

2665
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:44,600
you'll fail if you hesitate.

2666
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,670
- Just go and grab one. Just go.
- All right. Here I go.

2667
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:47,930
Yes. That's it.

2668
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,210
(He got a gold ball
at his first draw.)

2669
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:55,910
(He got a gold ball
at his second draw.)

2670
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:58,780
- It'll have an X.
- Please.

2671
01:22:58,780 --> 01:22:59,980
(What will be the last ball
of the man who has been lucky?)

2672
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,150
(He gets a black ball.)

2673
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:04,580
- It has an X.
- My goodness.

2674
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,550
Jae Seok,
I told you that it was late.

2675
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:08,090
You got a black ball.

2676
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,620
I love it.

2677
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,120
Hey, Se Chan.

2678
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,830
You should've grabbed one
right away.

2679
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:15,230
(He doesn't know what to do.)

2680
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:17,430
- Pick one.
- Here I go.

2681
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:18,430
(Daniel goes last.)

2682
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:20,400
(What will be the fate
of the new unlucky man...)

2683
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,700
(who chose a black ball
all day long?)

2684
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,300
- I should've grabbed it right away.
- Go.

2685
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:26,040
(He got a black ball
3 times in a row.)

2686
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,580
- You got the black ball.
- See?

2687
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:29,910
Look. It's just like the manual.

2688
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:31,610
You have to go right away
according to the manual.

2689
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:33,950
- You have to go with the manual.
- Like this.

2690
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:36,520
Everyone except those
who picked the gold ball...

2691
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,580
will get moving.

2692
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:38,620
- Okay.
- Okay.

2693
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:40,190
- I think it will be fun.
- Let's go!

2694
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:41,820
- Let's go.
- Farewell.

2695
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:43,090
See you.

2696
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,120
It looks fun.

2697
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,930
This is so scary.

2698
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:48,190
- Welcome.
- Hello.

2699
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:49,630
- Come inside a bit more.
- This is great.

2700
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:51,030
- Let's keep it balanced.
- Like this?

2701
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,800
- Okay.
- We have to keep it balanced?

2702
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,370
- Seriously.
- We have to go further in.

2703
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:55,700
- Go on.
- But shouldn't some...

2704
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,600
go over that side
so that it balances?

2705
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,970
You should look outside.
Why are you looking inside?

2706
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:03,580
I can just look over there.
And the bottom part is open.

2707
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:05,350
Isn't this screw missing?

2708
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:06,810
- Go inside.
- You're too scared.

2709
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:09,020
I'll give you a quick
safety instruction.

2710
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:10,920
- Sir.
- All right!

2711
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,120
- Lift it only a little.
- It's moving!

2712
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,550
It's going!

2713
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:15,660
Nice.

2714
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,720
(Moving)

2715
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,030
(Screaming)

2716
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:22,030
(Exclaiming)

2717
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:24,300
- Nice.
- Seriously.

2718
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:28,270
(The hot air balloon lifts off
while tilting.)

2719
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:29,800
No!

2720
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,100
Where is the railing...

2721
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:35,010
(It's rising at a much faster speed
than they thought!)

2722
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:37,410
(Screaming)

2723
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:39,110
(To Jae Seok, it's as fast
as a rocket.)

2724
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:42,120
Seriously.

2725
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:44,480
(It's quickly going further away
from the ground.)

2726
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,720
I'm scared.

2727
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:46,850
This is fun.

2728
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,020
- It's really fast.
- That's unbelievable.

2729
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:51,620
Are they all so fast?

2730
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:53,290
Goodness.

2731
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:54,530
Bye!

2732
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:56,660
See you!

2733
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:57,730
(They're still at a height
where they can hear them.)

2734
01:24:57,730 --> 01:25:00,170
- I get to fart just by looking.
- Seriously.

2735
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:03,600
Hold on. I think I feel
the atmospheric pressure a little.

2736
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,870
There is some pressure, right?

2737
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:07,210
- Swallow some saliva.
- I can feel it.

2738
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:09,010
Some people feel pressure
in their ears.

2739
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:11,380
Yes. I can feel the pressure
in my eyes.

2740
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:13,080
- My eyes are a bit...
- It's not that much.

2741
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,610
- Seriously.
- Why are you complaining?

2742
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,620
- There's no pressure in the eyes.
- My eyes are a little...

2743
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:19,420
Then the people living up there
would all be dead.

2744
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:20,720
- What are you talking about?
- I mean...

2745
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:22,520
- This is nice.
- How high will this go?

2746
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,990
I hate this so much.

2747
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:27,030
- This is nice.
- I really hate this.

2748
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:28,530
- It seems nice, right?
- Totally.

2749
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:30,860
I think it's tilting to this side.

2750
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:32,170
It's so...

2751
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:34,000
(Screaming)

2752
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:36,440
I think it's tilting to this side.

2753
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:37,900
We came up so high.

2754
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:38,970
I think it's tilted.

2755
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:40,370
Could we please go down?

2756
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:42,080
I really can't look.

2757
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,480
- It's amazing.
- I really...

2758
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:44,980
How high will it go?

2759
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:47,180
We can reach up to a maximum
of 130m.

2760
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:48,920
You don't have to push it.

2761
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:50,820
(Goodness)

2762
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:52,520
(Screaming)

2763
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,750
(While the cowards are already
pushing their limits at just 50m...)

2764
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:54,820
This is nice!

2765
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:56,920
- Seriously.
- We're at 50m.

2766
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,290
- This is nice.
- I can't do this.

2767
01:25:58,290 --> 01:25:59,760
- We're at 50m.
- You can see everything.

2768
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,930
It's refreshing up here.

2769
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:02,230
Right. It's so nice.

2770
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:03,630
You can see everything.

2771
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:04,760
It's so refreshing.

2772
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,030
Feel the wind.

2773
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,870
It's beautiful.

2774
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:09,670
- It's really beautiful.
- It's amazing.

2775
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:12,310
- It's beautiful.
- It's really refreshing.

2776
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:14,540
It is refreshing up here.

2777
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:16,310
- I like this.
- It's refreshing!

2778
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:17,310
It's refreshing.

2779
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:19,850
- We're at 50m.
- Be quiet.

2780
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:20,850
(Yu Coward is the only one
who can't open his eyes.)

2781
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:23,320
- We're at 50m.
- I said to be quiet!

2782
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:24,450
This is nice.

2783
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,050
I think it would be nice at 100m.

2784
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,550
- Ye Eun.
- Let's go up to 100m.

2785
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:28,860
- I really hate it.
- Right?

2786
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,760
- When would we ever go so high?
- When else would we go?

2787
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:31,930
(She's relaxed.)

2788
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:34,030
Higher!

2789
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:35,400
- What's wrong with her?
- Stop.

2790
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,630
- Ye Eun likes it.
- Let's...

2791
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:37,830
- Let's go up to 130m.
- Stop it.

2792
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:39,600
- Let's go up to 130m.
- Up to 130m.

2793
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,600
- No.
- Up to 130m.

2794
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,730
- Let's go up to 130m.
- Please go down.

2795
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:45,100
Higher!

2796
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,210
No.

2797
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:47,910
(With their request,
they reach 100m!)

2798
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:49,180
- Thank you.
- This is nice.

2799
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:52,150
This is nice.

2800
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:54,610
It's so refreshing.

2801
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:56,850
Se Chan. One, two, Ye Eun.

2802
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,620
One, two, three.

2803
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,720
- Let's take one too.
- Let's go down now.

2804
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:01,920
- Okay.
- Let's take one too.

2805
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,090
- Yes.
- Jong Kook.

2806
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:04,820
- Please let us down.
- One, two, three.

2807
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,730
(He takes a picture
while closing his eyes.)

2808
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:08,860
We can see everyone.

2809
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:11,330
- Nice.
- Please take us down now.

2810
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:12,630
Look over there.

2811
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:14,470
- I can't.
- Look at the park.

2812
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:18,100
(Jae Seok never opened his eyes
until they reached 100m.)

2813
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:20,470
- Look at the wide view.
- No.

2814
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:21,610
- There's a wide view.
- Jae Seok.

2815
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:22,710
- I can't look at it.
- It's not so bad.

2816
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:23,810
I can't look.

2817
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,950
I can't look.

2818
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:28,010
- Who is it?
- It's me.

2819
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:29,820
(They're as close as two love bugs.)

2820
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,820
- Lift your head up.
- I'm so scared.

2821
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:32,920
I'm holding you.

2822
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,720
Could you two be separated
for a bit?

2823
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,090
- No.
- But...

2824
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:38,120
- Hyun Young wants to pass.
- I want to pass...

2825
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,430
- She wants to pass.
- We have to go below 10m.

2826
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:40,830
- Let go of this.
- It needs to go below 10m.

2827
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:42,230
- Just let go for a bit.
- Seriously.

2828
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:44,230
- We're almost there.
- No.

2829
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:45,430
Hyun Young wants to pass.

2830
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:46,570
- She wants to pass?
- Yes.

2831
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:47,730
I passed through.

2832
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:49,900
We're here. We came down.

2833
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,800
- Seriously.
- We came down.

2834
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,110
- It was so scary.
- We're here.

2835
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:57,110
The Creepy Vacation Thriller Race...

2836
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:59,780
- has ended.
- Yes!

2837
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:02,450
I'll tell you...

2838
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:04,280
- the number of balls you have.
- Yes!

2839
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,550
The person with the most
prize balls...

2840
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:10,160
has seven balls.

2841
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,060
It's Asa.

2842
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:14,430
- No way.
- Asa has seven prize balls...

2843
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:16,460
and one penalty ball.

2844
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,360
- Amazing.
- Next is Jae Seok.

2845
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:21,070
He has 6 prize balls
and 4 penalty balls.

2846
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:22,600

2849
01:28:29,410 --> 01:28:30,910
Goodness.

2854
01:28:45,730 --> 01:28:46,930
What did you do today, Ye Eun?

2855
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:48,700
Ahyeon has two prize balls...

2856
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:49,930
- and six penalty balls.
- What?

2857
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:51,500
- Six penalty balls?
- Why did you do that?

2858
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:54,900
And Daniel has no prize balls...

2859
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,140
and eight penalty balls.

2860
01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:59,170
- What did he do today?
- He's rich.

2861
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:01,910
Something isn't right.

2862
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:02,910
- Did it all go somewhere?
- It's cute.

2863
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:04,310
- He's really...
- But...

2864
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:06,580
First, we will pick
the two members...

2865
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:08,280
- who will get gift certificates...
- That's nice.

2866
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,550
to a hotel buffet that goes well...

2867
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:10,550
- with vacations.
- Asa would take it.

2868
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:12,850
I just hope I don't get the penalty.
I don't care much about this.

2869
01:29:12,850 --> 01:29:14,020
- Me too.
- I also want to avoid the penalty.

2870
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:15,350
- Right.
- The penalty is really...

2871
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:18,120
I have a chance
to win the buffet gift certificate.

2872
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:22,030
The member who gets picked first
will get two gift certificates.

2873
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:24,560
The second member
will get one gift certificate.

2874
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,830
We'll start picking for the prizes.

2875
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,440
- Yes.
- I don't even expect to get this.

2876
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,170
- I don't.
- I want to get it.

2877
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:33,070
I picked one.

2878
01:29:33,070 --> 01:29:34,310
(It was called a vacation,
but they suffered the whole day.)

2879
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:35,340
Jee Seok Jin.

2880
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,850
The first prize goes...

2881
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:40,050
to Haha.

2882
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:42,120
(Haha gets the 1st prize.)

2883
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:43,780
But did you say, "Here I go?"

2884
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:45,420
- You didn't say it.
- You didn't.

2885
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:47,250
- You have to say it.
- You should say it.

2886
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:49,790
- You should say it.
- It's in the Running Man manual.

2887
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:51,360
- But this...
- Seriously. "Here I go."

2888
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,930
- You have to get confirmation.
- Here I go.

2889
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:54,430
- How many times must I tell you?
- Se Chan.

2890
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:55,830
- After you say it, we nod.
- Of course.

2891
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:56,930
- After you say "Here I go,"
- Don't do this.

2892
01:29:56,930 --> 01:29:58,060
- Nod
- we nod.

2893
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:59,830
- That's in the manual.
- We'll use that for the penalty.

2894
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:01,300
- Right.
- The first prize goes to Haha.

2895
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:03,070
- She's wise.
- It's in the manual.

2896
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:04,200
Thank you, Hyung In.

2897
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:07,070
- I'll choose the second one.
- I think I'll get the penalty.

2898
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,510
- Buffet?
- Let me get at least one.

2899
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:10,910
It's Se Chan. Yang Se Chan.

2900
01:30:10,910 --> 01:30:11,910
(The number of prize balls)

2901
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:13,150
It's me. Jee Seok Jin.

2902
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:14,610
(Who will be the last lucky winner?)

2903
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:17,120
- The second prize...
- It's me.

2904
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:19,420
- goes to Jong Kook.
- Goodness.

2905
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:20,820
(Kim Jong Kook gets the prize.)

2906
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:22,360
(He won the prize with 5 prize balls
after going safe and volunteering.)

2907
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,220
- The lucky ones get it.
- I didn't even expect it.

2908
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:26,730
You got very lucky at the end.

2909
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:28,090
Are there chances
I might get the penalty too?

2910
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:29,130
- Right.
- Please.

2911
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:30,930
We'll choose three members
to get the penalty.

2912
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:32,470
- Three. I just need to avoid this.
- I should avoid this.

2913
01:30:32,530 --> 01:30:34,600
I'll pick the first one. Here I go!

2914
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:37,100
(I'll pick the first one.
Here I go!)

2915
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:39,010
- "Here I go." Yes, I'll nod.
- Nod.

2916
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:40,070
We nodded.

2917
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:42,640
(Who will be picked first according
to the manual for the penalty?)

2918
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,440
- There.
- Here.

2919
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,410
It's Choi Daniel.

2920
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:49,380
(Choi Daniel will get the penalty.)

2921
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:50,620
- Right.
- You can go.

2922
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:52,520
- You had eight balls.
- You should just accept it.

2923
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:53,550
- You had a high chance.
- It's cute.

2924
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:54,920
- "Here I go."
- This is the second member.

2925
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,160
- You had many balls.
- "Here I go."

2926
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:57,190
- "Here I go."
- Here I go.

2927
01:30:57,190 --> 01:30:58,190
- Please.
- Okay.

2928
01:30:58,190 --> 01:30:59,760
- It's a scary penalty.
- Confirm.

2929
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,400
(Who will be the second person
to get the penalty with Daniel?)

2930
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,400
Ji Ye Eun.

2931
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:05,230
It's Jae Seok.

2932
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,000
Haha will get the penalty.

(Haha will get the penalty.)

2934
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:11,270
Right!

2935
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:12,970
(He got both the prize
and the penalty.)

2936
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:14,010
- She went with the manual.
- He's lucky.

2937
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:15,640
- He's lucky today.
- Right.

2938
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:17,440
- Take everything.
- Did you say "Here I go?"

2939
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:18,810
- before picking the second one?
- She did.

2940
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:20,380
- She did.
- We nodded. The manual was kept.

2941
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:22,420
- Goodness.
- She followed the manual.

2942
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:24,520
- The last attempt!
- This is the last one.

2943
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,720
- Here I go.
- Okay!

2944
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,020
- Jae Seok.
- It's Se Chan or Jae Seok.

2945
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:28,350
- It's Jae Seok.
- Please.

2946
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:29,720
- It's one, right?
- Please. Seok Sam.

2947
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,260
- Yu Jae Seok.
- Seok Sam didn't get any penalties.

2948
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,460
- That's right.
- Yu Jae Seok!

2949
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:33,460
- I got one.
- Milkshake.

2950
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:35,030

2951
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:38,100
- Joo Hyun Young.
- No!

2952
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,330
(Who will be the last person
to get the penalty?)

2953
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:40,800
It's Joo Hyun Young.

2954
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,140
(Joo Hyun Young will get
the penalty.)

2955
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:45,670
This is because of you!

2956
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:47,210
Congratulations, Hyun Young!

2957
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:49,610
(Hyun Young gets picked with 3 balls
because of Seok Sam's curse.)

2958
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:52,280
- This is because of you.
- Today's penalty...

2959
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:54,310
is to make 50 servings
of fruit bingsu...

2960
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:57,450
for the production crew
before leaving work.

2961
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,520
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

2962
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,090
This is a penalty.

2963
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:03,120
- Amazing.
- That's a real penalty.

2964
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,090
- This is a penalty.
- It's a huge one.

2965
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:07,390
You can all go home...

2966
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:09,900
- except the penalty receivers.
- Okay!

2967
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,560
- Let's go!
- Goodness.

2968
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:12,830
- Good luck, Hyun Young.
- Let's go!

2969
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:13,930
- Well done, everyone.

01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,290
(He's a ballad singer now.)

2982
01:32:36,590 --> 01:32:37,920
(That's how the day
of the variety show veterans begins.)

2983

where we had a fight!)

2984
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:40,860
(We pushed.)
