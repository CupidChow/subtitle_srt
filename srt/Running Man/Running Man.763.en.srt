1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,480
(One summer day
when the sweltering heat continues)

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,810
It's been a long time
since I've been to a mall.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,750
Gosh, this is really...

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,250
Hello.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,980
- Hello.
- Hello.

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,950
- Hello.
- This is...

7
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,320
(They are coming up
one after another.)

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,420
- Why?
- They're sitting on the floor.

9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,620
This is right in front
of my parents' house in Anyang.

10
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,620
This one?

11
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,690
- Like a convenience store.
- I see.

12
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,990
Where's Daniel?

13
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,360
Where's Daniel?

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,830
- Daniel is shooting a drama.
- Drama.

15
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,600
Daniel recently started a new drama.

16
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,200
- Right.
- We don't do this on Tuesday.

17
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,940
While doing a variety show,
he started a new drama.

18
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,340
- Right.
- It's a good thing.

19
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,340
It's good.

20
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,010
- It really is.
- Right.

21
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,280
Ye Eun is also not here today.

22
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,450
- No.
- Right. Ye Eun isn't here.

23
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,780
Today's race is called
Happy Ye Eun Day.

24
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,320
- What?
- Ye Eun is...

25
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
having a housewarming party.

26
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,820
- Nice.
- Right. She recently moved.

27
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,020
(The news of Ye Eun's move was
announced during the last shoot.)

28
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,990
- You can come to my place now.
- Can we go?

29
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,030
(The housewarming has come true
thanks to Ye Eun's invitation.)

30
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,200
We can't go to her new place
empty-handed, right?

31
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
- Right.
- And Ye Eun's birthday is coming.

32
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
- Really?
- I see.

33
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,000
- Let's go.
- The day before this one airs...

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,200
- is Ye Eun's birthday.
- Really?

35
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,370
It's July 26.

36
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,840
So you will buy something for her
with your own money...

37
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,210
as a housewarming gift
and a birthday gift.

38
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,810
- With our own money.
- Hang on.

39
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,280
- It doesn't matter how much it is?
- No.

40
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,520
Still, it should be
a reasonable amount.

41
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,050
- Right.
- It's for a TV show, after all.

42
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,590
- Then we should set a limit.
- Right.

43
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,690
- I'm not sure about that.
- Let's make it 200 dollars.

44
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,690
With 200 dollars per person,
it's over 1,000 dollars in total.
It will be
over 1,000 dollars in total.

45
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,960
Make it around 100 dollars.

46
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,990
(While they are discussing
the amount of money to spend...)

47
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,430
(At that moment, Ye Eun's house)

48
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,240
Hello.

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,370
- Welcome to Ye Eun's house.
- Hello.

50
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,240
- Hello.
- Hello. This is my place.

51
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,180
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

52
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,710
I wanted to introduce my house
for the first time on Running Man,

53
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,680
I refused all the other offers.

54
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,190
Thank you.

55
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,360
I'm a regular member,
so I should do this on Running Man.

56
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,160
Hello. Welcome to Ye Eun's house.

57
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,230
You may think my place
will be cute and lovely,

58
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,240
but I actually like a cozy feeling.

59
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,300
Like one you can see on Pinterest.

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,270
(Eat Girl who wants to be It Girl)

61
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,910
I had a fight with my mom
when I bought this couch.

62
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,310
It was really hard...

63
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,880
when I bought this.
I measured it with a tape measure.

64
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,020
And I bought those pillows myself.

65
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,520
I chose them one by one.

66
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,620
(Kitschy color selection
of white and burgundy)

67
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,790
Many people don't like this
because it's dusty.

68
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,830
But I've always wanted to have...

69
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,430
a fluffy carpet like this.

70
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,630
And here...

71
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,370
This is a fake plant.
It's for a vibe.

72
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,470
(Vibe)

73
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,870
- What kind of vibe?
- Just a good vibe.

74
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,270
- What kind of vibe?
- Just a good vibe.

75
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,610
(A fake plant for a vibe)

76
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,680
And these frames here.

77
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,250
The unbalanced arrangement
is my idea.

78
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,120
My place is cozy, isn't it?

79
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,450
(Will the members buy gifts
that suit Ye Eun, the vibe lover?)

80
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,790
When you are at a mall like this,
you should buy white T-shirts.

81
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,390
- That's a great idea.
- Yes.

82
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,930
- This is good.
- There are a lot.

83
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,360
The prices are reasonable.

84
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,230
- It's good.
- I should buy something like this.

85
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,230
I can wear it
when filming a YouTube video.

86
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,530
You really like striped shirts.

87
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,570
- I do.
- That's because...

88
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,200
Are you here
to buy something for yourself?

89
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,370
Yes. This is pretty.
I like striped shirts.

90
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,010
Can't I buy something for myself?

91
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,840
- Seriously, striped shirts...
- I like this one.

92
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,640
This is really pretty.

93
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,480
By the way, those striped ones
drive me crazy.

94
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,520
Seok Jin was a rock bream...

95
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,320
- This is really...
- in his past life.

96
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,020
Seriously, he's worn stuff like this
since the 1990s.

97
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,350
- You should look at the photos.
- A rock bream?

98
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,790
- I do like stripes.
- You really like things like this.

99
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,690
I'm crazy about things with stripes.

100
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,460
- Most of my clothes have stripes.
- He loves them.

101
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,960
- He really does.
- I should...

102
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,570
buy this in every color. Like this.

103
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,430
Right? I don't like
the black one, though.

104
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,000
- How many are you...
- Like this.

105
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,600
Seok Jin, how many are you buying?

106
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,070
- The striped one...
- He really loves stripes.

107
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,570
The black stripes don't look good.

108
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,240
- Hang on.
- Let me choose one for you.

109
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,350
- These two look nice.
- You...

110
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,480
Would the color stand out too much
at my place?

111
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,780
(Would the color stand out too much
at my place?)

112
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,480
(Jong Kook, who also recently moved,
is picking stuff for himself.)

113
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,680
I'll take this one.

114
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,190
I should buy one for Ye Eun.

115
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,060
I should buy it for Ye Run
for decency's sake.

116
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,820
- Towels.
- You can buy it somewhere else.

117
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,460
(He buys one more for Ye Eun
while buying it for himself.)

118
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,560
This is good to wear at home.

119
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,800
Seok Jin would like this one.

120
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,230
- Seok Jin.
- Yes?

121
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,430
Vertical stripes. Come here.

122
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,800
Why?

123
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,670
Did you find stripes?

124
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,800
This one is really pretty.

125
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,170
(Mr. Rock Bream came right away
upon hearing about stripes.)

126
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,970
- This is nice.
- This is...

127
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,540
- really good to wear at home.
- I know. I'll get one.

128
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,980
I'll buy the large one.

129
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,110
I'll buy this. Good.

130
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,320
Where are the bathroom products?

131
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,650
There's a diffuser. It's pretty.

132
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,620
A perfume diffuser. How nice.
I love the color.

133
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,930
The shape is pretty too.
I'll take this one.

134
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,660
This one is nice. What should I do?

135
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,230
(Sniffing)

136
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,170
It smells nice. I'll take this one.

137
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,370
(He carefully picks a diffuser
while smelling the scents.)

138
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,470
This one.

139
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,210
I'll take one.

140
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,180
A gift...

141
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,480
is supposed to make the person
who receives it happy.

142
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,520
And it should be useful.
You know me.

143
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,790
For something like a diffuser,
she probably has a preferred scent.

144
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,220
I can't buy it.

145
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,790
(Jong Kook just picked a diffuser.)

146
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,490
This is one of the things
you shouldn't buy as a gift.

147
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,790
I know it's cute.

148
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,830
But where would she put these?

149
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,960
She won't like it.

150
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,700
It's not wise to buy gifts
that ruin the vibe of her place.

151
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,230
What would go well with her place?

152
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,400
You know how I am with gifts.

153
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,940
I only buy items that are useful.

154
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,640
(He spots something.)

155
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,980
This is the best.

156
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,710
I mean it.

157
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,380
Moisture repellents are a must.

158
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,250
You know it's always good
to have these around.

159
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,950
Wouldn't she need a sponge?

160
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,890
(First moisture repellents
and then a sponge)

161
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,420
She'll eventually use this.

162
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,690
(He goes for essential
daily necessities.)

163
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,160
Does she floss?

164
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,360
She should floss even with veneers.

165
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,300
Seriously.

166
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,200
This is also a good choice.

167
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,000
(He moves on
to the electronics section.)

168
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,770
Water flossers are just as good.

169
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,140
A water flosser works wonders.

170
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,340
(The guy with handsome teeth
chooses a water flosser.)

171
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,380
This is 70 dollars.

172
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,350
Isn't this a good choice?

173
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,480
You need one of these.
You need a water flosser.

174
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,520
Haha.

175
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,350
- Yes?
- How about a water flosser?

176
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,890
She might like that.

177
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,590
You never want...

178
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,890
- to buy that yourself,
- Right?

179
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,290
- but it's great as a gift.
- You'd like it as a gift.

180
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,400
- He means business.
- What?

181
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,370
Do you love her?

182
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,970
- Who? Ye Eun?
- Yes.

183
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,000
- Why do you ask?
- I'm getting that feeling.

184
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,370
What did you pick up?

185
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,340
How about this?

186
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,340
A small vacuum for cleaning
under the couch and stuff.

187
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,710
You never use that.

188
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,350
- She might.
- She wouldn't. I know for sure.

189
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,980
Would you use it?

190
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,420
- Would you use it if I got you one?
- I would.

191
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,350
- You wouldn't.
- I would.

192
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,790
I don't intend to get it
for you anyway.

193
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,890
(Chuckling)

194
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,800
It's sad that you're not even
thinking about buying it for me.

195
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
(Jae Seok appears
at the electronics section...)
(with a bunch of clothes
for himself.)

196
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Hold on.

197
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,470
- Just a second.
- How about an air fryer?

198
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,740
Wait, this.

199
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,410
This seems like a good one.

200
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,480
A ramyeon cooker seems perfect.

201
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,980
(A ramyeon cooker that brings
the vibe at Han River home)

202
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,180
I bet people buy this a lot.

203
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,880
This is the sort of gift
you should buy.

204
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,120
Something like this.

205
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,120
So this is what it looks like.

206
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,060
(A trendy item that struck a chord
with the noodle lover)

207
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,990
It costs 199 dollars.

208
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,930
I could buy a gift
for just 200 dollars.

209
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,100
This ramyeon cooker seems perfect.

210
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,230
(The ramyeon fanatic
can't take his eyes off it.)

211
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,400
This is perfect.

212
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,700
Could I take this?

213
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,370
- What do you think?
- Isn't this pretty?

214
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,840
(Seok Sam was looking at appliances
next to Jae Seok.)

215
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,810
- Seok Jin.
- Isn't this a good choice?

216
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,840
- I made my choice.
- What did you get?

217
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,880
A ramyeon cooker.

218
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,640
- That's a good one.
- Right?

219
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,780
- A gift like this...
- I doubt she has this.

220
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,320
- She wouldn't have this.
- That's a good one.

221
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,520
Yes, this.

222
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,320
- Isn't this a good one?
- Meanwhile,

223
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,420
- I'm going to get an air fryer.
- An fryer?

224
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,650
Two items.

225
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,760
(Just like Jae Seok,
he chooses a sizable item.)

226
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,820
I'll get her two items.

227
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,860
- Sure.
- I think it's a good one.

228
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,930
- That's a good one.
- Right.

229
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,800
Ye Eun loves to eat,

230
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,100
so I'll buy something...

231
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,400
that will make cooking at home
easier for her.

232
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,170
(Ji Hyo goes for items
needed in the kitchen.)

233
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,270
I should get her prep trays.

234
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,300
I've been using them
and they're quite useful.

235
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,900
I use these at home,

236
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,270
and they're functional.

237
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,570
This one's also pretty.

238
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,510
A small stainless pot.

239
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,350
Since Ye Eun lives alone,
I'll get this.

240
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,250
(While everyone buys gifts
that are more to their liking...)

241
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,120
There are also snacks...

242
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,950
that you can only buy
at this supermarket.

243
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,520
People like those too.

244
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,290
(Cookies for Food Fighter
who loves anything sweet)

245
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,460
I think this is the one.

246
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,860
Let's check the expiration date.

247
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,200
December, 2026?

248
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,630
This gave me goosebumps.

249
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,730
It expires on my birthday.

250
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,400
December 8.

251
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,510
This is fate.

252
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,070
It expires on my birthday.

253
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,040
How can I not get this for her?

254
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,680
(He chooses cookies
that hold a special meaning.)

255
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,850
I'm done.

256
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,350
I can tell her to finish the cookies
by my birthday next year.

257
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,820
I remember Ye Eun saying
she likes this kimchi ramyeon.

258
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,320
This right here.

259
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,690
(He also gets the kimchi ramyeon
that Food Fighter loves.)

260
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,690
I remember her saying
she likes this.

261
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,360
Churros-flavored konjac jjondeugi.

262
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,460
These kinds of snacks are the best.

263
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,360
Corn-flavored konjac jjondeugi.

264
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,230
Dried sweet potatoes.

265
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,100
Mini puffed rice.

266
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,400
Purple sweet potatoes.

267
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,940
She loves snacks like these.

268
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,110
Maybe I should grab a cake.

269
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,410
I'll take the melon cake.

270
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,710
(A cake to celebrate
Ye Eun's birthday)

271
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,880
Haha, let's go.

272
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,680
Ye Eun, I was serious
with my choices.

273
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,450
(They arrive at Ye Eun's place.)

274
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,220
I have a feeling
she'll already have this.

275
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,590
(Ringing the doorbell)

276
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,160
(Startled)

277
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,760
(It's time for the nervous
housewarming party.)

278
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,630
(Checking the house one last time)

279
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,000
She's coming to the door.

280
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,570
- Hello.
- Hi.

281
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,340
- Hello.
- Hi.

282
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,410
(The newbie single occupant
is excited for some reason.)

283
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,540
Ye Eun.

284
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,180
- Let's keep it down.
- We'll keep it down.

285
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,410
Ye Eun, you look good today.

286
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,980
Your place looks great.

287
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,050
It's too cold in here.

288
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,850
- No way.
- It's cold.

289
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,190
(Running Man presents
Ye Eun's new home.)

290
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,230
It's too cold in here.

291
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,990
- Goodness.
- It smells incredible.

292
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,500
It's such a nice place.

293
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,760
- How is it this pretty?
- Is it pretty?

294
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,930
- What are these shoes?
- What is this?

295
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,170
Look at how pretty it is.

296
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,140
- Isn't this expensive?
- It's so nice.

297
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,310
- Is this a Bluetooth speaker?
- Yes.

298
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,170
It's like a model house.

299
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,440
She decorated it like an expert.

300
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,410
I have a few plants.

301
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,980
Just a few that are easy to manage.

302
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,480
Look at this. Isn't this clever?

303
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,850
Isn't it pretty?

304
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,320
The place looks nice.

305
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,280
There's something stylish
about this place.

306
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,750
- It's like a model house.
- She decorated it well.

307
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,190
- Isn't it pretty?
- How is it this pretty?

308
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,120
- Ye Eun, it's like a model house.
- Isn't it pretty?

309
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,460
It looks like a showroom.

310
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,860
- Right? Isn't it pretty?
- It was decorated well.

311
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,130
- Didn't I do a good job?
- The bedding...

312
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,160
I bet you received help
from an expert.

313
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,330
- Was this all you?
- Yes, I decorated the place.

314
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,670
It looks like a place
for a princess.

315
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,410
- You're lying.
- I'm not.

316
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,810
The unit looks pretty.

317
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,910
These switches and other things...

318
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,280
remind me of my old place.

319
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Really?

320
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,750
- He's not wrong.
- The layout is similar.

321
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,420
- It's a similar layout.
- It's a lot like his old place.

322
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,420
I'm surprised by the layout.

323
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,990
I was startled as well.

324
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,820
- The entrance.
- Isn't the entrance similar?

325
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,890
Really?

326
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,890
- It's like a model house.
- What's with that H brand?

327
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,230
(The high-end blanket
quietly shows off its presence.)

328
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,660
I got it as a gift from Coupang.

329
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,900
- Hold on.
- That's an expensive lamp.

330
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,570
- Yes, that's expensive.
- Is that expensive?

331
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,100
- Yes, that's expensive.
- Did you buy it?

332
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,440
Yes, I paid for it myself.

333
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,910
Even that speaker.

334
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,010
- This too?
- I bought that too.

335
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,780
- Is this a Bluetooth speaker?
- Yes, it has Bluetooth.

336
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,840
I wanted that for myself.

337
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,880
- Ye Eun.
- Yes?

338
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,880
You won't be able to save up...

339
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,150
- at this rate.
- That's not it.

340
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,850
Staying home is how I rest,

341
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,850
which is why I invested in my house.

342
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,320
- Please have a seat.
- Why is it so dim?

343
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,150
- Can't we turn on the lights?
- Is it perhaps...

344
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,920
- Over there.
- Can you turn on the lights?

345
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,190
I can't.

346
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,590
- Why not?
- To maintain the vibe.

347
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,460
("The vibe")

348
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,760
- The vibe?
- Just turn the lights on.

349
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,200
- Have a seat for now.
- Ye Eun, come on.

350
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,800
- That has nothing to do with vibes.
- The vibes.

351
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,130
Anyway, have a seat for now.

352
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,370
- That's hilarious.
- Sit for now.

353
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,870
The lights? At my place,

354
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,140
I don't turn on fluorescent lights.

355
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,740
Not at night,

356
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,440
not during the day.

357
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,480
I turn on lamps instead.

358
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,750
Can you turn on the lights
so we can film you better?

359
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,780
I'm sorry, I can't.

360
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,820
When in Rome,

361
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,420
do as the Romans do.

362
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,620
(The owner of the cozy house
is allergic to fluorescent lights.)

363
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,390
You won't turn on the lights
to maintain the vibe of the place?

364
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,360
- What?
- Why don't we take...

365
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,130
- a quiet tour around the house?
- Sure.

366
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,460
Please keep it down and follow me.

367
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,660
Does an elder live with you?

368
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,700
(Does an elder live with you?)

369
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,800
Why must we keep quiet?

370
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,770
Ye Eun, can't we turn on the lights?

371
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,230
Turn on the lights.

372
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,070
- Must we talk softly?
- Yes.

373
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,740
You won't be able to save up money
at this rate.

374
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,940
I'll turn them on
when we start filming.

375
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,110
But for now...

376
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,240
- But not now?
- For now,

377
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,280
- let me keep it the way I want.
- What's with her voice?

378
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,680
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Please have a seat.

379
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,410
Isn't this that famous lamp?

380
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,950
- Turn on the lights.
- Yes, it's from...

381
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,650
- a well-known brand.
- What's it called again?

382
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,520
- Ye Eun...
- Lou...

383
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,150
- It's from Louis Poulsen.
- Yes, Louis Poulsen.

384
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,920
(Is Bag Man the only one
who gets her vibe?)

385
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,460
I bet this book is for show
and not to read.

386
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,660
- Yes, it's a decoration.
- Of course.

387
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,130
- Ye Eun, let's turn on the lights.
- It's a decoration.

388
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,560
(Thoroughly scanning)

389
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,300
This is a pretty couch.

390
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,370
- I like the rug too.
- I said the place was pretty.

391
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,530
- Even the rug is nice.
- Right?

392
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,040
- And this table. It's pretty.
- I chose that myself.

393
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,140
- I chose that silk wallpaper.
- Even the silk wallpaper?

394
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,510
- This is nice.
- Is it Diamant?

395
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,980
I'm not sure,

396
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,110
- but it was expensive.
- Then it's Diamant.

397
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,410
This silk wallpaper is nice.

398
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,250
(Like a mother
who's marrying off her daughter)

399
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,420
Daughter,

400
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,980
the place is so nice.

401
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,350
This silk wallpaper is nice.

402
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,960
(Egen boy Kook is in a trance.)

403
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,790
- Goodness me.
- All right, then.

404
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,560
- I bet you're curious.
- Sure.

405
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,190
- Not really, but...
- All right.

406
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,500
This is my kitchen.

407
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,800
Hold on. Take a look at this.

408
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,230
I had this custom-made.

409
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,800
Even this cabinet?

410
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,440
Right here.
I measured the dimensions...

411
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,640
- with a tape measure.
- Did you have it custom-made?

412
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,110
I enjoy a warm...

413
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,970
- and cozy vibe.
- Really?

414
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,050
- Isn't this from Jong Kook?
- Yes, it's... Jong Kook.

415
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,280
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

416
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,420
The wallpaper
was installed perfectly.

417
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,980
- Jong Kook.
- It's right here.

418
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,420
- This is what you gave me.
- Goodness.

419
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,490
- It's right here. I love it.
- He must feel great about this.

420
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,420
- It's right here.
- Just so you know,

421
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,860
I don't have a robot vacuum cleaner.

422
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
- Really?
- What?

423
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,760
- Is that where one goes?
- A robot vacuum cleaner?

424
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,230
- You should've told us in advance.
- Ye Eun, that's...

425
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm hoping that someone
will get me one.

426
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,200
- Be patient.
- Got it.

427
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,670
I could've gotten her
the robot vacuum cleaner.

428
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,500
It was the golden opportunity
to score points with her.

429
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,910
Next up is this.

430
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,980
- I chose this dining table myself.
- Even the dining table?

431
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,510
Do you eat here?
Where do you normally sit?

432
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,680
- I'm in love with the lighting.
- Right here.

433
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,750
Is this where you sit?

434
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,480
- I read the bible here.
- Do you read the bible here?

435
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,720
I doubt it's always this neat.

436
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,780
I actually keep my place neat.

437
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,820
- Is it usually like this?
- Yes.

438
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,850
Isn't this also pretty?

439
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,790
The lamp wasn't turned on earlier.
Isn't this pretty?

440
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,150
You did a good job
decorating the place.

441
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,220
I don't cook at home,

442
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,930
because I hate dealing
with food waste.

443
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,700
I went for a kitchen
that would look good in photos.

444
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,200
Although, that's ruining the view.

445
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,330
(Cooking ingredients chosen
based on their packaging design)

446
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,430
I don't cook,

447
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,240
but I wanted a kitchen
that looked pretty.

448
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,140
I aim for a minimalist lifestyle.

449
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,510
Even when I'm in the kitchen,

450
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,340
my heart is with Running Man.

451
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,510
Running Man.

452
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,280
(Ye Eun's kitchen
is all about the vibes.)

453
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,310
I keep it simple.

454
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,680
Next is the master bedroom.

455
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,180
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

456
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,790
- Another cozy zone.
- So this is where you sleep.

457
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,620
Ye Eun, it's so neat.

458
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,660
Ye Eun, your place is
so nicely decorated.

459
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,190
Look how pretty that lamp is.

460
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,660
She could work
as an interior designer.

461
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,200
- Ye Eun, it's so neat.
- She put so much effort into it.

462
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,530
It's very pretty.

463
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,400
- That's the guestroom.
- This is so nice.

464
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,700
- This is the guestroom.
- I love the lamp.

465
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,100
Can anyone sleep here?

466
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,640
I let my friends sleep here.

467
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,610
- Your friends?
- They can't sleep in my room.

468
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,740
This is where my friends sleep.

469
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,040
Kian84 painted it for me,
and I painted this.

470
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,780
Is this a bear? Is it a cat?

471
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,250
- What's this?
- Love the color.

472
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,650
- What's this?
- It's a karaoke machine. A gift.

473
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,720
- Really?
- A karaoke machine?

474
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,920
- I got it as a gift.
- That's really expensive.

475
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,250
- I like keeping my place neat.
- I love the lighting.

476
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,520
- It's pretty.
- I love the cozy vibes.

477
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,290
Can't we turn on the lights though?

478
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,230
(Turning on the lights)

479
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,660
- Wait.
- Am I not allowed to do that?

480
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,830
- Not yet. The tour isn't over.
- Right.

481
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,030
- The tour isn't over yet.
- It's important for the vibe.

482
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,770
- Right.
- You made a mistake.

483
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,100
Why would you turn on the lights?

484
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
- Come.
- Is that right?

485
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,440
You have to see the walk-in closet.

486
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
(Too deep in the cozy mood)

487
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,940
- You are not done yet?
- No.

488
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,040
Follow me.

489
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,610
- Love the sofa.
- Come see the walk-in closet.

490
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,850
- This is Jong Kook's gym.
- It's my gym.

491
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,480
- It's my walk-in closet.
- It's the gym.

492
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,920
- This is how it looks.
- It's my gym at home.

493
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,380
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

494
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,120
- I don't have many clothes.
- She's funny.

495
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,620
They are neatly organized.

496
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,360
- You organized them so neatly.
- Look at this walk-in closet.

497
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,260
It's so neat.

498
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,530
- She's very organized.
- Hey, you are...

499
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,330
You put the Hermes boxes there
on purpose.

500
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,530
- Yes.
- That's what you have to do.

501
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,170
You can't save money this way.

502
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,630
- There's Louis Vuitton too.
- She can't save money?

503
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,200
I only have
a couple of designer bags.

504
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,440
- I use these hangers too.
- Right. These.

505
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,010
- The clothes don't slip.
- They don't slip,

506
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,040
and they don't deform shoulders.

507
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,440
I didn't know you could decorate
an apartment flat so nicely.

508
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,650
- Yes. You don't have to...
- It's super neat.

509
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,450
I didn't know you could
decorate this place so nicely.

510
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,780
- Can we turn on the lights now?
- I will turn on the lights now.

511
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,890
I will feel too sorry to fart here.

512
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,920
It looks like a showroom.

513
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,320
- I...
- You're really good.

514
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,190
This table looks expensive.

515
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,230
- It clearly looks expensive.
- How about this one?

516
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,460
- It's like a newlywed's home.
- Is it expensive?

517
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,560
It's pretty.

518
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,970
It's just like a newlywed's home.

519
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,500
- It's like a newlywed's home.
- Ye Eun.

520
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,170
You just need to find a husband.

521
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,100
- Se Chan's face just went...
- I don't have a husband.

522
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,340
(Accidental husband energy
in full cozy mode)

523
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,710
He doesn't match the place though.

524
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,410
- No.
- It's not a place for a man.

525
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,110
Have a seat.

526
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,140
- Can't I sit here?
- Wait.

527
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,480
It's a low-back sofa too.
It's the trend now.

528
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,420
- I know.
- What did you all bring?

529
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,080
Show her the housewarming gifts.

530
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,150
(Time to open
the housewarming gifts)

531
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,220
- We brought some gifts.
- The house is warm-toned.

532
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,660
Now that we've seen the place,
we will hide some things.

533
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,190
- Some things overlap.
- I'm confident...

534
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,260
- I did a good job.
- that she would like my gifts.

535
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,260
I'm glad I didn't buy
any interior decor items.

536
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,430
- Same here.
- That was a good call.

537
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,860
I will give her mine first.

538
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,630
- Are we revealing the gifts now?
- Yes.

539
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,770
- We can show her everything.
- I didn't know...

540
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,640
how much kitchen items...

541
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,670
she got. I got prep trays.

542
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,940
(Ji Hyo's gift 1. Food prep trays)

543
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,810
- I got prep trays.
- Right.

544
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,010
- Right.
- Food prep trays are...

545
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,380
- What are those?
- They are...

546
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,650
- Salad...
- She doesn't like it.

547
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,320
- She doesn't like it.
- She's not liking it.

548
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,450
- She doesn't like it.
- Salad. This is...

549
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,690
- She's clear about what she likes.
- It's a stainless steel tray.

550
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,460
- It doesn't absorb color or smell.
- She's going to sell it.

551
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,920
I could keep this in the fridge.

552
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,930
- Yes. It's for the fridge.
- She's going to sell it.

553
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,630
- It's a disposable dish sponge.
- Disposable dish sponge.

554
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,000
You need that.

555
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,230
It's a dish sponge.

556
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,370
- It's a disposable dish sponge.
- Disposable dish sponge.

557
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,840
- Disposable dish sponge.
- I only use the sponges...

558
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,940
that are stylish.

559
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,510
(Stylish)

560
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,940
- There's a stylish sponge?
- Wait.

561
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,210
- A cute one.
- Yes. A white sponge.

562
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,210
- Wait, but...
- The color is too loud.

563
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,210
- The color is too loud.
- It is.

564
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,720
- It doesn't match.
- Doesn't match the home color.

565
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,520
I'm all about cozy vibes.

566
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,220
I hate pink rubber gloves.

567
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,490
So I bought these instead.

568
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,490
(White sponge, white rubber gloves)

569
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,590
Wait. My mom put a dishcloth here.

570
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,930
I hate dishclothes in this color.

571
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,530
Mom put it here.

572
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,370
(Princess Cozy Vibes wants
to protect her cozy kingdom.)

573
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,900
Ji Hyo, I'm so grateful.

574
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,940
I don't accept every gift...

575
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,340
like Jong Kook does.

576
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,910
- I will pick what I will keep.
- You will pick?

577
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,110
(She will be the first host
who will pick the gifts to keep.)

578
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,150
- Right.
- Or they will become clutter.

579
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,280
- Right.
- You're right.

580
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,510
- Then I will hate this place.
- You are precisely right.

581
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,880
- That's a no.
- That's a no.

582
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,680
- We will take that.
- Let it go.

583
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,790
- Yes. I use a white sponge.
- You should take it home.

584
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,450
- Let me keep it.
- The color is too loud.

585
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,060
- Clutter makes you hate home?
- Ji Hyo.

586
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,460
When you were buying it,

587
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,390
did you ask for the tone
and color palette of her home?

588
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,930
- Did you ask her?
- I asked her.

589
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,100
I asked her what color her home was.

590
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,130
- I asked her what tone it was.
- He asked me.

591
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,470
Aren't you Mr. Plastic Bag?

592
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,700
- Right.
- Isn't he?

593
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,600
- But I was born anew.
- You were?

594
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,410
Jong Kook, your clothes
don't match this place at all.

595
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,240
- They are very off.
- But...

596
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,710
I won't be here forever.

597
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,110
- I'm just visiting.
- Yes.

598
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,910
- What if people blame me for it?
- What?

599
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,280
Why would you get blamed?

600
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,220
- Why would you? No.
- I'm refusing the gifts.

601
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,390
I don't understand
why anyone would blame you.

602
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,990
You have to accept...

603
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,490
- only the ones you will use.
- That's true.

604
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,890
- How about this one?
- What is it?

605
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,530
- This is a salad spinner.
- Salad spinner.

606
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,030
(Ji Hyo's gift 3. Salad spinner)

607
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,160
Check the color. The tone.

608
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,700
- It's white.
- It doesn't match the vibe.

609
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,670
- Then it's cool.
- White isn't bad.

610
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,100
I love it, Ji Hyo. I love it.

611
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,270
White matches the vibe.

612
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,410
- You spin the salad.
- Thank goodness.

613
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,010
The one I bought is white.

614
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,010
- Is yours white?
- It's white.

615
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,280
I thought of buying the white one,
but I ended up buying...

616
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,980
- the black one.
- This is...

617
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,850
a stainless pot set for one.

618
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,480
I have too many pots.

619
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,820
- She's got too many pots.
- Rejected.

620
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,020
(Rejected)

621
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,290
- Rejected.
- Rejected.

622
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,290
- But this is...
- Move it.

623
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,660
I bought the pretty pots.

624
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,030
- Give it to me.
- Give it to me.

625
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,360
I will use it to cook ramyeon.

626
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,260
- I live alone. Give it to me.
- Give it to me.

627
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,300
It's mine if she doesn't take it.

628
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,000
This is the last one I bought.

629
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,100
You live alone, so... Look.

630
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,000
(Ji Hyo's gift 5. Glass cup)

631
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,240
- Ji Hyo...
- I love it.

632
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,710
- What is it?
- I like clear glass ones.

633
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,770
- That's nice.
- You like clear glass ones?

634
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,040
- I like clear glass cups.
- You do?

635
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,240
- She's incredible.
- And this is...

636
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,880
- Thank you, Ji Hyo.
- Keep this.

637
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,650
It comes in very handy
when you clean windows.

638
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,850
- It's true.
- You should take it.

639
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,650
- It's...
- Stop it. Look at her face.

640
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,690
(He can't stop being thrifty even
when it comes to interior design.)

641
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,120
- You can clean windows with it.
- Take it home.

642
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,890
- It gives no vibes.
- This is the best.

643
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,530
(Disposable dish sponge
and pot set are rejected.)

644
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,300
(Food prep tray, salad spinner,
and glass cup are accepted)

645
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,230
I will go next. I will go fast.

646
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,530
This is so nice, by the way.

647
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,570
- It's fun, isn't it?
- It is.

648
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,400
This is a squeegee.

649
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,500
Do you have one? You do, don't you?

650
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,270
- To scrape water.
- You need it.

651
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,540
- Do you have a shower booth?
- You don't need it?

652
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,270
- I have a shower booth.
- Right.

653
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,940
The tone matches the interior.

654
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,080
- Where should I put it?
- It's a must-have.

655
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,250
No pressure. I needed it too.

656
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,020
- Then you use it.
- I will.

657
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,220
Jong Kook loves being rejected.

658
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,720
- He's...
- He loves it.

659
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,890
- He wanted it.
- He...

660
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,390
He bought what he wanted,

661
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,020
- so he can take what she rejects.
- Right.

662
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,390
- I think you already have this.
- What is it?

663
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,190
It's a toilet brush.

664
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,260
- A toilet brush.
- This is the type I use.

665
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,630
- Is it not your style?
- I use a stylish one.

666
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,500
(Putting it straight into his bag)

667
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,000
That's all right.

668
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,840
- He put it straight into the bag.
- Thank goodness.

669
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,910
He put it straight into the bag.

670
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,070
- He loves it.
- He takes what she rejects.

671
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,410
- Do you do that?
- What's next?

672
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,450
Do you wear gloves
when you wash dishes?

673
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,850
I bought the white rubber gloves.

674
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,250
- You already bought them.
- Goodness.

675
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,780
- I love it.
- You already have a pair.

676
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,490
He doesn't want to give it to her.
Did you see him?

677
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,720
- He wants it.
- He wants it.

678
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,360
- I love it.
- I knew you'd like this.

679
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,190
- I have white rubber gloves.
- It's the most expensive pair.

680
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,300
- I love it. I use rubber gloves.
- You love it, don't you?

681
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,700
- You love it, don't you? It's nice.
- I love the smell.

682
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,800
What's that?

683
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,000
These are nice too.

684
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,040
I love room fragrances.
I need a lot of diffusers.

685
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,640
Natural fragrance.

686
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,610
- Aveda.
- Aveda is a brand.

687
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,640
This is it. Jasmine.

688
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,780
Yours is jasmine.

689
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,850
- I like jasmine.
- "Yours is jasmine?"

690
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,050
- You bought one for yourself too?
- Mine?

691
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,850
It's buy one, get one, isn't it?

692
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,220
- It's buy one, get one.
- He's unbelievable.

693
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,650
- It's not buy one, get one.
- It's buy one, get one.

694
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,920
Jong Kook.

695
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,290
I needed one,
so I bought you one too.

696
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,290
- Hey!
- Hey!

697
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,590
- This is his.
- It is buy one, get one.

698
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,330
- His is rose black.
- Look.

699
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,560
- This is it.
- I will take this.

700
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,100
- This is yours.
- Rose black.

701
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,530
Mine is rose black.

702
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,740
- Was it buy one, get one?
- It wasn't buy one, get one.

703
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,070
- I like the smell.
- I bought two.

704
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,440
- Buy two, get one.
- Isn't the tone nice?

705
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,770
- I love the tone. It does.
- It matches your place, right?

706
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,970
- I knew it.
- I love diffusers.

707
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,940
- He bought one for himself.
- I loved the tone of these towels.

708
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,180
- I love them.
- You love them, right?

709
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,180
You can never have enough towels.

710
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,620
I thought you could
use these to work out at home.

711
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,220
It's a nice tone.

712
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,120
- It's pink. How do you like it?
- I love it.

713
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,920
He got the colors right.
He's detail-oriented.

714
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,730
- That's it for me.
- Thank you.

715
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,600
- Thank you.
- She only accepts the white ones.

716
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,100
All right. That's all.

717
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,870
- I will go next.
- I have to accept what I will use.

718
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,500
(Next is the gift master, Se Chan.)

719
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,630
First, I will...

720
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,670
(Mr. Housekeeping Master was
full of confidence at the store.)

721
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,340
(Will his useful housekeeping items
succeed to enter Ye Eun's home?)

722
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,880
- First, I bought...
- Yes?

723
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,810
one that looks like her.

724
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,420
(Se Chan's gift 1. Rose)

725
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,990
- He's unbelievable.
- Hey.

726
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,150
- You got it.
- I could cry.

727
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,220
- What looks like Ye Eun.
- I bought one that looks like her.

728
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,260
- I could cry.
- He's right.

729
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,260
- Great.
- Ye Eun...

730
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,390
- This is really expensive.
- What is it?

731
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,300
It's a water flosser.

732
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,060
- That's nice.
- You need the water flosser.

733
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,630
- Let's see.
- You need to clean...

734
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,930
You don't use a water flosser?

735
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,670
- You need to use it.
- You need to use it.

736
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,100
- I use the dental floss.
- The dental floss?

737
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,440
- I have it.
- I have the dental floss too.

738
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,370
- I...
- I have the dental floss too.

739
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,880
But there's one I use.

740
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,950
(Rejecting)

741
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,620
You really won't
use the water flosser?

742
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,880
- I will take it.
- Give it to me.

743
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,980
Give it to me.

744
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,220
I will let someone else take it.

745
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,220
Give it here. We'll take it.

746
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,390
Let's play
rock-paper-scissors for this.

747
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,390
That cost 70 dollars, okay?

748
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,890
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

749
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,000
- This is something you really need.
- Okay.

750
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,260
Moisture repellent.

751
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,270
- Gosh.
- Look at that expression.

752
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,730
(She's almost asleep.)

753
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,000
- It's the color.
- The color doesn't work.

754
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,500
- This is something you hide.
- It's the wrong color.

755
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,270
There are cute and pretty ones
you hang in nets these days.

756
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,480
The color stands out.

757
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,710
- You hide these in corners.
- The color stands out.

758
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,110
- Okay. How about this sponge?
- No.

759
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,450
It feels like you got extra strict
on Se Chan's turn.

760
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,720
She doesn't care for my gifts.

761
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,890
She won't be strict
when she sees the next gift.

762
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:44,890
- Really?
- Let's see.

763
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,090
I heard about that earlier, Se Chan.

764
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,460
About those cookies.

765
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,560
- Those.
- These are cookies.

766
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,660
- These are meaningful.
- They mean something.

767
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,530
- The expiry date...
- It's funny.

768
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,900
is December 8, 2026.

769
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,830
- That's my birthday.
- My gosh.

770
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,300
You can have it, then.

771
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,240
- Yes.
- See?

772
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,380
- He keeps trying.
- I see that.

773
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,080
- Ye Eun's putting up a wall.
- He stands no chance.

774
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,750
This isn't an interior thing.

775
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,080
- She has been stressed out.
- Yes.

776
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,250
I heard her parents called,
and I thought she'd need this.

777
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,290
- What is it?
- A book on common knowledge.

778
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,360
(Se Chan's gift 7:
Book on common knowledge)

779
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,360
Put it next to your bible
and read a bit whenever you walk by.

780
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,030
- I'll accept this.
- Good.

781
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,630
Take the cookies and the book.

782
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,300
- Read that when you want.
- I like this.

783
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,800
The book on common knowledge
is a good one.

784
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,070
Put away what she rejected.

785
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,900
I'll take these home.

786
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,800
- Next up is Haha.
- Haha is next.

787
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,970
- Okay, Ye Eun.
- It's your chance to win points.

788
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,480
First of all,
thanks so much for having me over.

789
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,510
Because I wish
you would make a lot of money...

790
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,250
and move into your own place...

791
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,680
- next time,
- I like flowers.

792
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,520
- I got you sunflowers.
- Thank you.

793
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,650
Thank you.

794
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,090
I have eyes only for you
like sunflowers turn to the sun.

795
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,360
I like flowers.

796
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,830
- That's nice.
- I heard that your birthday...

797
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,560
- is the day before this airs.
- Yes.

798
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,600
- I see.
- I don't know who had this idea,

799
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,500
but I got you a cake
to celebrate your birthday.

800
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,200
- Thank you.
- You like melon.

801
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,810
- Is that it? That's all?
- For real?

802
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,110
(Her wall has come down.)

803
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,510
- No, there's more.
- Thank you.

804
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,740
- I'm getting started.
- A cake?

805
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,280
I asked ChatGPT
what it thought you'd like.

806
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,650
(He consulted an AI service
to pick her gifts.)

807
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,720
Hey.

808
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,920
What did Ji Ye Eun say
she liked on Running Man?

809
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,690
(Did AI figure out Ye Eun's vibes?)

810
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,290
- Do you want this?
- Yes.

811
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,390
Okay.

812
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,830
(Snacks!)

813
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,490
- She's a Food Fighter.
- Food Fighter.

814
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,860
- Do you want this? Okay.
- Yes.

815
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,400
- Good.
- Do you want this?

816
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Yes.

817
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:39,400
(To AI,
Ye Eun is a human who eats a lot.)

818
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,470
- Yes, she likes sweet stuff.
- Yes.

819
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,070
Okay, AI. Thanks.

820
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,510
- Do you want this?
- Yes.

821
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,680
- She's famous.
- Yes.

822
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,280
- Yes.
- She loves food.

823
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,510
- This?
- Yes.

824
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,750
- She took everything.
- She accepted all the food.

825
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,920
This stuff,
the more you have, the better.

826
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,250
- Really?
- Food Fighter...

827
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,920
- Ye Eun, this is something I order.
- Okay.

828
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,690
- Cherries are good for you.
- I love cherries.

829
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,120
- Do you want it?
- Yes.

830
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,520
Any food...

831
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,460
(Her appetite beats her vibes.)

832
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,730
- Food...
- She took all of Haha's gifts.

833
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,730
Haha...

834
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,600
- She took all the food.
- I like cherries.

835
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,970
- And...
- Yes.

836
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,570
- This is...
- Boo.

837
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,900
- It's the wrong color.
- Boo.

838
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,300
- That blows.
- The color...

839
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,340
- This is a no-go.
- That's a no.

840
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,910
- She won't like that.
- That's a no.

841
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,440
- She won't like that.
- It's the wrong color.

842
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,610
(Stuttering)

843
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,280
- The tone of the house...
- It doesn't work at all.

844
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,250
I got this for my mom
who doesn't feel well right now.

845
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,890
Good for you. Well done.

846
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,990
- That doesn't work.
- It doesn't suit the place.

847
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,820
- That blanket...
- There were warmer tones.

848
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,730
Okay. I have...

849
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,290
- this thing...
- An ice cube tray?

850
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,000
I have this thing at home.
You can...

851
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,100
(Hesitant exclamation)

852
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,100
(Scrunched frown)

853
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,170
- That's not great.
- My father...

854
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,500
recently moved and I got this
for him to have when he's bored.

855
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,340
- I got this for my dad.
- Okay, good.

856
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,980
You take out
what you think she doesn't want.

857
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,510
Haha managed to give
most of his stuff.

858
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,210
- Are you next?
- Yes, I should have a go.

859
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,450
The color doesn't really work.

860
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,980
- Mine too.
- Wet wipes...

861
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,720
- Wet wipes...
- I do need wet wipes.

862
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,190
- You need some.
- Yes.

863
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,090
I hide these until I need them.

864
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,690
- You need wet wipes.
- Yes.

865
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,990
- Wet wipes are a necessity.
- They're a must.

866
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,190
- This kimchi...
- I like those.

867
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,230
- Right?
- Yes.

868
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,100
- That's why I got them.
- This is my favorite.

869
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,730
I remembered what you'd said
and got you a box.

870
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,840
Okay.
This isn't that special, but...

871
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,970
She doesn't like it.

872
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,270
- It's the worst.
- I got this...

873
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,110
- for Na Eun.
- It's for Na Eun.

874
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,840
(This is for Na Eun.)

875
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,280
- I got this...
- She'll love it.

876
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,850
- for Na Eun.
- She'll like it.

877
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,350
I kept this separate.
How did it get in here?

878
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,090
- Good save.
- Why is this here?

879
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,220
Go back inside.

880
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,990
- I got...
- You'll take that?

881
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,530
- I'm glad I got this in white.
- What's that?

882
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,900
I got you a ramyeon cooker.

883
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,000
(Ramyeon cooker)

884
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,800
- We don't need that.
- This...

885
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,370
cost me 199 dollars.

886
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,770
(Hesitant exclamation)

887
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,300
(Cold)

888
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,170
- A bad expression.
- It's bad.

889
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,670
- This...
- It's a no.

890
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,840
- This...
- Give it to me.

891
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,380
Your friends...

892
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,650
- You're in trouble.
- She looks...

893
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,750
That one thing is his biggest item.

894
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,080
- It's the biggest item.
- She's thinking.

895
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,850
This is the biggest.

896
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,120
It cost 199 dollars.

897
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,190
Where do I put it?

898
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,520
Give it to me, Jae Seok.

899
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,890
Will you use
this much space for ramyeon?

900
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,660
- You need special bowls.
- Yes.

901
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,630
- They're only this big.
- At home...

902
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,900
Her kitchen is clean...

903
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,770
- and this...
- I'm a minimalist.

904
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,100
- Oh, dear.
- A minimalist.

905
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,500
(Ramyeon cooker is out)

906
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,140
- Give that to me.
- But this is...

907
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,470
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

908
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,570
- It's 199 dollars.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

909
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,810
- I'm...
- Are you serious?

910
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,080
- Play if you want it.
- It's not that important.

911
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,510
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- I too...

912
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,110
- am a minimalist.
- Okay.

913
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,250
- Play only if you want it.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

914
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,250
Rock-paper-scissors.

915
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,850
- Okay.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

916
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,090
- Okay.
- My gosh.

917
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,450
It should go to whoever needs it.

918
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,620
(Haha gets the ramyeon cooker.)

919
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,790
This is insane.

920
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,390
- Yes.
- That cost 199 dollars.

921
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,100
- It should go to whoever needs it.
- Yes.

922
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,100
(The most expensive gift
went to Mr. Free Meals.)

923
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,100
(Jae Seok's gifts:
Wet wipes, kimchi ramyeon)

924
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,930
You wasted 199 dollars.

925
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,470
- This is crazy.
- Isn't it upsetting?

926
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,210
(Seok Jin goes last.)

927
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,870
I'm in trouble. The colors...

928
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,870
- It's bad.
- Jae Seok.

929
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,680
Hey. Forget everything. Seok Jin...

930
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,210
- Look at what he got.
- I'm in trouble.

931
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,480
- Ye Eun! You're a singer.
- Yes.

932
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,690
It's white. A karaoke machine.

933
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,090
(A white mic
for Milkshake's main vocalist)

934
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,760
- The other one's much nicer.
- I have one.

935
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,660
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- I really want that.

936
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,600
- Go on.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

937
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,930
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Please.

938
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,130
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

939
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,200
- What's up with him?
- Give me that.

940
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,100
- He's taking everything.
- Put that with my stuff.

941
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,300
- Haha.
- He's taking everything.

942
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,940
- Haha, let's share.
- I'm making money here.

943
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,670
You took that
and the ramyeon cooker.

944
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,940
And then...

945
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,480
- I have...
- Be prepared, everyone.

946
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,650
- Get ready.
- Prepare to play.

947
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,120
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- That's a definite no.

948
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,850
- I know you like white.
- Yes.

949
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,520
But black and white is a thing.

950
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,050
Oh, okay.

951
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,820
This is black. It's an air fryer.

952
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,590
I have one at home.

953
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,130
It's too big.

954
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,700
- The photo here...
- Oh, dear. No.

955
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,570
- It's...
- Ye Eun. Take it and...

956
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,300
- Shall I give it to my mom?
- Yes, give it to your mother.

957
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,840
(Pleased)

958
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,470
- Your mother.
- I have an air fryer.

959
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,870
- Yes.
- But my mom doesn't have one.

960
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,610
- Give this to her, then.
- I'll give it to Mom.

961
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,840
- Perfect.
- Can I give it to her?

962
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,750
- Yes, of course.
- I'll leave this at her home.

963
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,110
- Yes.
- This would be great.

964
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,120
- My mom...
- Tell her I got it for you.

965
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,850
Ye Eun's mother,
I hope you like the gift.

966
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,990
I gave it to you to do whatever.
It's pretty.

967
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,460
Okay. I like it. Thanks so much.

968
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,260
I'm glad it worked out.
I put a lot of thought into it.

969
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,700
- I'm touched. I'm so happy.
- I'm relieved.

970
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,030
- Right?
- Seriously.

971
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,270
Do you feel
that we thought about it?

972
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,500
I can sense that you tried.

973
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,100
- It was tailored to you.
- We thought a lot.

974
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,270
- Thank you.
- Can we eat something now?

975
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,700
What do we eat today?

976
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,810
I'll serve you something.
The food I prepared is pasta...

977
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,840
and a Korean melon salad.

978
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,180
- A Korean melon salad?
- Yes.

979
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,480
- Something like that.
- Can you cook this much pasta?

980
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,280
That's... I can manage.

981
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,650
I'll serve you some welcome drinks.

982
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,720
- What?
- Welcome drinks.

983
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,290
- You have something?
- Sit down.

984
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,590
- There are welcome drinks?
- A welcome drink?

985
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,360
I don't think she cooks.

986
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,560
I don't cook.

987
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,490
First, the welcome drinks...

988
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,360
You see, my mom
bought a pack of paper cups.

989
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,000
- We'll drink from that?
- Yes.

990
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,200
This is how things are at first.

991
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,400
- Later on...
- Yes.

992
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,070
There will be a stack
of washed clothes here.

993
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,080
Jong Kook's place
was so clean at first.

994
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,080
- My place?
- Yes.

995
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,750
- It was never clean.
- At first.

996
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,010
It was clean.
There was barely anything.

997
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,080
There was barely anything
when we visited.

998
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,650
- I'm sure Ye Eun will manage.
- You like this.

999
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,120
I can tell she watched
a lot of interior stuff on YouTube.

1000
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,690
She watched the ones I did.

1001
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,690
- Really?
- There's a guest room.

1002
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,700
- She does everything at home.
- Yes.

1003
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,900
- That's right.
- She has lots of visitors.

1004
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,630
I'd never turn that room
into a guest room.

1005
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,630
Would it be your room?

1006
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,000
- It would be mine.
- Your room?

1007
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
- With a huge massage chair.
- That's right.

1008
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,870
- With a projector for a movie.
- Yes.

1009
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,070
Don't you have that space at home?

1010
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,240
I don't. The bathroom is my space.

1011
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,510
(The hideout of a dad of three)

1012
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,110
- There's no room...
- That's nice.

1013
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,750
Your kid said
you're in the bathroom for an hour.

1014
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,480
In the early days of my marriage,
when we had no kids,

1015
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,850
I had my own room.

1016
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,490
I want to move so I can
have a room for my massage chair.

1017
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,490
(Staring)

1018
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,190
- have a room for my massage chair.
- You could put that on the floor.

1019
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:11,130
Hey. You can't say that
about my fashion.

1020
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,300
If you were to put that
on the floor...

1021
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,200
- Do you want to lie down?
- Lie down.

1022
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,100
- I think it would work.
- How dare you?

1023
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,470
It's a tablecloth.

1024
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,770
It's pretty.

1025
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:20,870
Come on.

1026
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,340
It would go well with the rug.

1027
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,270
Hey. This place will ruin...

1028
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,110
- her eyesight.
- What?

1029
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,580
Look at her.
That's a ghost doing the dishes.

1030
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,750
Will you turn on the lights?

1031
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,980
- Why...
- It's so dark.

1032
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,480
- It's her vibe.
- Living in the dark for vibes...

1033
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,990
- Is this a must?
- Yes. It's my vibe.

1034
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:40,460
Will you all wait?
I'll serve you welcome drinks.

1035
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,760
(She gave up her eyesight,
but she can't give up on this!)

1036
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,100
(Water purifier
connected to the tap)

1037
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,030
(Trickling)

1038
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,630
(This will take a long time...)

1039
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,470
Take a look.
The ice is round and cute.

1040
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,340
This one isn't pretty.

1041
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,670
(Embarrassed chuckle)

1042
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,710
The round ice is a vibe too.

1043
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,740
The ice is a vibe?

1044
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,380
Yes, it's a vibe.

1045
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,380
Ye Eun, what's the welcome drink?

1046
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,380
It's kombu tea and the ice...

1047
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,350
- is really pretty.
- I tried that and it's not for me.

1048
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,120
- Kombucha didn't taste good.
- Hey.

1049
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,390
Can't you just give me barley tea?

1050
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,460
- Just drink what you're given.
- Kombucha...

1051
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,990
- I tried kombucha last time, but...
- Hey, kombucha is...

1052
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,400
- It didn't suit my taste.
- about vibes too.

1053
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,160
- Kombucha, I mean.
- Kombucha is about vibes too.

1054
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,500
I want corn silk tea.

1055
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,900
No, you can't.

1056
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,670
- Hibiscus.
- No.

1057
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,670
You should each
have a glass of this.

1058
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,510
Let me serve the elders first.

1059
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,510
- I...
- Here you go.

1060
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,740
(Trying the kombucha)

1061
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,740
- Kombucha doesn't suit my taste.
- Oh, gosh.

1062
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,780
Your house is bigger.

1063
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,410
It may be the same layout...

1064
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,650
Kombucha doesn't suit my taste.

1065
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,850
I told you.

1066
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,480
- Excuse me, Ye Eun.
- Yes?

1067
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,190
Kombucha doesn't suit my taste.

1068
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,250
It's not to my liking either.

1069
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,590
- I don't...
- Gosh, you're such picky eaters.

1070
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,320
- Hey, can I not drink this?
- I don't like this.

1071
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,330
- Hey, stop making more.
- Kombucha doesn't suit my taste.

1072
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,660
- Stop making more.
- The kombucha...

1073
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,400
- I'll drink it.
- Give it to me.

1074
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,130
- I'll give you more. Hang on.
- Give it here.

1075
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,430
- Then, can I have...
- It's too sweet.

1076
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,930
- Ye Eun.
- Yes?

1077
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,470
Just give me a cold glass of water.

1078
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,970
Hey, is this Fanta?

1079
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,940
- It's nice.
- Yes, it is.

1080
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,210
- Isn't it Fanta?
- It's too sweet.

1081
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,340
- I'll give you more. Hang on.
- Give it here.

1082
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,280
- Gosh, that's nice. It's good.
- Right? Isn't it nice?

1083
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,750
It's good for your health. Yes.

1084
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,450
- Okay, will you make pasta now?
- Oh, now...

1085
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,850
- I should make pasta now.
- How many servings will you make?

1086
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,250
Ye Eun, can you make it by yourself?

1087
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,280
- Yes, I can do it by myself.
- So,

1088
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,350
you haven't cooked yet?

1089
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,390
- You'll make it now?
- Yes.

1090
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,420
So, the kitchen is...

1091
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,520
- Where are you right now?
- only for the owner of the house.

1092
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,160
- Ye Eun, in that case,
- Yes?

1093
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,890
- just make the pasta.
- That's right.

1094
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,860
Then, can Se Chan come and help me?

1095
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,030
- Me? Okay.
- You're good at cooking.

1096
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,970
- Hey, Se Chan is happy.
- I mean...

1097
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,930
- Well, you're good at cooking.
- Okay.

1098
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,640
(A kitchen purely for decoration
with no traces of cooking)

1099
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,210
(What kind of food
will be created here?)

1100
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,280
- You're boiling water in here?
- Yes.

1101
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,750
This isn't big enough.

1102
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,980
- But that's the largest one I have.
- You don't have a bigger one?

1103
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,750
- No, that's the largest one.
- Gosh, I knew it.

1104
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,890
Hang on.

1105
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,090
(They get ready to cook in earnest.)

1106
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,920
Also, I have to do that.

1107
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,360
I have to make sausage pasta.

1108
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,390
- Sausage pasta?
- Yes.

1109
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,460
Okay, got it.

1110
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,390
(The first item on the menu:
Sausage pasta)

1111
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,730
- Hey, but the thing is...
- Yes.

1112
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,160
- Ye Eun, let's make a little bit.
- Yes?

1113
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,470
- I mean, only a few servings.
- Yes, just a few servings, Se Chan.

1114
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,100
(They start making
the sausage pasta first.)

1115
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,370
That's impressive.

1116
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,170
Aren't you going to chop these up?
You should chop them.

1117
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,270
- I will.
- Okay.

1118
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,040
Oh, I have to stick the noodles
in the sausages.

1119
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,410
- You want to stick them in?
- Yes, you know what that is, right?

1120
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,210
- I do.
- That's what I'm making.

1121
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,850
- Oh, you want to make that?
- Yes, first of all...

1122
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,880
You will stick
each of these in 1 by 1?

1123
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,180
- Yes.
- Just make the pasta.

1124
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,620
Gosh, this... Jae Seok.

1125
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,020
This is getting out of hand.

1126
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,220
Then, you should hurry up and do it.
Will you do it, or should I?

1127
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,560
Then, you can go ahead
and boil those.

1128
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,090
- I'll put the flowers in water.
- No, but...

1129
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,530
- This is...
- No, but the flowers will die.

1130
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,600
What are you...

1131
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,060
Hey, the flowers won't die. Come on.

1132
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,900
- No, Se Chan. They will die.
- Do you want me to stick these in?

1133
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,170
Yes, stick them in.

1134
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,840
- You know that vibe, don't you?
- I do, but...

1135
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,310
Just go with your gut feeling.

1136
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,380
Guys, how many sausages
do you want to eat?

1137
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,110
- What?
- How many sausages each?

1138
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,050
- What sausages?
- These sausages.

1139
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,620
- What?
- Why are you asking about those?

1140
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,080
I don't know. She wants me to
stick the pasta into the sausages.

1141
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,190
How many will you have?

1142
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,750
- I don't know what's going on...
- I mean...

1143
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,990
- How many sausages do you want?
- What's going on?

1144
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,720
- Can't we just skip the sausages?
- I mean...

1145
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,130
Just put two per person.

1146
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,430
- Or three...
- If you eat two each,

1147
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,530
you'll only get three noodles.

1148
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,160
Hey, what is that?

1149
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,830
- What kind of pasta is that?
- But...

1150
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,570
Should I cook up some
oil pasta really quickly?

1151
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,800
I can make it really fast.

1152
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,540
Cut those.

1153
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,170
They're so pretty.

1154
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,240
They're so cute.

1155
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,810
Ta-da.

1156
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,350
Ta-da! Look at these.

1157
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,780
You're possessed by a ghost
right now.

1158
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,650
You're possessed by a ghost.

1159
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,050
Just go with your gut feeling,
Se Chan.

1160
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,890
No, but these...
I'll put three noodles each.

1161
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,690
- Ta-da!
- Let's just order food.

1162
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,260
- What is it?
- Gosh, how pretty.

1163
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,360
- Ye Eun.
- That's the vibe.

1164
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,990
- It's pretty.
- It's pretty.

1165
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,460
- That's the vibe. It's romantic.
- This is driving me crazy.

1166
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,270
- It's small and cute.
- But still...

1167
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,070
The cactus is pretty.

1168
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,100
Do you want some finger food?

1169
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,500
- No.
- Okay.

1170
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,470
I have really delicious finger food.

1171
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,940
- Okay.
- Give them here.

1172
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,270
These are really good.

1173
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,440
Still, she seems so happy, right?

1174
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,750
- That's right.
- Are you happy?

1175
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,510
- Ye Eun, are you happy we're here?
- Yes?

1176
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,220
- Yes, it's fascinating.
- I'm glad.

1177
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,780
- That's nice.
- Why? Because celebrities are here?

1178
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,290
(Why? Because celebrities are here?)

1179
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,650
What are you talking about?

1180
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,650
- Is it fascinating to have us here?
- Yes.

1181
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,760
Shooting something for TV
at my house...

1182
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,020
- You should try these.
- Shooting something for TV?

1183
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,320
These are so good.

1184
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,330
- What are they?
- What are those?

1185
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,330
Oh, these are good.

1186
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,260
- They're so good.
- Yes, these are good.

1187
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,430
- These are dried.
- Yes, they are.

1188
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,630
- Yes, these are tasty.
- Hurry up and try them.

1189
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,970
- They're good, right? Yes?
- Ye Eun.

1190
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,170
- Aren't they good, though?
- They're good.

1191
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,070
If anyone wants more,
I have more here.

1192
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,200
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1193
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,110
- Are these dried mushrooms?
- Yes.

1194
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,370
They taste like snacks.

1195
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,180
Is this what you call finger food?

1196
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,010
Well, you're eating them
with your hands.

1197
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,710
Didn't she just give us some snacks?

1198
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,250
Shouldn't she pour some oil...

1199
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,880
- and sprinkle some ground pepper...
- Some seasoning.

1200
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,920
for it to be finger food?

1201
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,050
By the way, what time do you think
we'll get to eat?

1202
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,320
About...

1203
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,920
In two hours or so?

1204
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,290
Don't you have any garlic?

1205
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,730
- I have garlic.
- You should get the garlic.

1206
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:43,830
Let me light the candle first.

1207
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,860
- What candle?
- By the way, Ye Eun.

1208
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,900
Yes?

1209
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,760
- Gosh, you're driving me nuts.
- Let me light the candle.

1210
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,300
- Jae Seok.
- Why are you lighting a candle?

1211
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,100
- All of a sudden?
- The candle went out just now.

1212
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,770
Hey, we're low on oxygen in here,
you brat.

1213
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,800
No, it's so romantic.

1214
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,470
She does everything she wants to,
doesn't she?

1215
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,510
But isn't this pretty?

1216
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,510
I didn't turn it on earlier,
but it's pretty, isn't it?

1217
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,410
- The scent.
- She does everything she wants to.

1218
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,780
- Oh, Ye Eun.
- Oh, goodness.

1219
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,010
Gosh, my head hurts.

1220
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,520
- I feel nauseous.
- Stop it.

1221
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,080
- Stop.
- That's enough.

1222
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,390
Oh, you finished the finger food.

1223
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,720
- No, stop.
- No.

1224
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,060
- Give us our meal.
- It's okay.

1225
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,090
- Hey, that's too much.
- Don't...

1226
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,120
- Hey.
- Yes?

1227
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,660
Don't give it to us
as if it's animal feed.

1228
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,030
- Seriously.
- I mean...

1229
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,460
- Yes, hurry up and boil the pasta.
- I mean, just now...

1230
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,500
You were pouring it
like it was animal feed.

1231
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,730
Give me my meal!

1232
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:26,470
This house even has two bathrooms.

1233
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,470
It's so nice.

1234
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,600
How much does a unit like this cost?

1235
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,510
- Why, do you want to buy one?
- Are you going to move out?

1236
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,640
No.

1237
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,410
It's perfect for living alone.

1238
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,010
- It's perfect for living alone.
- Seok Jin.

1239
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,510
Do you want to live alone?

1240
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,080
- It's nice to be alone.
- Why do you look so sentimental?

1241
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,150
No, it's not that. Gosh, this is...

1242
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,890
But...

1243
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,890
sometimes, I do feel jealous
when I visit other people's houses.

1244
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,820
- Oh, people who live alone?
- Those who live alone.

1245
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,990
I mean, it's not about...

1246
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,030
- wanting to live alone.
- Living alone is pretty nice.

1247
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,730
It's just another space, you know?

1248
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,130
- A place to rest.
- What are you saying?

1249
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,870
- Do you have two families or what?
- What is this?

1250
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,500
- What are you saying?
- Another house?

1251
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,540
- A 2nd house.
- Yes, a 2nd house.

1252
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,800
- Well, because...
- Hey.

1253
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,370
- I could shoot stuff for YouTube...
- Well...

1254
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,570
- and make a game room here, right?
- Right.

1255
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,910
I could put a massage chair here.

1256
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,910
- You could have a huge sofa.
- That's right. At home...

1257
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,210
- It would be so comfortable.
- Because when you get married,

1258
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,020
I think it would be nice
to go out...

1259
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,350
even if I don't have work,
for both partners.

1260
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,790
Seok Jin, why do you keep...

1261
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,590
- No.
- What are you saying?

1262
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,020
- Why are you suddenly so excited?
- No, I just thought...

1263
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,360
- I could have friends over.
- Right.

1264
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,160
I mean,
I could come here in the morning...

1265
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,460
Like the massage chair, you know?
Put it here.

1266
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,530
So, what you mean is...

1267
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,170
that you want your own space, right?

1268
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,970
- Sure, men want to have...
- Then, what did you think it meant?

1269
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,670
- What did you think it meant?
- Well, you kept...

1270
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,810
- You guys are being weird.
- You kept going...

1271
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,280
- Well, that's why I asked you.
- I just meant...

1272
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,780
- I could shoot stuff for YouTube.
- Right.

1273
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,410
- I'm considering the space.
- Well, you could...

1274
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,450
- You should get an office.
- I'm considering getting a space.

1275
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,820
- You could get yourself an office.
- Yes, an office.

1276
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,190
Having a space
within walking distance...

1277
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,520
from home wouldn't be so bad.

1278
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,620
Wouldn't it be better
if it were far away?

1279
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,060
(Laughing)

1280
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,090
Or Seok Jin,

1281
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,890
you should go to Seogwipo
on Jeju Island.

1282
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,560
You should get a place in Gyeongju.

1283
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,130
Yesterday, you said Gyeongju was...

1284
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,230
You said Gyeongju was so nice.
Seok Jin.

1285
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,270
(While Seok Sam spews nonsense
out of hunger...)

1286
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,530
- Take the KTX in the morning.
- I mean...

1287
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,340
- Guys, we can eat in five minutes.
- There would be no traffic.

1288
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,470
- In five minutes.
- My gosh. They did it.

1289
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,570
- My gosh.
- That was fast.

1290
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,570
Are you sure?

1291
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,910
Ye Eun, is this your first time
cooking at home?

1292
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,710
The plate has to look
nicely decorated.

1293
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,780
Got it.

1294
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,710
You just order food
when your friends visit, right?

1295
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,480
Yes!

1296
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,050
Yes!

1297
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,320
(Sounding hoarse)

1298
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,320
She must've lost her voice.

1299
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,790
- It sounds like she lost her voice.
- She must've had a hard time.

1300
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,920
Gosh, Ye Eun...

1301
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,060
- lost her voice.
- I answered him instead.

1302
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,700
Am I going to win an award?

1303
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,660
- Will I win one for good conduct?
- Right, you will.

1304
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,430
- You're so kind.
- My goodness.

1305
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,970
- You're so considerate.
- That's so...

1306
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,770
- I could win the Grand Award.
- It's so touching.

1307
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,500
- No one answered you.
- Seriously.

1308
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,410
- Isn't my house really clean?
- It's clean.

1309
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,640
- Be honest.
- It really is clean.

1310
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,580
- It's pretty too, isn't it?
- It's pretty.

1311
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,510
- It has a nice vibe, right?
- It totally has a nice vibe.

1312
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,310
(Smiling widely)

1313
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,450
- It's going so fast with you here.
- Yes.

1314
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,290
- It smells nice.
- You...

1315
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,690
- You're very neat and tidy.
- Yes.

1316
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,390
I'll make Korean melon salad.

1317
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,820
(I'll make Korean melon salad.)

1318
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,260
Se Chan,
I'll make Korean melon salad.

1319
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,060
- Korean melon salad.
- Okay.

1320
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,460
Hey, Ye Eun.
Something smells delicious.

1321
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,630
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1322
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,900
Jae Seok, I'm cooking.

1323
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,200
- Praise me.
- Oh, are you cooking?

1324
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,370
- Are you cooking?
- Thank you.

1325
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,340
- That's how it usually goes.
- Thank you.

1326
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,940
(She begins making
Korean melon salad full of vibes.)

1327
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,110
I have to stick this piece in.

1328
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,610
(She begins making
Korean melon salad full of vibes.)

1329
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,210
(Just peeling them
without making a pattern)

1330
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,580
Which plate should I use?

1331
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,820
This one,
for the Korean melon salad?

1332
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,320
- Isn't that an Hermes plate?
- Hermes.

1333
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,520
Hey, you won't save any money.

1334
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,190
- No, I got this as a present.
- Okay.

1335
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,320
- I'll use this one.
- Okay.

1336
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,720
Do you think everyone will know
this is Hermes?

1337
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,160
- I don't think so.
- I should tell them.

1338
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:40,360
(She starts plating the salad
on a luxury plate.)

1339
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,630
Do I have to get rid of the seeds?

1340
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,770
No, you can just use them as is.

1341
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,470
- Are you not supposed to eat seeds?
- It doesn't matter.

1342
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,840
I actually don't eat the seeds.

1343
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,700
The Korean melon salad is finished.

1344
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:50,140
The decorations should look pretty.

1345
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:53,440
This is really high-end olive oil.

1346
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,510
Oh, really?

1347
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,850
It's pretty. Yes, the Korean melon
salad is coming soon.

1348
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,280
Okay, take that out first.

1349
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,780
Do you want to see?

1350
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,580
Here it comes.

1351
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,750
- Here we go.
- They're coming.

1352
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,020
- Oh, they're coming.
- Here we go.

1353
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,050
- Here it comes.
- Let's eat.

1354
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,520
- We can eat now.
- It's Korean melon salad.

1355
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,520
(Ddochi's Korean melon salad
is served with vibes.)

1356
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,090
- You should come and eat with us.
- It's a salad?

1357
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,430
- Yes, Korean melon salad.
- It's a salad?

1358
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,930
- Gosh, it's pretty.
- Korean melon salad.

1359
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,100
- My gosh.
- This too.

1360
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,730
- We're eating salad?
- Hermes.

1361
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,170
- What's this?
- Hermes.

1362
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,100
- Just because.
- Hey, the plate is...

1363
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,300
- Is this Hermes too?
- Yes, it's Hermes.

1364
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,570
Well, I got this as a present.

1365
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,970
- A gift.
- I see.

1366
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,670
- Is this real?
- It is.

1367
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,010
- How do we eat this? Show us.
- Ye Eun.

1368
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,780
- What? Don't you know?
- Do we eat this with our hands?

1369
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,780
- Do we eat with our hands?
- Oh, I'll give you utensils.

1370
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,920
But compared to the plate,
this seems a little...

1371
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,780
- Well, it's...
- Is this supposed to be...

1372
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,190
- The plate doesn't go well with it.
- No, it doesn't.

1373
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,890
- What is this? Pork cutlet sauce?
- This kind of plate is...

1374
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:39,460
- I think it's balsamic.
- Well, the plate is expensive,

1375
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,460
- but it doesn't go well together.
- No, it doesn't.

1376
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,420
- It's not the right vibe or color.
- It doesn't match.

1377
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,990
- As long as we don't die from it.
- You can use these.

1378
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,230
- Hey, by the way...
- Yes? Use these.

1379
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,830
- Are you joking right now?
- My goodness.

1380
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,570
(Wooden chopsticks?)

1381
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,170
The plate is Hermes.

1382
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,900
- My gosh.
- Are you serious?

1383
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,040
- Hey, Haha.
- Gosh, no.

1384
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,570
- Did you say, "Are you joking?"
- It's romantic.

1385
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,980
Hey, it's romantic.

1386
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,180
- Don't you have anything else?
- Seriously.

1387
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,410
- I never even imagined.
- Ye Eun, this is...

1388
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,950
I don't have very many chopsticks.

1389
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:07,020
I haven't invited
so many people at once.

1390
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,380
What is this?

1391
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,590
- Hey, Ye Eun.
- Yes?

1392
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:11,350
- Here are your plates.
- We can use this.

1393
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:13,090
- You're worried about spills.
- Exactly.

1394
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,620
- Isn't it good?
- I'll have it as is.

1395
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,260
- The Korean melon is sour.
- It's a pasta plate.

1396
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:18,930
The melon isn't sour.

1397
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,460
- It's the balsamic vinegar.
- Hold on.

1398
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,060
What you mean by
a Korean melon salad...

1399
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,100
is sliced Korean melon
served with olive oil.

1400
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,800
It's a healthy dish.

1401
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,540
I enjoy having balsamic vinegar,

1402
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,970
and this is the olive oil
I usually have.

1403
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,370
Why did you serve this as well?

1404
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,010
- I was curious too.
- Is it a soy sauce dip?

1405
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:36,410
Isn't that a small dish
for soy sauce?

1406
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,450
- Yes, that's what it looks like.
- Sure.

1407
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:41,820
Looking on the bright side,
it seems we're being treated well.

1408
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,720
- Then...
- Let's not fuss over this.

1409
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,490
(Ye Eun returns
after serving the guests.)

1410
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:47,990
- Se Chan.
- What?

1411
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,130
- What is it?
- Why did you add all the sausages?

1412
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,160
- What?
- They had to be wrapped...

1413
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,160
with the noodles.

1414
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,300
- Wrap them with what?
- With the noodles...

1415
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,430
to make them look cute.

1416
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:55,860
- They're right here.
- I was going to...

1417
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,770
wrap them with the noodles.

1418
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,600
The noodles were going
to wrap around the sausages.

1419
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,870
- These sausages?
- Yes.

1420
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,070
Now, the dish won't look as nice.

1421
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,710
I can't wrap anything with this.

1422
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,880
Come on. I want to make
this dish look good.

1423
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,510
- Right.
- Jae Seok,

1424
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:10,950
she wants to make
the dish look good,

1425
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,610
- and that'll take 30 minutes.
- We're good.

1426
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:13,720
- Serve it as is.
- Yes, as is.

1427
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,350
- Just bring it out.
- Just makes sure it's enough.

1428
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:17,450
- Just serve it in a bowl.
- It's fine.

1429
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:19,520
- Can I serve it in the pan?
- No way.

1430
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,660
- Where should I serve this?
- Here. On this Hermes plate.

1431
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,890
- Unbelievable.
- Hermes.

1432
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,990
- Got it. Do you want to plate it?
- Me?

1433
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,130
- I'll...
- This is too much, Se Chan.

1434
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,700
- What's too much?
- Why did you make so much?

1435
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,000
You have seven mouths to feed.

1436
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,970
Should I just serve it in the pan?

1437
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,740
No, it must go on the Hermes plate.

1438
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,770
- Will it all go on here?
- I want to pour it out.

1439
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:38,810
Yes.

1440
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,110
Forget about the plating.

1441
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,280
I need to sprinkle
some parsley on top.

1442
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:43,580
It needs some basil too.

1443
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,610
(She won't compromise.)

1444
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:47,120
(An intense internal struggle)

1445
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,980
I feel bad for the Hermes plate.

1446
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,520
(Help...)

1447
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,460
Hold on. It needs some basil.

1448
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,160
She's treating
this housewarming party...

1449
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,860
like a performance.

1450
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,930
There you go.
If I let her carry the plate,

1451
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,300
it'll be like
she cooked the dish herself.

1452
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,470
- Now...
- This is a performance for her.

1453
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,200
She's treating this
like a performance.

1454
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,270
Here I come.

1455
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:08,000
- It'll be served.
- I'm exhausted.

1456
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,670
Here you go.

1457
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,070
(She serves it like monkfish jjim.)

1458
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,140
- What's that?
- What's this?

1459
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,410
- No way.
- My gosh.

1460
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:15,510
(The heap of pasta
makes a strong first impression.)

1461
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,650
Ye Eun, my gosh. This looks tasty.

1462
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,650
What's this green stuff? Spinach?

1463
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:20,820
- What are these?
- Did the wind blow...

1464
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,420
- and knock leaves onto the pasta?
- Of course not.

1465
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,250
- This looks good.
- It looks good.

1466
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,050
There's no way this can't be good.

1467
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,760
- Exactly.
- This will be good.

1468
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,060
- Spill, and you die.
- Don't get any on the floor.

1469
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,260
Why are we having pasta
like it's janchi guksu?

1470
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,660
It'll be good with some kimchi.

1471
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,760
(How did her first
homemade pasta turn out?)

1472
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,570
I have to be extra careful.

1473
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,770
- Isn't it salty?
- It's salty.

1474
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,040
(Is the main dish salty?)

1475
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:46,380
- It's salty.
- Isn't it salty?

1476
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,110
- It's extremely salty.
- This is really salty.

1477
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:50,050
- See? She said it wasn't salty.
- Really?

1478
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,410
(What happened to the pasta?)

1479
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,650
- Se Chan, this looks bland.
- Yes?

1480
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:54,750
We need to add more of this.

1481
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:56,690
This looks bland.

1482
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,650
- Bland?
- Yes, it looks bland.

1483
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:00,720
- I like my pasta...
- Salty?

1484
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,460
(Despite what she wanted,
the pasta turned out too salty.)

1485
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,790
It's too salty.

1486
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,060
- I don't like my food salty.
- This is too salty.

1487
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,260
- It's really salty.
- She stuck spaghetti...

1488
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,460
in the sausage.

1489
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,500
She stuck the noodles
in the sausage.

1490
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,200
The noodles? Where?

1491
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,370
Some of the sausages
have noodles stuck in them.

1492
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,140
- What's that?
- This?

1493
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,240
I wanted to show these off.
My name is on them.

1494
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,080
Did you give us these
while you're using fancy chopsticks?

1495
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,650
- She gave me these to use.
- I don't have many pairs.

1496
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:24,710
- She gave me these to use.
- Right.

1497
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,580
Ye Eun, this is tasty
but a bit too salty.

1498
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,780
I like my food salty.

1499
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,690
He's saying it's too salty for us.

1500
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,160
The leading Zoomer communicates
in a way that's all their own.

1501
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,260
Did you vote for her
as a leading Zoomer?

1502
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,430
(Is it to the homeowner's liking?)

1503
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:40,560
It's good.

1504
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,760
- Is it seasoned perfectly for you?
- Yes.

1505
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,630
- It was seasoned...
- Is it how you like it?

1506
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,470
- to the homeowner's preference.
- It's really good.

1507
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,800
But...

1508
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,910
(For us...)

1509
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,140
The more I eat this...

1510
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,040
It's tasty but salty.

1511
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,240
- It's salty.
- That's true.

1512
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,510
- It's a bit salty. Are you sure?
- I like my food salty.

1513
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,080
- It'll help you stay hydrated.
- Do you want some cheese?

1514
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,180
As in mozzarella?

1515
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,380
- It'll get even saltier.
- Slide cheese.

1516
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:01,920
Cheddar cheese.

1517
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,450
- Slide?
- Did you say, "slide?"

1518
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,520
- It's sliced.
- Sliced cheese.

1519
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,990
She probably said sliced.
We must've heard wrong.

1520
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:09,020
Reading the book will help, so read.

1521
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:10,760
Jong Kook.

1522
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:12,190
- I'm sure you heard wrong.
- Right.

1523
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,400
- You said "sliced," right?
- Yes, you heard wrong.

1524
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,700
How can it be "slide?"

1525
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,770
- That's out in the playground.
- We understood you.

1526
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,200
- Of course.
- Cheese... Hey, think about it.

1527
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,540
How can cheese slide?

1528
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:22,840
(We probably heard wrong.)

1529
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,870
- It couldn't have been "slide."
- We heard wrong.

1530
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:27,110
- Slide cheese?
- Someone who has Hermes plates...

1531
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:29,950
- won't have said "slide" cheese.
- Unbelievable.

1532
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,480
- You're right. Sliced cheese.
- Right?

1533
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,080
I thought it was a type of cheese.

1534
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,120
- Exactly.
- One I didn't know.

1535
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,150
- Slide cheese?
- Slide?

1536
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,850
It's not bad to have
as a group meal.

1537
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:38,990
I got it as a gift.

1538
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:39,990
This is fine.

1539
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:42,320
(A first housewarming party
always falls just a little short.)

1540
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,390
- We cleaned the plate.
- Right.

1541
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,890
- We ate it all.
- We cleaned the plate.

1542
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:47,160
- It was tasty.
- She serves tasty food.

1543
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,260
- It's good.
- Ye Eun, now that we've eaten,

1544
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,600
- can we have some dessert?
- Yes, I have buns.

1545
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,900
- Wait, we have a cake.
- Yes, the cake.

1546
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,300
- It's her birthday.
- Right, the cake.

1547
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,970
This.
I can't believe I threw this out.

1548
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,040
- What a waste.
- This?

1549
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,280
This must be melon cake.

1550
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:02,610
Yes, melon cake.

1551
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,450
Let's light that one candle.
H. B. D.

1552
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:06,880
Put that on her.

1553
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,420
It's the birthday girl.

1554
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:11,120
We should celebrate her birthday.

1555
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,720
- Thanks.
- Exactly.

1556
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,190
Isn't it your first birthday
with us?

1557
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,090
- It is.
- Ye Eun,

1558
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,330
I'm proud to see you
living in such...

1559
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,230
- a lovely place.
- He's like an elder of the family.

1560
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,360
- Really?
- Yes.

1561
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,230
- It's clear you're having a blast.
- We're proud of you.

1562
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,230
The way I see it...

1563
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:26,770
Ye Eun, how should I put this?

1564
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,740
- It's "Happy Birthday."
- I'm proud to see you living...

1565
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,240
- in such a lovely place.
- What's DB? The insurance group?

1566
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,770
(Ji Hyo's placing the candles.)

1567
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,180
- Ji Hyo, wait.
- Really?

1568
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,740
- It's "Happy Birthday."
- It's not fun.

1569
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,510
- It's "Happy Birthday."
- This is...

1570
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,210
- It's fun for me.
- You spelled the insurance group.

1571
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:41,280
- It's fun for me.
- It's HBD from my side.

1572
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,020
It's HBD from my side.

1573
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,390
Did you pay for all this
with the money you earned?

1574
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:45,520
- Read it like this.
- I did.

1575
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,720
(How so?)

1576
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,690
Jae Seok, does that read
"happy birthday" to you?

1577
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,700
- Be honest.
- Ji Hyo, it should be like this.

1578
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,400
- She spelled the insurance group.
- DB?

1579
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,740
(Ye Eun the Slide Girl
and Ji Hyo the DBH Girl)

1580
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:01,570
- How...
- How is it...

1581
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:03,170
that they lack
only just about enough?

1582
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,740
- She suggested we study.
- They all lack five percent.

1583
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,140
- The insurance group.
- Hold on.

1584
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,080
You lack knowledge
but in a cute way.

1585
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,380
- What's that?
- A candle lighter.

1586
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,210
- Good.
- It's what a Zoomer would have.

1587
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,020
- That has a vibe as well.
- That's pretty as well.

1588
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,420
- I quite like this.
- Nice.

1589
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,420
That's weird. Why won't it light up?

1590
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,120
I didn't see a flame.

1591
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,150
- How fascinating.
- Is it gas?

1592
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,460
It's electric,
and you have to charge it.

1593
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:22,820
- I quite like this.
- This is fascinating.

1594
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,890
- This is amazing.
- This is nice.

1595
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,260
- Right?
- The leading Zoomer...

1596
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,530
- You're right.
- has unique items we don't have.

1597
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,100
- It's pretty.
- Isn't it pretty?

1598
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,070
- You need to blow these out.
- Head over here.

1599
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,470
- Hey.
- Should we turn off the lights?

1600
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:33,700
- Wait. Yes, I should.
- The vibes.

1601
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,170
Let the vibes kick in for this.

1602
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,640
Let me bring some vibe to this.

1603
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,340
- How about this?
- Why didn't it go out?

1604
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,370
Come out from over there.

1605
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,180
- Act surprised, okay?
- Sure.

1606
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,110
Ye Eun, can you come over here?

1607
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,920
No way!

1608
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,220
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

1609
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,620
- She came out wearing the hat.
- Happy birthday

1610
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,890
- To you
- She's still acting surprised.

1611
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:01,360
(She walks into her surprise party
with the party hat already on.)

1612
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:04,270
(Still, we wish you
a happy birthday.)

1613
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,130
- Make a wish.
- Thank you.

1614
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,400
- Make a wish.
- Let us hear what you wish for.

1615
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,340
I wish for everyone to be healthy...

1616
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,010
and for Running Man
to keep being a success.

1617
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,740
In the holy name of...

1618
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,580
- Okay.
- Now, blow them out.

1619
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,980
- That's it.
- Yes!

1620
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,150
Thank you so much.

1621
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,420
I mean...

1622
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,520
- This is nice.
- That's hot.

1623
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,790
- Today is Happy Ye Eun Day.
- Right.

1624
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:31,330
The staff also prepared
a housewarming gift for her.

1625
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:32,930
- Really? What is it?
- For real?

1626
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:34,830
- Dig in.
- We asked...

1627
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:37,700
- Ye Eun in advance what she wanted.
- And?

1628
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:39,330
- We got her...
- What did you get her?

1629
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:42,240
a robot vacuum cleaner
and a Dyson electric fan.

1630
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,670
Let's get...

1631
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,240
- that robot vacuum cleaner for her.
- It won't be fun...

1632
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,510
- to give these to her for free.
- Right.

1633
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,510
There's a board with 15 syllables...

1634
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:52,450
- that have been shuffled around.
- And?

1635
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:55,150
You'll play a game
and uncover syllables...

1636
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:57,020
based on how well you perform.

1637
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:00,060
Using the revealed syllables,
you will form words,

1638
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,460
and Ye Eun will win all the items...

1639
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,490
- that you managed to spell out.
- Really?

1640
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:09,230
We could end up spelling
what she doesn't want.

1641
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,900
- That can happen.
- Lucky you.

1642
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:13,130
First, you will play the game
to see...

1643
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,270
- if she can win the electric fan.
- The fan.

1644
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:16,610
Here's your first game.

1645
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,940
- You will be using your feet.
- Our feet?

1646
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,340
- Our feet?
- We'll give you a moment...

1647
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,740
to sort out your feet.

1648
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,480
Please go wash your feet...

1649
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,480
if you feel the need to do so.

1650
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:27,580
- Shouldn't you go?
- I'm good.

1651
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,990
We didn't walk a lot
in our shoes today.

1652
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:31,090
- That's true.
- Right.

1653
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:33,520
- In 30 seconds,
- There you go.

1654
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,860
- put on a sock...
- You've got this.

1655
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,190
- using only your feet.
- It won't work.

1656
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,590
- He's good at this.
- What's happening?

1657
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:39,360
- Okay.
- How did you do that?

1658
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,030
(Sour Feet kicks things off
with a clean success.)

1659
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:42,130
How did you do that?

1660
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,270
(However)

1661
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,370
It's not easy.

1662
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:47,470
(Father Jee's toes aren't
cooperating the way he wants.)

1663
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:49,370
- It's game over.
- It's over.

1664
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,810
- Put your toes in like this.
- Just root for me, will you?

1665
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,910
- He did it.
- There!

1666
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,310
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo successfully put them
on one after the other.)

1667
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,350
- Go, Haha.
- He's got it.

1668
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:58,410
- You got it.
- He put it on.

1669
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,450
- There.
- Success!

1670
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,920
- Darn it.
- Here.

1671
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,450
(Haha also succeeded,
despite the cramps in his toes.)

1672
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,120
Ye Eun, aren't you touched?

1673
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,920
- I'm touched.
- I'll give you the board now.

1674
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,620
Ye Eun, you may reveal
the syllables.

1675
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,590
Choose wisely so that
you can win the fan.

1676
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:12,930
Which number should I choose?

1677
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:14,660
Ye Eun, when's your birthday?

1678
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,260
- It's July 26.
- Go with 7, 2, and 6.

1679
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,400
- Go with those.
- That's perfect.

1680
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,230
- Go with 7, 2, and 6.
- That's perfect.

1681
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,170
(Is she going to reveal them
without thinking some more?)

1682
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,440
- Seven.
- For July.

1683
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,840
- July. She got "sun."
- Hold on.

1684
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,210
(It's "sun!")

1685
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:27,510
(She got the syllable she needed
with the first number.)

1686
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:28,980
- Number 2.
- Where's 2?

1687
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,650
- But...
- Right above seven.

1688
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:32,110
- Will that be the syllable?
- It's okay. Just go for it.

1689
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,150
- Nu?
- Nu.

1690
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:37,420
(Number 2 is a dud.)

1691
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,450
What's the next number?

1692
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,160
- Six, but I don't think that's it.
- Two, seven, and...

1693
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,160
I don't think
it'll be behind six either.

1694
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,120
- She got lucky.
- When's your birthday again?

1695
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,190
July 26.

1696
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,490
Subtract 6 from 2.

1697
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:48,500
Subtract 6 from 2.
Wait, subtract 2 from 6. It's 4.

1698
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,500
- Four.
- That's right.

1699
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,170
- Which year were you born in?
- Go ahead.

1700
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:52,470
- In 1994.
- Is it 94?

1701
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,740
- Four.
- Four overlaps.

1702
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,740
(A weird calculation
leads them to 4.)

1703
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,610
(And the result?)

1704
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,340
Poong!

1705
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,840
(They got the syllable, Poong!)

1706
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,510
Hold on. Being born in 1994 worked.

1707
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:07,450
- I get it.
- I was born in 1994.

1708
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,980
- "Gi" must be in the bottom line.
- The bottom line?

1709
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,520
- I don't know.
- I think...

1710
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,720
- it's either here...
- Fifteen?

1711
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,760
(Now, they just have to find "Gi.")

1712
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,360
- Which one? Fourteen?
- Or this one.

1713
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,090
I really don't know.

1714
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,660
Which number popped into your head?

1715
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,060
- Or...
- I think it's either 13 or 14.

1716
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,360
- Right.
- It's 11, 12, 13, or 14.

1717
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,730
- Thirteen?
- Twelve or thirteen.

1718
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:25,230
- Let's try 13.
- Should we do 13?

1719
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:26,700
- All right.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1720
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,570
- It's "byung."
- "Byung."

1721
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:32,040
- Byung-sun?
- Hey, there's byung-poong.

1722
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,310
- A folding screen.
- You could win...

1723
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:34,640
- a folding screen.
- Hey, you won a folding screen.

1724
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,250
You won the balloons as of now.

1725
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,250
Oh, that's right.

1726
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,380
- The folding screen too.
- You could win a folding screen.

1727
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,420
They have pretty folding screens
for interior design these days.

1728
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:46,520
(But I want the fan.)

1729
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,890
Hey, how about we go straight down
under "nu" and "sun?"

1730
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:50,930
- Number 12.
- Go down to 12?

1731
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:52,360
(Ssaebssaeb's choice)

1732
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,360
- Oh, I don't know.
- Or...

1733
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,000
how about we each pick a number
and test our luck?

1734
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,900
- Okay. I'll take 11.
- I'll go with 15.

1735
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,000
- So, 15 and 11.
- I'll take 12.

1736
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,470
- You take 12.
- Then, I'll take 14.

1737
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:02,170
- I have 12.
- And I have 14.

1738
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:03,270
- Then...
- I'll take 12.

1739
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,710
- You each know your number, right?
- We're both 12.

1740
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:06,710
- We're a team. Ji Hyo, go.
- Okay, rock-paper...

1741
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:07,940
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1742
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,310
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- We have to win.

1743
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,080
Gosh, I lost.

1744
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,820
- Ji Hyo, you have to win.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1745
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,180
Rock-paper-scissors.

1746
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,520
- Okay.
- I lost.

1747
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,350
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- We'll leave it up to luck.

1748
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:19,690
- Leave it up to luck.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1749
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,260
- Oh, my.
- Hey, it's 12 if you win.

1750
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,090
- I had 14.
- All right.

1751
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,760
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- It's one or the other.

1752
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,760
Rock-paper-scissors.

1753
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,660
- Gosh, it's 12.
- It's 12.

1754
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:29,760
(The rock-paper-scissors fortune
says they should go with 12.)

1755
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,800
- We both had 12.
- Go.

1756
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,800
Okay, is it 12?

1757
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,470
- Come on.
- Just go with the number that won.

1758
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:35,170
- Hey, just pick whatever you want.
- They won.

1759
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:37,770
- Let's try it.
- But they won.

1760
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,440
Ye Eun, but...

1761
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,940
Why do you keep looking at us?

1762
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,440
- Why do you keep looking at them?
- Are you asking for a hint?

1763
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,350
- Hey, but they won.
- They won.

1764
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,010
Right, just do it.
You have no choice.

1765
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,720
(My gosh)

1766
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,850
(It's "Gi!")

1767
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,820
(Shouting)

1768
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,420
(Shocked)

1769
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,460
(The rock-paper-scissors fortune
was right!)

1770
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,060
- Hey.
- Does this make any sense?

1771
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,230
- How is this real?
- It doesn't make any sense.

1772
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,760
- My goodness.
- How did that happen?

1773
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,800
We won.

1774
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,670
- How does this make any sense?
- How did we get it right?

1775
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,330
- How did that happen?
- Congratulations.

1776
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,670
Ye Eun, you won...

1777
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,270
- the fan that was on...
- We won.

1778
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:11,440
- your wishlist.
- Congratulations.

1779
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,870
- Should we try something else too?
- Hey, this is really...

1780
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,310
- That was amazing, wasn't it?
- We had...

1781
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:15,810
- This was...
- What do you think 11 was?

1782
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:16,950
- This makes no sense.
- Hey, number 11.

1783
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:18,250
- The odds were against us.
- Number 11.

1784
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,910
- What was it?
- No way. I won the fan.

1785
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,820
- What was 15?
- What's 14?

1786
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,150
- It's "Je."
- It was "Baek."

1787
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:25,250
- Anyway, it's a success.
- The skies gave you a gift.

1788
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:27,660
- Gosh, that was awesome.
- You're so lucky.

1789
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,920
- Hey, that's crazy.
- It must've been meant for me.

1790
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,330
Ji Hyo, thank you so much.

1791
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:34,000
Okay, here's the second mission.

1792
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,430
- This time, we'll do a mission...
- Oh, my.

1793
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,100
- for the robot vacuum cleaner.
- We have to get this.

1794
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,330
There's a spot for it here.

1795
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:40,670
- There's a spot for it.
- Yes, a spot for the robot vacuum.

1796
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:42,700
- There is.
- It's fascinating. It's built in.

1797
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,070
- You have to fill that spot.
- I kept it empty...

1798
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,570
- on purpose.
- The second mission is...

1799
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,710
a quiz that you must do
whenever you visit the home...

1800
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,580
- of a Running Man member.
- What is it?

1801
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,650
It's an unofficial required mission.
It's the Relay Quiz.

1802
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,520
- Darn it.
- Gosh, this is hard.

1803
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,650
(Faker)

1804
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:59,350
- You know him, don't you?
- Of course I do.

1805
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:01,020
- You know him.
- Hang on. I can't remember.

1806
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,890
(He even forgot
his good friend's name.)

1807
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,930
- Oh, right. Yes.
- She has a unique last name.

1808
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,230
- All right.
- Her last name isn't Maeng, is it?

1809
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:09,830
- No.
- She was on our show a lot...

1810
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,930
- in the early days.
- Ms. Lee Mi Sun?

1811
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:13,230
Ms. Lee...

1812
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,670
(A game the members struggle with
under the pressure of time)

1813
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,410
- Didn't we succeed in this?
- This is hard.

1814
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:20,140
- It's the one with proverbs.
- You failed at the end.

1815
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,140
- Isn't it?
- Yes, we failed.

1816
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,040
So, we have to
get 4 or 5 questions correct.

1817
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,450
You can answer the questions
on the monitor.

1818
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:28,750
When you see a photo,
you must guess the person's name.

1819
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,690
If it's a proverb or idiom,
you must guess what goes...

1820
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:32,690
in the blank.

1821
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:33,820
Let's try it. We can do this.

1822
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,820
- You get three minutes.
- Yes.

1823
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,730
Last time, you each had to
answer seven questions,

1824
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:40,930
but you found it too hard.
So, you must each get...

1825
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:42,160
- five questions right...
- Oh, five sounds good.

1826
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,330
- to go on to the next person.
- Five is good.

1827
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,270
- We have lots of time. Don't worry.
- Let's do this.

1828
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,470
If you all succeed...

1829
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:49,770
within five tries,

1830
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:51,340
you will get to open...

1831
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:52,370
- five squares.
- Oh, nice.

1832
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:53,640
But five is still hard.

1833
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,810
Five squares? But it's "ro," "bot,"
"cheong," "so," "gi."

1834
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:57,810
No, you just need to get
"cheong," "so," "gi."

1835
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:58,880
Oh, "cheong," "so," "gi."

1836
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,150
If you fail,
you can only open three squares.

1837
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,150
This is hard.

1838
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,620
- Let's say a cheer.
- Let's cheer.

1839
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,350
- Let's go, Running Man. In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1840
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:06,350
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1841
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,460
Ye Eun, if you win this too,
it will be the best ever.

1842
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:11,330
- Gosh, of course. It'd be awesome.
- The best.

1843
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:12,890
- Jae Seok, you should go first.
- Okay.

1844
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,230
Right, Jae Seok should go first.

1845
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:15,860
- Should I go 1st?
- You're number 1.

1846
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:16,970
No, Seok Sam should go first.

1847
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:18,100
- No.
- Yes, let's go this way.

1848
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,530
- Should we go this way?
- All right. This way.

1849
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:20,900
- I think this will be hard.
- All right.

1850
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,600
- We just have to get five right.
- Okay.

1851
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,610
- Let's try this.
- We can do this.

1852
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:24,940
Let's say a cheer.

1853
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,410
- Let's go.
- Hands in.

1854
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:28,080
- All right.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1855
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,810
- Let's go.
- Okay. Ready.

1856
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:31,410
- We need to get 35 questions right.
- Let's go.

1857
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,150
- Okay, let's go.
- We can do this.

1858
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,180
- Are we starting over here?
- Yes.

1859
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,720
- We'll go this way.
- Ready, set, go.

1860
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,520
- Tom.
- Correct.

1861
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:39,150
- An A-frame.
- Correct.

1862
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,360
- Good.
- That's easy.

1863
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,060
- It's so easy.
- You know him.

1864
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,220
- All right.
- Seok...

1865
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,830
- Dol...
- That's it.

1866
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,860
(Lee Se Dol)

1867
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,160
- Right.
- Dol...

1868
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,170
Oh, it's like Dol Seok...

1869
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,470
(Lee Se Dol)

1870
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:54,770
Dol Seok isn't right.

1871
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:55,870
- Hey.
- Ma...

1872
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,070
Ma Dol Seok...

1873
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:00,240
- Ma Dol Seok?
- Gosh, what is he doing?

1874
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,040
- Sam Seok... Seok Sam...
- You're not there yet.

1875
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,440
- Seok Sam.
- What was his name?

1876
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,350
Gosh, this is... I seriously...
I know him.

1877
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:07,420
I mean...

1878
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,320
- Yes, you seem to know him.
- I just can't remember.

1879
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,750
- Gosh, but this guy...
- Seol... Dol...

1880
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,750
- Dol...
- You have to look at it from afar.

1881
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,420
Dol... Seok...

1882
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,720
- He played against AI.
- That's right.

1883
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,330
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
Seok...

1884
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:19,690
- Alpha Go.
- It was Alpha Go versus...

1885
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,860
Ma Dol Seok.

1886
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,660
No, it's not Ma.

1887
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,230
Ma Dol Seok.

1888
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:26,000
- This is driving me crazy.
- Ma Dol Seok.

1889
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,770
- Lee Seol... Sam.
- You're nearly there.

1890
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:29,370
(He got the last name right!)

1891
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:31,670
- Yes.
- Lee... Seok Sam.

1892
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:32,940
(Lee Seok Sam!)

1893
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,510
(Lee Seok Sam)

1894
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:36,740
- Come on.
- Seok Sam is your name.

1895
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,150
Seok Sam is your name.

1896
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:41,050
Lee Sam Dol.

1897
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,220
(Now, he just has to
change "Sam" to "Se!")

1898
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,150
Lee Sam Dol...

1899
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,850
- But that...
- Change it slightly.

1900
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,620
- You can't give him hints.
- Lee Dol Sam.

1901
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,890
- No! Go back.
- No.

1902
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:50,660
- I can't believe this.
- Lee Dol Sam.

1903
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,260
- Lee Dol Sam.
- You're almost there.

1904
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,630
This is driving me crazy.
Lee Sam Dol.

1905
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,460
Lee Dol Sam.

1906
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,460
Incorrect!

1907
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:58,570
- This is driving me crazy.
- How could someone's name be...

1908
00:59:58,570 --> 00:59:59,700
- Lee Sam Dol.
- Lee Dol Sam?

1909
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,870
That's not it.

1910
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,000
- It's not like that.
- Lee Se Dol!

1911
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,200
- Yes, correct.
- Right, it was Lee Se Dol.

1912
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,040
- Gosh, Lee Seok Sam.
- I'm sorry.

1913
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,510
- He knew it, though.
- Yes.

1914
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:08,510
- All right. It's easy.
- It's so easy.

1915
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:10,210
- That's so easy.
- A frog with a protruding mouth.

1916
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,510
- That's not it!
- How can you not know this?

1917
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:14,650
- How could you...
- Two minutes have passed.

1918
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:15,850
- You can do it.
- That's it.

1919
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:16,850
- How can you...
- It's over.

1920
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,350
- Two minutes? This guy is so weird.
- Seok Jin.

1921
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:21,320
He took up so much time
with Lee Sam Dol.

1922
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,590
- Oh, dear.
- He called the guy Lee Dol Sam.

1923
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:25,430
- Gosh, how can you not know this?
- Lee Se Dol.

1924
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:26,530
I keep thinking of Lee Se Dol now.

1925
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,360
Sam Dol, what are you doing?

1926
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,730
- Lee Se Dol frog.
- My goodness.

1927
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:30,730
- Sam Dol, stop it.
- Gosh, Sam Dol.

1928
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,100
What is this thing with the frog?

1929
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:33,970
- Hey, man.
- How can you not know this?

1930
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:35,300
- What is this?
- Hey, man.

1931
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,070
- A frog in my arms?
- You just don't know.

1932
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,140
- You don't even know.
- Incorrect!

1933
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,840
What is this?

1934
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,210
- Gosh, you just don't know.
- Oh, a frog in a well.

1935
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:42,440
- Correct.
- Oh, dear.

1936
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,310
(Seok Sam's final question)

1937
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,810
- Seriously, what is that guy doing?
- Seok Jin.

1938
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,580
(He doesn't know again.)

1939
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,990
- Don't you know him?
- Who is this?

1940
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:53,150
- This guy...
- Seok Jin.

1941
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,460
Oh, it's Director Ma!

1942
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,320
- Yes, that's right.
- It's Director Ma, right?

1943
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,060
- That's right.
- Does he just want more screentime?

1944
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,090
- It's over anyway.
- I swear.

1945
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,660
Gosh, I think he's kidding.

1946
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:01,830
- Seok Jin.
- No, I'm not kidding.

1947
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:03,330
- Do you really not know him?
- Why don't you know him?

1948
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,770
I know him.
He was on "Three Meals a Day..."

1949
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:06,170
- with Yoo Hai Jin.
- That's right.

1950
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:07,640
You do know him.

1951
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,670
I'm not kidding.

1952
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:09,840
- Is this for real or not?
- My gosh.

1953
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,770
I like this guy.

1954
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:13,640
- It's Director Ma.
- Seriously?

1955
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,140
- That's right.
- Five seconds left. Five.

1956
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,210
- He's a good friend of mine.
- Four.

1957
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,980
- Yes, he was on your YouTube.
- Three.

1958
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,580
- Two. One.
- Seok Jin, please.

1959
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,920
- It's over anyway. I'm sorry.
- Time is up.

1960
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,050
- Cha Seung Won!
- Cha Seung Won.

1961
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:23,750
Of course I know him.
Why wouldn't I know Cha Seung Won?

1962
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:24,890
- Then why didn't you say his name?
- Then why?

1963
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:26,890
Do I really have to say it?
He's such a famous guy.

1964
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,360
Well, that's the game!

1965
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,890
- It's a game!
- We're playing a game!

1966
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:32,090
- Come on. Who doesn't know him?
- Seok Jin.

1967
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:34,360
- Apologize to Mr. Lee Dol Sam.
- Sam Dol.

1968
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,730
- Lee Sam Dol.
- Gosh, I sincerely apologize.

1969
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:39,100
Mr. Lee Se Dol, I'm a huge fan.

1970
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:40,640
- I suddenly couldn't remember.
- That can happen.

1971
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,740
How could you not know his name...

1972
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,070
- if you're a fan?
- What is Lee Sam Dol?

1973
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,710
- Lee Seok Sam, Ma...
- You could be slightly confused,

1974
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:46,440
- Ma Sam Dol.
- Ma Seok Sam.

1975
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,510
- Gosh, what was Ma Sam Dol?
- I just couldn't remember.

1976
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:49,940
- Jae Seok, you should go first.
- I didn't expect...

1977
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,280
- Yes, I'll go first.
- Okay.

1978
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:52,780
- Gosh, that was...
- Jae Seok will go first.

1979
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:54,220
Lee Se Dol. My goodness.

1980
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,920
But when you're in that position,

1981
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,520
- you don't know it.
- It's hard when you're on the spot.

1982
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,020
- Let's try it once more.
- Jae Seok.

1983
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,760
- But...
- Seok Jin, go next to Ji Hyo.

1984
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,760
- Okay.
- To the middle. Let's try it.

1985
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,260
- Can't I be in the middle?
- Should I go second?

1986
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:06,460
- Are you scared?
- Do you want to go second?

1987
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,860
- Because I'm not very good at this.
- Let's go.

1988
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,260
- All right. Let's do this.
- Let's say a cheer.

1989
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,700
- Let's go.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1990
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:11,700
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1991
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,170
- Starting with Jong Kook.
- Let's do it. Just relax.

1992
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:14,600
- Okay, ready.
- Let's relax.

1993
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,070
- They won't give us questions...
- Just relax.

1994
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:18,170
- that we don't know.
- Ready, go.

1995
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:20,780
- Tayo.
- Correct.

1996
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:23,610
Who is this? Who are you?

1997
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:26,080
(Jong Kook's weakest point,
a quiz on female celebrities)

1998
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,750
- Mister.
- You don't know who this is?

1999
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:28,920
- Who is this?
- Heya

2000
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,050
(IVE)

2001
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,790
- Am I supposed to know?
- Jong Kook doesn't know.

2002
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:32,890
- He doesn't know.
- Hey.

2003
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:33,920
(Jang Won Young)

2004
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,090
- Who is she?
- Gosh, she's the prettiest...

2005
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:37,690
- Lucky Vicky.
- Oh, right!

2006
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,530
- Jang Won Young.
- Correct.

2007
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:42,160
But her face looked different.
The thirsty one digs the well.

2008
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,230
Correct.

2009
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,170
- Who are you? Oh, Justin Bieber.
- Correct.

2010
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:46,600
- I didn't know.
- In-san-in-hae.

2011
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,970
(Jong Kook finishes in 25 seconds.)

2012
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,810
- I didn't know who he was.
- Thread snippers.

2013
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:51,840
Correct.

2014
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,510
- Jennie.
- Correct.

2015
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,510
- Unicorn.
- Correct.

2016
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:56,640
- Ja-soo-sung-ga.
- Correct.

2017
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,850
Why are you so good at this, Ji Hyo?

2018
01:02:57,850 --> 01:03:00,350
(She gets 4 questions right
in a flash!)

2019
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,980
- You know him.
- Oh, it's...

2020
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,050
- Dwayne Johnson.
- Correct.

2021
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:05,090
Hey, you did so well.

2022
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:07,090
(Ji Hyo, who's usually zoned-out,
somehow succeeds in 10 seconds!)

2023
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:08,790
(Player number 3, Seok Sam)

2024
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:10,360
- Man-sa-hyung-tong.
- Correct.

2025
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:12,060
Oh, this is hard.

2026
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,260
- Haha, is he the same age as you?
- He's younger than me.

2027
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,330
- He's like a brother, born in 1980.
- Oh, dear.

2028
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:17,470
Kyung Ho, come here.

2029
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:18,630
- Yes?
- Over here.

2030
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:21,600
(Haha's younger brother who visited
last summer)

2031
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:26,070
(Actor Yoon Kyung Ho)

2032
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,640
I said something to him...

2033
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,140
- because he's younger than Haha.
- This is hard.

2034
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:31,210
- "The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call."
- He wouldn't know.

2035
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,310
Min Wan Sik?

2036
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,650
- Incorrect.
- Min Wan Sik?

2037
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,850
- He wouldn't know.
- Choi Kyung Woo?

2038
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:38,320
- Incorrect.
- Oh, Woo is in his name. No, Kyung.

2039
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,790
- Yes.
- Kyung...

2040
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:40,890
(Starting to guess his name)

2041
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:42,990
Lee Kyung... Song?

2042
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,060
Incorrect.

2043
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,530
You guys don't know either, right?

2044
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,830
- Heo Kyeong Hwan.
- Lee Kyung Ho.

2045
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:50,700
- Incorrect.
- You're almost there.

2046
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,730
(He got Kyung Ho right!)

2047
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:53,730
- You're almost there.
- It's similar.

2048
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,000
- Choi Kyung Ho?
- No.

2049
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,600
- Park Kyung Ho? Jung Kyung Ho?
- Incorrect.

2050
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,510
- Yoo Kyung Ho?
- Incorrect.

2051
01:03:58,510 --> 01:03:59,510
(He's almost there!)

2052
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:01,240
- It's similar.
- Lee Kyung Ho, Yoo Kyung Ho.

2053
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,340
- Oh, Yoo... It's similar.
- Oh, gosh.

2054
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,250
- Yoo Kyung Woo?
- It's similar! Come on.

2055
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,850
She said it was similar before this.

2056
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:07,450
- She said it was similar to Yoo.
- Yes, so what is it?

2057
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:08,450
- Go down.
- It's similar to Yoo!

2058
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:09,880
- It's similar to "Yoo."
- Yoo?

2059
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,050
Is "Yo" a family name?

2060
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:12,450
- No, it's similar to "Yoo."
- Seok Jin.

2061
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:13,750
There's one...

2062
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,890
- There's one similar to "Yoo."
- Yoon Kyung Ho?

2063
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,330
- Yoon Kyung Ho?
- That's right.

2064
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:18,430
- It was right.
- How can he not get that?

2065
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:20,130
- Straw.
- Correct.

2066
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:21,630
- Who is that?
- Who is she? Wait.

2067
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:23,260
- Who is she?
- I don't know who she is.

2068
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,430
- Who is she?
- Superstar.

2069
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,170
- Gosh.
- Who is she?

2070
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,400
Superstar.

2071
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,770
- You know who she is?
- She's a superstar.

2072
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,770
- She's Lee Hyo Ri.
- Correct.

2073
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:33,770
She was Lee Hyo Ri.

2074
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:35,040
You got one question left.

2075
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,610
- Why doesn't he have any hair?
- It's him.

2076
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:38,880
He's got no hair.

2077
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,950
You wear it.

2078
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:42,520
His name is something like Bong Sik.

2079
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:44,320
Is he Ya Sik?

2080
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,320
- Ya Sik?
- What is he?

2081
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,850
His name is something like that.

2082
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:48,560
Who is he?

2083
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,990
(Gi Yeong)

2084
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,090
Is he Nu Rung?

2085
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,030
No.

2086
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,860
You're just saying
whatever comes to your mind.

2087
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,600
- How can you say Nu Rung?
- I just thought of it.

2088
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,670
- Who is he?
- How can you say Nu Rung?

2089
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:58,970
- His name begins with "Gi."
- Who is he? What?

2090
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:01,640
- "Gi."
- "Gi."

2091
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,540
- Gi Yeong.
- Correct.

2092
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,810
(4 people are left,
so there's still a chance.)

2093
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:07,410
Why would you say "Nu Rung?"

2094
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:09,580
- Why would you say "Nu Rung?"
- Son Ye Jin.

2095
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:10,580
Correct.

2096
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:12,150

01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,580

2100
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,850
- Shine Muscat.
- Correct.

2101
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:20,220
- He's good.
- Nice.

2102
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,360
(If they hurry, they might succeed.)

2103
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,360
- Get it.
- There.

2104
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:26,560
- Catallena?
- Wrong.

2105
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,230
- Catallena?
- It's...

2106
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,730
- Cabrina?
- Wrong.

2107
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,470
- Nabilera.
- Wrong.

2108
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:33,430
(He got stuck at Ocarina.)

2109
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,840
(Ocarina)

2110
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,640
- Kids carry that around...
- This is hard.

2111
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,410
- in elementary school.
- It's an instrument.

2112
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:40,440
- Hey.
- It's hard.

2113
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,480
It's "rina."

2114
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,210
- It's four syllables.
- Something rina.

2115
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:44,350
Lotteria?

2116
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,080
Lotteria?

2117
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,920
I know it. It's something rina.

2118
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,250
- What rina is it?
- I know.

2119
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:51,050
- You know it, don't you?
- You have five seconds.

2120
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:52,420
- Don't you?
- Why don't you know it?

2121
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,620
- Three,
- I can't remember it.

2122
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:54,790
- two, one.
- What is it?

2123
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:57,090
- Ocarina.
- Ocarina.

2124
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:58,860
You're the biggest fan of Karina.

2125
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:00,190
How can you not know ocarina?

2126
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,330
Why would you say Lotteria?

2127
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:04,000
He said "Catallena."

2128
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,700
He thought of the song "Catallena."

2129
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,840
- When you get stuck with one...
- I'll get one.

2130
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,200
When you get stuck,
your mind goes blank...

2131
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,270
because you feel sorry.

2132
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:12,140
Since you all find it too difficult,

2133
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,510
- we will give you enough time.
- Five minutes.

2134
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:14,680
- We will give you five minutes.
- Five minutes is good.

2135
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,180
- Five minutes is good.
- Thank you.

2136
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,510
- That's nice.
- Five minutes is good.

2137
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:18,880
And our wrong answers are fun.

2138
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,350
They want to give it to Ye Eun.

2139
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:22,350
- Right.
- Right.

2140
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:24,290
- Can we use the pass chance?
- No passing.

2141
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,920
- No passing?
- No passing.

2142
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,920
- Give us 5 minutes.
- You get 5 minutes.
Five minutes is plenty of time.

2143
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,020
Are you going in this order?

2144
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,830
- No, the opposite.
- Let's start from here.

2145
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:32,890
- We will go like this.
- Right.

2146
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:34,300
- Shouldn't you switch seats?
- In a zigzag order.

2147
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,560
- We should go to the front.
- Right.

2148
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,100
- Let's go to the front.
- Go.

2149
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,000
- You should be the third.
- In a zigzag order.

2150
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,370
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

2151
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,900
- Are you the first?
- I am.

2152
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,500
- Relax.
- Let's do this.

2153
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,610
Go.

2154
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,140
- Yuk Seong Jae.
- Correct.

2155
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:50,710
- We went to his place.
- Right.

2156
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:51,780
- Pacquiao.
- Right.

2157
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,080
- We went to his place.
- Okay.

2158
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,620
- Typewriter.
- Correct.

2159
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,620
- Flamingo.
- Correct.

2160
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:57,720
- How does he know that?
- What is it?

2161
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:59,450
- You block it with phlegm.
- That's it.

2162
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:00,920
(It's a smooth start!)

2163
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,160
- I never knew.
- Is it me?

2164
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,760
- Funnel.
- Okay.

2165
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,830

2166
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:06,430
- Sip-jung-pal-gu.

2167
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,600
G...

01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,000
- Gas mask.
- Correct.

2169
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,400
(It's their best record so far!)

2170
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,530
- Correct.
- Nice.

2171
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:14,770
What's that called?

2172
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:16,270
- What is that?
- Just read it.

2173
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,540
- That's...
- What does it look like?

2174
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:21,010
- It's safety... What's it called?
- Wait.

2175
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,410
- Safety cone?
- Wrong.

2176
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:24,450
(Rubber cone)

2177
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:25,910
- Road.
- Cone chips?

2178
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:27,210
(Cone chips?)

2179
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:29,450
What are you saying?

2180
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:30,450
(He's making up names again.)

2181
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:31,590
What is it? Rubber cone?

2182
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:33,420
- Rubber cone?
- Yes.

2183
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:34,460
- Is it right?
- I will accept that.

2184
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:35,920
The English pronunciation
is similar.

2185
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,120
- Right. Rubber cone.
- Next.

2186
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,560
- Nam Chang Hee.
- Correct.

2187
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:39,890
- Ye Eun is next.
- Ye Eun.

2188
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:41,200
Startled by a turtle,
now startled even by...

2189
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:42,900
- It's...
- What is it?

2190
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,300
- What?
- You don't know that?

2191
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:45,530
Pork belly.

2192
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:48,300
I know it. Startled by a turtle...

2193
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,000
This is not right.

2194
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,870
You can't do this.

2195
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,170
Now startled even
by a webfoot octopus.

2196
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:54,780
I'm the webfoot octopus?

2197
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,140
(Subjective interpretation
of the hint)

2198
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:58,150
Come on, Ye Eun.

2199
01:07:58,150 --> 01:07:59,410
- Now startled even by a squid?
- No.

2200
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:00,710
- No.
- Startled by a turtle...

2201
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:02,020
- I know it.
- That's not it.

2202
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:03,280
- This is...
- No.

2203
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,320
(There's still enough time!)

2204
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,250
(Sizzling sound)

2205
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,860
- Now startled even by a griddle?
- No.

2206
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:09,260
- That's similar.
- What kind of a griddle?

2207
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,320
Now startled even by a fire pit?

2208
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,390
- No.
- Fire...

2209
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:12,490
Ye Eun.

2210
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:13,630
- Three syllables.
- Look at Jong Kook.

2211
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:14,830
- Startled by a fire lid.
- Look at Jong Kook.

2212
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:15,930
- No.
- That's it.

2213
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:17,360
- Now startled even by a pot lid.
- Correct.

2214
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:19,430
- Jung Jae Hyung?
- Correct.

2215
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,970
- Tape. White-out tape.
- Correct.

2216
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,040
- Who is he?
- He is...

2217
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,040
Miden?

2218
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,510
- Gordon Ramsay.
- Correct.

2219
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,680
She pronounced it well too.

2220
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,140
- She's...
- Who is she?

2221
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,580
Who's that?

2222
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:32,310
- Isn't she done?
- No. This one is the last one.

2223
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:33,710
Inuyasha's friend.

2224
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:34,750
- No.
- Inuyasha's friend?

2225
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:35,750
No.

2226
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:36,780
I don't know her.

2227
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,620
- It's not from her period.
- Galaxy Express 999

2228
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,190
- Right.
- Who is it?

2229
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,920
- Sophie.
- No.

2230
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,660
- Kiki?
- No.

2231
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:45,890
- What is it?
- It starts with M.

2232
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:47,030
M?

2233
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:48,030
- T.
- Mitel?

2234
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:50,260
- Mitel?
- No.

2235
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:51,930
- Mitan.
- No, you almost got it.

2236
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:52,930
- You almost had it.
- Mital?

2237
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:54,540
- No.
- Just mumble the words.

2238
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:55,570
- Midle.
- The first one...

2239
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:57,940
(Midle)

2240
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:59,470
- It's similar to what you said.
- Matel.

2241
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:00,610
- Okay.
- Maetel.

2242
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:01,780
Okay.

2243
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:03,180
(Ye Eun passed.
Now 4 people remain!)

2244
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:05,750
Ji Hyo is next.

2245
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,080

- Correct.

2246
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,350
- How does she know him?
- Lee Sang Soon.

2247
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:09,720
- Correct.
- How does she know? She's good.

01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:10,820
- Mafa tofu.
- Correct.

2249
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,150
- She's so good.
- She's so good.

2250
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,090
- Fennec fox.
- Correct.

2251
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:15,860
(Will she get
the Chinese idiom right too?)

2252
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,730
- Bu-chang-bu-su.
- Correct.

2253
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,290
(Ji Hyo passes quickly,
and now three people remain.)

2254
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:20,590
- She's incredible.
- Get one, at least.

2255
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,360
Seok Sam is next.

2256
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,500
Ji Hyo.

2257
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,570
Sea squirt.

2258
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:25,700
Correct.

2259
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,540

- Ja-rin.

2261
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,740
- Lee Su Ji.
- Correct.

2262
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,070
That was hard.

2263
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:33,240
I don't know.

2264
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:35,180
Gosh.

2265
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:36,940
It's him.

2266
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,150
It's him. Him.

2267
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:40,710
- The friend.
- The friend.

2268
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,180
- Look.
- He is the friend.

2269
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:44,080
- Funny.
- It's his friend.

2270
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,120
He's the friend of the guy
who grabs a spaceship with his toes.

2271
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,590
It's him.

2272
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:49,620
What's his name?

2273
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,760
- I always watched this cartoon.
- Now.

2274
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,660
- He's his friend.
- Get your hand out of your pocket.

2275
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,360
Right. What's his name?

2276
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,330
You can tell me
his original name. Right?

2277
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,370
- Jimsy.
- You got 1 minute and 30 seconds.

2278
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:02,000
Correct.

2279
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,170
(1 minute and 30 seconds remain.
And Se Chan and Haha are left.)

2280
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:04,370
Se Chan.

2281
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:05,610
- Yakgwa.
- There you go.

2282
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:06,610
- Yakgwa.
- Wrong.

2283
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:08,510
- Right.
- Isn't it yakgwa?

2284
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:10,110
- It's made with rice. What is it?
- Hangwa.

2285
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:11,780
Correct.

2286
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,380
- KAI.
- Correct.

2287
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,480
Nice.

2288
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:15,650
Is she Cinderella?

2289
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:16,920
- There's a movie.
- There are two.

2290
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,120
Like that.

2291
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,220
- They say someone is like that.
- Like something.

2292
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,920
- Princess?
- No.

2293
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,120
What is she?

2294
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:25,890
Han Chae Young.

2295
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,330
Princess Mimi? No.

2296
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:28,630
- Similar.
- Similar to that.

2297
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,130
Barbie.

2298
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:31,330
(Dan-sin)

2299
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:33,070
- Dan-sin.
- I know this.

2300
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:34,600
What dan-sin is it?

2301
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,170
- All right.
- I am craving ramyeon.

2302
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:37,610
- Ha-ha-dan-sin?
- No.

2303
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,040
- Ha-ha-dan-sin?
- What dan-sin?

2304
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,210
Same initials.

2305
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,510
- Right.
- Ho-ho-dan-sin? No.

2306
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:43,710
- All right.
- Same initials.

2307
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:44,750
- Dan-sin?
- All right.

2308
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:45,810
- You know.
- Look.

2309
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,150
Purse?

2310
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:48,480
- Now.
- Purse dan-sin?

2311
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,750
Yul-hyul.

2312
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:52,090
- Yul-hyul-dan-sin!
- Wrong.

2313
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:53,490
- Wait.
- Is that wrong?

2314
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,920
- Yul-hyul-dan-sin!
- Wrong.

2315
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,260
Is that wrong?

2316
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,690
(He embarrassed himself
while trying to give a hint.)

2317
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:01,260
- I'm sorry.
- It's similar.

2318
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,430
Hurry.

2319
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:04,200
(He's almost there!)

2320
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,230
- Hyul-yuk-dan-sin?
- No.

2321
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:06,430
Wrong.

2322
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:08,470
- Hyul...
- Same initials.

2323
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:09,970
- Hyul-hyul-dan-sin.
- Correct.

2324
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,140
- Yi-gu-dong-sung.
- Correct.

2325
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:14,280
(If the last player,
Haha succeeds, they succeed.)

2326
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,780
- Bamboo shoot.
- Correct.

2327
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,180
(Even if you know the way,
ask and go.)

2328
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,750
- If you don't know...
- Wrong.

2329
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:20,910
Ask and go.

2330
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:22,280
No. It's wrong.

2331
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,680
- No.
- Hurry.

2332
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,750
How don't you know that?

2333
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:27,290
- Even if you go around...
- Come on.

2334
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,490
- No.
- What is it?

2335
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:30,120
- You have 20 seconds now.
- We have 20 seconds.

2336
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,460
- Hurry.
- We can do it.

2337
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,730
Just say anything.

2338
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:34,800
- Go.
- All right.

2339
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,560
- Ask. I don't know.
- Why ask?

2340
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,570
- Because I don't know.
- Why ask?

2341
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:39,830
- No.
- Right.

2342
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:41,570
- You ask if you don't know.
- Ten.

2343
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:42,940
- What about the opposite?
- Come on.

2344
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,140
If you succeed...

2345
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:46,970
- Ask...
- If you succeed, we succeed.

2346
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:48,610
South Gyeongsang Province!

2347
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:49,840
(South Gyeongsang Province?)

2348
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,010
South Gyeongsang Province!

2349
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:52,310
(With the ring,
their 4th attempt fails.)

2350
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:53,650
South Gyeongsang Province?

2351
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:55,080
- Wrong.
- What is it?

2352
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:56,820
- Even if you know the way.
- Gosh, Haha.

2353
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,090
- Even if you know the way.
- Even if you know the way.

2354
01:11:58,090 --> 01:11:59,490
Even if you know the way.

2355
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:01,520
- That was hard.
- You failed.

2356
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,620
This is so upsetting.

2357
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,120
Look at Ye Eun's face.

2358
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:05,460
It's okay.

2359
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:08,060
- Even if you know the way, ask.
- Even if you know the way, ask.

2360
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:09,530
How can he not know that?

2361
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:11,200
I will give you one last chance.

2362
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,770
One last chance.

2363
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:15,040
If we count the time
when we did it at Jong Kook's,

2364
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,240
we failed it about 20 times.

2365
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,710
This time,

2366
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:19,970
we had a chance to succeed.

2367
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:22,180
By the way, Ji Hyo is the ace.

2368
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:23,310
Ji Hyo is good.

2369
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,450
- Ji Hyo is the ace.
- You go first.

2370
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:26,250
- Me?
- Ji Hyo, you go first.

2371
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,510
Let's switch seats.

2372
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,880
Why did I suddenly become the ace?

2373
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,580
- What if I get stuck?
- Ye Eun and then me.

2374
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,290
- Ye Eun.
- Just do what you did.

2375
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:33,290
- Let's trust Ji Hyo.
- Let's trust her.

2376
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:34,520
- Will I be able to do it?
- Let's start with Ji Hyo.

2377
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,190
- It's easy in the beginning.
- Ready.

2378
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:37,930
- Ready.
- Get ready. Go.

2379
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,060
Ca...

2380
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,130
- Start.
- Go.

2381
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,900
Ca...

2382
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:46,570
- Parfait.
- Wrong.

2383
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:47,940
What?

2384
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:49,100
- Waffle.
- Wrong.

2385
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,000
- It's this, isn't it?
- Right.

2386
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,910
- Cone.
- Wrong.

2387
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,510
"Fe" is right.

2388
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:55,680
- Pen?
- You had it.

2389
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,310
- Go.
- Rfait?

2390
01:12:57,310 --> 01:12:58,510
Parfait.

2391
01:12:58,510 --> 01:12:59,580
(This is the last chance.)

2392
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:01,120
- It's similar to what you said.
- Let's go.

2393
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,050
- Waffle.
- Similar to the first one.

2394
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:05,050
- Crape.
- No.

2395
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,250
- Don't change...
- Crepe.

2396
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,250
- Right.
- Correct.

2397
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,760
Crepe. Pelican.

2398
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:09,890
- Correct.
- Okay.

2399
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:11,260
- Yu-yu-mu-sang.
- Wrong.

2400
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:12,830
Wait.

2401
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:14,130
(Mu-nyum-mu-sang)

2402
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,260
Our lives are...

2403
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:19,400
- Hui-no-ae-rak?
- No.

2404
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,470
It's "mu-sang" at the end.
How can you say "Hui-no?"

2405
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:23,170
- How did she come up with that?
- Timeout!

2406
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:25,670
- Timeout!
- Timeout!

2407
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:28,010
- Breathe.
- I am sorry.

2408
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:30,340
- It's "mu-sang" at the end.
- Can we start over?

2409
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:31,650
- How can you say "Hui-no?"
- She's hyperventilating.

2410
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:33,480
- We...
- I told you.

2411
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,620
We will change the order.

2412
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:35,820
- Wait.
- Just once more.

2413
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,220
You go first.

2414
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:38,790
Let's go as usual.

2415
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,220
It's just unbelievable.

2416
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,220
It's "mu-sang" at the end.
How could she say "Hui-no?"

2417
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,620
Jong Kook,

2418
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:44,890
you and I should go first.

2419
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:46,160
Let's go back to the previous order.

2420
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,900
- The previous order.
- What will we do about him?

2421
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,330
- He's the last one.
- And...

2422
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:50,960
- Seok Sam is...
- I'm scared too.

2423
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,400
He's not in good shape.

2424
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,500
He's in terrible shape.

2425
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,770
- He keeps saying the wrong things.
- That's not it.

2426
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:56,400
This is perfect.

2427
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,270
Let's not get up...

2428
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:00,070
and be too actively involved.

2429
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,380
We are too involved.

2430
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:03,080
We did well
when we went in this order.

2431
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,050
Right. You have to
watch from a distance.

2432
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:06,180
Have you decided on the order?

2433
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,480
- It's really your last chance.
- All right.

2434
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,280
- It's the last chance.
- Let's do this.

2435
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:10,520
(This is the last chance for real.)

2436
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,920
We should be at ease doing this.

2437
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,120
- Right. Put yourself at ease.
- Should I go first?

2438
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,150
- Yes.
- Okay.

2439
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:15,320
- Let's do this, Jae Seok.
- Ready, go.

2440
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:18,130
- He doesn't know.
- This isn't going to work.

2441
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:21,090
- He doesn't know.
- This isn't going to work.

2442
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:23,030
- Shall I go first?
- Jong Kook goes first.

2443
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:24,060
- Hugh Jackman.
- Correct.

2444
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,070
- You go first.
- Good.

2445
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:26,370
- Geo-du-jeol-mi.
- Incorrect.

2446
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:28,070
- All right.
- Geo-du-jeol-mi.

2447
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:29,770
- Tutu.
- Correct.

2448
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:30,840
You're good.

2449
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,440
- Maggot.
- Correct.

2450
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,170
- Hahoe mask.
- There you go.

2451
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,210
(Jong Kook finished it quickly,
and it is Jae Seok's turn now.)

2452
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:36,280
- I didn't know.
- Let's go.

2453
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:38,410
- In-myeon-su-sim.
- Correct.

2454
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,850
- You know it.
- It's... Bboongbboong.

2455
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:41,850
- Correct.
- Good.

2456
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:43,420
- Who is this?
- Who's that?

2457
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,620
- Jonathan.
- Correct.

2458
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:46,520
- Is it Jonathan?
- Why does he look so handsome?

2459
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,820
- Gayageum.
- Correct.

2460
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:51,930
- All right. This is... Casper.
- That's right.

2461
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:53,260
- Well done.
- All right.

2462
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:55,160
Well... Gadget.

2463
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,330
- Correct.
- She's good.

2464
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:58,030
- That's... John Lennon.
- Yes.

2465
01:14:58,030 --> 01:14:59,770
- Correct.
- How did she know that?

2466
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:00,830
- Correct.
- Good.

2467
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:02,340
- Mapae.
- Good.

2468
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,340
- Hong Jin Kyeong.
- Correct.

2469
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:06,310
- I don't know.
- If the price is the same...

2470
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:07,470
All right. What is it?

2471
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:08,580
I should pay.

2472
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:10,710
I should pay.

2473
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,810
(She got it wrong
with a mind-shattering answer.)

2474
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:15,050
If the price is the same,
it's half price.

2475
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:16,150
- No.
- Incorrect.

2476
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,020
- If the price is the same...
- It's over. She can't get it.

2477
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,390
- She's mired.
- It's over.

2478
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,990
- That's not it.
- Isn't it "I buy it cheap?"

2479
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:22,720
(Answer: If the price is the same,
buy a scarlet skirt.)

2480
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:25,190
- If the price is the same...
- In the past,

2481
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:27,130
- our ancestors wore...
- That's...

2482
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:30,000
- Well... Jeogori?
- But...

2483
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,030
- Not jeogori.
- Well... Hanbok.

2484
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:33,670
- Right. The bottom.
- It's pretty.

2485
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:34,740
- What is it?
- Something pretty.

2486
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:36,670
- The color is pretty.
- Well...

2487
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:38,270
- Buy a scarlet skirt.
- That's it.

2488
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:41,340
(That makes 3 of them,
and now it's Ye Eun's turn!)

2489
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:43,040
- My gosh.
- SpongeBob.

2490
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,340
- Yes.
- Correct.

2491
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:45,850
- Byul.
- Correct.

2492
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:47,380
- Mak-mu-ga-nae.
- Correct.

2493
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:49,350
- Hong... Peacock.
- Yes.

2494
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:50,650
- Correct.
- Good.

2495
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,290
- That's it.
- It's a tricky one.

2496
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,890
- I did this before.
- That's... Toun... Dou...

2497
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,120
- You're almost there.
- It's close.

2498
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,420
- Douner.
- It's close.

2499
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,030
- Correct.
- Good.

2500
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:01,300
- Who is it?
- Whose turn? It's you, Haha.

2501
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:02,800
- You should do it.
- It's still your turn.

2502
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,600
- She finished. It's your turn.
- Me?

2503
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,970
- It's her. It's you.
- What?

2504
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:08,340
- Ah Young.
- Yes.

2505
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,300
- Her full name.
- Lee... Kim Ah Young.

2506
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,470
- Correct.
- All right.

2507
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:12,570
Dahongjima.

2508
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:14,210
- Incorrect.
- That's not it, you punk.

2509
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:15,580
- Haha is...
- It's "Jima."

2510
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:16,640
(Haha is the problem again.)

2511
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,450
- It's about life.
- What is life like?

2512
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,450
- Life is...
- Life is...

2513
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:22,450
- Life is really like...
- Life is really like...

2514
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:23,520
It's something you know.

2515
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:25,120
- Hang on a second.
- Say.

2516
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:27,050
- Something's flying.
- Say.

2517
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:28,760
- Sae...
- Saeongjima.

2518
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:29,790
- Correct.
- Good.

2519
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:31,020
- Gargamel.
- Correct.

2520
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,930
Age is undefeated.

2521
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:33,930
Good.

2522
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:36,360
- She's... Park Na Rae.
- Correct.

2523
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,760
- Correct.
- Next.

2524
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,570
(With 2 minutes and 40 seconds left,
Seok Sam and Se Chan should go.)

2525
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:41,700
- It's Seok Sam's turn.
- Seok Sam.

2526
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:43,440
- I-yeol.
- Correct.

2527
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,240
- Who's that?
- You know him. Look closely.

2528
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,310
- Byeon Woo Seok?
- Incorrect.

2529
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:49,410
He's doing a drama now.

2530
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,180
- He's on a TV drama.
- A perfect score...

2531
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:52,380
My house.

2532
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,480
All right.

2533
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,050
- He was on our show?
- He was.

2534
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,220
I see. It's him. A member of 2PM.

2535
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:58,890
- Right.
- Of 2PM...

2536
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:01,320
- Let's go to my house
- That's it.

2537
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,920
(Jun Ho)

2538
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,730
- Why aren't you saying his name?
- My gosh. I don't know.

2539
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:09,400
(He remembers everything
but his name.)

2540
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,060
- What's his name?
- All right.

2541
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,630
- Seriously...
- Just say any name.

2542
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:14,130
- Name everyone.
- He's 2PM.

2543
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:16,300
- Right.
- He's not Jay.

2544
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,310
- It's too...
- Gosh, seriously...

2545
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:19,740
- This is driving me crazy.
- It's not difficult.

2546
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,010
- It's a common name.
- Right.

2547
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:22,380
(This is their last chance
to win a robot vacuum cleaner.)

2548
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,610
All right.

2549
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:25,150
- All right.
- Him of 2PM.

2550
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:26,250
- You're almost there.
- You have two minutes left.

2551
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:27,480
- You can do this.
- We have two minutes?

2552
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,020
If I get it right now,
we can still do this.

2553
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:31,450
- He's 2PM.
- Jun...

2554
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:34,020
- He's 2PM.
- Jun...

2555
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:36,460
- My gosh. Jun...
- Yes. Ho!

2556
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:38,990
- My gosh. Jun...
- Yes. Ho!

2557
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:41,630
(They said
both "Jun" and "Ho" already.)

2558
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:43,500
(Jun Ho)

2559
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,930
- Hee Jun?
- Incorrect.

2560
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,600
- Hee Jun?
- Incorrect.

2561
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,600
- Is it two syllables?
- Yes.

2562
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,300
- Two syllables? Jun Seok?
- It's a two-syllable name.

2563
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,740
- Incorrect.
- All right.

2564
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:53,470
- Hae Jun.
- No.

2565
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:54,810
Does Jun go first or last?

2566
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,310
- It goes first.
- First.

2567
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,180
- Jun Hae. Jun Seok.
- Incorrect.

2568
01:17:58,180 --> 01:17:59,610
- Jun Su.
- No.

2569
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:00,950
(His colleagues keep saying "Ho"
behind him.)

2570
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:03,050
- Ho!
- Ho!

2571
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,620
(Will he pick up on the hint?)

2572
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:09,390
- Jun Kyu. Jun Ki.
- Incorrect.

2573
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:11,490
(He still doesn't know!)

2574
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:13,360
- Jun Ki.
- Jun Ho!

2575
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:16,100
- Jun Ho!
- Jun Ho!

2576
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,070
Jun Ho!

2577
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,330
- It's Jun Ho.
- Correct.

2578
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:22,200
- Tomato. No, pomegranate.
- Good.

2579
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:24,000
(Exclaiming)

2580
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,240
(He doesn't know again!)

2581
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,610
Bus? Tayo?

2582
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:29,480
- Tayo?
- That's not it.

2583
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,710
- What is it?
- It's English.

2584
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:31,950
It's English, Seok Jin.

2585
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:33,780
The thermage... Henderson?

2586
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:35,380
- It's something like that.
- What?

2587
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:39,320
Johansson? It's something
that sounds like that.

2588
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:41,860
(Now they have less than 1 minute.)

2589
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:45,490
If it's not
Johansson or Henderson... Wait.

2590
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:47,390
Smurf. No.

2591
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:48,830
- Thomas!
- Correct.

2592
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:50,700
- There's one more.
- Hurry.

2593
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,170
- The boot is on the other foot.
- Good. Hurry.

2594
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,540
(With 50 seconds left,
the last player, Se Chan, steps up.)

2595
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:56,640
A bolt out of the blue.

2596
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,670
- Correct.
- Okay. We can do this.

2597
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:59,070
- Big head. No.
- Incorrect.

2598
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:00,810
What is it then?

2599
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:02,110
Jang-gun?

2600
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:03,640
- Dok-bul-jang-gun.
- Correct.

2601
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,850
Who are they? DAY6.

2602
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:07,510
- Correct.
- What is it? Snoopy?

2603
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:08,650
- No.
- Blue?

2604
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:09,650
- No.
- We're in trouble.

2605
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:11,750
- This is...
- You can't give him a hint.

2606
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:12,820
- What is this?
- He's stuck.

2607
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:14,790
- It's a otter.
- Is this the last one?

2608
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,590
- Four syllables.
- Otter...

2609
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:17,920
- Four syllables.
- No.

2610
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,760
- Isn't it an otter? What is it?
- A Japanese character.

2611
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:21,290
- A Japanese character?
- That's...

2612
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:22,600
Doraemon?

2613
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,000
- No.
- Hurry.

2614
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,500
- What's that?
- What is it? I don't know.

2615
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,600
(15 seconds left)

2616
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,000
What's its name?
Oh, right. Bonobono.

2617
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,070
- Correct.
- That's it.

2618
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:35,080
(With 10 seconds left,
he moves on to the last question.)

2619
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,410
- Correct.
- That's it.

2620
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:37,410
- Really?
- Financier.
- Incorrect.
- No.

2621
01:19:38,410 --> 01:19:39,410
- Financier.
- Incorrect.

2622
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:40,450
- No.
- Se Chan, I bought it before.

2623
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:42,720
Carolrulru. Ca...

2624
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,320
- Ca...
- It's something like that.

2625
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:46,620
(He's correct about "Ca.")

2626
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:48,590
(Last 5 seconds!)

2627
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:49,720
Carolrelre.

2628
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,190
- Almost there.
- Please.

2629
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,090
- Carolrelre.
- Please.

2630
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:55,530
(Cannele)

2631
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:56,930
- Cannele.
- Correct.

2632
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,600
(Yang Se Chan succeeded!)

2633
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,800
- Is it over?
- Yes.

2634
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:01,200
- You succeeded.
- What?

2635
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:05,340
- You succeeded at the last minute.
- We did it.

2636
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:06,740
Hey, Ca...

2637
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:09,340
- Hey, we did it.
- My goodness.

2638
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,410
I'm sorry, Jun Ho.

2639
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:13,850
I'm sorry, Jun Ho.
I forgot your name for a moment.

2640
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:17,480
- I'm really sorry.
- Now you can open five letters.

2641
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,690
It's not over yet.

2642
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:19,890
- We have to do this.
- All right.

2643
01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:21,690
- Yes. Ye Eun, we tried our best.
- All right.

2644
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:24,660
- I'm sweating.
- You should find...

2645
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,330
the letters,
"cheong," "so," and "gi."

2646
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:27,960
I'm worried.

2647
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,930
I thought there would be
repeated letters, but no.

2648
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:30,960
Right.

2649
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,230
Just open one with confidence.

2650
01:20:32,230 --> 01:20:33,400
I was born in July.

2651
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,600
- Okay. Seven.
- Seven.

2652
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,370
- Didn't you pick it earlier? No?
- Or we...

2653
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:37,770
I was born in August.

2654
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:39,410
- I'll pick eight, then.
- Okay.

2655
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:40,570
Okay. I was born in August.

2656
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:41,640
Please.

2657
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:43,210
- Is that it?
- What is it?

2658
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:47,450
(She picked the letter
she wanted right away.)

2659
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:49,120
- It's "so."
- So?

2660
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,850
- I have five chances.
- Then...

2661
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,790
I don't think
the rest is right next to it.

2662
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:53,850
- No.
- No.

2663
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:55,320
Get rid of 7 and 9.

2664
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,960
- Pick these two.
- Pick number five.

2665
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:58,930
- Pick number five.
- Five?

2666
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:00,290
- Why is that?
- No.

2667
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,760
I don't have a feeling
that it's number five.

2668
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,200
You don't?
You should have a feeling.

2669
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,300
- What about number one?
- It wouldn't go that way.

2670
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,130
- Just pick what you want.
- Pick anything.

2671
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:08,440
- Number one?
- We still have many chances.

2672
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,170
- Go ahead.
- Do whatever you want.

2673
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,040
- Do you want to open number one?
- Go ahead.

2674
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,570
- All right. Do whatever you want.
- Number two?

2675
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:14,910
- Number 2?
- Okay. Number 2 sounds nice.

2676
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:16,180
- Number 2?
- Yes, number 2.

2677
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:17,810
- Why number two?
- Du.

2678
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:19,350
- Sodu.
- Sodu.

2679
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,280
- Sodu.
- You got a small head.

2680
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:23,850
You got a small head.

2681
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,590
- All right.
- Now...

2682
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:27,190
- We have three chances left, right?
- Now...

2683
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:28,260
- Two?
- You should pick one of these.

2684
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:29,460
- Pick what you want.
- Let's go with number one.

2685
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:30,860
- Go with your choice.
- Number one.

2686
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:32,190
- I have a feeling.
- That's what you wanted?

2687
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:33,290
Number one.

2688
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:37,260
(Will it be "cheong" or "gi?")

2689
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,470
Number one.

2690
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,970
(It's "cheong.")

2691
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:43,070
What?

2692
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:44,470
- It was number one.
- My goodness.

2693
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,040
- That's what I chose.
- You're really...

2694
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,440
- I also thought of number one.
- I chose it.

2695
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:50,040
- My goodness.
- Good.

2696
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:53,550
(Now she needs to find "gi"
using the remaining 2 chances.)

2697
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,650
Now, we need "gi."

2698
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:56,780
- Yes. I need "gi."
- It'd be here or here.

2699
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:58,180
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

2700
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:00,520
- I think it's number 10.
- Number 10?

2701
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:02,360
- I feel the same way.
- I don't think it's number 10.

2702
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,620
- Then number 5...
- I think it's number 10.

2703
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:05,960
- I think it's number 7.
- Number 5.

2704
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,560
Hey, we can't decide on
the last one.

2705
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,030
- Let Ye Eun choose.
- Right.

2706
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:11,100
- We have one more chance anyway.
- Right.

2707
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,700
- Okay.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2708
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:13,970
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- I think it's number five.

2709
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:15,340
(They will decide by playing
rock-paper-scissors again.)

2710
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,970
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2711
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:18,170
It's settled.

2712
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:19,270
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2713
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:20,570
I think it's number five.
Is it correct?

2714
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:21,740
- I don't think so.
- I don't think it is.

2715
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:22,910
- That can't be it.
- No.

2716
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:24,880
- I don't think it's number five.
- You can't pick.

2717
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,110
- I don't think it is.
- You stay out of this.

2718
01:22:26,110 --> 01:22:27,350
- I don't think it is.
- You have bad luck.

2719
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:28,450
Are you confident, Jae Seok?

2720
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:29,480
- Why should I stay out of it?
- What's your choice?

2721
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:30,950
- I'll choose number three.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2722
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:32,320
Why would you decide that?

2723
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,750
- I won.
- If you are confident...

2724
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,260
- Number five?
- Do you want to do it?

2725
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:36,560
- Yes.
- I pick number nine.

2726
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,960
- My choice is number 3.
- I don't think it's number 9.

2727
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:39,960
- Number nine...
- Cheong, so, gi.

2728
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,060
- I think it's number ten.
- No. Cheong, so, gi.

2729
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:43,460
- Number ten?
- Cheong, so, gi.

2730
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:44,860
- Ye Eun, just open it.
- Cheong, so, gi.

2731
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:45,970
- You do it.
- What the heck!

2732
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,970
(Shocking)

2733
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,670
(She really got it!)

2734
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,340
You got it?
I said it was number ten.

2735
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:55,140
What?

2736
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:58,750
(Everyone is shocked
by Ye Eun's amazing luck.)

2737
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:01,350
I said it was number ten.

2738
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,820
(They achieve great success
on the 4th try.)

2739
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:04,850
- I said it was number ten.
- Really?

2740
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:06,220
- Really?
- No way.

2741
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,920
Really. I said it was number ten
since earlier.

2742
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,960
Does this make sense?

2743
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,460
- Good.
- Congratulations,

2744
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:13,060
- Ye Eun.
- Does this make sense?

2745
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:14,930
- I said it.
- You won the robot vacuum cleaner.

2746
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:16,260
- Nice.
- But...

2747
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:18,130
I said I had a feeling
it would be number ten.

2748
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:19,830
I'm exhausted.

2749
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:21,270
- I'm exhausted.
- I'm so tired.

2750
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:22,740
I can't go to housewarmings.

2751
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:23,800
But this is really hard.

2752
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:24,800
Let's go home now.

2753
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,340
The Happy Ye Eun Day race ended.

2754
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:29,910
The members and Ye Eun
worked together...

2755
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:31,440
to earn both gifts.

2756
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,450
Congratulations.

2757
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:34,280
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2758
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,480
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

2759
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,280
- How nice for you.
- My head hurts.

2760
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,650
This is really crazy.

2761
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:40,190
- It was crazy.
- I just pulled it and it was there.

2762
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:42,160
- I had a feeling it would be ten.
- My head hurts so much.

2763
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,720
I'm so tired.

2764
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:45,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

2765
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:46,830
Hello.

2766
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:48,860
- Hello.
- Hello.

2767
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:51,030
- Okay. We're here again.
- Hello.

2768
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,730
- We've been here before.
- It's been a while.

2769
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:54,700
- Kim Rae Won was here.
- That's right.

2770
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,140
- Rae Won.
- That's right.

2771
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,340
Right. It was that time.

2772
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:58,470
- Rae Won.
- I remember.

2773
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:00,740
- With Park Byung Eun.
- That's right.

2774
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:01,940
Niel.

2775
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:03,010
- I...
- Why are you so late?

2776
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:05,180
- I went that way.
- It's okay.

2777
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:07,610
Daniel didn't come to Ye Eun's
housewarming party last week.

2778
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:09,150
- Right.
- Why didn't you come?

2779
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:10,550
- It's really pretty.
- Yes. It's pretty.

2780
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:11,550
It's like a model house.

2781
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:14,020
I couldn't go because
I was filming...

2782
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:15,260
- a drama.
- Which?

2783
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:17,820
Daniel was cast in a drama.

2784
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,560
- Yes.
- He...

2785
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,560
- joined a good drama.
- Nice.

2786
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,960
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2787
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,830
- We need to hear such good news.
- Yes.

2788
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:26,930
- But...
- Right.

2789
01:24:26,930 --> 01:24:30,170
(Anyway)

2790
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:31,810
What's wrong with Ji Hyo's eyebrows?

2791
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:33,610
- What happened? Did you dye them?
- Did you dye them?

2792
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,840
Yes. I dyed them yesterday.

2793
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,110
(Glancing)

2794
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:39,080
- Your eyebrows?
- My aunt was looking...

2795
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,250
for her shoes.

2796
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:42,350
(Mona Lisa was wearing
Jong Kook's Aunt's shoes.)

2797
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:45,050
Take them. Here.

2798
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:48,150
Take them. There you go.

2799
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:50,090
- Hey!
- Give them to your aunt.

2800
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:51,360
I found them, Aunt!

2801
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:53,560
Give them to her.

2802
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:54,630
Wear them.

2803
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:57,230
Their sitcom is really funny
these days.

2804
01:24:57,260 --> 01:25:00,430
I'm a real fan. These two...

2805
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:02,270
It's been 15 years.

2806
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:04,240
- Their chemistry is amazing.
- It's been going on for 15 years.

2807
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,970
- We have guests today.
- We have guests?

2808
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:08,840
- We have three guests.
- Really?

2809
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:09,840
We have many guests.

2810
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,640
- Please come.
- Who is it?

2811
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:12,810
- Who is it?
- Okay!

2812
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:14,950
- It's Kim Ha Neul.
- Kim Ha Neul.

2813
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:16,350
- Hello.
- Okay!

2814
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:18,350
- Hello.
- It's Woo Hyun.

2815
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:20,250
- Hello.
- Ha Neul.

2816
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:22,620
Why... Jun Young.

2817
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:26,630
(She said the famous line,
"You are a student. I'm a teacher.")

Ha Neul. It's been so long.

2832
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:22,650
It's been so long.

2833
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:24,180
- Hello.
- Come to the middle.

2834
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,150
- Right.
- It's really nice to meet you.

2835
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:27,450
- Really.
- Hello.

2836
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:28,490
- What?
- Hello.

2837
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:29,960
- Goodness.
- Hello.

2838
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:31,060
Hello.

2839
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:33,960
Jun Young. What brings you here?

2840
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:35,630
- It's been a while.
- Have you been well?

2841
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:37,260
- I've been great.
- Come to the middle.

2842
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:40,030
It's been a while. Yes.

2843
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:42,640
"Weak Hero."

2844
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:45,140
Hello.

2845
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:46,910
- He dances really well.
- He dances well.

2846
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:48,040
He sings well and dances well.

2847
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,110
- He dances really well.
- You'd get shocked.

2848
01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:51,440
- But...
- He dances really well.

2849
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,810
- Jun Young was in an idol group.
- Yes.

2850
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:54,810
We know!

2851
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:56,480
Of course, he dances well.

2852
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,650
- That's...
- "Man Man Ha Ni."

2853
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:58,720
I was in a group,
but I don't dance well.

2854
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,220
He sang "Man Man Ha Ni."

2855
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:02,590
- U-KISS.
- Do you think I'm that easy?

2856
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:04,960
You were a singer, Jun Young?

2857
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,760
- I was a singer.
- Really?

2858
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,760
- I didn't know.
- He was in U-KISS.

2859
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:11,130
I didn't know.
Why didn't you tell me?

2860
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:12,530
I'm sorry.

2861
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:14,470
- U-KISS.
- You Quiz.

2862
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:16,400
You Quiz is my show.

2863
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,470
- U-KISS.
- He was in U-KISS.

2864
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:20,240
- I say, "You quiz?"
- U-KISS?

2865
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,710
- He was in U-KISS.
- He was in U-KISS.

2866
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:23,540
- He was in INFINITE.
- INFINITE.

2867
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:25,350
- This is Ha Neul.
- Sky.

2868
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:27,810
Anyway, we have three guests today.

2869
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,080
Hello.

2870
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:31,250
- But...
- This is nice.

2871
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:33,020
- You...
- Aren't you from the same office?

2872
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:34,390
- Yes.
- Right?

2873
01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:35,490
Really?

2874
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:37,460
- That's why everyone came today.
- Right.

2875
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,960
- Their office supported them.
- Right.

2876
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,230
There are so many people here
from your office.

2877
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:42,460
Where?

2878
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:43,760
They're all here.

2879
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,700
Didn't you come
with around ten people?

2880
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,600
- That's right.
- This would be a loss.

2881
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:49,740
- Around ten people.
- Your office will become poor.

2882
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:51,470
The hallway was packed.

2883
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:52,640
- Right.
- Really?

2884
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,270
- Yes.
- Of course.

2885
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:57,910
It's your first time on Running Man,
Ha Neul.

2886
01:27:57,910 --> 01:28:00,450
Yes. I thought
I had been here before.

2887
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:02,720
- I know, right?
- It's been so long.

2888
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,650
- How did you not come even once?
- Right. I hadn't come.

2889
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:05,990
It's really nice to meet you.

2890
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:07,820
- It's so nice to meet you.
- This is so fascinating.

2891
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:09,620
It's nice to meet you.
I always saw you on TV.

2892
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:11,490
- I'm a real fan.
- I'm a real fan.

2893
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,130
It's like I'm looking
at a celebrity.

2894
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,060
But there really are such people.

2895
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,360
Have you been rejecting
our invitations?

2896
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,730
I guess my company rejected them.

2897
01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:20,270
Right.

2898
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:22,140
Ha Neul may not know.
Her company may have done that.

2899
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:24,970
They all use their company
as their excuse.

2900
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:27,440
It's not an excuse. It may be
because of the image of her role...

2901
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,740
That's how actors are.

2902
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:29,840
- Seriously.
- What's wrong with you?

2903
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,180
- Normally...
- Ha Neul isn't like that.

2904
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:34,410
They all say they didn't know,
but they were all informed.

2905
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:36,150
- But...
- I really didn't know.

2906
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:37,150
That's how it is.

2907
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:39,190
- She really didn't know.
- I know.

2908
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:42,690
It's okay, Ha Neul.
You can be honest about it now.

2909
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:45,190
Your company also doesn't know
that you come here like a beggar.

2910
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:46,230
A beggar?

2911
01:28:46,230 --> 01:28:48,730
- Please leave us, beggar.
- We feel embarrassed.

2912
01:28:48,730 --> 01:28:50,730
We're filming right now.
Please leave us.

2913
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:52,170
You're wearing rags.
How are you a celebrity?

2914
01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:54,200
Hey! What did you say?

2915
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,340
Please leave, beggar.

2916
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:58,340
- We're filming.
- There's a show.

2917
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:00,340
A show? All right.

2918
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:04,140
It looks like you're appearing
on variety shows more than before.

2919
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:06,450
- Really?
- Is there a particular reason?

2920
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:09,650
I actually really like
variety shows.

2921
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:12,350
- I watch almost all the shows.
- Really?

2922
01:29:12,350 --> 01:29:15,220
But I wasn't called that much.

2923
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:17,960
When we cast people,
we have to see them somewhere...

2924
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:20,030
- to know they're available.
- They've started appearing.

2925
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:22,200
I think I can appear
on many others after this.

2926
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,230
- That's so nice.
- Kim Ha Neul!

2927
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:25,630
She's open!

2928
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:26,930
- Kim Ha Neul is open!
- Nice.

2929
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:29,970
Did you prepare impersonations
or acrostic poems?

2930
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:31,740
- Or a dance.
- An acrostic poem...

2931
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:32,840
with Running Man.

2932
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:34,740
You should at least do
the leg dance.

2933
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:36,080
Or roll your eyes back.

2934
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,540
Something like this.

2935
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,680
You have to show us.

2936
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:42,720
I'll slowly show you later.

2937
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:43,720
She's open.

2938
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:47,490
Let's move on to Jun Young now.

2939
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:48,790
Jun Young really dances well.

2940
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:49,760
He's really good.

2941
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,360
- He dances really well.
- He's really good.

2942
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,830
He won first place...

2943
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:55,030
- in a dancing competition.
- Show us, Jun Young.

2944
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:56,130
- A freestyle dance.
- Please show us.

2945
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:57,530
- Let's first see...
- Show us.

2946
01:29:57,530 --> 01:29:58,970
Jun Young's freestyle dance.

2947
01:29:59,330 --> 01:30:00,630
- He's really good.
- Is the floor okay?

2948
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:01,730
He has a light body.

2949
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:04,270
It's already cool.

2950
01:30:04,270 --> 01:30:05,300
He's warming up.

2951
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,740
Will we see Ha Neul's next?

2952
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,040
Let's see it next.

2953
01:30:08,210 --> 01:30:10,540
- We should see her leg dance.
- We should definitely.

2954
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:13,350
(The music plays.)

2955
01:30:13,550 --> 01:30:15,820
That's nice.

2956
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:17,020
That...

2957
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:21,450
(What?)

2958
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:25,220
(His shyness is gone.
He starts dancing like crazy!)

2959
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:28,590
(He's very serious.)

2960
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,760
He's determined!

2961
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,800
What's that?

2962
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:36,940
(Moving swiftly)

2963
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:38,500
- That's amazing!
- That's right!

2964
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:41,970
(Finger whip)

2965
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:44,480
What is up with him?

2966
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,750
He's really doing his best.

2967
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,980
(It was a high-quality performance
from a dance competition winner.)

2968
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:51,520
What is suddenly happening?

2969
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,850
- Hey.
- What is that?

2970
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:54,590
(He finishes on the beat.)

2971
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:56,920
(He goes on with the energy.)

2972
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,360
- Jun Young!
- You danced really well!

2973
01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:01,490
- That's so amazing.
- What was that?

2974
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:02,830
- Were you a dancer?
- Hey.

2975
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:05,500
- He danced to the rhythm like this.
- Why didn't you tell me?

2976
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,170
- It was hip.
- I told you he dances well.

2977
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,370
(This is just electrocution.)

2978
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:10,840
I've always been seeing this.

2979
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,510
(He is just being electrocuted.)

2980
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:14,140
- Jun Young.
- Jun Young.

2981
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,680
- A dancer.
- He won the dance competition.

2982
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,280
- Hey.
- The winner.

2983
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,440
What is this?

2984
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:20,510
You're so cool.

2985
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:22,880
He dances so well, but he's shy.

2986
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,150
- He's shy?
- He sings well too.

2987
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:25,180
- That's a charming point.
- He's got everything.

2988
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:26,720
Jun Young sings well, acts well...

2989
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,860
- He acts well.
- From "Weak Hero..."

2990
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,790
- He's good-looking too.
- Right.

2991
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:33,160
It's been a while
since we last saw Woo Hyun.

2992
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,190
It's been a while, Woo Hyun.

2993
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:36,130
- "Be Mine."
- You haven't changed.

2994
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:37,730
- He does musicals.
- Right.

2995
01:31:37,730 --> 01:31:38,900
- He does a lot of musicals.
- Yes.

2996
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:39,930
I released a new album too.

2997
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:42,100
- Right. It came out.
- I also do variety shows.

2998
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:43,270
I'm working hard.

2999
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:44,470
It is "Dangerous."

3000
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:46,410
- That's right.
- We know that.

3001
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:47,670
He recently...

3002
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:49,140
made a comeback as a solo artist...

3003
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:50,410
- Right.
- With his fifth album.

3004
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,480
The lead track is "Straight."

3005
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,510
"Straight."

3006
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:55,180
- "Straight." He only goes straight.
- It sounds nice.

3007
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:58,120
- It's coming out on July 30.
- I see.

3008
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:59,920
- It's not released yet.
- Can you show us a little?

3009
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,690
- Of course.
- Please show us.

3010
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:02,720
"Straight."

3011
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,920
Do you have stuff like this?

3012
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:07,590
Woo Hyun is...

3013
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:09,730
You know what?
Woo Hyun is from Suyu-ri.

3014
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:10,930
- I know.
- Really?

3015
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:12,230
- Suyu-ri.
- Yes, I'm 1 of the top 3.

3016
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,730
- Who are the top three?
- Yu Jae Seok,

3017
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:16,170
Nam Woo Hyun, and Jee Seok Jin.

3018
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:17,670
(Number 1)

3019
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:18,770
(Number 2)

3020
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:19,810
(Number 3?)

3021
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:20,870
- He's...
- That's not it.

3022
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:21,910
He hasn't been so popular lately.

3023
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:23,240
Seok Sam isn't one of them.

3024
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,880
- Seok Sam is number three now.
- Seok Sam doesn't count.

3025
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:28,410
- Seok Jin is the 3rd.
- He's the 3rd.

3026
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:30,420
- Why am I the third?
- He's annoyed by everything.

3027
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:33,050
All right. Music, please.

3028
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:35,520
(He starts singing
his new song, "Straight.")

3029
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:40,860
(It goes straight to the highlight.)

3030
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,600
- My goodness.
- Nice.

3031
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,400
(Only go straight)

3032
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,470
(I go straight toward you)

3033
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:48,530
- Amazing.
- His singing...

3034
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,270
(There's no U-turn)

3035
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:53,610
(The starting line
is already too far away)

3036
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:56,680
- He's so good.
- You're amazing.

3037
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:58,510
(Singing live in the morning
is no big deal...)

3038
01:32:58,510 --> 01:32:59,910
(for the main vocalist of INFINITE.)

3039
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:05,220
(I'll end up reaching
the finishing line, which is you)

3040
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:06,720
- I like the song.
- It's nice.

3041
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:07,790
It's a great song.

3042
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:09,160
You're the best.

3043
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,660
- I love your song.
- It's really nice.

3044
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:13,130
- It's a great song.
- Hey.

3045
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:14,330
Thank you.

3046
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:15,490
It's great.

3047
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:17,260
His live performance is amazing.

3048
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:18,260
- I know.
- It was nice.

3049
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,000
Please sing "Be Mine."

3050
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,670
- It's INFINITE's hit.
- I'll sing "Be Mine."

3051
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:22,940
- "Be Mine."
- You'll grab it?

3052
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:24,670
"Be Mine." I should do this.

3053
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:26,870
- We should.
- This is what we should do.

3054
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:28,640
I love this song.

3055
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:29,680
Woo Hyun does everything we ask for.

3056
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:30,880
- I love it.
- I'm so thankful.

3057
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,910
- He does anything.
- Is he singing the song live?

3058
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:34,850
Three, two, one.

3059
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:37,820
(Be mine)

3060
01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:39,520
This is great.

3061
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:43,490
(This song that he has sung
a thousand times)

3062
01:33:43,490 --> 01:33:45,390
(He still sings it passionately.)

3063
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:50,460
(Jun Young seems to have
mixed feelings at this moment.)

3064
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:53,770
(He has a feeling
that U-KISS will be next.)

3065
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:55,800
(Feeling anxious)

3066
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,070
(Singing passionately
without knowing how he feels)

3067
01:33:59,870 --> 01:34:02,640
(Kim Sky is just happy.)

3068
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:10,720
(The perfect performance
of the idol senior is over.)

3069
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,790
- The live performance...
- Woo Hyun.

3070
01:34:12,790 --> 01:34:14,250
- It's really nice.
- Woo Hyun's live performance.

3071
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:16,120
- He's still got it.
- Gosh, Woo Hyun.

3072
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:18,490
He can pull it off right away
even in the morning.

3073
01:34:18,490 --> 01:34:19,560
- Yes. Sure.
- It was no joke.

3074
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,560
- He's really something.
- You're...

3075
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,830
He's so nimble.

3076
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:23,160
- He sings so well.
- He's really something.

3077
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:24,460
Please perform "Man Man Ha Ni."

3078
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,500
- Please perform "Man Man Ha Ni."
- Right away.

3079
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:28,470
Let's go!

3080
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:29,670
(It's his turn as he expected.)

3081
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:30,670
Jun Young.

3082
01:34:31,370 --> 01:34:32,610
- Let's go.
- There you go.

3083
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:35,670
(Since he joined the team late,)

3084
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:38,310
(he probably didn't have
many chances to perform this song.)

3085
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:42,650
- Do you think I'm that easy?
- You should dance.

3086
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,120
- You should dance.
- Dance!

3087
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:47,920
(It seems like it's his first time
performing "Man Man Ha Ni" alone.)

3088
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:52,320
(Hey!)

3089
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,590
(Shy)

3090
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:56,330
This is crazy.

3091
01:34:58,930 --> 01:35:02,300
(Though he's shy,
he does everything he should do.)

3092
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:04,200
- That was nice.
- It's a great song.

3093
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:05,810
- I love it.
- Okay.

3094
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,540
You can be like that...

3095
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:08,840
- because it's been a long time.
- Good.

3096
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:11,240
After Jun Young danced,

3097
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,180
Ha Neul keeps swallowing hard.

3098
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:14,350
By the way...

3099
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:16,320
- You should do something.
- I wasn't thinking of anything.

3100
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:18,250
When will Ha Neul get to perform?

3101
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:19,450
- Ha Neul should do it too.
- She feels pressure.

3102
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:20,650
Why are you doing this to me?

3103
01:35:20,650 --> 01:35:21,890
Ha Neul should...

3104
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:23,520
To be honest, we can let her
sing three songs.

3105
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:25,860
- A medley.
- Do you know me?

3106
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:27,990
- "Straight,"
- "Straight."

3107
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:29,900
- "Be Mine," and "Man Man Ha Ni."
- "Be Mine."

3108
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:31,760
- She can do anything.
- What's your favorite song?

3109
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,170
Aren't we going to see
her dog leg dance?

3110
01:35:33,170 --> 01:35:34,300
- What?
- My dog leg dance?

3111
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:37,500
- Ha Neul, are you going to be okay?
- You mean, the dog leg dance?

3112
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,940
Please play the song...

3113
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:40,370
that Jun Young danced to earlier.

3114
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:42,510
We will play
something intense for you.

3115
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:43,580
- Okay.
- Which one?

3116
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:45,040
- What should I do?
- This is how you survive here.

3117
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,480
- What do I do? For me?
- That's good.

3118
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:47,510
- Something hip.
- Why?

3119
01:35:48,210 --> 01:35:49,820
This is a variety show.

3120
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:54,120
(Wiping)

3121
01:35:54,690 --> 01:35:57,120
(The stage is ready.)

3122
01:35:57,790 --> 01:35:58,890
I can't do this.

3123
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:02,190
(What?)

3124
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:05,930
(She's really dancing.)

3125
01:36:06,370 --> 01:36:08,170
(After dancing some random moves,)

3126
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:10,600
(she shows the dog leg dance.)

3127
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,240
(Satisfied)

3128
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,840
(Kim Sky is showing off
her dancing spirit.)

3129
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,040
Ha Neul, you should do this.

3130
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,310
- You should do this too.
- The hands, too.

3131
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:20,880
Do you know me?

3132
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:21,910
- I don't know.
- Do you know me?

3133
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:23,180
(She claps her hands with him
in anger.)

3134
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,250
"Do you know me?"

3135
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:25,950
Why did you do that
when you didn't know her?

3136
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:27,390
I can't just ignore her.

3137
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:28,590
That was nice.

3138
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:30,460
She said, "Do you know me?"

3139
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:31,860
- "Do you know me?"
- "Do you know me?"

3140
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:33,160
- "Do you know me?"
- She was furious.

3141
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,390
"Do you know me?"

3142
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:36,660
- "Do you know me?"
- "Do you know me?"

3143
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:37,900
- I...
- I didn't know her.

3144
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:39,870
This is
what I was expecting to happen.

3145
01:36:39,870 --> 01:36:41,230
Right. "Do you know me?"

3146
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:42,800
What do I do?
Is it okay to be funny?

3147
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,600
(Kim Sky, who was born to be funny,
is let loose.)

3148
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:46,070
(The penalty goes to Se Chan!)

3149
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:48,240
(What are you doing?)

3150
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:50,840
(The dog leg dance
was just the beginning.)

3151
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,880
(Ambitionist Kim Ha Neul tries
to be the queen of variety shows.)
