00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,180
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,950
(Running Man)

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,150
Hello.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,020
(Running Man in Tongyeong)

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,050
So, this is the Tongyeong I've only heard about.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,850
We're finally here.

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,850
- This is my first time here. - Let's first meet the guest...

8
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,850
(A special guest...)

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,320
who comes to mind when you think of Tongyeong.

10
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,220
(for their trip to Tongyeong)

11
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,630
(Tongyeong Bomber, Heo Kyeong Hwan)

12
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,090
I spoke with the mayor of Tongyeong.

13
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,160
- With the mayor? - If you spend...

14
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,360
(The basic rules for the trip to Tongyeong)

15
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,890
more than the basic budget,

16
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,930
one more member will get a penalty.

17
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,130
(More members will get the penalty if they exceed the budget.)

18
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,170
- You have to spend money on a trip. - Right.

19
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,970
But if you enjoy the romance,

20
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,240
(They have 1 member exempted if they post a romantic photo.)

21
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,500
you can have the extra money you spend deducted.

22
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,540
Can I have seafood ramyeon?

23
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,570
- I want seafood ramyeon too. - Sea pineapple, please.

24
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,010
(The members lost their reason, relying on romantic photos.)

25
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,170
- Two raw mackerel. - You should order some fish.

26
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,740
(They spent 130 dollars.)

27
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,780
- What's the point of saving money? - This is really good.

28
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,680
- Thank you. - Is it 30 dollars?

29
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,310
(They even overspent, with Tongyeong's son on their backs.)

30
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,350
- How much is it per kilogram? - How much?

31
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,580
(They spent 190 dollars.)

32
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,210
- That's so cheap. - That's a good deal.

33
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,280
I hope we get a nice romantic photo.

34
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,050
(The only thing they could trust was the romantic photo judgment.)

35
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,620
- Yes. - Seriously.

36
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,990
- Votes for "It's romantic..." - Let's deduct 50 dollars.

37
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,320
It surpassed the other by a landslide.

38
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:55,360
(It turned out to be romantic.)

39
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,560
So we'll say that it's romantic.

40
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,660
It surpassed the other by a landslide.

41
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,830
So we'll say that it's romantic.

42
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,930
Since the number decreased by one, five people will take the penalty.

43
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,960
(The current number of members to get the penalty is 5.)

44
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:57,960
- Great. - Okay!

45
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,660
- Let's hurry up and eat. - Okay.

46
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,200
You'll make dinner with tuna.

47
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,230
(Today's main ingredient, big tuna)

48
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
- Okay. - That sounds good.

49
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,100
- You can make three dishes. - That sounds very delicious.

50
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,570
(Menu: Tuna steak, tuna sushi, fresh tuna and kimchi stew)

51
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,040
- We can make that. - We'll make kimchi stew.

52
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,510
(Jae Seok, Haha, Jong Kook, in charge of tuna and kimchi stew)

53
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,510
- That's right. - Let's do it together.

54
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,280
We have a reliable chef.

55
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,610
(Se Chan, in charge of tuna sushi)

56
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,450
I feel reassured.

57
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,310
- You have to make rice. - I have to make rice?

58
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,380
(Seok Jin, in charge of rice)

59
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,450
- How many cups are those? - I don't know.

60
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,450
- Just do it then. - I'll just do it.

61
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,350
How about the steak?

62
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,130
(Daniel, Ji Hyo, in charge of steak)

63
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,260
All right. This is for the tuna steak.

64
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,430
- What is that? - I'm making skewers. I'll roast it.

65
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,830
- Which dish are you making? - Which dish are you making?

66
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,890
- A braised dish. - A braised dish?

67
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,700
- Then you need the back meat. - Then you need the back meat.

68
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,900
(The braised tuna and radish that no one asked to make)

69
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,300
- There's chili pepper. - Why are you making fried squid?

70
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,070
It's a local specialty.

71
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,140
(And even fried cuttlefish and fried oyster)

72
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,440
Why are we making so many dishes?

73
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,740
(They got carried away and came up with too many dishes.)

74
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,610
- Hey. - Why are there so many dishes?

75
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,380
What dishes are we making?

76
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,750
Let me tell you. Sushi, kimchi stew with tuna,

77
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,880
- Okay. - tuna steak, raw oysters...

78
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,550
(They have 7 dishes to make. Fried cuttlefish and sushi,)

79
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,750
Fried oysters, fried cuttlefish, and braised radish.

80
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,220
(braised tuna, raw tuna, oysters and fried seafood, tuna skewers,)

81
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,590
(tuna steak, fresh tuna and kimchi stew)

82
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,820
(Can they manage to make all those dishes?)

83
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,520
We have more people coming other than us, right?

84
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,420
Are we cooking for the production crew as well?

85
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,630
(Main dishes: Tuna and kimchi stew, tuna steak, tuna sushi)

86
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,090
- Okay. - That's a lot.

87
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,660
(Additional dishes: Braised tuna, fried oyster, fried cuttlefish)

88
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,160
Haha.

89
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,560
We should begin. With kimchi...

90
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,230
(They make the fresh tuna and kimchi stew first.)

91
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,760
Do we have kimchi?

92
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,630
- Kimchi is here. - Okay.

93
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,940
I'll stir-fry kimchi, and...

94
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,840
(He starts by looking for the kimchi first.)

95
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,570
- It's hard to make the stew. - Then...

96
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,940
We should cut the kimchi.

97
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,680
(First)

98
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,840
Cut the kimchi. Then?

99
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,210
(Preparing the ingredients comes first.)

100
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,650
Stir-fry it. Don't we need to cook tuna with it?

101
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,820
We should add some fish sauce and stir-fry it.

102
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,620
(But the pot is already so hot.)

103
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,890
Yes. Add some green onions.

104
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,760
This is burning. We should hurry.

105
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,960
Ji Hyo. Then, with this...

106
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,430
- Hey. - We will stir-fry it, so...

107
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,900
The ingredients aren't ready yet. Hang on.

108
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,470
You can't add oil now. It will be a disaster.

109
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,670
(He just dumps in the oil.)

110
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,270
Hurry and give me the ingredients.

111
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,610
I can't give them to you when they are not ready.

112
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,810
Hey, where is it?

113
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,140
(From now on, if there's any more delay,)

114
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,010
What, Jae Seok?

115
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,850
(it will be turned into fried kimchi.)

116
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,310
- Don't you have green onions? - Here. It's over there.

117
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,580
(The time-attack mission begins.)

118
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,310
This is for the steak.

119
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,750
Why do you need them? They are onions.

120
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,520
- I need onions. - Okay.

121
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,450
(He steals the onions that Daniel cut up.)

122
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,190
What's that?

123
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,190
What are you cooking?

124
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,720
- Cuttlefish. - Cuttlefish?

125
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,260
- Cuttlefish. - Cuttlefish?

126
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,490
(He puts in the onions he stole.)

127
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,260
Daniel...

128
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,560
Don't you need more onions? Is that enough?

129
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,430
- It'd be good to have more. - Yes. The pot is good.

130
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,560
Give me more onions.

131
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,630
- Onions. - Ji Hyo.

132
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,330
- Slice onions and green onions. - Okay.

133
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,940
(A task that struck like lightning)

134
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,130
Watch your fingers, Ji Hyo.

135
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,900
Daniel, this...

136
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,740
- I need to stir-fry kimchi. - Okay.

137
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,270
Can you cut the kimchi for me? You're wearing gloves.

138
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,670
(Daniel prepares the kimchi.)

139
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,370
- Kimchi? - Yes.

140
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,610
- Kimchi. - Cut the kimchi for him.

141
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,580
(In a rush, he slashes the kimchi.)

142
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,210
- Cut the thin, leafy part. - Okay.

143
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
I need this too.

144
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,780
Hey.

145
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,220
- Hurry and bring it. - We should hurry.

146
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,420
Get me some green onions.

147
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,090
- I have green onions here. - Green onions!

148
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,360
(He screams while facing forward when she is behind him.)

149
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,090
Here are the onions.

150
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,630
This is crazy.

151
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,290
- Gosh, this is... - Are you putting it in already?

152
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,860
- No, green onions. - Put it in.

153
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,930
(Luckily, the pot is cooled down with the kimchi.)

154
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,960
- Chili powder... - Do you need more kimchi?

155
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,870
- Haha, do you need more? - Give me some more.

156
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,470
How many servings are you making?

157
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,040
Here... I think...

158
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,640
the production crew will eat it, so...

159
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,310
How many servings is it?

160
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,080
- Hey. - Maybe about 20 servings?

161
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,810
(They are preparing ingredients based on the size of the pot.)

162
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,510
Thanks.

163
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,940
This is the rice.

164
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,450
Green onion.

165
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,620
(A giant kimchi grave)

166
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,620
- Done. - Do you want me to cut potatoes?

167
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,850
This is perfect.

168
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,580
This much?

169
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,250
(They match it for now and add the seasonings.)

170
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,250
- We need this much. - Right.

171
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,390
(Adding gochujang)

172
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,890
And finally, chili powder.

173
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,120
We're not adding Cheongyang chilies, right?

174
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,890
(Adding chili powder)

175
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,260
- Should we add some? - If we add them,

176
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,420
it will be spicy. Is it okay?

177
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,890
- And some of it... - What else did you ask for?

178
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,160
- That thing. - Chilies?

179
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,660
(And sesame oil?)

180
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
Yes.
Chilies?

181
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,900
- Chilies and potatoes. - It is tasty this way.

182
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,400
(After adding a full circle...)

183
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,070
- You need chilies? - We need some sesame oil.

184
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,740
(Adding more sesame oil?)

185
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,310
My gosh. Now, the fire is quite strong.

186
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,710
- That's enough. - The fire is quite strong.

187
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,810
- Se Chan. - It smells good.

188
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,440
(A savory smell)

189
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,850
I think we should put more sesame oil in.

190
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,420
(Adding it according to his gut)

191
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,220
We have to add chicken stock to make it delicious.

192
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,390
(This time, chicken stock?)

193
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,490
For flavor enhancer.

194
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,790
- I'll add just a little. - Okay.

195
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,800
- What's that? - Chicken stock.

196
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,800
(Each one of them is a tasty ingredient.)

197
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,360
That's enough.

198
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,970
You should taste the flavor.

199
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,500
(How will the fresh tuna and kimchi stew turn out?)

200
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,170
It smells good.

201
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,740
The kimchi stew smells nice.

202
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,570
I'm suddenly getting attached to the kimchi stew.

203
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,870
This kimchi stew is...

204
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,040
Add some water.

205
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,140
(After stir-frying the ingredients, they add water.)

206
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,880
- Pour in the water. - Call me to your place.

207
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,650
Seok Jin. I don't think we have enough rice.

208
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,150
- Pour all of it. - About this much.

209
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,750
I will add more water after boiling it down.

210
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,020
It's okay if all other dishes fail.

211
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,690
(Full of confidence)

212
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,220
This will be great.

213
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,050
- Add some tuna. - Yes.

214
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,460
(It is time to add the tuna.)

215
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,790
- Add tuna? - The fatty part?

216
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,420
- Haha. - Give me three pieces.

217
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,460
- This. - Okay.

218
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,490
- You can use this. - I'll give this to you.

219
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,300
- I'll take what I need. - Se Chan.

220
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,230
(Fresh tuna is usually eaten sparingly.)

221
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,560
- You need this? - This is the belly.

222
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,170
Okay.

223
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,700
I'm putting the tuna in.

224
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,670
(Today, the finest tuna is added into the kimchi stew.)

225
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,570
With tuna fat...

226
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,600
- How much is this worth? - Right. It will be fatty.

227
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,640
What's that?

228
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,870
Gosh, this is the belly.

229
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,110
- What? - Put it in.

230
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,110
- Belly. - Are you putting it here?

231
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,310
- It looks great. - It's crazy, right?

232
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,350
We're using the belly meat? My goodness.

233
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,720
(The luxury kimchi stew is possible only because they are in Tongyeong.)

234
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,750
It tastes better with some fat.

235
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,120
I think this kimchi stew is worth about 300 dollars.

236
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,020
I've never made kimchi stew with fresh tuna before.

237
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,650
(Excited)

238
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,520
(With a lot of sesame oil and fatty tuna belly)

239
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,090
Look at the color.

240
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,590
(How does the kimchi stew taste?)

241
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,860
You should try it.

242
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,670
I think we added too much oil.

243
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,040
Really? But we will add more water.

244
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,640
(Sure enough, the soup is too greasy.)

245
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,710
It's a little...

246
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,510
- I think it's too much sesame oil. - Then...

247
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,310
- I was going to add water. - But...

248
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,150
Is it rich?

249
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,780
(Speechless)

250
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,050
(He can't quite react.)

251
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,650
We can make it better. Do we need more kimchi?

252
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,890
- No. Kimchi is enough. - What about kimchi juice?

253
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,890
- Is it good? - Do you like it?

254
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,460
(Daniel volunteers to taste it.)

255
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,500
Why?

256
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,100
(Greasy)

257
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,330
- Isn't it good? - This is amazing.

258
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,100
Is this right?

259
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,230
- I don't know. - Seriously, Jae Seok...

260
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,840
Why? What's wrong?

261
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,470
- I don't think this is right. - It doesn't taste right?

262
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,110
- It's not bad. - Let me see.

263
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,210
(Jong Kook, who can even stomach stones, tries it.)

264
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,210
- It's not bad. - Jong Kook.

265
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,410
- You should try it. - I'll try it.

266
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,580
- Where is it? - It's not bad.

267
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,640
I'll try it.

268
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,780
- I can tell once I taste it. - He means, we need...

269
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,980
- something with a kick. - Something savory?

270
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,180
It's a little...

271
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,390
- I think it's a little greasy. - This is...

272
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,250
- It's not bad. It's okay, but... - Haha...

273
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,520
- added too much sesame oil. - Sesame oil?

274
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,060
(A rushing flavor of sesame oil)

275
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,720
- My gosh. - Jae Seok.

276
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,290
So, this is how it feels.

277
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,260
It's like a dish from a Korean restaurant overseas.

278
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,060
- Exactly. - You know what I mean, right?

279
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,700
This feels like that. That's because...

280
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
he added chicken stock.

281
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,130
(Haha did.)

282
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,400
That's right.

283
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,170
This is what I tried at a Korean restaurant in Manchester.

284
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,610
It's somewhat buttery.

285
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,940
It tastes good.

286
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,780
(They can taste Mrs. Ok Jung's cooking.)

287
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,110
- Haha. - This is good enough.

288
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,480
- Jae Seok. - It tastes like a dish...

289
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,710
- made by an overseas Korean. - Right.

290
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,910
You said it was a Korean in LA.

291
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,250
But it doesn't taste like LA.

292
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,710
Korean food in LA is good.

293
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,250
- "Korean food in LA is good." - LA is good.

294
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,180
(He defends LA in the midst of it all.)

295
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,290
Why did you add chicken stock?

296
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,990
(An exotic kimchi stew that was made in Tongyeong)

297
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,090
That's why it tastes like kimchi stew in a foreign country.

298
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,760
Then you should act like you're eating in a foreign country.

299
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,690
You know what I mean, right?

300
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,900
It's like a Korean restaurant in Europe, right?

301
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,370
It's not spicy at all.

302
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,230
(He tries to think of a way to save it.)

303
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,530
- We have chilies. - We should add Cheongyang chilies.

304
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,700
- Did you add them? - We have chilies.

305
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,770
Just one.

306
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,710
- It shouldn't be too spicy. - Okay.

307
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,940
(Adding a touch of Korean spiciness)

308
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,410
I think it will be better with some kimchi juice.

309
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,210
(Adding kimchi juice)

310
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,780
Right. We should add that.

311
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,280
- Should we add more? - We should add garlic.

312
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,710
Garlic? Okay. We need garlic.

313
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,980
Hang on. I'm...

314
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,180
- working on garlic now. - We need a lot.

315
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,720
(Adding everything that will cut the greasiness)

316
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,620
- About that much. - We don't have much.

317
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,950
That would be enough.

318
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,020
(Adding garlic)

319
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,320
Wait. I'll bring some more.

320
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,920
Do we have more garlic?

321
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,120
Garlic? Hang on.

322
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,090
Where should I place the garlic?

323
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,500
(They are putting the taste together with the tip of their tongue.)

324
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,530
Jae Seok, we should boil it more...

325
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,930
- Garlic? - to bring out the taste.

326
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,230
That's enough garlic.

327
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,900
Didn't we add ramyeon soup base before?

328
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,810
We are good at cooking now.

329
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,110
About this much?

330
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,510
Add some more.

331
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,780
- More? - We need this.

332
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,040
(Beef artificial flavoring)

333
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,110
We need more.

334
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,410
We're so good.

335
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,250
(They still add MSG when they are pressed.)

336
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,250
We're so good that it's not fun anymore.

337
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,350
We need at least this much.

338
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,920
We are good at cooking now.

339
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,950
It's okay.

340
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,450
We don't need ramyeon soup base anymore.

341
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,320
(Will they be able to save the taste of the kimchi stew?)

342
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,620
It's good. Okay.

343
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,660
The sauce...

344
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,190
(Amidst the swamp of kimchi stew)

345
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,960
I'll make it now.

346
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,460
What if I fail? I don't know when I'll come again.

347
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,300
(One man obsessed with his own cooking)

348
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,530
(Actually, Kyeong Hwan is a hidden cooking expert.)

349
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,740
(He's been on numerous cooking shows.)

350
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,840
(His skills have been recognized by Chef Lee Yeon Bok.)

351
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,110
Can't you make braised fish with tuna too?

352
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,140
Braised fish is good too.

353
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,110
(He suggested a dish he didn't have to make.)

354
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,940
- We could braise the big piece. - Hey, braised tuna sounds good too.

355
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,910
- Or soybean braised tofu. - Can you do that?

356
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,450
I can do that if I have to.

357
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,450
(Confident)

358
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,020
He's a good cook.

359
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,580
(A good opportunity to secure more airtime)

360
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,880
- You should make it. - Right. You do it.

361
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,890
- Kyeong Hwan. - Yes.

362
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,120
(Will he finally be a star made by Running Man?)

363
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,590
- Please make it delicious. - All right.

364
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,820
Please.

365
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,320
I'll make it delicious. Where is it?

366
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,530
All right.

367
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,060
(That's how he starts cooking the dish no one asked for.)

368
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,270
All I need to do is slice it.

369
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,140
I should use the back meat, right?

370
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,310
- Which one? - Where are the vegetables?

371
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,910
(After skillfully preparing the ingredients,)

372
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,210
The braised fish.

373
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,910
The back meat.

374
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,450
(it is time to add tuna.)

375
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,510
What's important is...

376
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,910
All right. The guest is coming.

377
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,480
(Attention.)

378
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,750
- Hey, Daniel! - Where is it? It's here.

379
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,950
- You don't need Cheongyang chilies? - Daniel!

380
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,090
(No one cares.)

381
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,120
Where is it? There it is.

382
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:47,730
(Now, he will prepare the tuna, which will draw people's attention.)

383
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,160
I don't think I use the belly meat.

384
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,660
It will be too oily. So...

385
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,630
Four pieces would be enough, right?

386
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm putting the tuna in.

387
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,660
(Attention.)

388
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,360
We can make sushi once the rice is done.

389
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,730
The tuna steak is almost done.

390
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,670
(No one is interested, as expected.)

391
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,070
Wouldn't it be fishy?

392
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,140
(It is noisy, with everyone chatting.)

393
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,000
I haven't done this before.

394
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,910
The unique smell of tuna...

395
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,570
(The braised tuna and radish chef mutters to himself.)

396
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,510
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

397
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,080
We have one more here.

398
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,240
Braised tuna.

399
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,510
(Making braised radish instead of securing airtime.)

400
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,680
It's braised tuna...

401
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,220
First, I need to boil this down.

402
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,150
(Anyway, the braised radish will be ready once it's boiled down.)

403
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,720
I'll boil it down first.

404
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,990
The cuttlefish is really good.

405
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,660
This is such a protein-rich meal.

406
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,590
(Meanwhile, the other dishes are being completed.)

407
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,960
Should I cook more steak?

408
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,330
(Big-portioned)

409
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,330
- No. That's a lot. - Is this enough?

410
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,260
- Is this a cooking competition? - No.

411
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,200
You know what?

412
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,600
I've cooked on many TV shows,

413
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,040
(Daniel's tuna steak is almost ready as well!)

414
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,400
- but this is a first for me. - Right.

415
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,810
I've never done this with tuna before.

416
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,940
This is a first for me too.

417
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,340
- Thank you. - We will take 20 dollars worth.

418
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,140
(The cuttlefish and raw oyster they bought at the market)

419
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,720
(Chef Yang deep-fries them.)

420
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,020
(A technique for making batter stick)

421
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,820
The fried food sounds great.

422
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,690
The sizzling sound.

423
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,490
(Now, he puts in cuttlefish.)

424
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,500
The cuttlefish is really good.

425
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,430
It's very chewy.

426
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,230
Right? It is really chewy.

427
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,470
(All made with their own excitement...)

428
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,770
(A feast of additional dishes)

429
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,270
This looks amazing.

430
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,970
How many chefs do we have today?

431
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,070
- Daniel is also good. - We have reliable chefs.

432
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,480
How much of your cooking is done?

433
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,710
(Current cooking progress)

434
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,280
The fried oyster and fried cuttlefish are ready.

435
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,980
(Braised tuna and radish: Done once it's boiled down.)

436
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,380
(Tuna sushi: Done once the rice is done.)

437
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,910
We can make sushi once the rice is done.

438
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,220
The rice will be done in ten minutes.

439
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,980
(Fresh tuna kimchi stew: Done once the seasoning is right.)

440
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,420
It's done once it's boiled down.

441
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,190
The rice should be done.

442
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,950
(The rice is the most important part.)

443
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,520
Don't worry about the rice. Don't open it!

444
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,620
You're not opening it.

445
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,560
Don't worry about the rice. Don't open it!

446
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,690
You're not opening it.

447
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,760
- He's sensitive. - I was startled.

448
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,560
(Rice Papa is touchy.)

449
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,230
What are you doing? You startled me.

450
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,100
- I thought you were opening it. - I checked the temperature.

451
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,270
It's here.

452
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,540
The rice should be done.

453
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,810
(Rice is the essence of sushi.)

454
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,740
Seok Jin. Once the rice is done...

455
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,140
- You should add this. - What?

456
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,840
How are you cooking rice?

457
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,910
(Will the rice be cooked well?)

458
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,810
You can come and try some.

459
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,850
I'm full from tasting the food.

460
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,750
(He doesn't look so good.)

461
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,220
We got full after tasting all the dishes.

462
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,090
Why isn't the rice cooked? That's strange.

463
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,690
- Is the rice ready? - No.

464
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,790
(In a hurry)

465
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,260
Will you go over there?

466
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,290
What's wrong with the rice?

467
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,390
Just wait a little longer.

468
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,030
- What's wrong with it? - It looks like porridge.

469
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,830
(The rice is still raw?)

470
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,230
The rice at the bottom is still raw. What's going on?

471
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,730
This is different from what I make at home.

472
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,370
How do you cook rice at home?

473
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,070
I use a rice cooker. But this is...

474
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,240
It will be done if you wait.

475
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,940
(Claiming loudly)

476
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,370
Just wait a little more.

477
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,980
Just trust me. Seriously.

478
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,510
(Jae Seok leaves.)

479
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,650
The rice is in serious trouble now.

480
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,680
(His inner thoughts)

481
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,910
Seok Jin, is the rice too hard?

482
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,450
No. It's just that the water isn't enough.

483
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,180
I can make it work.

484
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,220
I did it before.

485
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,590
Isn't it for sushi?

486
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,860
(Will he miraculously save the rice like he did before?)

487
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,960
It will work.

488
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,430
Please be good, rice.

489
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,600
The rice...

490
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,330
It's still raw rice.

491
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,030
Good. That's enough.

492
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,340
(Meanwhile, the kimchi stew was brought to a boil for a while.)

493
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,240
I should check the fire.

494
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,570
I'm getting full just from tasting the food.

495
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,080
I've now lost my sense of taste.

496
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,650
- Is it good? - I'd pay 1,000 dollars for this.

497
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,550
(Chef Yang comes over out of curiosity.)

498
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,780
It's tasty.

499
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,220
- Try it. - Yes, try it.

500
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,220
(The resident chef confirms the kimchi stew.)

501
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,460
There's no way this isn't tasty.

502
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,190
(Did they manage to save the stew?)

503
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,030
There's no way this isn't tasty.

504
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,200
- It's good. - It's good.

505
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,830
(They saved it.)

506
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,330
It's really good.

507
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,200
- It's good. - It's tasty.

508
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,770
(The kimchi stew makers can finally relax.)

509
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,440
- My gosh, this... - It's really good.

510
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,270
(They finish the kimchi stew that was made with fresh tuna.)

511
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,570
You won't believe it.

512
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,610
Check out that chunk of tuna.

513
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,070
Look at that tuna.

514
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,180
- Even tuna belly went into that. - Check out this tuna.

515
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,610
Imagine how much this would cost.

516
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,950
This kimchi stew would cost about 300 dollars in a restaurant.

517
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,420
(Real tuna kimchi stew with fresh tuna meat)

518
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,050
There's fresh tuna in there.

519
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,080
- Wait. - Is there another bowl?

520
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,420
Haha, give that to the staff.

521
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,160
(They share the first bowl with the staff.)

522
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,020
- Is there another one. - Do you have spoons?

523
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,220
- This is enough for one more bowl. - Don't let any of it go to waste.

524
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,320
We need to scoop all of it, down to the last drop.

525
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:47,930
(Elegant flavors that warm you as they hit the back of your throat.)

526
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,840
I wouldn't mind just having the kimchi stew.

527
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:54,570
(Today's main dish ended on a happy note.)

528
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,150
Isn't this a stew?

529
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,450
- It'll soon be ready. - How can you call this braised?

530
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,650
Isn't this a stew?

531
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,390
(Is the real issue with another dish?)

532
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,050
- It'll soon be ready. - How can you call this braised?

533
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,620
Will the broth boil down?

534
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,220
(The braised dish is not being braised.)

535
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,920
It's still being cooked. The broth has to boil down.

536
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,690
- When will it boil down? - What's the matter with you?

537
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,760
Hold on.

538
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,160
It's practically a soup. When will this boil down?

539
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,330
When will this all boil down?

540
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,430
- It's a soup. - It'll be ready...

541
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,530
when the rice is done.

542
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,630
Don't worry.

543
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,130
(Kyeong Hwan's braised radish is only making him cower.)

544
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,230
- Will this boil down? - Yes, of course.

545
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,940
I just have to turn up the heat and boil it down.

546
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,640
(The braised tuna and radish only had to be boiled down.)

547
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
I'll boil it down.

548
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,310
(After tasting it...)

549
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,380
(More sauce)

550
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,040
(More water)

551
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,610
(Some more sauce)

552
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,850
(Some more water)

553
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,120
(He was under so much pressure...)

554
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,820
I might quietly ruin this dish.

555
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,620
(that he felt he needed to do something to the braised radish.)

556
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,920
- This is bad. - Isn't this a soup?

557
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,760
- It'll soon be ready. - How can you call this braised?

558
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,030
- You see... - Isn't this a stew?

559
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,730
Once everything else is ready...

560
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,200
(It became tuna stew.)

561
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,160
- Will it be ready on time? - Yes.

562
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,860
Once the flames die down a bit...

563
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,130
- Can I place this on there? - This is perfect for a barbecue.

564
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,700
Can I put this here?

565
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,500
On the side. There you go.

566
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,870
(In his urgency, he takes it to another heat source.)

567
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,440
This is great. We're almost done.

568
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,770
(Will Kyeong Hwan's braised radish turn out okay?)

569
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,480
This must be why we eat out instead of cooking.

570
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,320
(The old man's pithy remark)

571
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,310
This must be why we eat out instead of cooking.

572
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,750
- This is why... - I mean it.

573
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,690
- I'm exhausted just from cooking. - I'll be too tired to eat.

574
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,320
- Is this a feast? - How many mouths are we feeding?

575
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,660
Don't bother too much.

576
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,030
(The result of cooking extra dishes when no one asked them to...)

577
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,660
- Why are we cooking a feast? - This will take five hours.

578
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,300
If we take any longer, this might turn into breakfast.

579
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,830
- That could happen. - That's possible.

580
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,560
Seok Jin, what's going on with the rice?

581
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,070
(Still, aside from the braised radish,)

582
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,570
The rice is almost done.

583
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,730
- Is it? - Yes.

584
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,170
(everything will be ready once the rice is done.)

585
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,930
Let me try some.

586
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,200
- The rice is done. - Let's see.

587
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,270
(Just before, it was raw rice with crunchy grains.)

588
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,170
- Can I check the rice? - Sure.

589
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,570
Get some on here first.

590
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,410
- Get some on here first. - Sure.

591
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,780
(Did Rice Papa conjure a miracle again?)

592
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,510
I bet it's cooked.

593
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,010
- Right? - What? It's...

594
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,380
- It's a bit wet, but it's fine. - Yes, it's fine.

595
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,020
- I doubt you can make sushi. - Why's that?

596
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,190
- Is it too mushy? - It's too mushy.

597
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,720
- I doubt you can make sushi. - Why's that?

598
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,190
(The rice is too watery to add vinegar water.)

599
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,090
- Is it too mushy? - It's too mushy.

600
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,460
The rice is done.

601
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,660
It's a bit wet and mushy, but...

602
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,700
It's slightly mushy.

603
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,600
It's still edible.

604
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,000
Don't bother making sushi then.

605
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,100
- What? No sushi? - No sushi?

606
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,870
- We'll eat it with the fish. - Eat the fish on the side.

607
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,740
We'll just eat the raw fish like a wrap.

608
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,610
- We should do that. - We'll just eat it as a side dish.

609
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,640
- Yes, let's do that. - Sounds good.

610
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:17,110
(They finally agree to make it DIY sushi.)

611
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,780
- I like it. - A DIY sushi.

612
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,050
Wouldn't the rice dry a little once the water evaporates?

613
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,980
- Okay, then. Let's set the table. - Sure.

614
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,480
We need to clear everything here.

615
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,620
(Just when things were almost ready...)

616
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,950
- Everything was cooked fast. - I know.

617
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,690
I'm back!

618
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,660
- Ye Eun! - Hey, you're back.

619
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,760
- Ye Eun, you're back! - How are you feeling?

620
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,660
(Ye Eun thankfully recovered after getting an IV drip.)

621
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,930
- Are you okay? - I feel great now.

622
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,090
- That's a relief. - Are you back to full health?

623
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,630
- Totally. - Are you feeling much better?

624
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,060
Don't I look better too?

625
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,570
- Yes, you look prettier. - Let's look at you.

626
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,630
- What a relief. - You're right.

627
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,400
- Do I look prettier? - Your complexion is way better now.

628
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,770
Her face looks alive again.

629
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,740
(Strong)

630
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,270
- Ye Eun. - What can I do?

631
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,310
- It's okay. - Just sit and eat.

632
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,310
We're all done, so you only have to eat. Take a seat.

633
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,640
- Food Fighter returned... - Yes.

634
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,840
- just as we were about to eat. - Goodness.

635
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,510
Why don't we clear this table and eat here?

636
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,580
Let's clear this table.

637
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,580
- I'll do that. - I'll then serve the rice.

638
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,620
Clear the table.

639
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,050
(They're setting the table 2 hours after cooking began.)

640
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,420
I'll now serve the rice.

641
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,290
This... Wait. Where should we put this?

642
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,720
The process was a struggle,

643
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,690
but I still managed to cook the rice.

644
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,790
(He scoops the rice, which he dragged to success.)

645
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,590
- Did you cook it in that pot? - I did, and...

646
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,860
Ji Hyo, the tuna steak looks incredible.

647
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,660
(Ji Hyo's fresh tuna steak)

648
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,660
- Seriously. - The tuna steak looks insane.

649
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,000
- Ji Hyo's tuna steak looks amazing. - Look.

650
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,200
(Daniel's chopped tuna steak)

651
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:13,270
This scene will boost the ratings.

652
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,940
(Se Chan's fried cuttlefish and fried oysters)

653
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,140
Se Chan, the fritters look delicious.

654
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,140
These oysters taste amazing.

655
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,840
Everything looks good.

656
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,180
(They all came together to willingly go through the trouble...)

657
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,840
- This looks good. - Good job, everyone.

658
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,380
Gosh, this looks amazing.

659
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,110
Look at what we prepared.

660
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,180
(and create the Tongyeong feast.)

661
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,850
We cooked with everything we had.

662
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,450
Everything looks good. No way.

663
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,850
- What a sight. - I know.

664
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,860
When will the braised radish be ready?

665
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,490
(By the way)

666
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,660
- Unbelievable. - Will it be done by today?

667
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,030
(It is boiling down all night.)

668
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,790
- The braised radish is all done. - I'm most excited for this dish.

669
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,660
(Did the braised tuna and radish boil down nicely?)

670
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,300
You learned from Chef Lee Yeon Bok himself.

671
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,670
- Here it comes. - No way!

672
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,040
- The braised radish is done. - Look at that.

673
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,610
- That's insane. - This looks good.

674
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,610
- Are you sure this is braised? - Isn't this a soup?

675
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,010
- The broth is too clear. - You see,

676
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,410
(The braised radish has too much water.)

677
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,710
the stove wasn't as strong as I would've liked.

678
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,350
Why is the broth so clear?

679
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,120
- I couldn't boil it down. - Hold on. Kyeong Hwan?

680
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,280
- Yes? - You and Running Man...

681
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,520
just don't click.

682
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,490
- I rarely fail when cooking. - I mean...

683
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,360
(He gave it his all, even betting on being invited back.)

684
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,020
He messed up his dish.

685
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,420
I can't afford to mess this up.

686
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,060
Who knows when I'll be on Running Man again?

687
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,030
- Come on. - It's not a failure.

688
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,090
Take some for now.

689
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,830
- Try it first. - Why is it so...

690
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:14,730
(Will Kyeong Hwan be able to come back to Running Man?)

691
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,030
We should try it.

692
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,400
- Let's see how tasty it is. - Let's see.

693
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,940
Sometimes, dishes turn out differently than you expect.

694
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,900
Do you have your rice? Haha, do you have your rice?

695
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,210
It's all right.

696
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,310
(It's all right.)

697
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,370
- Kyeong Hwan, dig in. - Sure.

698
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,940
- It's a little bland. - Join us.

699
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,480
- It's a little bland, right? - It's tasty, but...

700
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,850
If only I had boiled this a bit more.

701
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,680
It's bland. It needed to be boiled down some more.

702
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:33,550
(His reappearance is left undecided.)

703
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,880
What a bummer.

704
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,850
This reminds me of "Family Outing."

705
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,150
You're so right.

706
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,990
(It's now really time to dig in.)

707
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,290
This is good.

708
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,660
- No way. - This is tuna right here.

709
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,860
(Chunks of tuna the size of tofu are in the kimchi stew.)

710
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,030
We added fresh tuna.

711
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,830
Who puts fresh tuna in kimchi stew?

712
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,130
We normally add canned tuna.

713
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,270
- The kimchi stew is incredible. - Anything strong.

714
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,240
The kimchi stew is incredible.

715
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,070
- The kimchi stew! - I love the kimchi stew.

716
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:57,270
(Kimchi stew with fresh tuna can't possibly taste bad.)

717
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,710
The tuna in the kimchi stew is to die for.

718
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,040
No way.

719
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,380
Hey, check this out.

720
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,850
(A huge chunk of tuna)

721
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,220
- This is tuna. - My gosh.

722
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,120
Okay, here we go.

723
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,390
(It's delivered to Ssaebssaeb.)

724
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,020
(He opens wide and eats everything in one mouthful.)

725
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,560
No way.

726
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,330
(A mouth full of tuna)

727
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,600
(Jong Kook tries the DIY sushi.)

728
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,330
Take some of this,

729
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,470
and place it on the rice.

730
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,400
(Wasabi on rice)

731
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,100
(Gulping)

732
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,640
Then, take a slice of tuna.

733
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,840
- You now have your sushi. - Look. Like this.

734
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,840
- This is delicious. - See?

735
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,210
(A pretty convincing tuna sushi is made.)

736
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,380
Check this out.

737
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,980
(It's really sushi.)

738
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,310
- You have your sushi. - Like this...

739
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,810
- That's DIY sushi. - The tuna tastes amazing.

740
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,020
(Satisfied)

741
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,790
Everything's delicious.

742
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,790
The fritters are incredible.

743
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,490
(A gourmet party in Tongyeong begins.)

744
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,190
The fritters are tasty.

745
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,670
- I should try one of these. - Goodness.

746
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,370
- DIY sushi. - The fritter tastes great.

747
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,140
- Is this an oyster? - Yes.

748
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,100
Fried oysters don't need a dip.

749
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,240
(Trying one of Chef Yang's fried oysters)

750
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,240
It's edible.

751
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,040
(Deep-fried oyster: It's edible.)

752
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,650
Try the tuna steak.

753
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,050
(Mine)

754
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,880
- That doesn't have any color. - It's better than you think.

755
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,220
- The color matters. - Kyeong Hwan, this and...

756
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,820
(The color looks bland, but how will it taste?)

757
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,590
- I don't lean toward it. - Try it with this dip.

758
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,560
I'll try it since Daniel made this.

759
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,820
It tastes peculiar.

760
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,390
- But it's not bad, right? - It's not.

761
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,560
(Tuna steak: Not something that can be tasted in Korea)

762
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,390
- It doesn't taste Korean. - I'll try some.

763
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,760
(This time, they try Ji Hyo's tuna steak.)

764
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,300
I can't believe I'm about to have tuna belly steak.

765
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,270
It's just tuna.

766
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,710
(Tuna steak: It's just tuna.)

767
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,880
(While the foodies deliver their harsh criticism)

768
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,380
Doesn't the tuna taste amazing?

769
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,950
- Guys, try... - Do we have chojang?

770
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,150
- Try the braised radish. - We have some chojang.

771
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,590
(He finds a window to promote his braised radish.)

772
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,050
We have chojang.

773
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,360
(It loses miserably to the raw tuna.)

774
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,790
- Kyeong Hwan's... - We have soy sauce too.

775
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,560
- Try Kyeong Hwan's braised radish. - It just got done.

776
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,500
(They only go for the raw tuna though.)

777
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,230
This is the best dish here. The raw tuna.

778
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,970
- This is great. - I know.

779
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,070
The raw tuna is insane. It's really sweet.

780
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,670
(The satisfying chew of the raw tuna has left him tongue-tied.)

781
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,310
- The raw tuna is delicious. - It's really good.

782
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,780
It's different.

783
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,050
(Yummy)

784
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,020
- Isn't it good? - Yes.

785
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,650
- The raw tuna is the best. - I know.

786
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,120
(Writer)

787
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,520
What's the best dish?

788
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,220
Currently? The raw tuna.

789
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,560
(The raw sliced tuna is the best dish right now.)

790
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,630
The raw tuna is unbeatable today.

791
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,090
Raw tuna is in 1st place, and the kimchi stew is in 2nd.

792
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,500
- Meanwhile, the rest... - If I'm being honest, I mean.

793
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,500
So much for all the fuss that went into the cooking.

794
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:37,430
(They cooked a variety of dishes, but the raw tuna tastes the best!)

795
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,900
Hold on a second.

796
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,970
- Kyeong Hwan. - Yes?

797
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,540
Why aren't you eating the dish you cooked?

798
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,570
(The braised radish)

799
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,570
- This... - Well...

800
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,610
- It's too bland. - I'm disappointed in myself.

801
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,080
If only you had given me a little more time.

802
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,650
- More? - More time?

803
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,820
- You had two and a half hours. - Was this meant for tomorrow?

804
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,690
(It would have tasted better tomorrow.)

805
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,520
We had three hours to cook.

806
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,620
It just wouldn't come together.

807
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,620
The rice is seriously undercooked.

808
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,260
(Next, they attack Rice Papa.)

809
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,460
- Seriously. - The rice is just...

810
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,830
The rice is undercooked. I might get a stomachache.

811
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,100
Some of the rice is mushy while...

812
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,400
Can undercooked rice give you a stomachache?

813
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,170
The rice will expand a bit...

814
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,630
- by morning. - That's it.

815
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,130
There's too much undercooked rice.

816
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,300
(Mumbling)

817
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,740
Eating undercooked rice won't give you a stomachache.

818
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,040
It does in my case.

819
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,540
Why were you born that way?

820
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,340
Why was I born that way?

821
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,310
(Outraged)

822
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,040
- Seok Jin, that's... - But I...

823
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,910
Guys, before we go to sleep tonight, the KBS comedians should gather...

824
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,480
(Thanks to ruining dinner, the KBS comedians will have to gather.)

825
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,020
- behind caravan number three. - Hold on.

826
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,720
The message has been delivered.

827
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,690
I'll announce when and where later on.

828
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,250
(The senior)

829
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,690
I mean it. I need a word with the ones...

830
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,260
who cooked the rice and braised radish.

831
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,660
I've had it with the KBS comedians today.

832
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:42,330
(Still, thanks to the fresh tuna, they finished a filling meal.)

833
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,300
Everything worked well together.

834
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,500
- The combination was great. - This was great.

835
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,770
I finished my bowl of rice.

836
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,270
Okay, let's do this.

837
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,000
(The members gathered again after a break.)

838
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,500
- Let's do this. - Sure thing.

839
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,110
Two people need to sit out front.

840
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,170
This looks like fun.

841
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,040
(The two seats are separate.)

842
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,310
- Yes. - Right?

843
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,880
- Okay. - No. Heo Kyeong Hwan...

844
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,410
(The writer tells Kyeong Hwan and Se Chan to sit there.)

845
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,510
- and Yang Se Chan can sit there. - Okay.

846
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,880
- Why? - We'll explain.

847
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,350
(Only Kyeong Hwan and Se Chan are sitting separately?)

848
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,980
I guess there's something.

849
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,420
It's for the Empty Heads.

850
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,080
What are you talking about?

851
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,120
Okay!

852
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,690
Some of you may have had your eyes on the caravan rooms...

853
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,390
you want to sleep in when you checked earlier.

854
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,760
You can only sleep in the four rooms you've seen.

855
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
- What? - What?

856
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,030
Do we have to sleep together?

857
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,230
(So it's not 1 person per room?)

858
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,030
We can only sleep in four rooms?

859
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,700
- What does that mean? - Aren't they single rooms?

860
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,630
- I see. - I see.

861
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,630
There is a four-person room.

862
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,270
I see. There is a four-person room.

863
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,770
I like this. I like being with people.

864
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,440
(Each of the 4 rooms has a limited number of people allowed.)

865
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,670
(Luxury single room)

866
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,540
There's a luxury single room with a double bed, living room,

867
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,280
(A terrace where you can enjoy the ocean view...)

868
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,640
and a terrace.

869
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,840
(the moment you open your eyes)

870
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,110
You have to sleep in a single room today.

871
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,410
(Luxury single room)

872
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,410
There's a good room here.

873
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,480
A luxury single room.

874
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,820
(A spacious shower area exclusive to single rooms)

875
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,690
There's a bathroom inside. It's almost like a house.

876
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,420
(A luxury single room with a double bed)

877
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,660
(Standard single room)

878
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,360
A standard single room with just a double bed.

879
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,660
(It's smaller than the luxury single room,)

880
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,660
The standard room is also nice.

881
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,230
I also like the standard single room.

882
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,230
(but you can sleep alone in the standard single room.)

883
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,230
It's amazing.

884
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,800
This place is amazing.

885
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,860
(3-person room)

886
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,770
A three-person room with a double bed and a sofa bed.

887
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,230
(The 3-person room has 1 bed...)

888
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,130
When you set up the sofa bed,

889
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,900
(and 1 sofa bed.)

890
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,970
it becomes a bed.

891
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,470
There's a four-person room with a large bed and a bunk bed.

892
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,270
(The 4-person room has a double bed....)

893
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,540
(and a bunk bed next to the bathroom.)

894
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,340
It feels so tight.

895
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,080
This is so-so.

896
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,480
(4-person room)

897
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,280
You shouldn't sleep in the 4-person room today.

898
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
You'll snore.

899
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,720
Seok Jin wants the luxury single room or...

900
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,920
I want to sleep in either of the top two options.

901
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,590
(The eldest wants a single room.)

902
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,590
I'm also fine with a standard room. I just need it to be a single room.

903
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,930
(4-person room with a bunk bed and a standard bed)

904
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,860
I'm sorry, but the four-person room with a bed and a bunk bed.

905
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,160
There are 2 pillows. Does that mean 2 people will sleep there?

906
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,300
(A bunk bed)

907
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,570
- That's right. - There are only two beds?

908
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,630
(Angry)

909
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,130
How can adults sleep in such a tight space?

910
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,170
- He's getting angry again. - It looked...

911
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,470
- It's about being romantic. - You're not living there forever.

912
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,470
- It's just one day. - One day.

913
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,640
- Still... - Haha, today...

914
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,880
It can't be helped.

915
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,180
Right. That's how the game works.

916
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,850
- "That's how the game works." - That would create the differences.

917
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,580
(Agreeing immediately)

918
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,420
How will you separate the men and the women?

919
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,720
- It doesn't matter. - Men or women? We're all members.

920
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,790
You don't separate men or women here.

921
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,390
- Right. We all... - It's because...

922
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,960
- slept together in "Family Outing." - I have a member I like here.

923
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,130
Kyeong Hwan can sleep in his house.

924
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,560
- That's right. - Yes.

925
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,660
You can sleep there.

926
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,800
(He suggests sleeping at his parents' house in Tongyeong.)

927
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,030
- Sleep at home. - You can sleep at home.

928
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,700
Can you go home during the recording?

929
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,140
- I'll come back in the morning. - Right.

930
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,770
(He can commute.)

931
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,810
We'll start the mission to decide the selection order of the rooms.

932
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,840
- Okay! - Okay.

933
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,510
The mission is called Typing Empty Heads.

934
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,680
The official Empty Head of Running Man, Se Chan,

935
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,180
and the guest Empty Head Heo Kyeong Hwan...

936
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,980
The guest Empty Head is a bit...

937
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,280
But Kyeong Hwan is a bit educated.

938
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,080
- I know. - He looks like he'll do well.

939
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,920
(Is Kyeong Hwan, who is a guest, also Empty Head?)

940
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,050
- I know the basics, but suddenly, - He's not that ignorant.

941
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,590
(During the pre-interview)

942
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,060
the writer gave me a quiz.

943
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,320
I couldn't answer it because it was sudden.

944
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,960
She called me an Empty Head and left.

945
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,260
I said, "What?" She just called me an Empty Head...

946
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,530
(The staff member judged him to be Empty Head.)

947
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,530
- and left. - She just left.

948
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,070
- We don't know... - I didn't know.

949
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,570
- Kyeong Hwan's situation. - We don't know.

950
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,600
We don't know his intelligence level.

951
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,670
- We don't know Kyeong Hwan. - We don't know.

952
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,540
- What did she ask? - We know each other's level.

953
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,400
(What did the writer ask?)

954
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,870
One question we asked him earlier...

955
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:40,110
(The writer asked him about the Donghak Peasant Revolution.)

956
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,670
was the person who participated in the Donghak Peasant Revolution.

957
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,680
He said General Gang Gam Chan.

958
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,680
- He's not good. - He's not good.

959
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,110
(Answer: Jeon Bong Jun)

960
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,980
- I wanted to be funny. - You don't know him?

961
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,050
You know who it is, right?

962
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,510
- I do. - Who is it?

963
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,780
It's Brother Bong Jun.

964
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,620
Brother?

965
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,090
- I know him. - What's his surname?

966
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,790
Come on, Jong Kook.

967
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,720
Jeon?

968
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,390
- Jeon Bong Jun. - That's right.

969
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,260
(The official Empty Head knows the full name.)

970
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,390
That's right.

971
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,130
You're smarter...

972
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,400
- You didn't know, right? - than him.

973
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,430
So the two Empty Heads will only see the answer...

974
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,870
and type the question.

975
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,600
The other members will read the question...

976
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,510
- Only the answer? - as they type...

977
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,970
- and guess the answer. - That's nice.

978
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,270
- For example, - We know their level.

979
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,280
if the answer is Dok Island,

980
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,410
- Right. - they'll type things...

981
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,510
- related to Dok Island. - Okay. Nice.

982
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,910
The members will read it...

983
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,280
- and answer, "Dok Island." - All right.

984
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,550
- That sounds fun. - Then, "southeast of Ulleung..."

985
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,780
- That's it. That's how it's done. - Can I write...

986
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,980
"along the sea route southeast of Ulleung Island for 78km?"

987
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,350
- That's right. - That's easy.

988
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,690
The member who answers correctly earns one point.

989
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,390
- The person who answers it right... - This is going to be fun.

990
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,720
- will say whose question... - This is going to be fun.

991
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,060
- they answered from. - It'll be hard for me.

992
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,760
- You have to be honest. - That person also gets a point.

993
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,430
- Nice. Okay. - The question giver.

994
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,370
How many characters per minute can you type?

995
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,500
Me? Four hundred characters.

996
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,640
I'm really quick.

997
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,240
(Ssaebssaeb can type fast.)

998
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,540
I worked at the public service center.

999
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,370
(During his social service)

1000
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,410
- Really? - At the public service center.

1001
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,540
(Kyeong Hwan did a lot of typing at the public service center.)

1002
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,180
- Public service center. - Public service center...

1003
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,580
- City hall public service center. - Really?

1004
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,450
(The 400-wpm typing champion versus a former public service worker)

1005
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,880
Do you type well?

1006
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,050
The typing speed isn't important. Grasping the gist...

1007
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,350
of the word is important.

1008
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,150
- You should know what it is. - Okay, nice.

1009
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,690
They wouldn't know, anyway.

1010
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,990
- Even if I don't know, - Okay, I got it.

1011
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,390
(Even if Empty Heads don't know the answers,)

1012
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,990
I can make it a brain teaser.

1013
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,220
- Okay. - If it's difficult,

1014
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,220
- Okay. - I'll make it a brain teaser.

1015
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,090
(they succeed if they can get them to answer correctly.)

1016
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,560
- Make it a brain teaser. - Okay.

1017
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,630
- A brain teaser. - Let's do this.

1018
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:08,800
(Who will use a single room?)

1019
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,630
- Okay. The standard... - Let's do this.

1020
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,460
Let's aim for the standard single room.

1021
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,260
- Let's go to the standard single. - Let's go.

1022
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,800
- Let's go. - Let's go to the standard single.

1023
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,470
(He's nervous.)

1024
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,070
Let's aim for the standard single room.

1025
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,370
Please. I want to win it too.

1026
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,710
- Let's begin with the first one. - We can't see the answer.

1027
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,240
(Answer: Big Mac Index)

1028
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,410
You can't answer it, Jae Seok.

1029
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,980
(An economic indicator that compares prices and exchange rates...)

1030
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,880
- Okay. - Then...

1031
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,410
- The answer. - At least get the two-person room.

1032
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,220
(by converting each country's Big Mac price into dollars)

1033
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,150
- Seok Jin can't answer this time. - You can't answer it, Jae Seok.

1034
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,250
(How will he explain this general knowledge question?)

1035
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,220
- I can answer it. - At least...

1036
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,860
- I can answer it. - At least...

1037
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,090
(Do you know McDonald's?)

1038
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,090
McDonald's?

1039
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,390
- I know it. - What is that?

1040
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,630
(He brings up the hamburger place.)

1041
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,060
- Hamburga... - What is that?

1042
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:42,000
(I really like it.)

1043
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,160
Hamburga...

1044
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,600
- It is... - It is...

1045
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,670
(He's typing as fast as a stenographer.)

1046
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,270
- quite high in calories. - quite high in calories.

1047
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,270
Let me answer.

1048
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,540
(I really like it, but it is quite high in calories. BLACKPINK...)

1049
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,510
Do you know...

1050
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,670
- What? - I really like it, but...

1051
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,510
(It's hard to understand his explanation.)

1052
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,180
- It is... - It is...

1053
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,980
- quite high in calories. - quite high in calories.

1054
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,450
- You can't answer it, Jae Seok. - I can answer it.

1055
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,720
(Meanwhile, Kyeong Hwan)

1056
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,480
- Do you know... - McDonald's?

1057
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,450
(Typing)

1058
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,550
- I know it. - What is that?

1059
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,990
(He's typing in English.)

1060
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,950
Do you know McDonald's?

1061
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,060
- I know it. - What is that?

1062
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,890
(R,T hamburga)

1063
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,490
- I know it. - What is that?

1064
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,060
Hamburga...

1065
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,030
- I really like it... - "Hamburga."

1066
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,730
(No one is better or worse.)

1067
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,260
- It is... - It is...

1068
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,030
- quite high in calories. - quite high in calories.

1069
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,870
(Hamburger?)

1070
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,970
- Let me answer. Sexy food. - Let me answer!

1071
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,100
(Incorrect)

1072
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,540
(Food Fighter approached it with food.)

1073
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,140
- Let me answer. Sexy food. - Let me answer!

1074
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,970
- It's big... - Let me answer! Big Mac!

1075
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,110
- Big Mac. - Let me answer! I know this.

1076
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,780
(Incorrect)

1077
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,710
Can I answer?

1078
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,510
(He knows it's about Big Mac!)

1079
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,310
- Big Mac. - Let me answer! I know this.

1080
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,020
I know this.

1081
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,650
Can I answer?

1082
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,090
- Let me answer. - Let me answer!

1083
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,650
(Did he figure out the answer?)

1084
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,490
- Let me answer. - Let me answer!

1085
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,490
Big Mac Index. Okay.

1086
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,820
(Correct)

1087
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,860
- Gosh... - Gosh. Big...

1088
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,760
Big Mac Index. Okay.

1089
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,290
(Kim Jong Kook is correct.)

1090
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,430
Big Mac Juice?

1091
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,660
(An economic indicator that compares prices and exchange rates...)

1092
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,500
This... Wait, hey!

1093
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,170
(by converting each country's Big Mac price into dollars)

1094
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,900
(It's a one-dimensional approach...)

1095
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,840
Big Mac Juice?

1096
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,500
(that surprises even the person who got it right.)

1097
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,670
Whose did you look at to get it right?

1098
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,410
(Se Chan!)

1099
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,410
His.

1100
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,510
(Se Chan: 1, Jong Kook: 1)

1101
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,380
He types really quickly.

1102
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,280
(Dongducheon Stenographer put his chat-typing skills to use.)

1103
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,220
I type quickly.

1104
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,790
Why did you type, "Do you know McDonald's" for Big Mac Index?

1105
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,150
- It has Big Mac. - It has Big Mac.

1106
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,150
That's right, but...

1107
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,620
It's not McDonald's. It's Big Mac. Right. It's Big Mac.

1108
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,920
(Why did he write "BLACKPINK" then?)

1109
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,690
- It's Big Mac. - That's right.

1110
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:17,730
- BLACKPINK's Jisoo? - Yes.

1111
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,760
(BLACKPINK: Jisoo)

1112
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,430
- You explain well. - That was nice.

1113
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,000
- You explain well. Se Chan is good. - That was good.

1114
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,430
You explain well.

1115
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,970
- You explain well. Se Chan is good. - That was good.

1116
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,540
McDonald's BLACKPINK.

1117
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,600
(Ssaebssaeb broke down the word and scored first.)

1118
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,800
He's good.

1119
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,840
- That was funny. - Let's go.

1120
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,240
(The second question)

1121
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,510
Seriously.

1122
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,980
(Answer: Toegye Yi Hwang)

1123
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,580
That was easy.

1124
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,010
(This person....)

1125
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,720
(is someone's son.)

1126
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,190
(Answer: Toegye Yi Hwang)

1127
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,260
- This person... - This person...

1128
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,460
That was easy.

1129
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,060
(One thousand won bill)

1130
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,560
- This person... - This person...

1131
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,360
- Let me answer! Ji Ye Eun. - Let me answer!

1132
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,590
- Yulgok Yi I. - Ji Ye Eun.

1133
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,760
(The critical keyword was "1,000 won bill.")

1134
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,100
- This person... - This person...

1135
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,460
- Let me answer! Ji Ye Eun. - Let me answer!

1136
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,270
- Let me answer. Yulgok Yi I. - Yulgok Yi I.

1137
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,430
(Yulgok Yi I is incorrect.)

1138
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,500
- Let me answer! - Ji Ye Eun.

1139
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,970
- Let me answer! - Ji Ye Eun.

1140
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,240
- Toegye Yi Hwang. - Correct!

1141
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,370
(Correct)

1142
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,870
- Goodness. - I was going to...

1143
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,570
- You went with the 1,000 won note? - I was...

1144
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,070
I guessed it from seeing Kyeong Hwan's explanation.

1145
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,810
- Goodness. - I was going to...

1146
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,580
(Kyeong Hwan wrote the essence in four syllables.)

1147
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,450
You went with the 1,000 won note?

1148
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,080
(Kyeong Hwan: 1, Se Chan: 1, Jae Seok:1, Jong Kook: 1)

1149
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,680
I guessed it from seeing Kyeong Hwan's explanation.

1150
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,420
Take a break now.

1151
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,850
(Anxious)

1152
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,820
Why are you getting angry?

1153
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,620
(The single room is mine.)

1154
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,690
This is the next question.

1155
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,590
(Answer: Eureka)

1156
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,960
- What is it? - Is it something you know?

1157
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,260
(The exclamation said to have been shouted by Archimedes,)

1158
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,430
- What is it? - Is it something you know?

1159
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,590
(meaning "I found it!")

1160
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,530
- What is it? - Is it something you know?

1161
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,800
- Jae Seok. - Jae Seok.

1162
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,440
(The car Jae Seok rides)

1163
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,930
- Jae Seok... - Go on.

1164
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,130
Jae Seok found...

1165
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,970
Let me answer! Porsche.

1166
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1167
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,210
(It's another ridiculous interpretation.)

1168
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,440
- Let me... - Carnival?

1169
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,270
- Jae Seok found... - The car Jae Seok rides.

1170
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,070
Let me answer! Porsche.

1175
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,280
- What? - Car...

1176
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,080
(While everyone is clueless,)

1177
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,180
Car...

1178
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,920
(Kyeong Hwan also starts typing.)

1179
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,090
- The car Jae Seok rides. - Let me answer!

00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,990
(but it's full of typos.)

1185
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:07,600
The car Jae Seok rides. In Europe...

1186
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,570
(What is that?)

1187
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,300
(The car Jae Seok rides. In Europe,)

1188
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,110
(someone found water.)

1189
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,710
- This... - Water...

1190
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,870
- The shouting... - "This is something."

1191
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,380

- "This is something." - Let me answer!

1195
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,450
- Eureka. - That's right!

1196

00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,920
(Kim Jong Kook gets it correct again.)

1199
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,950
Let me answer! Eureka.

1200

00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,890
What is that?

1204
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,300
(Dumbfounded)

1205
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,560
- How is that eureka? - Hey.

1206
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,900
How is that eureka?

1207
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,230
What is this?

1208
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,030
Whose did you get it from? Be honest.

1209
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,400
- Me? Well... - What's "upon discovrry?"

1210
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,770
(It's ambiguous!)

1211
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,770
- Be objective. - This one.

1212
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,310
Shouting out upon making a discovery.

1213
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,880
"Shoting out upon making a discovrry?"

1214
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,540
- Hey. - I referred to both,

1215

(Laughing)

1216
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,810
but I got the answer...

1217
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,080
- from this. - "Shoting out..."

1218
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,350
"upon making a discovrry?"

- This... - What is it?

1225
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,660
- is when the land... - The land...

1226
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,660
Let me answer. Earthquake?

1227
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,060
- When the land dies... - When the land dies...

1228
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,130
It's not correct.

1229
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,860
- What is this? - Nine people?

1230
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,500
- The land dies and nine people... - Nine people?

1231
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,770
This is...

1232
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,170
- Eating rabbits. - Eating rabbits.

1233
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,440
- Eating rabbits. - What is this?

1234
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,640
- What is this? - Nine people.

1235
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,440
- Land dies and nine... - Run away?

1236
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,240
This is...

1237
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,540
- The land... - Let me answer!

1238
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,010
(Interpreting)

1239
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,580
This is...

1240
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,550
- The land... - Let me answer!

1241
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,920
Tosagupaeng.

1242
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,920
- That's right! - Tosagupaeng.

1243
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,050
(Correct)

1244
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,950
Whose was it?

1245
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,620
Let me answer! Tosagupaeng.

1246
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,390
(Jae Seok answers two questions right.)

1247
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,450
- That's right! - Whose was it?

1248
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,930
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook are answering all the questions.)

1249
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,090
Tosagupaeng.

1250
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,960
- I thought of it. - Seriously.

1251
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,490
("When the rabbit is dead, the hunting dog is cooked.")

1252
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,630
Tosagupaeng.

1253
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,330
Tosagupaeng.

1254
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,200
(It's an idiom that means to discard what is no longer needed.)

1255
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,230
- Tosagupaeng. - That's right!

1256
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,230
Whose was it?

1257
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,270
(Anticipating)

1258
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,900
- Mine, right? - Seriously.

1259
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,270
Eating rabbits and running away.

1260
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,140
(Kyeong Hwan's explanation)

1261
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,540
That's tosagupaeng.

1262
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,870
(Scoring 1 point each)

1263
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,200
- Tosagupaeng. - Hey.

1264
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:52,210
(Land: To, Die: Sa, Nine: Gu, Top: Paeng)

1265
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,310
- Oh, "To, "Sa?" - Yes, "To, "Sa."

1266
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,570
"Gu," "Paeng."

1267
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,440
You're seriously driving me crazy.

1268
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,040
- Oh, these guys are funny. - Okay, on the bottom...

1269
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,650
- Those two are so funny. - There are many...

1270
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,180
- I'm in so much trouble. - I don't know!

1271
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,120
I won't be able to sleep in my own room. Darn it.

1272
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:05,560
(Currently, only Jae Seok and Jong Kook have 2 points each.)

1273
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,850
I won't be able to sleep in my own room.

1274
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,050
- Darn it. - Me either.

1275
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,960
Gosh, I'm in trouble. I didn't get anything right.

1276
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,460
(At this rate, those two will get to have the single rooms.)

1277
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,020
I didn't either.

1278
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,730
(Proceeding to the next question right away)

1279
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,590
What?

1280
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,200
What?

1281
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,260
- Hey, just write anything. - Try it.

1282
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,730
- Hang on. What is it? - Just try.

1283
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,730
- "This person is..." - Oh, "This person..."

1284
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,170
What is this?

1285
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,870
- "This person..." - "This person is..."

1286
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,670
(Ssaebssaeb doesn't seem to know at all.)

1287
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,640
- "This person is..." - Oh, "This person..."

1288
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,810
(Then, what about Kyeong Hwan?)

1289
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,770
What is this?

1290
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,740
- "This person..." - "This person is..."

1291
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,080
Is it someone who isn't well known?

1292
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,680
- "Someone who is excited..." - "Someone who is excited..."

1293
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,950
- "and fortunate..." - Let me answer!

1294
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,950
Is it someone who isn't well known?

1295
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,680
- "Someone who is excited..." - "Someone who is excited..."

1296
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,850
- "and fortunate..." - Let me answer!

1297
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,750
- "Someone who is excited..." - "Someone who is excited..."

1298
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,790
- "and fortunate..." - Let me answer!

1299
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,890
- Sin Yun Bok! - Correct!

1300
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,920
- Okay. - What?

1301
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:42,130
(Correct)

1302
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,660
Let me answer!

1303
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,330
- Sin Yun Bok! - Correct!

1304
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,500
- What was that? - Sin Yun Bok?

1305
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,930
(They get it only now.)

1306
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,560
Hey, but...

1307
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,700
If you do it like this...

1308
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,300
- "Excited and fortunate." - I mean...

1309
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,800
(A 3-line acrostic poem with Sin Yun Bok)

1310
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,040
"Excited and fortunate."

1311
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,210
- Can you do this? - I mean, why not?

1312
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,170
If I could do this, it would be so much easier.

1313
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,180
I mean, Jong Kook, it's because you know...

1314
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,810
(He's a genius when it comes to clever tricks.)

1315
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,910
- He got it right because he knows. - I got it right because I know.

1316
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,380
Hey, "excited and..."

1317
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,780
(Kyeong Hwan: 4, Se Chan: 1, Jong Kook: 3)

1318
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,780
That's so funny.

1319
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,020
- Hey, you are... - "Excited and..."

1320
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,480
- very creative. - It's good.

1321
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,590
Hey, it's fun.

1322
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:13,190
(He's proud to have gotten his first compliment today.)

1323
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,290
- You're so intuitive. - He got it right because he knows.

1324
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,790
- I have to get one right too. - How did you know that?

1325
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,360
"Excited and fortunate."

1326
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,730
(Up next is the sixth question.)

1327
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,690
- Here's the next question. - It's hard.

1328
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,230
- Let's go. - Next question.

1329
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:24,170
(Answer)

1330
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,960
Oh, what's this?

1331
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,030
Oh, what's this?

1332
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,330
- Try it. - These guys...

1333
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,440
Oh, what's this?

1334
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,800
(Sighing)

1335
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,140
(Inhaling sharply)

1336
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,940
- Try it. - These guys are funny.

1337
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,070
"Cartoon."

1338
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,810
Oh, what's that?

1339
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,880
- "Firstborn son..." "Toy?" - "Toy..."

1340
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,180
"Story?"

1341
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,450
"In a cartoon..."

1342
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,480
- "Toy..." - "Story?"

1343
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,880
"In a cartoon..."

1344
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,580
- Let me answer! "Toy Story." - "Our..."

1345
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,890
Who was that judo athlete?

1346
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,960
A story about toys? It's not "Toy Story."

1347
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,590
- "The place he was in." - "The place he was in..."

1348
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,530
- A story about toys? - "Our judo athlete..."

1349
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,830
(A story about toys and a judo athlete?)

1350
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,790
No one has gotten it right yet.

1351
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,630
- It's Andy's bed. - Isn't it cool?

1352
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,370
(The movie exhibit where they filmed with Judo national team members,)

1353
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,270
- Do you like it? - You're cute.

1354
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:59,200
- You're cute since you're here. - Hey, with Woody, you're so...

1355
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,070
(Min Jong and Ha Yoon)

1356
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,040
A story about toys.

1357
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,640
(The answer is related to the movie?)

1358
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,370
Toyo... Story? Toy...

1359
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,740
Isn't it "Toy Story?"

1360
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,710
Let me answer! "Toy Story."

1361
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,480
(Incorrect)

1362
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,650
A story about toys?

1363
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,250
(It's not a movie title.)

1364
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,380
No one has gotten it right yet.

1365
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,650
"In English..."

1366
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,020
- "Tall people are in it..." - Oh, let me answer!

1367
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,190
"Beauty Inside."

1368
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,790
- "Tall people are in it..." - Oh, let me answer!

1369
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,520
(Tall people are in it as well as fat people.)

1370
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,690
- "Beauty Inside." - No.

1371
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,360
(Both wrote "tall people.")

1372
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,090
"Tall people are in it..."

1373
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,530
What is this?

1374
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,060
- Oh, that thing! - Let me answer.

1375
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,330
- Oh, that thing! - Let me answer.

1376
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,600
- That thing. - Pixar Mundo.

1377
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,570
(The name of the exhibition is incorrect.)

1378
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,670
- What was that? - Let me answer. That...

1379
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,940
That one. Sadness.

1380
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,340
- No. - I think I know this.

1381
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,840
(Incorrect)

1382
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,340
Well, it's the...

1383
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,010
- What is it? - Let me answer. Big.

1384
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,340
"A person's car..."

1385
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,510
(Incorrect)

1386
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,780
A story about toys?

1387
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,610
"In English, tall people are in it."

1388
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,580
- and a story about toys? - "Hanging on the back..."

1389
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,010
- Someone already said "Toy Story." - "Hanging on the back and going..."

1390
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,250
- Yes, but I don't know this! - Yes, this!

1391
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:51,050
(The explanation seems to be about the movie "Toy Story.")

1392
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,150
"Hanging on the back of a person's car..."

1393
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,450
Someone already said "Toy Story."

1394
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,790
Hey, I was right.

1395
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,920
(But "Toy Story" is not correct.)

1396
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,360
- Let me answer. "Toy Story." - Isn't it "Toy Story?"

1397
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,060
- No, it's not! - Then, what is it?

1398
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,790
Isn't it the one with Sadness and others in it?

1399
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,690
(There's an animation featuring someone in a spacesuit,)

1400
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:01,300
(and it's not that long.)

1401
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,830
Gosh, I gave you all the hints.

1402
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,300
- Let me answer! - Buzz Light.

1403
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,330
"Inside Out."

1404
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,630
- That's not it! - Let me answer.

1405
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,470
(Think it over.)

1406
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,070
"There's a cartoon where they wear space suits..."

1407
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,240
(It's not long?)

1408
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,440
"but it's not that long. Think about it."

1409
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,170
(I explained everything.)

1410
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,270
"In English, tall people..."

1411
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:13,710
(A story about toys, in English, tall people are in it, about toys)

1412
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,340
- Isn't it "Toy Story?" - No, it's not!

1413
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,680
- Then, what is it? - Isn't it the one...

1414
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,710
with Sadness and others in it?

1415
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,580
- Gosh, I gave you all the hints. - Let me answer!

1416
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,010
- Oh, dear. - "Inside Out."

1417
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,150
(Kyeong Hwan says the answer is in here.)

1418
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,550
Isn't it "Big?"

1419
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,320
- "Small, short?" - "Small, short?"

1420
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,450
Isn't it "Big?"

1421
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,150
- "Small, short?" - "Small, short?"

1422
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,390
If you're small, you're short.

1423
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,020
What are you if you're not?

1424
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,130
(What is the answer?)

1425
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,130
What is this?

1426
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,860
(Tolstoy!)

1427
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,790
What?

1428
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,830
- "Small, short?" - "Small, short?"

1429
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,930
If you're small, you're short.

1430
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:38,870
(His intention: Describing "Toy Story" and adding "tall")

1431
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,460
What are you if you're not?

1432
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,530
If you're small, you're short. What are you if you're not?

1433
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,300
- Big! - Let me answer!

1434
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,240
- Big! - Let me answer!

1435
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,010
(Answer: Tolstoy)

1436
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,840
Long Story.

1437
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,010
- Gosh, no! - Big!

1438
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,370
(Incorrect)

1439
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,940
Let me answer! Big Story.

1440
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,140
Let me answer! "The Big Short?"

1441
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,010
(Incorrect)

1442
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,780
- No, gosh! - I said "Big..."

1443
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,910
(Incorrect)

1444
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,550
- "All right." - "Don't be fluent..."

1445
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,520
- "in English." - Hey, this...

1446
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,750
He said not to be fluent.

1447
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,850
(He's writing a letter in the end.)

1448
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,620
- "Just pronounce it as is." - "Just pronounce it as is."

1449
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,290
"Just pronounce it as is..." Fluent...

1450
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,420
(Be less fluent?)

1451
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,090
Guys, you saw this clearly, right?

1452
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,890
(The writer asks them.)

1453
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,660
- Yes. - Let me answer!

1454
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:05,900
- I got it now. - They know, don't they?

1455
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,670
(Answer: Tolstoy)

1456
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,960
- "Small, short..." - Let me answer.

1457
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,560
"Tall toys."

1458
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,270
Long...

1459
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,500
- Long... - Long...

1460
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,070
"Just pronounce it as is..." Fluent...

1461
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,770
- Long... - It's 100 percent!

1462
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,110
This is the answer.

1463
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,580
- It's not "Toy Story." - It's not that.

1464
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,910
(Toy, tall, short, tall people, "Toy Story," toys, English)

1465
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,410
Let me answer.

1466
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,510
It's 100 percent!

1467
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,650
- Tolstoy. - This is the answer.

1468
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,920
(Correct)

1469
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,220
- Let me answer! - That's it!

1470
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,250
What? Hey, you...

1471
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,250
Tolstoy.

1472
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,020
(Tolstoy?)

1473
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,690
- Let me answer! - That's it!

1474
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,920
What? Hey, you...

1475
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,790
- I mean... - Tolstoy?

1476
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,820
(My goodness)

1477
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,190
- Why, you little... - Hey, Tolstoy is...

1478
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,430
- We said Tolstoy. - Listen.

1479
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,530
Why? "Toy Story..."

1480
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,730
- Hey, "Toy Story." That can... - You little...

1481
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,770
Tolstoy!

1482
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,970
- Tall people. That's right. - This one was hard.

1483
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,570
- Tall's... - They explained this like that?

1484
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,740
(Tols: Tall, Toy: Toy)

1485
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,210
- My gosh. - Oh, was that it?

1486
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,310
- Toy. Things you play with. - Hey, it's Tolstoy.

1487
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,710
(They're frustrated by each other.)

1488
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,740
Yes, Tolstoy. Toys.

1489
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,810
Gosh, Tols...

1490
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,710
Kyeong Hwan.

1491
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,080
(He guessed the answer based on Kyeong Hwan's explanation.)

1492
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,150
Tall people's toys.

1493
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,420
- It was me? - Kyeong Hwan.

1494
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,780
(Kyeong Hwan: 5, Se Chan: 1, Jae Seok: 2, Jong Kook: 3)

1495
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,450
Yes, good.

1496
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,620
(Kyeong Hwan is far ahead.)

1497
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,890
I'm shocked.

1498
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,120
- This is shocking. - Tolstoy.

1499
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,590
Hey, you guys are impressive.

1500
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,860
- Gosh, you guys... - I never even imagined this.

1501
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,860
- For real. - Those guys are...

1502
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,960
- The fact that this was Tolstoy... - Seriously, this was...

1503
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,200
- These guys are so creative. - For real.

1504
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,400
We may be Empty Heads,

1505
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,770
(Smug)

1506
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,300
but I know the basics, like English.

1507
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,870
Please keep that in mind.

1508
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,670
(The two people giving questions gain confidence.)

1509
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,800
- You got Tolstoy right. - Okay, next question.

1510
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,310
(The answer)

1511
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,940
- Is it ours? - "This person..."

1512
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,140
- "Developed." - "developed something..."

1513
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,080
(Sighing)

1514
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,610
"Developed but promised to marry?"

1515
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,850
Gosh, this...

1516
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,620
- It must be an actor's name. - "Among actors..."

1517
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,320
- "the same person?" - "The same person?"

1518
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,260
- "When it rains..." - "Old person, Year of the Dragon."

1519
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,290
"When it rains,"

1520
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,560
- "get it right." - "Get it right."

1521
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,260
- "When it rains, get it right?" - "When it rains, get it right?"

1522
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,760
- "So, people..." - "Doing it before?"

1523
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,300
- That's an engagement. - "Promise..."

1524
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,470
A wedding.

1525
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,070
- "You're a genius?" - It's an old person?

1526
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,470
- Among them... - He wrote promise...

1527
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,600
- "You're a genius." - "You're a genius?"

1528
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,940
- "The king..." - "The king..."

1529
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,340
- "What kind of marriage..." - "What kind of marriage..."

1530
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,810
Are you writing a novel?

1531
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,510
Are you writing a novel?

1532
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,650
What is this?

1533
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,620
- What? - "I will give you a prize."

1534
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,250
(He starts writing an oral tale.)

1535
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,350
"You're a genius."

1536
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,420
- "For the country..." - What is this?

1537
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,020
Is it a person's name or something?

1538
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,960
- "You have contributed..." - "For the country..."

1539
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,760
- Oh, "You have contributed." - "Marriage, explain once more..."

1540
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,760
- "Senior third..." - "Third Senior..."

1541
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,030
Do you know what Third Senior is?

1542
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,060
- No, but it's kind of like this. - "Third Senior..."

1543
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,130
"I will give you Senior third."

1544
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,630
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1545
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,240
(It seems like a nobleman who had a government position.)

1546
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,200
- "For the country..." - Seriously, what is that?

1547
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,940
(Kyeong Hwan's explanation in the meantime)

1548
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,070
What is this? "A famous old person who promised marriage."

1549
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,140
- "A very old person." - What does that mean?

1550
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,180
"Year of the Dragon."

1551
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,280
Yes.

1552
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,850
"Doing it before marriage?"

1553
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,910
- "So, people..." - "Doing it before?"

1554
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,820
Gosh, we shouldn't get these mixed up. It's...

1555
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,820
(We shouldn't get these mixed up.)

1556
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,220
"A promise you make before marriage."

1557
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,490
- "It's a person?" - "A promise and person?"

1558
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,460
- That's an engagement. - Let me answer.

1559
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,690
An engagement ceremony.

1560
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,760
(Incorrect)

1561
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,730
- Let's see. - What is this?

1562
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:53,160
(Is "marriage" the keyword?)

1563
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,290
- "Kind of marriage, explain again." - "Kind of marriage,"

1564
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,500
- "explain again." - "I'll explain again."

1565
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,070
- Explain it once more. - Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1566
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,670
(Their explanations are completely different this time.)

1567
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,170
- "For the country..." - Seriously, what is that?

1568
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,470
"You..." Wait, "a famous old person..."

1569
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,970
- "who promised marriage." - What is this?

1570
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,140
- "Marry?" - Okay.

1571
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,440
- Engagement. - "Let's marry."

1572
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,710
No, an engagement...

1573
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,410
- isn't it. - Promise. Engagement.

1574
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,980
"If the weather is bad,"

1575
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,780
"this person goes..."

1576
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,150
Let me answer! Can I answer?

1577
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,350
Jeong Yak Yong.

1578
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,280
Can I answer? Jeong Yak Yong.

1579
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,790
(Out of nowhere, Jeong Yak Yong?)

1580
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,250
Let me answer! Can I answer?

1581
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,320
Jeong Yak Yong.

1582
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,660
(This is the answer?)

1583
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,320
Whose hint did you look at to get it right?

1584
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,720
Can I answer? Jeong Yak Yong.

1585
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,160
(The answer is Jeong Yak Yong.)

1586
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,590
Whose hint did you look at to get it right?

1587
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,660
- How did you know? - Whose hint helped you?

1588
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,360
(Surprised)

1589
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,300
Oh, that's it!

1590
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,230
(What did she base her guess on?)

1591
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,470
Whose hint did you look at to get it right?

1592
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,900
Whose hint helped you?

1593
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,270
- Oh, but... - Did this person work on weather?

1594
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,640
Kyeong Hwan's hint was more...

1595
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,010
- Like a marriage of convenience. - Right? A marriage of convenience.

1596
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,110
- I kept thinking of that. - A marriage of convenience.

1597
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,180
Right? A marriage of convenience.

1598
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,340
I kept thinking of that. A marriage of convenience.

1599
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,280
- A marriage of convenience. - Yes, so Jeong Yak Yong.

1600
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,180
(A marriage of convenience...)

1601
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,850
- Right? A marriage of convenience. - Yes, so Jeong Yak Yong.

1602
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,510
(as "convenience" sounds like "jeongyak")

1603
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,550
- How can we get this right? - Gosh, a marriage of convenience.

1604
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:49,690
(She somehow managed to understand his random explanation.)

1605
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,950
Jeong Yak Yong.

1606
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,860
Didn't this person work on weather?

1607
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:57,330
(It's Jang Yeong Sil who invented the rain gauge.)

1608
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,290
Oh, that was Jang Yeong Sil.

1609
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,930
What did Jeong Yak Yong invent? What?

1610
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,360
Hey, but why...

1611
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,700
Why did you say it was an actor?

1612
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,930
- What was the actor thing about? - Well, the...

1613
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,670
There's someone who has a similar name as him.

1614
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,170
There's someone named Yak Yong on "Mom's Diary," isn't there?

1615
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,970
You said it was an actor, so I kept thinking about that.

1616
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,040
- You mean Won Hee's friend? - Yes, Jeong Seok Yong.

1617
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,210
- It's Jeong Seok Yong. - Seok Yong?

1618
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,710
(Actor Jeong Seok Yong)

1619
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,880
Gosh, I can't guess what these guys are describing.

1620
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:20,550
(Seok Jin: 0, Haha: 0, Ji Hyo: 0)

1621
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,810
- It's hard. - Nice. Okay.

1622
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,180
- Here's the next question. - I'm in big trouble.

1623
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,650
I haven't gotten anything right.

1624
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,020
- I got it now. - Gosh, I...

1625
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,250
(Even Seok Sam, who's good at quizzes, is helpless today.)

1626
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,120
I give up.

1627
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,090
How many questions are there? About 260 of them?

1628
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,120
(Answer)

1629
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,220
I know what this is.

1630
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,520
"This person also worked for the country..."

1631
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,290
- Oh, is it someone from the past? - It's someone from the past.

1632
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,330
Is it a king?

1633
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,330
"The king..."

1634
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,330
- "You're a genius." - "You're a genius."

1635
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,500
(A Genius of Joseon, Episode 2)

1636
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,470
- "The king... You're a genius." - "You're a genius."

1637
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,700
You're a genius?

1638
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,340
What else?

1639
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,170
"How can people not go..."

1640
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,640
The king calls you a genius?

1641
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,080
I know what this is.

1642
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,410
- "The king calls you a genius." - What else?

1643
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,120
- The king calls you a genius? - Let me answer.

1644
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,220
(All he writes is two words.)

1645
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,190
"Human map?"

1646
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,390
"How can people not go..."

1647
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,990
- Let me answer. - Let me answer!

1648
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,390
(Did they get it right away?)

1649
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,290
- Let me answer. - Let me answer!

1650
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,490
- Kim Jeong Ho. - That is correct!

1651
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,130
(Correct)

1652
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,560
- Kim Jeong Ho. - That is correct!

1653
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:10,270
(The Joseon Dynasty geographer who created the Map of the Great East)

1654
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,560
- What was that? - Human map.

1655
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,230
- That's right. - Oh, Kim Jeong Ho.

1656
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,500
- Human map. - Kim Jeong Ho.

1657
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,300
(Haha gets his first score thanks to the clean, simple hints.)

1658
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,900
I got it from Kyeong Hwan.

1659
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,900
Kim Jeong Ho?

1660
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,610
(Bitter)

1661
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,270
Human map.

1662
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,640
Seok Jin will end up in the four-person room.

1663
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,740
- I... - Seok Jin will end up...

1664
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,210
(He's about to get a 4-person room, let alone a single.)

1665
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,380
on the top bunk of the four-person room.

1666
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,920
I just can't think the way they do.

1667
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,720
(The next set of questions)

1668
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,150
- Let me answer. - That's not it.

1669
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,150
(Answer: Cheonmachong)

1670
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,120
- Cheonmachong. - Whose clues helped?

1671
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,420
- Go! - Let me answer.

1672
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,890
(Answer: Going back and forth)

1673
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,690
- Cross? - Going back and forth.

1674
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,060
That's correct.

1675
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,560
Let me answer. Confucius.

1676
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,430
(Only the ones who get it right keep getting more correct.)

1677
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,530
Whose clues helped?

1678
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,560
I practically spelled it out for you.

1679
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,260
(Still at 0 points)

1680
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,160
This isn't easy.

1681
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,070
It's already clear...

1682
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,700
(Let's evaluate the interim performance...)

1683
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,870
- who's in the upper ranks. - Right.

1684
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,330
(of the top and bottom players.)

1685
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,600
- There are four in the lower ranks. - Sure.

1686
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,670
Seok Jin, Ji Hyo,

1687
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,410
Ye Eun, and Haha.

1688
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,310
- Right. - Only they will keep playing.

1689
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,980
(Only the bottom 4 will play in the last round.)

1690
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,410
- Sure thing. - We'll treat you right.

1691
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,210
- Please raise your hand. - What?

1692
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,410
- Here. - Empty Heads, raise your hands.

1693
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,550
Okay, got it.

1694
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,880
Only the empty heads are left.

1695
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,620
Only those four will play.

1696
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:04,350
(The final showdown to determine who ends up last)

1697
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,850
This is so annoying.

1698
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,490
- I'll explain in detail. - Here's the last one.

1699
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:09,190
(Bernard Werber)

1700
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:06,620
I couldn't get any one of them.

1701
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,620
What?

1702
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,160
(Answer: Bernard Werber)

1703
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,630
What?

1704
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,930
What is it? Is it hard to know this?

1705
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,460
(How will he explain it?)

1706
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:14,930
- What is it? - This must be a tough one.

1707
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,700
- Overlapping... - Overlapping?

1708
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,030
- I just don't get it. - Let me answer!

1709
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,100
It's a person.

1710
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:21,970
- Let me answer! - It's a person.

1711
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:23,870
A doppelganger.

1712
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,140
- Is that not it? - No?

1713
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,610
(Incorrect)

1714
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,450
- Blueberries... - In the blueberry family?

1715
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,910
- In Europe? - In Europe.

1716
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,250
In the blueberry family?

1717
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,680
(He calls it a fruit while he calls it a person.)

1718
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,750
- What on earth? - In the blueberry family?

1719
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,390
(He has no idea.)

1720
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,750
Something that's like a fruit? Let's see where this goes.

1721
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,890
- There are two of them. - In Europe?

1722
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,560
- There are two of them in Europe? - What is this?

1723
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,560
- Is it a person? - He's been in Korea before.

1724
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,630
From Europe?

1725
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,230
Has he been to Korea before?

1726
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,260
(It's true.)

1727
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,600
("Bernard Werber Visits Korea with His Newest Release")

1728
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,960

In "The King of Fighters?"

1732
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,410
Be more specific. Is it a person?

1733
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:57,810
(Why is he suddenly mentioning a fighting video game?)

1734
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,210
- There's a character. - A character?

1735
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,340
Who sounds like a fruit?

1736
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,210
Berry, berry, blueberry. Something like that.

1737
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:05,350
Not the Japanese Kyo but...

1738
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,850
(Very serious)

1739
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,320
- Not the Japanese Kyo but... - I know!

1740
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,850
- Him! - Not the one who does judo.

1741
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:09,950
The famous writer!

1742
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,750
- With long hair? - I know who this is.

1743
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,990
(Which character is he describing in detail?)

1744
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:12,990
It's him!

1745
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,590
I know who this is.

1746
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:16,660
(Benimaru)

1747
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,160
- Him! - Yes, of course.

1748
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,030
I got it right away from what Se Chan wrote.

1749
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:21,300
(All the fuss started over the single word "Be.")

1750
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,530
I know who this is, but I can't remember his name.

1751
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:20,960
- I like that game, you see. - Oh, no...

1752
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,330
- What was his name again? - The King of...

1753
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,070
- I don't know the game. - What?

1754
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,840
(He turns to Kyeong Hwan's clue instead.)

1755
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,140
"I've never said the name correctly before."

1756
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,640
(Kyeong Hwan's not doing any better.)

1757
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,770
- A character. - A game character?

1758
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,440
A name that sounds like a fruit.

1759
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,980
"I've never..."

1760
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,280
- Baskera? - Baskera?

1761
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,580
- Baskerabin? - Baskin Robbins?

1762
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,280
- Oh, I see. - Baskin Robbins?

1763
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,050
Like Baskin Robbins?

1764
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,850
- Is it Very Berry Strawberry? - Very Berry?

1765
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,360
Berry, berry, blueberry. Something like that.

1766
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,690
It sounds like that. Anyway, a writer...

1767
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:49,960
I know. Let me answer!

1768
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,860
Is it that writer? The one with the cheese?

1769
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,930
- Wait, he's... - Go for it.

1770
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,230
He's... His name...

1771
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:58,800
The famous writer!

1772
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,770
- You're almost there. - It's Berry-something.

1773
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,070
- It's not. - Let me answer.

1774
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:05,640
(They've finally figured it out!)

1775
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,940
You've got it!

1776
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,640
- Let me answer. - Me!

1777
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,910
- Let me answer. - You've got it!

1778
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:08,310
- Saint Exupery. - That's the one.

1779
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,410
(Incorrect)

1780
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,480
- That's not it. - Let me answer.

1781
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,410
- Werber... - That's not it.

1782
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:12,680
- Read our clues. - That's not it.

1783
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,520
(Incorrect)

1784
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,720
What?

1785
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,120
Haha knows which writer it is.

1786
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,620
- I do. He's super famous. - He wrote "The Ants."

1787
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,060
- Didn't he write "The Ants?" - Yes, "The Ants."

1788
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,890
Why can't I remember his name?

1789
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,530
(Bernard Werber's most famous work, "Empire of the Ants" is the answer.)

1790
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,960
It'd be a bummer if he can't get this.

1791
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,590
(Haha is almost there.)

1792
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,160
We all know it.

1793
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,130
- Who is it? - Just keep going.

1794
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:28,630
(All he has to do is remember his name!)

1795
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,530
Guys, you did a good job explaining the name.

1796
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,130
- Yes, you did great. - I don't get it.

1797
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:32,630
- Se Chan did great. - I prefer Kyeong Hwan's.

1798
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:33,670
- Really? - I prefer Se Chan's.

1799
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:36,110
- "You'll feel drowsy." - I prefer Kyeong Hwan's.

1800
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,240
I know which writer it is, but I can't remember his name.

1801
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:41,540
(Very drowsy)

1802
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,940
- That's a part of his name. - Berry?

1803
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,980
- What's his name again? - "Think of the berry family."

1804
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,350
Okay, strawberries.

1805
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:49,180
(Reciting them lazily)

1806
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,880
Blueberries.

1807
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,950
Seok Jin is definitely sleeping in the four-person room.

1808
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,790
I just don't get it.

1809
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,490
(Clueless)

1810
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,560
Can I tell them his surname?

1811
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,530
Do we have to guess his full name?

1812
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:59,430
- It's Werber. - I know!

1813
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,630
- Let me answer. - Do we have to get...

1814
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,470
(Answer: Bernard Werber)

1815
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,100
- his full name? - Werber Werber.

1816
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,170
(Incorrect)

1817
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,430
Darn, I remember now!

1818
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,170
- I know which writer it is. - He got the full name wrong.

1819
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,240
- Carefully read what I wrote. - I know which writer it is.

1820
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:11,140
(Drowsy)

1821
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,340
- Just read every word. - I know who this is.

1822
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,740
Read every word carefully. I spelled it out for you.

1823
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:18,050
(Not "guretnaru.")

1824
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,250
- Na... - Not "guretnaru."

1825
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,780
Not "guretnaru."

1826
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:19,720
I can't possibly give you any more clues.

1827
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,120
- It's all here. - Go for it.

1828
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,320
(Beretnaru)

1829
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,550
- Let me answer. - It's all here.

1830
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,620
Narberry.

1831
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,320
(Incorrect)

1832
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,790
- Narberry? - This is driving me nuts.

1833
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,090
- Just go for it, Seok Jin. - Look!

1834
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:28,590
Look!

1835
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,190
(They're really almost there!)

1836
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,360
- From the berry family. - Think of berries...

1837
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,090
and the fact that you get drowsy after eating them.

1838
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,560
- You get drowsy? - Eating it makes you drowsy?

1839
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,260
How can you get drowsy?

1840
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,870
(Shouting)

1841
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:36,570
Let me answer!

1842
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,370
- Is it Berryber? - No.

1843
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:39,970
It ends with "ber."

1844
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,140
- All right. - Go for it.

1845
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,610
(Will Haha get it first?)

1846
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,140
I gave you all the clues you need.

1847
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,270
- It'll make you drowsy? - Just read it.

1848
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:46,440
(Or will the smarter Seok Jin?)

1849
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,380
I gave you everything you need.

1850
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,010
- All right. - Go for it.

1851
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,440
(Who will answer correctly first?)

1852
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,340
I gave you all the clues you need.

1853
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,980
- Let me answer. - I gave you everything you need.

1854
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,050
- Bernard. - Hold on.

1855
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,220
Here we go. Give us the full name.

1856
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,480
(Ddochi suddenly stepped up.)

1857
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,750
Ye Eun, say the full name.

1858
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,820
(Will she get it right?)

1859
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:59,250
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

1860
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,760
Bernard Bernard.

1861
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,120
- That's not it. - Come on!

1862
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,720
(Incorrect)

1863
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,460
Bernard Bernard.

1864
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,530
(She got one Korean syllable wrong.)

1865
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,860
- Let me answer! - That's not it.

1866
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,090
Bernard Bernard.

1867
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:08,400
- Let me answer! - That's not it.

1868
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,730
Bernard Werber.

1869
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,870
- Nice. - Bernard Werber.

1870
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,330
(Bernard Werber is correct!)

1871
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:16,270
(Old Raccoon took the chance.)

1872
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,370
Bernard Werber.

1873
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,770
It's Bernard Werber.

1874
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,910
- Good job on the explanation. - I knew his name!

1875
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,810
(Disappointed)

1876
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,180
- I even know the name of his book. - I was clueless.

1877
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:24,780
His name sounds something like berry,

1878
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,850
(He's carefully reading the question again.)

1879
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,580
and eating this berry will make you drowsy.

1880
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,320
Guys, you won't forget this until the day you die.

1881
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,620
- Eating berry after berry. - Eating berry after berry.

1882
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,990
(Kyeong Hwan's description: It sounds like a fruit...)

1883
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:32,520
(from the blueberry family with a repetitive name.)

1884
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,590
(I've heard it, but I never said it aloud.)

1885
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,690
After getting drowsy, he still ate more berries.

1886
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:36,090
Bernard Werber?

1887
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:39,600
(There's an ice cream at Baskin-Robbins with a similar name.)

1888
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,960
- Yes, Bernard Werber. - I won't ever forget it.

1889
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,630
Good job explaining the name.

1890
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,600
They're a fun bunch.

1891
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,830
This quiz was hilarious.

1892
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:45,270
- The comedians were on a roll. - They were excellent.

1893
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:47,640
- That was amazing. - Mission Empty Heads, clear!

1894
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:49,140
(Triumphant)

1895
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,170
That was hilarious, guys.

1896
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,610
Do you know something hilarious about Kyeong Hwan?

1897
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:53,910
He's funny when he types his words.

1898
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,810
- Rather than saying them... - He's funny...

1899
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:56,910
- when he types them. - Kyeong Hwan,

1900
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,310
type your words on Running Man.

1901
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,950
(Speechless)

1902
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,480
You should carry this around.

1903
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,950
- I didn't get a single one. - That was fun.

1904
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:03,420
- That was hilarious. - I'm nervous now.

1905
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:07,790
(Kyeong Hwan: 9, Se Chan: 3)

1906
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,950
You've got to be kidding me.

1907
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,220
- Haha, you almost had it. - What was my answer again?

1908
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,860
- It was Bernard Werber. - It drove me nuts.

1909
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:11,290
(The last round ends like this.)

1910
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,090
- Bernard Werber. - That was fun.

1911
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,930
The three with the most correct answers...

1912
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,760
and the higher-scoring explainer...

1913
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,070
will each draw a number from 1 to 4...

1914
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,900
- to determine the ranking. - I love it.

1915
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,300
Being in the top four should do it.

1916
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,710
- Okay, - The four with the lowest score...

1917
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,710
and the remaining explainer...

1918
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:28,380
will draw a number from 5 to 9,

1919
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,910
which will determine their ranking.

1920
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,510
Beginning with the person in first place,

1921
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:33,850
(The numbers they drew determine the room selection order.)

1922
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,180
you'll choose the room you want.

1923
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,590
Okay, let's start with the top four.

1924
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,920
(They start drawing numbers.)

1925
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,590
- Who else? - Kyeong Hwan.

1926
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,730
(Top 4: Jae Seok, Jong Kook, Daniel, Kyeong Hwan)

1927
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,160
- Draw one. - Draw one.

1928
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,660
Isn't drawing the right number most important?

1929
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,060
- Yes, this is most important. - That's right.

1930
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,230
If you don't draw the right number,

1931
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:48,200
(They must draw numbers 1 or 2 to sleep in a single room.)

1932
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,760
it'll all be for nothing.

1933
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,300
I hope I draw number one. Ranking fourth isn't ideal.

1934
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,600
(Bitter)

1935
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:51,970
I hope I draw number one.

1936
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,200
Ranking fourth isn't ideal.

1937
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,570
- As long as it's not 4... - I'm in 1st place!

1938
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,340
(Jae Seok's in 1st place.)

1939
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:58,840
I'm in second place.

1940
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,780
(Kyeong Hwan's in 2nd place.)

1941
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,380
- I'm 3rd. - I'm 4th.

1942
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,440
I'm in second place.

1943
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,780
(3rd place: Jong Kook, 4th place: Daniel)

1944
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,980
- The rest will now draw numbers. - I'm in second place.

1945
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,050
It'll be a disaster to share a room with Ye Eun.

1946
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,380
(After that, the lower-ranked members start drawing numbers.)

1947
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,550
- Tell me about it. - Ye Eun, I'm sorry.

1948
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,580
- I can't bunk with Ye Eun. - Seriously.

1949
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,390
(Everyone except the 5th-place member will go to a 4-person room.)

1950
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,290
What's a good number to pull?

1951
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:11,790
- Probably fifth place. - Here.

1952
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:13,460
I'm in sixth place.

1953
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,420
(Haha drew number 5.)

1954
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,320
The two female members will be sticking together.

1955
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,490
- Seok Jin... - I'll sleep on the floor.

1956
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:17,890
- I can't share a bed with anyone. - Are you fifth? That's a relief.

1957
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:20,030
How can two men share that small bed?

1958
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,070
Please add your name, starting with whoever is in first place.

1959
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,130
(They choose rooms according to the number they drew.)

1960
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:26,100
- This is the room I'll sleep in. - That's a boring choice.

1961
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,100
- Jae Seok, you're lucky. - It's boring to sleep alone.

1962
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,770
(Jae Seok chooses a luxury single room.)

1963
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,670
(Jealous)

1964
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,040
Come on.

1965
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,980
You won't get a lot of screen time if you sleep alone.

1966
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,950
- Sure, whatever. - That just makes sense.

1967
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,280
(Kyeong Hwan chooses a standard single room.)

1968
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:39,850
This room isn't so bad.

1969
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,420
(All the single rooms are taken.)

1970
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,420
- This isn't so bad. - It's really not.

1971
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,650
The rooms are divided.

1972
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,650
- Aren't the rooms divided? - They are.

1973
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,250
- This is quite nice. - I'll sleep here.

1974
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:47,690
- Is that so? - Really?

1975
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,290
(Jong Kook gets the big bed in the 3-person room.)

1976
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:48,860
There's not much of a difference.

1977
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,090
- Who's in fourth place? - Me.

1978
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,260
Choi Daniel.

1979
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:54,700
(Daniel takes the sofa bed.)

1980
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,030
Does that mean you'll sleep down by my feet?

1981
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,600
(Laughing)

1982
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,100
- That's what it means. - Down by my feet.

1983
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:03,340
(3-person room: Jong Kook, Daniel, Haha)

1984
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,410
We'll be sharing the room.

1985
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,270
This room isn't so bad. I actually wasn't aware of this.

1986
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:06,740
You're right. It's not too bad.

1987
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,380
(Seok Jin and Se Chan take the bunk in the 4-person room.)

1988
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,380
Just us two? This isn't good.

1989
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,810
(Ji Hyo and Ye Eun will use the 4-person room as well.)

1990
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,420
I'll make an announcement before you go to your rooms...

1991
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,980
- for the night. - Sure.

1992
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,020
As you were told, you'll face a penalty tomorrow morning.

1993
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,890
- Exactly. - It'll be a tiring task...

1994
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,890
that requires a lot of work.

1995
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:22,220
(5 people will receive a penalty for now.)

1996
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,720
If you want to be exempt from the penalty,

1997
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,160
volunteer to go out and get breakfast.

1998
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,360
- Voluntarily? - Yes.

1999
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,260
A van to take you there will be provided tomorrow morning.

2000
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,830
(A car will be prepared to get breakfast tomorrow morning.)

2001
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:32,830
The first two to get in it will be exempt from the penalty.

2002
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:34,070
(The 1st 2 people who get in the car will be exempt from the penalty.)

2003
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,970
- At what time? - At what time?

2004
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:36,270
We won't say when.

2005
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,340
(But they don't know when the car will come.)

2006
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,340
- What? - Come on.

2007
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,210
Shouldn't we sleep?

2008
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,910
Are we not supposed to sleep at all?

2009
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,080
Come out when you think...

2010
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:45,280
(They will succeed if they see the car at the estimated time.)

2011
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,250
- the minivan is here. - Really?

2012
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:45,750
If the minivan isn't here, you won't be able to get in.

2013
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:48,480
(They have to predict when it will arrive.)

2014
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,180
- You're killing me. - Where will it be?

2015
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,420
They're not letting us sleep comfortably.

2016
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,420
Jae Seok usually wakes up at 5am.

2017
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,520
- He wakes up at five! - You see,

2018
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:55,060
(Morning person)

2019
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,690
I'm an early bird anyway.

2020
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:55,360
- He's unbeatable. - Will it be just one person?

2021
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,960
- No, two. - Then that's doable.

2022
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,460
(The 1st 2 to get in the van will be exempt from the penalty.)

2023
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,200
I need to get up by 4am at the latest

2024
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,330
- So much for sleeping. - We're supposed to get breakfast.

2025
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,630
What can we buy...

2026
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,040
- at 4am? - What's open at that hour?

2027
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,640
- The seafood market opens at four. - Nothing is open at that hour.

2028
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,310
- Really? - Yes, 4am is when it's busiest.

2029
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,180
- That must be it. - Right.

2030
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,440
We're getting breakfast at the seafood market.

2031
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,210
(Will the car arrive at 4am as they think?)

2032
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,180
- That's where we're going. - We'll let you know.

2033
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,680
This is nice.

2034
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:21,620
(Everyone toured the rooms.)

2035
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,220
- There's an upper floor. - This is the best.

2036
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,680
This is great!

2037
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,420
I want to take a shower with strong water pressure.

2038
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,750
- They have that. - I bet it'll be weak.

2039
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,160
- No, it's super strong. - Really?

2040
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,790
I used the bathroom in Jae Seok's room earlier.

2041
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,160
- Really? - Is the water pressure strong?

2042
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:31,930
- Did you use my bathroom to poop? - Yes.

2043
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:36,600
He's been pooping everywhere.

2044
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:38,270
(He left his mark in someone else's room.)

2045
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,230
Jae Seok, I...

2046
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,700
I didn't know you'd get that room.

2047
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,040
Gosh, I'm sorry.

2048
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,310
I even left the door open to air it out. It's nice and clean.

2049
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:44,310
Oh, really?
I didn't know.

2050
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,340
You just poop all over the place.

2051
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,180
So, let's just chat for a while...

2052
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,750
(Reluctant to go to bed, they decide to spend some time chatting.)

2053
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,880
- We'll go over there... - Let's chat there for a bit and go.

2054
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,750
- Let's go and chat, then. - Chit-chat.

2055
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,450
Gosh, Jolly Pong. This reminds me of my childhood.

2056
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,450
(Gathering in the staff's room)

2057
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:56,520
Yes, Jolly Pong.

2058
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,190
- I think that's it. - What if it's a dud?

2059
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,790
(The cameras are rolling without the staff members.)

2060
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:02,390
- Can I eat this? - Yes, you can eat it.

2061
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:05,860
(Ji Hyo and Ye Eun are washing up first.)

2062
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:04,390
- No. - Seok Jin, that's...

2063
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:05,590
It was so delicious earlier when it was warm.

2064
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:07,130
Is it only 9:30pm now?

2065
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,500
(Current time: 9:30pm)

2066
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,800
It's not that late.

2067
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,600
Gosh, I should go to sleep at 10pm.

2068
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,100
Can you fall asleep at 10pm?

2069
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,340
(Newborn Jae Seok goes to bed at 10pm and wakes up at 5am.)

2070
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,200
If you go to sleep at 10pm, you will definitely...

2071
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,100
I could fall asleep right now if I wanted to.

2072
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,410
- You have your own room too, - Right.

2073
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,610
(You'll be able to get a good night's sleep.)

2074
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:20,240
- so you could just sleep. - That's impressive.

2075
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,840
Jong Kook, what time do you go to sleep?

2076
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:26,310
When I was a bachelor, I didn't go to sleep until really late.

2077
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,050
I'd watch Netflix and stuff, but now...

2078
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,180
Aren't you still a bachelor now?

2079
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:32,190
- Yes, I am a bachelor. - Are you married?

2080
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,090
- I'm pretty sure you're not. - I'm a bachelor, you know?

2081
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:36,760
(They still can't believe this lonely bachelor got married.)

2082
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,720
- Yes, that's right. - So, these days,

2083
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,390
as I'm living a new life as a bachelor,

2084
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,860
- I go to sleep a bit earlier. - I'm sure.

2085
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,130
Between midnight and 1am.

2086
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,200
(He's been living a routine life since getting married.)

2087
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,700
That's not too bad, though.

2088
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,400
When do you work out, Jong Kook? In the evening?

2089
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,500
- Is that what you like? - He works out in the evening.

2090
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,100
I work out in the evening and during the day too.

2091
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,510
- I like working out in the morning. - I work out early too.

2092
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,810
I also like working out in the morning.

2093
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:53,070
Kyeong Hwan has a great body too.

2094
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,710
Yes, Kyeong Hwan has always had a great body.

2095
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:55,940
He was the comedian with the great body.

2096
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,780
No, I don't work out to develop my physique.

2097
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,180
I just keep exercising.

2098
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,580
Then, what do you do?

2099
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,320
- He does contact sports. - I do jiu-jitsu.

2100
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,190
- If not, I run or go to the gym. - Oh, jiu-jitsu.

2101
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:06,960
(He's skilled enough to win awards in jiu-jitsu competitions.)

2102
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:07,090
But didn't you use to lift weights?

2103
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:08,660
- Oh, did he really? - Grabbing...

2104
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,230
- and pushing... - Hey, you should try jiu-jitsu.

2105
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,230
(Since we're at it)

2106
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,760
- Right now? - Yes. Show us.

2107
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,500
- So, in jiu-jitsu... - He says he's so good.

2108
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,530
- What belt are you? - What do I have to do?

2109
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:17,430
(He demonstrates his techniques on Se Chan.)

2110
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,870
Hey, don't put me in an armlock.

2111
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:18,930
- No, I won't do that. - Don't do it.

2112
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:20,700
It won't hurt, right? Okay.

2113
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,910
Hey, wait. Hang on.

2114
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,170
Hang on.

2115
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:26,140
(Going straight for the move)

2116
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,080
- What is this? - It's slippery.

2117
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,210
That's what it's like.

2118
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,010
(Smug)

2119
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:29,710
Hey, it's slippery.

2120
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,780
- Of course, it's... - We did this often before too.

2121
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,680
(Getting up)

2122
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,180
- But... - Gosh, Jong Kook is undressing.

2123
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,980
(Kim Muscles wants to experience it himself.)

2124
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,180
Why are you doing this?

2125
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,420
Imagine you ran into an assailant.

2126
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,190
(Excited)

2127
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,650
It's slippery.

2128
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,590
How? Watch out.

2129
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,120
(Shouting)

2130
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:42,790
Watch out.

2131
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,860
(He's no match for the muscular man.)

2132
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:45,790
- Head butting! - Hey, Kyeong Hwan.

2133
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,130
But the assailant...

2134
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,800
- What good is learning jiu-jitsu? - The assailant is more...

2135
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
What is this?

2136
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,700
What can I do if the assailant is like this?

2137
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,340
(His face is red.)

2138
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,240
- What good is learning jiu-jitsu? - You can't...

2139
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,800
What can I do, then?

2140
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,670
What kind of assailant is so strong from the beginning?

2141
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,510
- Earlier, you... - I'm an assailant.

2142
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,480
Please just beat Kim Jong Kook.

2143
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,110
I'm supposed to be an assailant.

2144
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:06,980
(Ji Hyo and Ye Eun came back, fully prepared to sleep.)

2145
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:06,920
- I did that since I'm an assailant. - I can beat you.

2146
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,450
- If I just grab you, I can... - By the way...

2147
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,250
Ye Eun, what are you supposed to be? A clown?

2148
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:14,420
(She's wearing flashy pajamas like she did in Heongseong.)

2149
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,050
- This is... - What is this?

2150
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,290
What? I'm wearing pajamas.

2151
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:15,660
- What is this? - It's cute.

2152
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,560
But why did you wear pajamas?

2153
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,390
- Try it. - What kind of jiu-jitsu...

2154
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,760
(Kyeong Hwan even took off the team uniform to demonstrate jiu-jitsu.)

2155
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,130
- only does what the opponent wants? - Hey, what's up with that?

2156
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:22,700
- I have to learn the technique. - Well, this is...

2157
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,830
(He wants to show properly this time.)

2158
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,400
- You can't just do what he wants. - How am I most disadvantaged?

2159
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,430
- Oh, that's right. - This is the worst position for me.

2160
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,400
(Bring it on.)

2161
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,800
- Get on top of him. - Get on top.

2162
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,770
- There you go. - He's up, right?

2163
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,240
But usually, they won't do it like this.

2164
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,940
- Right? - Hang on.

2165
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:35,640
(Pressing close)

2166
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,680
With both of our shoulders...

2167
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:38,710
(He's perplexed by his strange attack.)

2168
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,880
I'm sure his legs would be open.

2169
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,880
But this is comfortable.

2170
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,750
- Hey, who would... - Did he die on top of me?

2171
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,750
This is like if he were to die on top of me.

2172
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:47,090
- But jiu-jitsu... - Hey.

2173
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:49,860
(Master Heo wants a lot from the attacker.)

2174
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:48,920
- The situation... - How can the situation be...

2175
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,360
- Well, it's true. - Is this scripted?

2176
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,590
- Is this scripted? - I mean...

2177
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,660
Normally, you don't do that. Get on top and sit on him.

2178
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:56,030
- Mount. Like if you're fighting. - Like with your legs open.

2179
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,600
- So, I'd go like this, right? - That's it.

2180
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,130
(He's satisfied now.)

2181
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,340
- Go farther up. - And grab him by the collar.

2182
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,340
- Hit him! - Grab his collar.

2183
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,070
- Pretend to hit him. - Right, grab his collar.

2184
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,310
- That's it. - I'm sure he'd do this so quickly.

2185
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:08,240
(The opponent will attack in an instant.)

2186
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,340
- Then, from here... - Do a head butt.

2187
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,610
- Wait... - Go.

2188
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,810
(Super close)

2189
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,010
Butt his head with yours.

2190
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,850
Look at him.

2191
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:15,450
Come on. Don't rub your face on mine. Darn it!

2192
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:15,520
(Unpleasant)

2193
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18,120
(He finally executes the move correctly on him.)

2194
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,120
Darn it!

2195
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,120
(Body choke)

2196
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:24,930
Jae Seok! This part hurts so much!

2197
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,400
- Gosh, how do you do that? - Look at his thighs.

2198
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,400
(Impressed)

2199
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,400
- Nice one. - What was that?

2200
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,400
- He squeezed here. - The diaphragm...

2201
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,730
Jae Seok, this part hurts so much.

2202
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:34,400
- Did he squeeze with his legs? - This part hurts so much.

2203
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:36,740
(Tongyeong Prince wasn't bluffing about his jiu-jitsu skills.)

2204
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,140
- Look at Kyeong Hwan's thighs. - He's impressive.

2205
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,070
He's quick too. He just grabbed and squeezed,

2206
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,510
- and this part just hurt. - Indeed, that is...

2207
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:42,680
Why is your face so oily? Gosh, you're gross.

2208
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,950
Ye Eun, is a man who's into sports attractive?

2209
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,850
(Secretly anticipating)

2210
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:48,050
What?

2211
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,220
- But Ye Eun cares about height. - Right.

2212
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,520
- I see. - No, I mean...

2213
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,890
(He was turned down before he even confessed.)

2214
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,060
- Well, I... His face.... - You could just say that...

2215
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,390
(Laughing)

2216
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,790
But he is...

2217
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:58,460
(Feeling sorry for him)

2218
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,590
This guy... Look. If you look at his upper body,

2219
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,500
- The upper body... - If you look, his legs...

2220
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,930
should come down to about here.

2221
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:05,500
- Look. - You're right.

2222
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,770
So, I am perfect down to here.

2223
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:09,670
(As a fellow short person, he analyzed it with a clear head.)

2224
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:10,870
- This part is way too short. - That part is short.

2225
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:13,780
But he was doomed from here down.

2226
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,980
- Look at his upper body, - He's quite short.

2227
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,180
- not his lower body. - His face...

2228
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,480
Look at him.

2229
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,950
(Dumbfounded)

2230
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:19,110
- He's glaring. - He has wide shoulders. Look.

2231
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,780
- Haha, you're too harsh. - Also,

2232
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,780
(Anyway, it means his upper body is perfect.)

2233
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,020
- his legs... - You're right.

2234
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,820
That's why he does jiu-jitsu, since you can do it sitting down.

2235
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,720
- But... - What is up with this?

2236
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,720
- You know? - You can tell if you're boxing.

2237
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,060
It's a bit unbalanced.

2238
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:32,130
- Who threw this? - Hey, put that over yourself.

2239
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:33,230
See? Look at just that part.

2240
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:34,330
His upper body is like a work of art.

2241
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:35,960
- He's handsome. - Look right until his belly button.

2242
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,270
Gosh, he looks good.

2243
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,130
Hey, make it longer.

2244
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,600
- Hey. - Gosh, look at this. More.

2245
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,540
(Dragging)

2246
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,440
- My goodness. - What's this?

2247
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:47,440
(A magic trick to look taller with one blanket)

2248
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,270
- He's supposed to like this. - Hey.

2249
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,910
That's what his legs are supposed to look like.

2250
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,450
- You look cool. - Hey.

2251
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,780
(The magician is satisfied.)

2252
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:51,610
- My gosh. Hey. - See?

2253
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,210
- Do I look good? - Hey, it's So Ji Sub.

2254
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,520
- Hey, grab two shoes. - You're so cool.

2255
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,780
- Kyeong Hwan. - Hey, So Ji Sub!

2256
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,020
Normally, it should be like this.

2257
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,160
- Hey, did you just bring these? - I brought those.

2258
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,820
(He brought shoes that didn't suit him.)

2259
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,520
Whose are these?

2260
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,960
(He looks as big as a door.)

2261
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,390
This is how it should be!

2262
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:05,660
- Hey! - Kyeong Hwan.

2263
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,060
- Kyeong Hwan. - Are you for real?

2264
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,860
- I'll take a photo of you. - Let's make this a romantic photo.

2265
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,170
- A romantic photo. - Gosh, seriously.

2266
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,030
(If it were a romanic photo, it'd get an overwhelming response.)

2267
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:11,600
Hey, this is the romantic photo!

2268
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,030
Hey, this is So Ji Sub.

2269
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,540
Hey! Look at this!

2270
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:19,140
You look cool, right? Look at this. This is it.

2271
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,480
(The titan's long legs)

2272
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,780
- It looks cool. - Gosh, that's amazing.

2273
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,140
- Look. - They look so long.

2274
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,680
- Take the blanket off. - That's how it should be.

2275
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,120
- Take the blanket off. - Shall I take it off?

2276
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,680
One, two, three.

2277
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:36,890
(Exploding)

2278
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,490
Why are you doing that to me? It hurts.

2279
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:39,090
Why are you using jiu-jitsu on me?

2280
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:42,060
- Can't you just accept it? - No.

2281
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,930
"Can't you just accept it?" Look at this.

2282
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,540
- Look. He looks cool, right? - For real, Kyeong Hwan.

2283
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:48,340
(The photo still amazes them.)

2284
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,100
- You look cool in this. - Kyeong Hwan.

2285
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,510
Kyeong Hwan! You're a good match for Running Man.

2286
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:52,940
But I didn't make people laugh.

2287
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,680
- I forgot. - You made us laugh.

2288
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:56,180
Everything was funny, starting with jiu-jitsu.

2289
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,310
- You're so funny. - Yes, it's all about you today.

2290
00:57:58,310 --> 00:57:59,350
- Right. - You're the leading man, punk.

2291
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:03,790
- You're the leading man. - I keep wanting to cover up.

2292
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,390
Don't do stuff like that.

2293
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,690
(Cold)

2294
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:08,220
- Isn't this it? - Look at Jong Kook.

2295
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,060
- You should've just stayed quiet. - "Don't do stuff like that."

2296
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,360
(His ridiculous joke got him scolded right away.)

2297
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:12,390
- It was good. Why did you... - Just stretch your legs.

2298
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:13,800
- I like this, though. - Why...

2299
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,860
- Why... - I keep wanting to hear it.

2300
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,500
Well, I...

2301
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,400
You know, I've been looking up all of your catchphrases.

2302
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,970
- I can do all of them. - The original... Hey, just stop it.

2303
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,910
Because of you, he has nothing to do.

2304
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,770
- I can do all of them. - What were they, Kyeong Hwan?

2305
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:27,810
Start with, "By the way."

2306
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:29,240
What was your first catchphrase?

2307
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,980
At first, it was, "By the way."

2308
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,810
- "By the way" really blew up. - Oh, was that it?

2309
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:34,680
- There's also "You punk." - Right.

2310
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,620
- "You punk." - "You punk."

2311
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,420
- You also have this one. - "No, you can't."

2312
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,320
Sadly. Thankfully.

2313
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,690
- Yes, that one. - He has so many.

2314
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:44,060
Hey, how is that a catchphrase?

2315
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:45,930
(Kyeong Hwan subtly slips in his unpopular catchphrase.)

2316
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,430
- "How odd." - What?

2317
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:47,700
- He's pretty much... - Hey, don't say that!

2318
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,700
How does that make sense?

2319
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,960
- What else? - There's, "It's unbalanced."

2320
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,100
- Sure, I'll give you that. - Right.

2321
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,800
- Gosh, that's a lot. - He has so many.

2322
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,800
- He does. - Not many people have this many.

2323
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,140
When I did, "Give me 50 cents. I'll tell you,"

2324
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,310
I went to the bank after the third time that was on TV.

2325
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:00,980
(He visited the bank after the comedy skit...)

2326
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:04,010
I asked, "Can I get this done?" And that person said,

2327
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:03,210
(where he played a beggar aired 3 times.)

2328
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,680
"Are you curious? Give me 50 cents. I'll tell you."

2329
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:09,080
(The teller said his catchphrase.)

2330
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,880
This person was the bank teller.

2331
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:12,320
(That was the first time he realized how popular he had become.)

2332
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,220
So, I thought, "The impact is so huge."

2333
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,350
You must've felt awesome.

2334
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,960
Ji Hyo, didn't you instantly become popular after "Family Outing?"

2335
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,590
- Yes, that's right. - "Hot Issue?" Right, I remember.

2336
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:18,330
- Yes, "Hot Issue." Right? - Yes, "Hot Issue."

2337
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:21,900
- Back then, Ji Hyo was adorable. - For real.

2338
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:22,230
(Her stiff dance became the talk of the town.)

2339
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,160
She was so pretty on Running Man too.

2340
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,370
(Ji Hyo seemed young and innocent when she debuted on a variety show.)

2341
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,770
- Running Man was totally... - Right, in the early days.

2342
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:28,970
Back then, we were still ripping name tags off.

2343
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,570
(Early episodes of Running Man)

2344
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:32,040
Gosh, as we ripped off name tags, we'd sometimes get...

2345
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,040
- upset with others. - Yes, you're right.

2346
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,710
- Right. - "Shouldn't they rip mine off now?"

2347
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,340
So, when we became prison buddies,

2348
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,980
- we totally became allies. - Yes, the prison.

2349
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,580
It was me, him, and Jae Seok.

2350
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:42,750
(The weaker ones came together in prison.)

2351
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:42,420
For years, we were just in prison...

2352
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,820
- Niel, you... - I never once...

2353
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,090
You think you can beat me if we do name tag ripping, right?

2354
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:47,760
- You can't beat him. - You can't beat me.

2355
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,920
Do you want to try now?

2356
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,960
You can't beat me. Do you want to try now?

2357
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:52,790
- Try it. - Yes, try it.

2358
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,730
(Seok Sam suddenly provokes him.)

2359
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,330
(Out of nowhere?)

2360
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,430
- Then, do you want to try? - You have two right now.

2361
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:56,700
Yes, let's try it. Come here. Name tags. You have one, right?

2362
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,470
(Taking off)

2363
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,200
- Are you sure you should do this? - I do have one.

2364
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,500
Gosh, this is fascinating. What in the world is going on?

2365
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,870
- Seok Jin is seriously... - Take off your socks.

2366
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:03,600
- You might lose your hair. - Take off your socks.

2367
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,600
(He was just sitting there,)

2368
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,510
- Take your socks off. - Seok Jin.

2369
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,840
(and suddenly he has to tear off his name tag.)

2370
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,210
- Why take off the socks? - Seriously.

2371
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:09,580
(Seok Sam's provocation led to a big match.)

2372
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:08,680
- We get to see such a show? - But why...

2373
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,710
Seok Jin, thank you! Hey, film this for him.

2374
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:12,610
- Seok Jin. - This is so amusing!

2375
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,050
- Hey, - This is fun. Hang on a minute.

2376
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,120
(I need to film it.)

2377
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:16,350
- Hey, come here. - I'm looking forward to this.

2378
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,890
- Shall we try it for real? - How?

2379
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,290
(The old fighter takes off his socks to compete seriously.)

2380
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:21,190
Seok Jin will stay there, then...

2381
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:22,660
More than anything else, it's so funny to me.

2382
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,160
Seok Jin was sitting like this, then...

2383
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:26,260
"Hey, do you want to try it now?"

2384
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,300
You can't beat me. Do you want to try now?

2385
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,530
(The best scene of 2025)

2386
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,870
(These little...)

2387
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,170
- That's because... - So funny.

2388
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,440
on my own channel, way back when,

2389
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,770
we ripped other people's name tags taken off, called "1 on 1."

2390
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:38,910
An actual MMA fighter came, but he couldn't beat me.

2391
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,510
- My gosh. - Seok Jin, back in the day...

2392
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,240
(Impressed)

2393
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:43,180
(He's the weakest, but he's confident for a reason.)

2394
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,410
You're out! I ripped it off!

2395
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,650
(He has the experience and technique honed for over 15 years.)

2396
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:47,250
Hey, all of you, back off! The year 2014 is my year!

2397
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:51,050
(Jee-rasoni sometimes tears off Jong Kook's name tag too.)

2398
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,090
I ripped it off.

2399
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,690
Goodness, man!

2400
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:54,490
(Daniel, who's never played Name Tag Elimination, is his opponent.)

2401
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:57,460
(He's well-built, but not very athletic.)

2402
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:57,230
A header.

2403
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:02,260
(Who will win this match?)

2404
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,190
Okay, start.

2405
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,660
By the way, he's so strong.

2406
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,600
Yes, he's strong. And he has a long armspan.

2407
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,240
- So, do I just take your name tag? - How?

2408
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,170
(Seok Sam is even warming up for this.)

2409
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,500
- Just rip off his name tag. - Ripping off the name tags...

2410
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,040
(Laughing)

2411
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,900
- You've watched Running Man before. - Yes.

2412
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,570
- You can try name tag ripping. - You haven't tried it all, right?

2413
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:11,340
(Daniel: No Name Tag Elimination experience, better-built)

2414
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,770
(Jee Seok Sam: 15 years of experience, always in prison)

2415
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:12,670
- Aren't you taking your socks off? - Hey.

2416
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,710
- So, Kyeong Hwan. - All of a sudden? Yes.

2417
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,110
This is "Big Pride" on "Gag Concert."

2418
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:17,510
That's right.

2419
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:19,610
- I haven't done this in a while. - I've never tried it.

2420
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:22,320
(The pride race, Daniel versus Seok Jin)

2421
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:22,350
- Race, start! - Start!

2422
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,050
- Ready. - Let's go.

2423
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:26,150
(Will it be the physique or the experience?)

2424
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,090
- Set... Niel, do it for real. - Gosh, look.

2425
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:27,120
Go!

2426
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:29,590
(This balance game is unpredictable.)

2427
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,420
- We haven't done this in so long. - For real.

2428
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,490
No, you really have to do it.

2429
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:32,790
Gosh, I'm even more excited than the jiu-jitsu thing right now.

2430
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,960
(The rare sight drew everyone's attention.)

2431
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,960
No, you must do it for real.

2432
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,400
We used to run into others often, just like this.

2433
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,770
- Yes, we did. - We ran into each other this way.

2434
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:39,530
- We faced each other like this. - That's right.

2435
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,700
We did this a lot.

2436
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,240
- That's right. - Come here for the cameras.

2437
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:42,970
(Relaxed)

2438
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,240
This brings back memories.

2439
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:46,610
(Seok Jin attacks first.)

2440
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,240
It's over.

2441
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,410
(He grabbed him right away.)

2442
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,380
It's over.

2443
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,440
- No, Jae Seok. - He can't win.

2444
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:50,140
(He's perplexed a little.)

2445
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,450
- You never know. - Seok Jin.

2446
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:51,710
- It's over. - No, Jae Seok.

2447
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:53,150
- He can't win. Seok Jin. - You never know.

2448
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:54,920
Seok Jin. It's a matter of speed.

2449
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:56,380
(At that moment,)

2450
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,690
(Seok Jin grabs Daniel's name tag.)

2451
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,060
(They grab each other's name tags almost at the same time.)

2452
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,730
(Groaning)

2453
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:15,400
(Ripping)

2454
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:15,100
It ripped off. He lost.

2455
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:18,170
(Struggling)

2456
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,810
- He lost. - Of course.

2457
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:23,480
- He lost. - Seok Jin is out.

2458
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,950
- He lost. - Of course.

2459
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,480
- He lost. - That didn't take long.

2460
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,180
He lost in a pitiful way.

2461
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:31,820
- You know, - Seriously.

2462
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:33,390
- I thought his wig had come off. - Oh, no.

2463
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:34,420
It was so funny.

2464
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:36,560
(Popping)

2465
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,460
For goodness' sake.

2466
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:40,530
- Oh, no. - It was so funny.

2467
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:41,630
(His face is red.)

2468
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,570
(Bawling)

2469
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,630
What was that?

2470
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,440
Seok Jin, are you okay?

2471
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:48,440
(He feels sorry for no reason.)

2472
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,900
What was that?

2473
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,910
- I mean... - He lost in a pitiful way.

2474
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,970
(He's out of breath.)

2475
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:53,270
- It was so embarrassing. - Seriously.

2476
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,240
- I became embarrassed. - What was that?

2477
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:58,780
- Shall we have a go at it now? - What was that?

2478
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:59,550
(He was so confident.)

2479
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,450
- It was embarrassing. - Seriously.

2480
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:02,280
(He lost without a chance to use his strength.)

2481
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:03,220
His hat flew off.

2482
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,090
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin, you're pitiful.

2483
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:07,160
(Seok Jin's cardigan)

2484
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,690
- Hey. - It was so embarrassing.

2485
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:08,960
- What? - Watch.

2486
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:14,030
("The Return of Jee-rasoni")

2487
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,060
"Hey, Daniel."

2488
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,900
"You think you can beat me, right?"

2489
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,300
(Throwing the cardigan)

2490
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,700
He acted like a fighter.

2491
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:20,430
He acted like a fighter.

2492
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,640
(Fighting barefoot)

2493
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,670
It was so shocking.

2494
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,700
(Ashamed)

2495
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,870
(Checking the camera angle)

2496
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,740
- "Let's do it here." - "Bring it on."

2497
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,980
(He was out in 10 seconds.)

2498
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,880
("The Return of Jee-rasoni," the end)

2499
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:34,950
(The match was like a comedy skit.)

2500
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:36,780
(Bawling)

2501
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,920
He lost in a pitiful way.

2502
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:38,820
But Seok Jin...

2503
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:40,050
- did come close. - Yes.

2504
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,360
- No. - Seok Jin, try again.

2505
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,490
- Seok Jin. - It isn't like that.

2506
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,760
- I didn't use all of my strength. - You should've grabbed him here.

2507
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,330
Seriously, I didn't use all of my strength.

2508
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:48,160
- Really? Why did you do that? - You should've grabbed him here.

2509
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:51,070
(Jee-rasoni still has pride to uphold.)

2510
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,330
It was so funny.

2511
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:50,900
- Come here. I'll help you. - Seok Jin.

2512
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:51,930
The situation was so funny.

2513
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:53,100
- Listen. - For goodness' sake.

2514
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,770
Watch the episode when it airs.

2515
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,140
- You tried so hard to win. - It was so embarrassing.

2516
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:03,140
(The look of giving his all)

2517
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:01,710
No.

2518
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,810
- You lost in a pitiful way. - Seriously.

2519
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,380
It was so pitiful.

2520
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,610
No. Come here.

2521
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:07,850
- Seriously. - Let's try again.

2522
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:09,050
- Again? - Yes.

2523
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:10,920
- Shall we try again? - Yes, let's try again.

2524
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:12,550
- Seok Jin. - Stop it.

2525
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,260
- Stop it, Seok Jin. - I underestimated him.

2526
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:18,960
(The pride race, a rematch for revenge)

2527
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,560
Will they have another go?

2528
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:17,060
- Seok Jin. - The race...

2529
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:18,730
- starts now. - Starts now.

2530
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:20,930
(The camera is on.)

2531
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:20,760
It's the second match.

2532
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:22,960
- Seok Jin. - Let's go, Seok Jin.

2533
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:23,630
(Kyeong Hwan's camera)

2534
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:23,970
Seok Jin, you got this.

2535
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:26,630
(Will he gets his revenge in the 2nd round?)

2536
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:25,670
Seok Jin, attack right away.

2537
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,270
- All right. - This is romantic.

2538
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:29,270
This is romantic.

2539
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:31,410
(Seok Jin attacks first this time as well.)

2540
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:30,940
This is romantic.

2541
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,010
I shouldn't go in there prematurely.

2542
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:33,810
(Slapping)

2543
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:35,940
That's right.

2544
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:39,010
(Jee-rasoni shows off some clever techniques.)

2545
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:37,710
- No, that's a technique. - Go.

2546
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,580
- That's a technique. - That's a technique.

2547
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,550
- You need a technique like this. - Is that so?

2548
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,450
(Smug)

2549
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,520
- It'll begin once he gets caught. - Daniel, you need to win.

2550
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,560
His arms are long.

2551
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,860
- It'll begin once he gets caught. - Daniel, you need to win.

2552
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:49,960
His arms are long.

2553
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:50,960
- Oh, my. - There they go.

2554
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,260
(Seok Jin gets wrapped up in Daniel's long arms.)

2555
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:54,400
(Slapping)

2556
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,300
Do it with seriousness.

2557
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:58,230
(He stretches his hand toward the name tag.)

2558
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,370
Do it with seriousness.

2559
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,970
- Someone should stop them. - Grab the name tag.

2560
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,540
(He just needs to rip it off now!)

2561
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,600
- Someone should stop them. - Grab the name tag.

2562
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:06,440
- His arms are too short. - I know. They're too short.

2563
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:09,580
(He misses it!)

2564
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,840
- His arms are too short. - I know.

2565
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,410
- They're too short. - Come on!

2566
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:13,650
(Groaning)

2567
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:15,750
(What?)

2568
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,550
Come on!

2569
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,050
(He got his name tag ripped off again.)

2570
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:19,550
What was that?

2571
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,520
Come on.

2572
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,090
Seok Jin is out.

2573
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,060
(Seok Jin is out again.)

2574
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,630
Seok Jin is out.

2575
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,330
- What was that? - Daniel, stop it!

2576
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:28,760
- Seok Jin, I'm sorry. - Don't torment Seok Jin.

2577
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,600
- It was so embarrassing. - Seok Jin.

2578
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,930
Seok Jin, are you okay?

2579
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:33,530
- His arms were too short. - Your neck is scratched.

2580
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:34,800
His arms were too short.

2581
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,300
- Seok Jin, I'm sorry. - His arms were too short.

2582
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,770
- It was because of the name tag. - What should I do?

2583
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:38,970
Are you okay?

2584
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:41,380
(The back of his neck turned red.)

2585
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:41,040
- Hey. - Are you okay?

2586
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:42,780
It's a wound of glory.

2587
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:44,810
You punk.

2588
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:46,610
- Put your cardigan back on. - Seok Jin, I'm sorry.

2589
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,050
- Seok Jin, I'm sorry. - Hurry up and put it back on.

2590
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,620
(He quickly covers it with the cardigan.)

2591
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:49,550
- Seriously. - He needs his cardigan.

2592
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:50,820
Put it back on.

2593
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,590
Seok Jin, take a seat.

2594
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:55,120
- What was that? - Nothing happened, okay?

2595
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:55,860
(Feeling sorry)

2596
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,260
- Seok Jin. - Hey, let's listen to music.

2597
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,190
- His neck is scratched. - His neck is scratched.

2598
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:00,390
(The name tag slightly scratched his skin.)

2599
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:00,930
- We had many such wounds... - Hey.

2600
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:03,060
- back then. - It's only a small wound.

2601
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,700
- Gosh, Seok Jin. - I'm sorry.

2602
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,430
It's nothing, you punk.

2603
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:07,800
- We had bigger wounds. - Seok Jin.

2604
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,700
I bet you'll do this during a shower.

2605
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,870
(Screaming)

2606
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,970
- Hey. - I'm so sorry.

2607
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:16,940
(His heart was scratched deeper than his neck.)

2608
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:15,540
- Put some ointment on it. - Don't be sorry, you punk.

2609
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,650
I'll put it back on.

2610
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,780
(He returns Seok Jin's name tag.)

2611
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:20,250
- Seok Jin. - He can't wear his cardigan...

2612
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,380
because his hands are shaking.

2613
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,720
(My stomach hurts.)

2614
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:23,380
- I can skip my abs workout today. - It was...

2615
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,550
It was the most pitiful sight I had seen...

2616
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:27,860
- in the past five years. - It was really pitiful.

2617
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:29,490
(The Tongyeong match that made everyone laugh is over.)

2618
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,290
Let's go to bed.

2619
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:30,560
- Seriously. - All right.

2620
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:31,960
- Okay. - Let's go to bed.

2621
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:33,830
(Everyone is going to bed.)

2622
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,090
- Let's wrap it up. - Thank you for your hard work.

2623
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:35,100
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

2624
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,400
Seok Jin, it was fun.

2625
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,700
- It was fun. - It was fun.

2626
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,330
- Seok Jin, I'm sorry. - No.

2627
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,670
(So cool)

2628
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:40,770
Why would you apologize, you punk?

2629
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,670
- That's right. It's perfect. - Yes.

2630
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:42,970
(Luxury single room: Jae Seok, Standard single room: Kyeong Hwan)

2631
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:44,140
- You're right. - Really?

2632
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,670
(3-person room: Jong Kook, Haha, Daniel)

2633
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,570
- This is it. - That's right.

2634
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:48,140
(4-person room: Seok Jin, Se Chan, Ji Hyo, Ye Eun)

2635
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:47,680
- Here... - Let's lay out the blankets.

2636
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,050
(Se Chan and Seok Jin are getting ready to go to bed.)

2637
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:53,250
Gosh, that was so funny.

2638
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:54,580
I'm so annoyed.

2639
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,090
(Laughing sadly)

2640
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:01,820
Why did I lose?

2641
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:03,020
He's an easy target.

2642
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,290
- You... - I went in.

2643
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:06,460
- When you went in... - I...

2644
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,330
I shouldn't have gone in first.

2645
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,260
If we try it again...

2646
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:12,130
Come on in.

2647
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,370
Come on in.

2648
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:14,870
- I'm here, right? - Come on in.

2649
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:18,610
(Jee-rasoni is reviewing the battle that just took place.)

2650
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:16,900
I should've grabbed this part.

2651
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,170
- That's right. - I should've grabbed this part.

2652
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:21,110
I should've reached with my hand and grabbed the name tag.

2653
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:22,940
- But I went in first. - Then he grabbed you...

2654
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:26,350
(Attacking first didn't help him.)

2655
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:24,880
- like this. - Yes. That was what happened.

2656
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,150
My strategy failed.

2657
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:29,780
For goodness' sake.

2658
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:33,550
(Meanwhile, people in the 3-person room...)

2659
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,790
(are watching Haha's thigh show.)

2660
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:39,030
Watch carefully.

2661
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:42,960
(The winner laughs without much thought.)

2662
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:45,200
(The loser is serious.)

2663
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,630
Seok Jin, you should analyze the match.

2664
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:47,030
I have the video.

2665
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,200
- There he goes. - That's right.

2666
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,440
(They even have a video analysis.)

2667
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:53,110
See, Seok Jin?

2668
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:54,280
Seok Jin.

2669
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:56,410
(He's a strategy analyst.)

2670
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,340
- Do you see that? - Yes.

2671
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:56,680
- He grabbed you. - Yes.

2672
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,710
(Shaking)

2673
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:05,490
(They fail to analyze the video since it's too funny.)

2674
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,620
He lost.

2675
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,060
There's no such thing as failure.

2676
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,290
(Laughing)

2677
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,030
There is only success...

2678
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:15,460
- and the journey. - That's right.

2679
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,260
- That's right. - This is a journey to success.

2680
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:19,230
(While Seok Jin comforts himself,)

2681
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:25,240
(Tongyeong Prince puts a sheet mask on his face.)

2682
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:31,450
(He grooms himself carefully while listening to a pop song.)

2683
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:28,110
It's so nice.

2684
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,480
(Humming)

2685
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:42,260
(Current time: 11:28pm)

2686
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:44,960
(Kyeong Hwan and Jae Seok prepare to go to bed comfortably...)

2687
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,530
(since they're in a single room.)

2688
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,660
- What are you going to do tomorrow? - About what?

2689
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:50,800
Are you going to get up early?

2690
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:54,770
We need to know the time to set up an alarm or something.

2691
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:53,330
(The rules of the morning mission)

2692
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:58,970
(The car will arrive at an uncertain time.)

2693
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:57,070
- Right? - I think we should wake up...

2694
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:58,940
around 5:30am or 6am.

2695
01:08:58,940 --> 01:08:59,940
- When? - Isn't that too early?

2696
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:04,040
(They have to guess when the car will arrive.)

2697
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:01,480
But if we wake up at 6am...

2698
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,880
only to have the vehicle come at 7am,

2699
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:05,710
it'll be annoying, right?

2700
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:07,410
Ji Hyo, are you going to wake up early tomorrow?

2701
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:09,550
Ye Eun and I are going to place first.

2702
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:09,820
(Motivated)

2703
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:10,890
At what time are you going to wake up?

2704
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,020
About 5am.

2705
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,790
- I'm going to wake up at 4am. - Don't lie.

2706
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:15,090
You can't wake up at 5am.

2707
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:18,060
(Se Chan's strategy: Sacrifice sleep and wake up early to be on standby)

2708
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,260
- I mean, at 4am. - I'm going to wake up at 4am.

2709
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,730
I'm really going to wake up at 4am.

2710
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:19,230
- I'm just going to sleep. - Okay.

2711
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:21,360
- Seok Jin, I won't wake you up. - Don't wake me up.

2712
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,630
Seok Jin, I feel like I'm on a family retreat.

2713
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:26,970
- Right. - It's nice.

2714
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:27,270
(Conflicted)

2715
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:30,340
(His reaction feels a bit empty.)

2716
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,070
But...

2717
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:30,840
- While it's a family retreat... - A family retreat?

2718
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,370
- A family retreat. - While it's a family retreat,

2719
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:33,470
Dad...

2720
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,040
had a fight with the dad of the neighboring family...

2721
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,610
- and lost. - Seriously.

2722
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:39,580
That's why the atmosphere is bad.

2723
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:42,420
(Father Jee is disheartened.)

2724
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:41,580
We'll go to bed.

2725
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:42,650
He's annoyed.

2726
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,390
(Watching the video)

2727
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,620
He lost.

2728
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:50,490
(Laughing)

2729
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,590
He lost.

2730
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:52,360
What?

2731
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:54,830
(Laughing)

2732
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,900
Se Chan, what's so funny?

2733
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,600
Let's go to bed.

2734
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,530
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

2735
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:00,700
Let's turn off the light.

2736
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,700
- Where is the switch? - Where is it?

2737
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:04,440
(Current time: 12:10am)

2738
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,210
- Is it this one? - This place is nice and cozy.

2739
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:08,480
(Each of them goes to bed now.)

2740
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:06,370
How nice.

2741
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:07,910
- Ye Eun, lie down. - Okay, Ji Hyo.

2742
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:12,980
(Cackling)

2743
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:10,580
He's insane.

2744
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:12,610
- Let's watch it together. - Seok Jin,

2745
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,850
this video makes me so happy from 24 seconds onward.

2746
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:22,790
(Thus, the night deepens in Tongyeong.)

2747
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,450
All right.

2748
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:20,120
- Hey. - Good night.

2749
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,260
- Okay. - Good night.

2750
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,290
Okay.

2751
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:25,790
(Current time: 1:11am)

2752
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:29,800
(Groaning)

2753
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,470
(Grinding his teeth)

2754
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:34,500
(Sighing)

2755
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:38,740
(Cock-a-doodle-doo)

2756
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:38,570
For goodness' sake.

2757
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:41,840
(Snoring)

2758
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,510
(Sighing)

2759
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,750
(Unlike Seok Jin's room that's full of groaning,)

2760
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:52,450
(morning begins quietly in Tongyeong.)

2761
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:54,190
(Current time: 4:37am)

2762
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:58,460
(Someone comes out early in the morning.)

2763
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:01,200
(It's Se Chan!)

2764
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:02,930
Is it over? Is it not here?

2765
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,160
(Is the vehicle not here?)

2766
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,970
(It's currently 4:37am.)

2767
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:06,770
It isn't time yet.

2768
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:09,240
(The car hasn't shown up yet.)

2769
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:07,800
Where is the location?

2770
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,970
It's where the food truck was.

2771
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:10,970
- Where? - But it isn't here yet.

2772
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:13,370
- Here? - Yes.

2773
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:12,210
(Se Chan's current location)

2774
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:16,310
(The parking spot for the arriving car)

2775
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:14,980
The vehicle isn't here yet, so you can go back inside...

2776
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,240
and sleep some more.

2777
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,250
I didn't sleep a wink.

2778
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:19,950
I'm serious.

2779
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,550
Seok Jin snores too much.

2780
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,050
Seriously, I forgot about that.

2781
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:26,550
Seok Jin snores and grinds his teeth.

2782
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:27,620
He grinds his teeth.

2783
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:28,890
I forgot about that.

2784
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,590
We had an announcement earlier, right?

2785
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:31,960
There wasn't an announcement.

2786
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,690
- What announcement? - What did you hear?

2787
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:34,960
What announcement?

2788
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,300
"Now,"

2789
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:37,430
"we'll begin..."

2790
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:40,800
"the morning mission." Didn't you make that announcement?

2791
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:44,270
- I think you were dreaming. - I must've been stressed out.

2792
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:45,040
(It looks like Se Chan had a nightmare.)

2793
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:46,670
I can't sleep in that room.

2794
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:47,170
(And soon...)

2795
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:50,340
(Escapees of the room, Ji Hyo...)

2796
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,810
Ye Eun, hurry up.

2797
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:53,410
(and Ye Eun join.)

2798
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,320
I didn't sleep a wink.

2799
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,190
Seriously, that rooster crows too much.

2800
01:11:56,850 --> 01:12:00,820
(It's 4:51am. The car hasn't arrived yet.)

2801
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,620
It just kept crowing.

2802
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,860
We'll attach the microphone.

2803
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:06,460
(They wear their microphones with bloated faces.)

2804
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,560
Seriously.

2805
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,560
The staff members look unhappy because we came out too early.

2806
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,530
We're sorry.

2807
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,740
(Current time: 4:57am)

2808
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,240
Everyone...

2809
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:20,210
(The three of them came out earlier than the staff members expected.)

2810
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,340
Seok Jin...

2811
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:21,380
didn't let us sleep.

2812
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:24,040
I'm sorry, but I'm going to place first.

2813
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:25,610
I'm also going to place first.

2814
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:27,780
(Only the 1st 2 will be exempt from the penalty.)

2815
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,280
You should yield for the two of us.

2816
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:31,350
I didn't get any sleep.

2817
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:33,120
I won't go easy on anyone...

2818
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:35,490
- because I'm angry. - Hey, Seok Jin is the only one...

2819
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:37,560
who got sleep in that room.

2820
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:42,430
(He's still in a deep sleep.)

2821
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,700
(Grinding)

2822
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,100
(Snoring)

2823
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:50,700
Where did Ye Eun go, Myung Jae?

2824
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:55,580
Do you know when the vehicle is coming?

2825
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:57,140
- What? The vehicle? - The vehicle.

2826
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,680
(Ddochi gets information from the production crew.)

2827
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,110
We didn't get any information.

2828
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:01,750
Can we stay here?

2829
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:04,650
- Can we stay here? - You need to stand by indoors.

2830
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:08,460
(You can't stand by outdoors for a prolonged period of time.)

2831
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:07,020
Right.

2832
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,760
(Se Chan goes to the waiting room.)

2833
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:14,930
(Ye Eun also goes back without any information.)

2834
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:19,200
Ye Eun, were you crying?

2835
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,300
Seriously.

2836
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,400
- You're as white as a sheet. - By the way, Ye Eun,

2837
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,270
you can't just stand outside.

2838
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:27,110
That's why I came back.

2839
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:30,940
(The chestnut seller has a frigid attitude.)

2840
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:33,210
Standing there is cheating.

2841
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:34,920
- So I came back. - Okay.

2842
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,550
Jae Seok woke up.

2843
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,850
- For goodness' sake. - Oh, no.

2844
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:40,390
(Jae Seok gets up at 5:10am.)

2845
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,720
(Clicking)

2846
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:48,030
(He can't find the switch for the bathroom light.)

2847
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,800
Is he at a club? Why is he moving around so much?

2848
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:57,740
(Current time: 5:11am)

2849
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:54,330
Everyone will wake up.

2850
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:56,400
- Seriously. - Maybe all three of us will fail.

2851
01:13:57,770 --> 01:14:01,580
(They get an ominous feeling.)

2852
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,740
Why isn't the vehicle coming?

2853
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:03,180
It'll be over if Haha wakes up.

2854
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:05,210
- Why? - We won't be included in two.

2855
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:06,410
Then a physical fight will ensue.

2856
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:07,920
Seriously. I feel so victimized...

2857
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:09,250
(Worried)

2858
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,620
- when a physical fight ensues. - For the future,

2859
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:11,750
go and sleep for 10 or 15 minutes.

2860
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:13,290
- We can't. - We can't enter that room.

2861
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:15,060
- It's impossible. - Hey.

2862
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:16,590
The beggar came. He's coming this way.

2863
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,720
Impressive.

2864
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:21,400
(At 5:12am, Beggar Ha comes to work.)

2865
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:19,860
This is too much. Haha.

2866
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,530
- Put on the team uniform. - You need to wear the team uniform.

2867
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:23,060
Why are you pretending to be a staff member?

2868
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,800
Jong Kook woke up as well.

2869
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,730
(Jong Kook is here too.)

2870
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,270
- Wait. I might as well just sleep. - We're ruined.

2871
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:35,440
(5 out of 9 have come to work.)

2872
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,710
- Haha. - Isn't it here yet?

2873
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:34,110
- It isn't here yet. - Why did you get up so early?

2874
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:35,610
- Why did you get up so early? - I knew that this would happen.

2875
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:37,140
- No one could sleep. - Seriously.

2876
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,950
- We stayed up. - I couldn't sleep since 4am.

2877
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:41,150
(The car isn't here yet.)

2878
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:40,780
- It's over. - I should go back to bed.

2879
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:42,350
The two of you should go back to bed. Seriously.

2880
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:43,350
I feel so victimized.

2881
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:45,250
Jong Kook will place first. I'll tell you in advance.

2882
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:47,250
Then Haha and I will pull some kind of a trick...

2883
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,860
and place second. You should know that.

2884
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:49,060
(Threatening)

2885
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:51,490
- Jong Kook, please help me. - What?

2886
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,590
Please help me.

2887
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:56,230
Why is your face so shiny?

2888
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:57,430
(She starts pleading out of the blue.)

2889
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:57,300
- I applied lotion. - What?

2890
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,630
- I applied lotion. - I see.

2891
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,030
Please help me this once.

2892
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:02,370
(Pleading)

2893
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,670
Please use your strength to subdue them.

2894
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,270
- I can't help you. - Jong Kook.

2895
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:09,480
Then you should get a spot.

2896
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,040
Do you want a spot?

2897
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,780
(She looks especially pitiful today.)

2898
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,210
Look at her eyes. She needs a spot.

2899
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,650
- Her eyes... She's crying. - What is it?

2900
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:17,280
- She's crying. - Please help me.

2901
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:21,220
- Hey. - Hey.

2902
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,390
(Actor Ji even uses fake tears.)

2903
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:24,060
- Hey, tears are cheating. - Hey.

2904
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:27,330
Jong Kook, would you use your strength...

2905
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:28,800
- to subdue them? - I can't...

2906
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:31,100
What's up with your face?

2907
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:33,400
I thought you were Kim Hee Ae.

2908
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,570
Hey.

2909
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,440
- It's my skincare routine. - Really?

2910
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:37,910
(Her unique skincare routine)

2911
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:37,940
It's different.

2912
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:41,040
Hold on. Wasn't that Jae Seok's cough just now?

2913
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,410
- Jae Seok woke up earlier. - Jae Seok woke up earlier...

2914
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:43,910
- and took a shower. - I think he did a half bath.

2915
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:45,450
- Did he take a shower? - Yes.

2916
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:47,250
(Current time: 5:31am)

2917
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:51,750
(Jae Seok even showered during the morning commotion.)

2918
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,580
He's unbelievable.

2919
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:51,350
Why did he take a shower at this hour?

2920
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:56,960
(He gets to work in a clean state after his morning routine.)

2921
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,690
Jae Seok, come here.

2922
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:03,600
We won't get to determine the winners.

2923
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,270
- Of course not. - Jae Seok.

2924
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:07,670
- Did you sleep at all? - Barely.

2925
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:09,640
(Current time: 5:32am)

2926
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:08,740
- Right? - Yes.

2927
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,540
Why did you act out so early in the morning?

2928
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:11,570
I watched some shorts.

2929
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:13,770
That's what makes you an amateur.

2930
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:15,810
You should've gotten enough sleep before acting out.

2931
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:21,650
(Jae Seok pretends to be sharp when he woke up at the usual time.)

2932
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,010
I mean...

2933
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:21,080
You should've gotten enough sleep before acting out.

2934
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,680
We came out at 4am, but it didn't work.

2935
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,550
Of course not. It needs to be past 5am.

2936
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:26,850
(It's already past 5am.)

2937
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:25,720
It needs to be past 5:30am.

2938
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,790
Come here.

2939
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,960
Here's what we've decided to do.

2940
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:29,060
(Including Jae Seok, who is in good condition,)

2941
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:31,220
(6 out of 9 people are up.)

2942
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:30,520
Should I just go back to bed?

2943
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,360
Competition will be a hassle.

2944
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,590
- Everyone is awake. - Welcome.

2945
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:36,600
(Daniel enters as well.)

2946
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:39,100
Hey, did something happen last night?

2947
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:42,070
- He looks like he's in his 50s. - You suddenly became a burglar.

2948
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:42,840
(Who are you?)

2949
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:43,970
- He looks like he's in his 20s. - Hey, why...

2950
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,310
(Just how?)

2951
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:46,010
- He definitely isn't in his 20s. - His 20s.

2952
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:50,080
Seok Jin made the best decision.

2953
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:51,880
- What? - Seok Jin decided to sleep.

2954
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,250
- That's impressive. - He decided to sleep until 8am.

2955
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:56,150
(Seok Sam is the real winner.)

2956
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:56,050
He looked after his health.

2957
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,820
I forgot. We have Kyeong Hwan on the show today, right?

2958
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:00,890
- Yes. - He has guts.

2959
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,360
(Kyeong Hwan, Seok Jin)

2960
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,960
(It's currently 5:35am. Everyone woke up except for 2.)

2961
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:07,890
Maybe I should go back to bed.

2962
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:10,960
(At what time will the vehicle come?)

2963
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:09,930
We won't get to determine the winners.
Right?

2964
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:14,870
(Since it's the 1st 2, the probability is too low.)

2965
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:13,970
Ye Eun, we don't have a chance.

2966
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,800
Can't we have a draw instead?

2967
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,800
- I want to do that, to be honest. - I want to have a draw.

2968
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,040
Let's have a draw instead.

2969
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,910
- Jae Seok. - Jae Seok.

2970
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:23,440
(Someone even suggests to decide through lucky draw.)

2971
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:22,280
- Yes? - Jae Seok.

2972
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,410
Let's have a draw and send some people back inside.

2973
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:26,850
We have a suggestion.

2974
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:28,550
(Right then, the production crew makes a suggestion.)

2975
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:29,280
- We said two people could get in. - Yes.

2976
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,180
But all of you are here.

2977
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,690
- You'll go back inside the room. - Okay.

2978
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,590
We'll allow three people in total.

2979
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:35,520
(Increasing the number to 3 from 2)

2980
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:35,960
- Really? - Two people will be exempt.

2981
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,060
(1st and 2nd: Exempted from penalty, 3rd: Chances of penalty go down)

2982
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,360
One person will get a lower probability.

2983
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,290
- That means I have to fight for it. - Let's say you decide on a time...

2984
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:41,600
(New rule: When they come out after waiting...)

2985
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:40,290
and come out of the room.

2986
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:42,460
If the vehicle isn't there, you need to go back.

2987
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,930
(and if the car isn't there, they fail.)

2988
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,900
- I see. - Do you only get one chance?

2989
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,470
- You only get one chance. - It's Game of Wits.

2990
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:48,140
(They have only one chance.)

2991
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:46,800
- That's right. - One chance each.

2992
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,770
If the vehicle isn't here when you come, you're out.

2993
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:52,970
(They'll be eliminated if there is no car waiting when they come out.)

2994
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:50,840
- You're out. - Okay.

2995
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,210
- This is entertaining. - This is fun.

2996
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:53,340
- That's right. One chance. - It puts me at ease.

2997
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:56,310
(They move back to their caravans first.)

2998
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,840
- Everyone will get a chance. - Okay. Let's go.

2999
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,880
It's better than going back and forth.

3000
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:58,110
Maybe it'll be an electric car that doesn't make any sounds.

3001
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:58,710
(New rule: When they come out after waiting...)

3002
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:00,080
- A hydrogen car. - You only get one chance.

3003
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:01,450
(and if the car isn't there, they fail. They get only 1 chance.)

3004
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,110
- Okay. - Okay.

3005
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:02,350
At what time will it come?

3006
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:05,720
(At 5:41am, they wait in their rooms.)

3007
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:04,250
I need to look at the clock.

3008
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:05,950
How will I decide on the time?

3009
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:07,350
What time is it now?

3010
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:11,260
(The trio entered another room to not wake Seok Jin up.)

3011
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:10,120
I'll tell you this.

3012
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:11,760
Give me some tips.

3013
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:13,660
- The time... - How about 6am?

3014
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:15,400
It'll be too cliched if it's 6am.

3015
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:18,970
I'll leave a bit after 6am.

3016
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:20,700
Same here.

3017
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,370
I think it'll be a quarter past.

3018
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:24,770
A quarter past?

3019
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:26,240
Please.

3020
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,410
Se Chan, hurry up and pray.

3021
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:32,580
(The 3 of them were the 1st to wake up.)

3022
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:29,910
You're Christian.

3023
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:35,150
Do you know what'd be the most annoying situation?

3024
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,720
Let's say Kyeong Hwan or Seok Jin finally wakes up...

3025
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,420
and goes, "I need to do the morning mission."

3026
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:40,790
If they come out to find the vehicle,

3027
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,860
- it'll be pure luck. - It's like that idiom.

3028
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:45,560
- It means they suit the show. - Ripping profits from the others?

3029
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,190
(Not confident)

3030
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,060
Ripping profits from the others?

3031
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:49,960
(Wary)

3032
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:49,600
- I guess it's incorrect. - It isn't exactly fitting.

3033
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:52,370
It's that idiom. A shrimp's back bursts from the whales' fight.

3034
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:53,900
It isn't fitting either.

3035
01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:58,240
It's fitting. We're like the fighting whales...

3036
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,970
and he... I guess it's incorrect.

3037
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,540
You look like a shrimp today.

3038
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:06,250
(While the three of them speak nonsense)

3039
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:07,110
I'll probably hear the car.

3040
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:11,550
(Jae Seok decides to go out by listening to the sounds.)

3041
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:09,820
I'll probably hear the car.

3042
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:14,150
All right.

3043
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:15,490
Is now the time?

3044
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:19,330
(Haha decides to go with his hunch.)

3045
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,190
Shall I go out?

3046
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:27,130
(Current time: 5:52am)

3047
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,700
Haha, go out.

3048
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,170
- We only get one chance. - Yes.

3049
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:30,300
(Haha gets up.)

3050
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,410
Haha, will you go out right away?

3051
01:19:34,410 --> 01:19:35,510
My heart is beating fast.

3052
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:37,880
Haha, will you go out now? It isn't even 6am.

3053
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,010
(Current time: 5:53am)

3054
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:40,010
It's 5:53am.

3055
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:44,250
(It's an awkward time.)

3056
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:41,920
What? I hear the van.

3057
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,490
(Opening)

3058
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,220
- Are you going? - I'm going.

3059
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:48,560
Are you going?

3060
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,160
(Haha picks 5:53am!)

3061
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:53,860
Did he start the mission?

3062
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:58,730
(If the vehicle isn't there, he'll receive the penalty.)

3063
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:02,800
(Will the vehicle be there at 5:53am?)

3064
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,110
All right.

3065
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:06,510
Look at him!

3066
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:12,180
(A grasshopper is sitting on the window.)

3067
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,580
Hey, I'm practically a rooster.

3068
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:19,420
(There's a reason why Rooster Yu is sitting on a perch.)

3069
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:17,520
I'm sitting on a perch.

3070
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:20,690
I can see the location from here.

3071
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:24,320
(Jae Seok's room, Kyeong Hwan's room, parking lot)

3072
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:23,660
I can see the location from here.

3073
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:28,800
(The parking lot is visible from the two single rooms!)

3074
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,170
(He secures an escape route right away.)

3075
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,100
Okay.

3076
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:33,100
Okay. I got it.

3077
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,640
(He began keeping watch just like that.)

3078
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:36,400
My room is the best.

3079
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,270
I'll be able to see the vehicle right away.

3080
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:39,640
(Jae Seok's room, Kyeong Hwan's room)

3081
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:43,810
(The location of the single rooms is like a cheat code.)

3082
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:42,780
Other people can't see the parking lot from their rooms.

3083
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,680
- Seriously. - Isn't the location the best?

3084
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,820
It's insane.

3085
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:54,490
(Jae Seok's presence means...)

3086
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:52,790
Did you come out already?

3087
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,190
I don't think the vehicle has come.

3088
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,160
(no vehicle.)

3089
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:57,390
I don't think the vehicle has come.

3090
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:59,060
Haha, you failed.

3091
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:02,400
Has anyone else failed?

3092
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:03,800
You were the first to come out.

3093
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,900
Was I the first to come out?

3094
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:08,840
(Haha moves to the waiting room.)

3095
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,030
I feel relieved.

3096
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,100
Gosh, look at him.

3097
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,810
He should've come out at 6am.

3098
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:17,210
(Current time: 5:54am)

3099
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:17,510
The location of Jae Seok's room is insane.

3100
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:21,920
(At what time will the vehicle show up?)

3101
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:18,710
It has the best location.

3102
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:20,680
The location is unbelievable.

3103
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:24,550
(Daniel looks outside the window.)

3104
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,350
Jong Kook, Seok Jin is up.

3105
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:27,620
- What? - Seok Jin is up.

3106
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:29,260
(Seok Jin is up?)

3107
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:29,060
- Seok Jin is awake? - Yes.

3108
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,660
(Seok Jin finally wakes up.)

3109
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:35,200
(Current time: 5:55am)

3110
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:34,190
Everyone went out.

3111
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:39,230
(The entire family left overnight.)

3112
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:43,700
(It's still first-come, first-served. He has woken up!)

3113
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:43,540
They're gone.

3114
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,770
(Will Seok Sam get the opportunity?)

3115
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:45,570
Seok Jin. Amazing.

3116
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,880
When is it coming? My butt hurts.

3117
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:51,480
(Meanwhile, Chicken Yu is hanging for 15 minutes.)

3118
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:53,050
There are three minutes left. Will he come at 6am?

3119
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:58,390
(It became 6am.)

3120
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:02,360
It's here. It came.

3121
01:22:04,690 --> 01:22:06,730
(The car came.)

3122
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:08,230
It's going to the side. Is it not for us?

3123
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:10,530
(The car arrived at exactly 6am.)

3124
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,900
The van is here.

3125
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,370
It's here.

3126
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,070
(Hopping)

3127
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:16,470
(He turned into a grasshopper from a chicken.)

3128
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,240
(He runs with all his strength.)

3129
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:20,970
This is the van, right?

3130
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,780
(Happy)

3131
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:23,880
- This is the van, right? - Yes.

3132
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:25,780
(Thanks to the super benefit of using a single room)

3133
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:25,380
This...

3134
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:28,950
(Yu Jae Seok succeeds in getting 1st place.)

3135
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:35,260
(1st and 2nd: Exempted from penalty, 3rd: Chances of penalty go down)

3136
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:32,920
Goodness.

3137
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:35,720
It was exactly 6am.

3138
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:37,090
It was 6am.

3139
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:38,930
(The answer was 6am!)

3140
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:42,930
(Meanwhile, Seok Sam came out right before.)

3141
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,960
What is this? There's no one.

3142
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,330
Why is there no one here?

3143
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:50,100
(Writer)

3144
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:47,970
The rule changed...

3145
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:50,200
- while you were sleeping. - Yes.

3146
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:53,540
(Sharing a revised rule with Seok Sam)

3147
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:53,810
Everyone except you is awake and waiting.

3148
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:55,210
- Everyone but me? - Yes.

3149
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:56,610
Goodness.

3150
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:00,350
(Sharing the rule with Kyeong Hwan who got up at the same time)

3151
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:59,680
While you were sleeping,

3152
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:02,220
- one rule changed. - Okay.

3153
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:03,650
(Everyone is awake now.)

3154
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:06,020
It's 6am. Go out quickly. What are you doing?

3155
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,290
What time do you expect the van to come?

3156
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,290
Wouldn't it be 6am?

3157
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,890
(Correct)

3158
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,560
But I won't go out at 6am.

3159
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,060
That's too obvious.

3160
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:23,400
(Seok Jin thinks it wouldn't be 6am.)

3161
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:22,300
I don't think it would leave at an obvious time.

3162
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:27,170
(Jong Kook thinks the same.)

3163
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:27,840
That rooster is crowing too much.

3164
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:29,810
What time would it come?

3165
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:32,810
I think it will start from 6am.

3166
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:37,320
I'm going out at 6am.

3167
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:40,750
(Ye Eun will go out now.)

3168
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,390
Should I go?

3169
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:43,690
(Moving)

3170
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:47,830
(Daniel is packing his things.)

3171
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:52,930
I'll go out at 6am sharp. The van will come.

3172
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:52,630
(Among them, including Se Chan who talks a lot,)

3173
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,870
(will the person in 2nd place come out?)

3174
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:58,610
(Someone came out!)

3175
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:00,740
Is that the van?

3176
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,180
He's seriously...

3177
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:04,910
Is that the van?

3178
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:06,980
(It's Jee Seok Jin!)

3179
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:07,250
He's seriously...

3180
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:09,120
It's an amazing story.

3181
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,320
- I think it's that van. - He got it by chance.

3182
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,790
After sleeping so well?

3183
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:14,450
(Dumbfounded)

3184
01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:19,160
But I won't go out at 6am. That's too obvious.

3185
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:19,430
(He surely said that he didn't think it would be 6am.)

3186
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:22,330
I don't think it would leave at an obvious time.

3187
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,600
I'll go out at 6am.

3188
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:32,910
(As if he's suddenly possessed by something,)

3189
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:32,170
I'll go out at 6am.

3190
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:35,980
(he suddenly starts saying it's 6am.)

3191
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:36,110
I think it's right to leave at 6am.

3192
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:37,640
Seok Sam.

3193
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:40,350
(Just like that, he took 2nd place luckily.)

3194
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,080
How...

3195
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,180
- Hey. - Seok Jin.

3196
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,920
- Amazing. - Why are you so lucky?

3197
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,020
I'm not lucky. I had a hunch that it would be 6am.

3198
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,890
They've not been sleeping since 4am.

3199
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:46,920
Why didn't they come?

3200
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:50,920
(1st and 2nd: Exempted from penalty, 3rd: Chances of penalty go down)

3201
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,860
- He's really... - Things might work out well today.

3202
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:51,020
I thought you were done.

3203
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:53,830
(There's only one spot left.)

3204
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:53,090
There's one person left.

3205
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:55,300
I'll go out now.

3206
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,830
Heo Kyeong Hwan. It's Heo Kyeong Hwan!

3207
01:24:57,830 --> 01:24:59,900
All the people who slept well are coming out.

3208
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:02,200
I'll go out now.

3209
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:03,940
(Kyeong Hwan gets ready to go out.)

3210
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,070
This is all about fate.

3211
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:11,240
(Daniel also gets up at the same time!)

3212
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,010
What is it? Are you going?

3213
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:13,710
I'll go out.

3214
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,620
- I'll go out. - This is thrilling.

3215
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:21,050
(There's only one spot left.)

3216
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:18,890
Goodness.

3217
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:23,020
At 6:03am or 6:05am. At a weird time.

3218
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:24,690
I'll go out at 6:05am.

3219
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:25,730
At 6:05am?

3220
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:29,600
(Current time: 6:03am)

3221
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:28,130
The 1st and 2nd are completely exempted. So, you and I are...

3222
01:25:28,130 --> 01:25:29,400
- completely exempted. - Goodness.

3223
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,730
- The third gets a benefit. - That's amazing.

3224
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:34,070
(Who will be the last person to be saved?)

3225
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,400
I didn't think you'd come.

3226
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,830
Who would the last person be?

3227
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:38,170
(Someone is coming.)

3228
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,640
- That's... - That's Daniel.

3229
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:39,710
They say enemies meet on a narrow bridge.

3230
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:43,980
(Choi Daniel)

3231
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:44,180
What's going on?

3232
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:45,650
- Enemies meet on a narrow... - Look at...

3233
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:47,450
- Seok Jin. - It was so close.

3234
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:48,920
You met again.

3235
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:52,820
(Jeerasoni met the man he swore to take revenge on.)

3236
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,880
- You meet your enemy... - Play Name Tag Elimination here.

3237
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,250
- Seok Jin. - Play Name Tag Elimination here.

3238
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:54,390
- Seok Jin. - I made an analysis yesterday.

3239
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:56,390
It's here!

3240
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:59,730
(President Tong was just one step behind.)

3241
01:25:58,930 --> 01:26:00,930
- It's here. - It's over.

3242
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,970
(He failed by 15 seconds.)

3243
01:26:03,730 --> 01:26:06,970
- By the way, we're in the van. - We're in the van.

3244
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:08,940
- Jong Kook is coming. - Hey.

3245
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:12,440
(The runner with an out-toed gait also unfortunately fails.)

3246
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:09,970
Jong Kook.

3247
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:12,470
You're all in there?

3248
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:15,280
- It's 6:06am. - It's 6:06am.

3249
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:16,580
(Delivering the news to the three as well)

3250
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,310
Yes.

3251
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:19,210
The three members have already gotten in the van.

3252
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,550
(Exclaiming)

3253
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:21,810
- It was 6:00am. - You failed.

3254
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:25,020
I hate this. What time was it?

3255
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:26,690
It was 6:00am sharp.

3256
01:26:25,290 --> 01:26:26,890
(The answer)

3257
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:28,320
- There was no twist? - That's right.

3258
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:29,790
Who went?

3259
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:32,730
Daniel, Jae Seok, and...

3260
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:35,190
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin?

3261
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:37,300
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin?

3262
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:40,800
(Among the victims of Seok Jin who woke up first,)

3263
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:40,300
Seok Jin?

3264
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:42,700
- Seriously. - I feel so empty.

3265
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:44,240
(none of them survived.)

3266
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,340
Was it 6am?

3267
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,410
Okay. Off you go.

3268
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:46,610
- Okay. - We'll get going.

3269
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:46,940
(The ones who succeeded in the morning mission...)

3270
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:48,010
- Bye. - We'll bring something tasty.

3271
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,110
(set off to buy breakfast.)

3272
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:52,510
Shall we get yesterday's gukbap? Gukbap is best, right?

3273
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,280
(Running along the early morning road before dawn breaks)

3274
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:54,250
- Amazing. - Sundaegukbap looks tasty.

3275
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:56,350
(They arrived at a gukbap place that's open.)

3276
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,620
- Yes. - It's sundaegukbap.

3277
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:56,950
Luckily...

3278
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:59,120
Then give us sundaegukbap.

3279
01:26:57,820 --> 01:27:00,850
(Ordering hot sundaegukbap that will wake them up)

3280
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,690
I'll just have the sundae.

3281
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,520
Why don't you eat with us?

3282
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,160
(To the production crew)

3283
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:04,660
It's on me.

3284
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:07,130
Eating is more important.

3285
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:07,730
(Thanks to Jae Seok, the production crew fill their stomachs as well.)

3286
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:09,560
Just give me 150 dollars. I'll give you a 3-dollar discount.

3287
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:10,300
(The owner)

3288
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,360
No. I'll pay everything.

3289
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:15,130
(He refuses the celebrity discount and goes big with the treat!)

3290
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:15,300
Take one each.

3291
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:17,540
- Take one each. - The day has dawned.

3292
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:21,770
(The red sun came up.)

3293
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,440
The morning glow.

3294
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,810
The day has dawned

3295
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:22,810
Will all the people who didn't make it...
- get a penalty? - Yes.

3296
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:26,110
- No. We'll... - We're candidates. We'll pick.

3297
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:29,120
(At the caravan, they're worried about the penalty.)

3298
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:27,710
How many were there yesterday? Four?

3299
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:29,280
I was lucky until yesterday.

3300
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,820
Would I be able to get exempted today?

3301
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:34,090
Goodness. You would be feeling so empty.

3302
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:36,190
(The winners return with breakfast.)

3303
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:35,120
- Right. It feels empty. - It can happen.

3304
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,260
- It's such a shame. - But Seok Jin...

3305
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:38,560
Seriously. Seok Jin...

3306
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:40,390
(Walking in proudly)

3307
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,690
- Seok Jin is really lucky. - Goodness.

3308
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:41,330
- His luck... - We slept here.

3309
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:42,960
He's a lucky guy.

3310
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:46,630
I woke up and came out, and I found the van there.

3311
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:48,940
Today's winner is Seok Jin.

3312
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:50,170
(The old raccoon's lucky morning)

3313
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:50,640
- Seriously. Seok Jin. - Seok Jin is really...

3314
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,900
I was so lucky.

3315
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,910
We thought it wouldn't be 6am.

3316
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:55,380
- I thought it would be 6:30am. - But you...

3317
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:57,240
The gukbap is really tasty. Try it.

3318
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:58,510
Try it.

3319
01:27:57,340 --> 01:28:00,680
(The gukbap will soothe their bitter heart from their loss.)

3320
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:00,780
- Try it first. - It's amazing.

3321
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:01,980
Let's enjoy the meal.

3322
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:04,050
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

3323
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,520
(Slurping)

3324
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,760
- It's really good. - It's nutty, right?

3325
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,090
We have an extra portion so you can eat more.

3326
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:13,530
- Well done. - Some might not have enough...

3327
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:15,800
(Eating protein)

3328
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:15,290
if we buy according to the number of people.

3329
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:16,300
This is nice.

3330
01:28:16,830 --> 01:28:18,200
- It's good. - Gukbap is the best in the morning.

3331
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,230
- It's really tasty. - Unfortunately...

3332
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:23,270
We went there by chance, but it was a great place.

3333
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:26,710
(They focus on eating, forgetting the penalty for a second.)

3334
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,970
- Try it without the sauce. - This one.

3335
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:29,210
It's seasoned well.

3336
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:32,110
It's good, right? Isn't it really delicious?

3337
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:35,150
I'd put this in my top three foods I've ever had.

3338
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:36,320
It's a great place.

3339
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,350
- It's great, right? - Yes.

3340
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:38,750
- It was luck. - It was a really great restaurant.

3341
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:41,520
I'll explain today's penalty...

3342
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,360
- as you eat. - What's the penalty?

3343
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,790
There were going to be five penalty receivers today.

3344
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:46,230
- Yes. - Yes.

3345
01:28:46,230 --> 01:28:48,430
For the sake of the people who couldn't sleep in the morning,

3346
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:50,500
we'll have one less penalty receiver.

3347
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,660
(For the sake of the members who couldn't sleep in the morning,)

3348
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:51,760
- Thank you. - Well done.

3349
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,270
(the number of penalty takers was reduced to 4.)

3350
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:55,030
We'll decide the penalty receivers using the roulette.

3351
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:55,870
(4 penalty-takers they'll pick through the roulette)

3352
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:56,300
- Roulette. - The 1st and the 2nd...

3353
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,540
who went and bought breakfast,

3354
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:00,640
Jae Seok and Seok Jin, don't have their names on the roulette.

3355
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,010
Seok Jin's name isn't there?

3356
01:29:01,870 --> 01:29:04,610
(Bummer)

3357
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,480
I should have just waited three minutes.

3358
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:05,610
- You would have won if you waited. - I was lucky.

3359
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:07,310
Daniel, in 3rd place, has 1 slot.

3360
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:09,880
- The rest have two slots each. - But...

3361
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,190
- Those who bought the breakfast... - Daniel has...

3362
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:13,050
(Benefit for the members who went to buy breakfast)

3363
01:29:12,190 --> 01:29:14,920
can stick the name of the member you want...

3364
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,760
on the empty slots that had your names.

3365
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,220
When you get chosen to do the penalty,

3366
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:20,260
you have to shuck 20kg of oysters, Tongyeong's specialty,

3367
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:22,100
before you leave work.

3368
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,230
Before leaving work.

3369
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,800
(It takes 5 hours to get to Seoul.)

3370
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:26,930
Shucking oysters.

3371
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:29,440
(They'll get off much later if they get the penalty.)

3372
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,240
It's really hard to shuck oysters.

3373
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:31,240
It's hard because they don't open at once.

3374
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,270
- It doesn't open. - It doesn't open.

3375
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:33,970
You have to struggle with it.

3376
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:36,940
(A penalty the members hate and find the most annoying)

3377
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:36,040
- Twenty kilograms? - Twenty kilograms?

3378
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:37,810
If you've finished,

3379
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:40,550
(Who are the unlucky members whose hands will smell like oysters?)

3380
01:29:37,810 --> 01:29:39,210
- shall I clear the table? - Yes.

3381
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:42,220
Are you going to turn it?

3382
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:43,350
Yes.

3383
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:45,150
- That's how... - Those who were exempted.

3384
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:46,390
(Filling the empty slots before spinning the roulette)

3385
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:47,190
- The empty slots. - Jae Seok, in first place,

3386
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:50,190
can place two names of your choice.

3387
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:51,420
Two names?

3388
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:53,330
- Seok Jin can place two names. - And...

3389
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:54,560
Daniel can stick one.

3390
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:55,930
Can I stick it as well?

3391
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:58,500
(Jae Seok is about to stick the 2 names.)

3392
01:29:57,430 --> 01:29:58,730
- Shall we play rock-paper-scissors? - We three can play.

3393
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:00,430
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - We three...

3394
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:01,700
(Deciding with rock-paper-scissors)

3395
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:02,800
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors!

3396
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,940
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors. Okay.

3397
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:05,370
(Win, lose, win, win, lose)

3398
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:08,370
I'll stick the names of Jong Kook and Ssaebssaeb.

3399
01:30:08,370 --> 01:30:10,310
- Okay. - Why didn't you play?

3400
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:11,310
- Kyeong Hwan. We have to go again. - This...

3401
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:13,050
- We have to do it again. - We have to do it again.

3402
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,810
(President Tong was lost in thought.)

3403
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:14,580
Why?

3404
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:16,280
- You should add his name. - You know,

3405
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,880
- those who don't play lose. - Hey.

3406
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,090
- I didn't know he'd add one more. - If you don't play, you lose.

3407
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:20,850
- I didn't know. - If you don't play, you lose.

3408
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:22,120
- But I didn't know. - Kyeong Hwan.

3409
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,190
Unfortunately...

3410
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:24,560
- Unfortunately... - Unfortunately...

3411
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:25,890
It's added.

3412
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:30,660
(Jong Kook and Kyeong Hwan get a slot each.)

3413
01:30:25,890 --> 01:30:27,330
- His name is added. - I didn't know.

3414
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:29,460
- I get to add two names, right? - Yes.

3415
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,030
And Jong Kook.

3416
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:32,530
I have three slots.

3417
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:34,570
(He got away with it thanks to Kyeong Hwan.)

3418
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:33,670
Kyeong Hwan has 3, and I have 2.

3419
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:38,640
(Time to stick 2 of Seok Sam's name)

3420
01:30:34,770 --> 01:30:36,670
Seok Sam will add one name.

3421
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:38,670
Who are the ones who laughed a lot yesterday?

3422
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:40,940
(Guilty)

3423
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:40,940
You know, I was on your side.

3424
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:42,810
You know I felt really bad for you, right?

3425
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,540
(Lie)

3426
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:44,710
First, I'll exclude the three members...

3427
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:47,180
who couldn't sleep in our room because of my teeth grinding.

3428
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:51,180
(Feeling bad, he excludes Ye Eun, Ji Hyo, and Se Chan.)

3429
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:49,480
I feel bad for them.

3430
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:51,350
- Thank you. - And...

3431
01:30:51,850 --> 01:30:53,090
Daniel isn't here?

3432
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,150
Are you going to add my name?

3433
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:56,490
- You should add Daniel's name. - It's not here.

3434
01:30:55,190 --> 01:30:58,220
(Trying to get revenge again, the one he failed yesterday?)

3435
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:57,520
We should balance the numbers.

3436
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:58,690
- I just got one more. - Daniel is here.

3437
01:30:58,690 --> 01:31:00,230
Seok Jin, I'm in third place.

3438
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:02,830
(Egging on)

3439
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,230
Seok Jin, you should give Daniel one slot.

3440
01:31:02,230 --> 01:31:03,300
You are getting back at him with this.

3441
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:04,800
- Come on. - Seok Jin. Give him one slot.

3442
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:06,800
(Contemplating)

3443
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:05,970
That would make me look cheap.

3444
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:08,300
You should add Daniel's name.

3445
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:09,170
(Half-hearted)

3446
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:09,500
I'd look narrow-minded.

3447
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:11,570
- All right. Kyeong Hwan. - My gosh.

3448
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:11,600
(Kyeong Hwan, 4)

3449
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:15,210
(Kyeong Hwan gets 1 more slot for no reason.)

3450
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,810
- Unfortunately... - Oh, no.

3451
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:15,040
Unfortunately...

3452
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,410
You should pick Daniel to make it fun.

3453
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:17,640
It's fun that way.

3454
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:20,350
(His pride)

3455
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:18,980
I don't want to get revenge on him with this.

3456
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:20,610
- I should fight him fairly. - It was just a game.

3457
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:21,980
You're scared, aren't you?

3458
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,950
Two. I'll pick Haha.

3459
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:23,920
(Hurt)

3460
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,520
(Haha gets 1 more slot.)

3461
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:25,850
You're scared.

3462
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:27,990
- All right. Daniel. - Yes.

3463
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:30,090
- The last one. - How many slots do I have?

3464
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:31,160
- Unfortunately... - Okay.

3465
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:33,390
(1 more slot can be added for Daniel.)

3466
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,490
- You want me to shuck oysters. - All right.

3467
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:33,530
How many does Kyeong Hwan have?

3468
01:31:33,430 --> 01:31:36,130
(Currently, Kyeong Hwan has 4 slots.)

3469
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:34,560
- I have four. - One, two...

3470
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,330
- You can give it to Kyeong Hwan. - Three.

3471
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:37,700
- The son of Tongyeong. - Tongyeong Bomber.

3472
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,400
- He should do it in Tongyeong. - No.

3473
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:40,970
- The son of Tongyeong. - Hang on.

3474
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:41,670
(Flustered)

3475
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:42,970
- Unfortunately... - Unfortunately...

3476
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:44,870
(According to public opinion, Kyeong Hwan gets 1 more slot.)

3477
01:31:44,770 --> 01:31:46,740
- This is driving me crazy. - We should give it to one person.

3478
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:48,010
(Kyeong Hwan, 5)

3479
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:48,110
It's Tongyeong.

3480
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:50,010
- This is the Kyeong Hwan zone. - All right.

3481
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:52,250
(Time to pick 4 penalty-takers)

3482
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:51,780
We will pick four people now.

3483
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:54,750
If Kyeong Hwan is picked on the first spin,

3484
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,650
(Kyeong Hwan)

3485
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,420
he can take off his name...

3486
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:57,780
- and add the member he wants, - Again?

3487
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,090
- and he will get the penalty. - Okay.

3488
01:31:57,950 --> 01:31:59,090
(Se Chan)

3489
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:00,290
Those who added my name.

3490
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:02,220
(They can attack whoever they want after getting picked.)

3491
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:01,720
So, you will get more slots over time.

3492
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:03,720
- Let's do this. - Let's do this!

3493
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,190
I'm worried.

3494
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:08,430
(The first roulette spin begins.)

3495
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:06,560
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

3496
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,930
I'm worried.

3497
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:10,030
- Unfortunately... - Unfortunately, I got many slots.

3498
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:11,660
But fortunately...

3499
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,770
(Laughing)

3500
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:14,330
(Proud)

3501
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:15,740
All right. We don't know it yet.

3502
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:17,040
- We don't know. - I think I know.

3503
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:19,410
(Who is the first penalty-taker?)

3504
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,410
Ji Hyo, Haha, or Jong Kook.

3505
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:20,910
- It's Haha. - Haha.

3506
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:23,280
- Unfortunately... - Unfortunately...

3507
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:24,810
(Haha is picked.)

3508
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,240
It's Haha.

3509
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:28,050
(Haha with 3 slots gets the penalty.)

3510
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,950
- Unfortunately... - Unfortunately...

3511
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:29,650
Fortunately!

3512
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,120
(Yes!)

3513
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:30,950
- Fortunately! - Unfortunately...

3514
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:34,190
(Haha, 3)

3515
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:32,180
Unfortunately...

3516
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:33,590
Fortunately...

3517
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:35,020
Unfortunately...

3518
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:37,160
- Give me my names. - Haha will get the penalty.

3519
01:32:35,490 --> 01:32:40,330
(Haha can stick other people's names in his 3 slots.)

3520
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:38,860
Haha can add the names he wants...

3521
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:40,260
- on his slots. - Oh, no.

3522
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,430
He looks angry now.

3523
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:42,930
(Laughing)

3524
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:44,100
Who? Se Chan?

3525
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:47,700
(Adding 1 slot for Se Chan for provoking him)

3526
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,360
He's always like that.

3527
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,500
- One... - He's always so harsh on me.

3528
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:49,040
- Ji Hyo. - Haha.

3529
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:51,470
(Ji Hyo and Daniel also got one slot each.)

3530
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,470
The daughter of Tongyeong.

3531
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,840
Spin it hard.

3532
01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:54,940
(The second roulette spin begins.)

3533
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:53,970
- That's it. - Good.

3534
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:56,240
Who will be unfortunate now?

3535
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:59,650
(Will Kyeong Hwan with 5 slots be saved again?)

3536
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:57,510
All right.

3537
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:59,180
Heo Kyeong Hwan.

3538
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:00,880
- We don't know it yet. - We don't know.

3539
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,880
- We don't know. - It's Kyeong Hwan for sure.

3540
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,520
- Ye Eun. - Ye Eun.

3541
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:07,290
(Ye Eun gets it.)

3542
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:07,550
- Unfortunately... - Unfortunately...

3543
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,660
(Ye Eun, 2)

3544
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:09,320
- What? - Ye Eun.

3545
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:11,420
- It's Ye Eun. - Unfortunately...

3546
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:12,730
(He survived again!)

3547
01:33:13,290 --> 01:33:15,760
(Ddochi had only two slots.)

3548
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:14,930
- Ye Eun had only two slots. - Hey.

3549
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:16,160
- She had only two slots. - I thought...

3550
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,970
(Who will take Ye Eun's 2 slots?)

3551
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:18,230
it would be me. I had a feeling.

3552
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,270
- Because he likes me... - No.

3553
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:23,100
(Daniel)

3554
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:24,700
(Daniel, 3)

3555
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:25,070
Let's shuck oysters together.

3556
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:29,480
(Adding 1 more slot for Daniel)

3557
01:33:25,070 --> 01:33:26,370
- That sounds good. - Let's do it together.

3558
01:33:26,370 --> 01:33:27,670
- No, Ye Eun. - Shuck oysters with her.

3559
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:29,580
He will be happy to shuck oysters with me.

3560
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:30,640
- Now... - One, two...

3561
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,450
No, you can't do that.

3562
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:34,450
(Kyeong Hwan gets 1 more slot.)

3563
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:34,580
- Just one. - I have too many.

3564
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:36,520
(Kyeong Hwan, 6)

3565
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:36,150
- Still, you're not picked. - You haven't gotten picked.

3566
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:37,150
You're not getting picked.

3567
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:39,950
(Kyeong Hwan has 6 slots all by himself.)

3568
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:38,620
- You survived. - You have a lot, but you survived.

3569
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:40,290
- I have too many. - Kyeong Hwan should get it.

3570
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:42,820
(Will he survive again?)

3571
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:41,890
I have six slots now.

3572
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:44,960
(The third roulette spin begins.)

3573
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,360
We have two spots left.

3574
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,360
(For the penalty)

3575
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,630
If Kyeong Hwan survives again...

3576
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:49,300
I have three.

3577
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:50,530
It's not me.

3578
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:51,830
- Unfortunately! - Ji Hyo!

3579
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:52,830
(Song Ji Hyo)

3580
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:52,900
It's not me.

3581
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:55,070
(Kyeong Hwan survived again!)

3582
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:55,130
- Unfortunately! - Ji Hyo! Unfortunately!

3583
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:59,310
(Ji Hyo, 3)

3584
01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:57,170
- The daughter of Tongyeong! - Is it Ji Hyo?

3585
01:33:57,170 --> 01:33:58,270
- Ji Hyo. - It's Ji Hyo.

3586
01:33:58,670 --> 01:34:00,640
- Why wasn't Kyeong Hwan picked? - The last one.

3587
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:01,570
(Miracle of Tongyeong)

3588
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:01,940
- This is the last one. - Kyeong Hwan is...

3589
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:03,880
(Kyeong Hwan has 6 slots, but he didn't get it.)

3590
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:03,040
Kyeong Hwan survived again.

3591
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,680
I guess that's the power of Tongyeong.

3592
01:34:04,710 --> 01:34:05,810
The last one.

3593
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:08,410
(Now, there's only one spot left for the penalty.)

3594
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:09,150
- Kyeong Hwan should do it. - It should be Kyeong Hwan.

3595
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:11,180
(Time for Ji Hyo to transfer her 3 slots)

3596
01:34:09,150 --> 01:34:10,920
- You should do it nicely. - How did he survive again?

3597
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,620
It doesn't make sense that he has survived.

3598
01:34:12,790 --> 01:34:14,020
- Kyeong Hwan is... - No.

3599
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:15,490
- I know. - All right. Let me add your name...

3600
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:16,660
(Kyeong Hwan, 9)

3601
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:17,090
- and see if you're picked. - No. Don't do that.

3602
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:19,530
(Giving all Ji Hyo's slots to Kyeong Hwan)

3603
01:34:17,090 --> 01:34:18,860
- What are you doing? - I want to see how it goes.

3604
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:20,390
- If you survive again, - Kyeong Hwan.

3605
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:21,530
- If you are not picked again... - you're unsuited for Running Man.

3606
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:22,660
Kyeong Hwan, how many slots do you have?

3607
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:24,800
Kyeong Hwan, if you survive again, you're really...

3608
01:34:23,330 --> 01:34:25,360
(Kyeong Hwan has 9 slots now.)

3609
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,800
This is my turf.

3610
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:29,670
(Will he survive until the end?)

3611
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,370
It's my area.

3612
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:30,670
The sky is helping me.

3613
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:34,270
(The last spin begins.)

3614
01:34:32,170 --> 01:34:33,270
Good. That's it.

3615
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:34,410
All right.

3616
01:34:34,570 --> 01:34:36,210
It will be funny if Kyeong Hwan survives again.

3617
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,580
- Please let me survive. - You have nine slots.

3618
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,410
(Please)

3619
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:40,610
It will be amazing if Kyeong Hwan survives again.

3620
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,650
(Will he get the energy from his hometown...)

3621
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:43,020
Tongyeong people won't let this slide.

3622
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:44,380
(and avoid the penalty again?)

3623
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:44,880
Unfortunately...

3624
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:48,320
(Or will he finally get picked as everyone hoped?)

3625
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:46,320
Unfortunately.

3626
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,150
- Heo Kyeong Hwan. - No. I'm lucky today.

3627
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:49,890
Here it goes.

3628
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:54,230
(Heo Kyeong Hwan gets the penalty.)

3629
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:54,890
- Unfortunately! - Unfortunately!

3630
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:55,730
(Kyeong Hwan, 9)

3631
01:34:55,730 --> 01:34:59,230
(He was about to be the star of the day!)

3632
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:01,100
You almost survived, though.

3633
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:04,470
(It barely stopped at Kyeong Hwan's slot between Se Chan's.)

3634
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:03,400
- You almost survived. - Right.

3635
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,140
I thought it would be Se Chan.

3636
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:07,240
(Disappointed)

3637
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:07,310
- That was close. - It could've been me.

3638
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:09,080
Today, Haha, Ye Eun,

3639
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:11,080
Ji Hyo, and Kyeong Hwan will get the penalty.

3640
01:35:11,310 --> 01:35:13,280
- Unfortunately... - Unfortunately...

3641
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,980
- By the way, I could've survived. - You could've survived.

3642
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:18,450
Except for those who will get the penalty,

3643
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:19,790
you may go home now.

3644
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:20,850
Thank you.

3645
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:22,090
(They'll remain in Tongyeong for extra work...)

3646
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:22,020
- Thank you. - All right. One,

3647
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:23,590
- two, three. - Good work.

3648
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:23,590
(while the rest head back to Seoul.)

3649
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,360
It's nice to go straight home after eating.

3650
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:25,890
(This is so nice.)

3651
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,390
It's great.

3652
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:28,030
It would've been strange if I survived.

3653
01:35:26,730 --> 01:35:30,930
(Today's penalty: Shucking 20kg of Tongyeong oysters)

3654
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:30,360
My goodness. Aren't they rock oysters?

3655
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:32,430
- With a knife... - Once you shuck the oysters,

3656
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:34,200
- please put them on a plate. - They are boiled.

3657
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:36,040
The production crew will eat them later.

3658
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,100
Enjoy the oysters.

3659
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:41,040
- My gosh. It's so hard to open. - This is not opening.

3660
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,480
Kyeong Hwan, how do you open this?

3661
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:44,740
(It's not easy to shuck oysters.)

3662
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:45,010
How do we do this?

3663
01:35:45,010 --> 01:35:47,550
I can't believe I'm shucking oysters in Tongyeong.

3664
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:47,880
(Struggling)

3665
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:49,520
This is not opening.

3666
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:51,750
You should open it.

3667
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:53,420
I see.

3668
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:55,250
Why do you sound so cold?

3669
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:56,290
He's so cold.

3670
01:35:56,290 --> 01:35:58,160
You guys added my name.

3671
01:35:56,290 --> 01:35:58,590
(Holding grudge)

3672
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:00,090
How do I open this?

3673
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,630
(So, how do I shuck it?)

3674
01:36:00,090 --> 01:36:01,860
- You just... Look here. - Okay.

3675
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,130
(Ji Hyo, who got the hang of it, demonstrates.)

3676
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:03,060
Grab the knife and...

3677
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,770
Actually, you eat oysters for the fun of opening them.

3678
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:09,500
(They are busy shucking oysters while complaining.)

3679
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,940
- Today... - Thank you for the food.

3680
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:12,610
- What? - Are you...

3681
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:13,970
- Today... - Thank you for the food.

3682
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:15,640
- What? - Are you...

3683
01:36:15,670 --> 01:36:17,380
Are they taking it once the plate is full?

3684
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:19,350
(Once the plate is full, it is delivered to the table.)

3685
01:36:18,910 --> 01:36:20,010
This is annoying.

3686
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:23,550
(Another deliveryman arrives.)

3687
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:23,920
Take this one too.

3688
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:28,820
(As soon as the oysters are shucked,)

3689
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:26,990
- You're getting more work... - By the way...

3690
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:29,160
- because you're good at this. - In the morning...

3691
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:31,890
(the production crew annoyingly takes them.)

3692
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:30,620
- I... - My gosh.

3693
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:31,860
They took it again.

3694
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:33,190
Give me a plate.

3695
01:36:33,190 --> 01:36:34,490
We're almost there.

3696
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:34,690
(To meet the demand,)

3697
01:36:34,690 --> 01:36:37,900
(they shuck oysters faster.)

3698
01:36:34,730 --> 01:36:36,200
- It's almost done. - It's almost done.

3699
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:37,630
The end is in sight.

3700
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:39,060
It smells like oysters.

3701
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,170
I should take the oyster smell home.

3702
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:43,040
(Romantic)

3703
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,640
- This is the last one. - Yes!

3704
01:36:45,570 --> 01:36:49,380
(Thanks to President Tong, 20kg of oysters are shucked in no time.)

3705
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:46,940
The last oyster.

3706
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:49,680
Come to Tongyeong.

3707
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:51,380
Bye.

3708
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:55,310
(We thank Heo Kyeong Hwan, the son of Tongyeong, for the big laugh.)

3709
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:52,750
- The end. - We finished the oysters.

3710
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:54,310
We worked so hard to shuck oysters.

3711
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:55,380
We did.

3712
01:36:55,550 --> 01:36:56,850
(He's back after a long time.)

3713
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:56,880
- What? Who's that? - Kang Hoon.

3714
01:36:56,850 --> 01:36:59,080
(The first rented member, Kang Hoon)

3715
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:59,220
- I had no idea. - He's the one who left us.

3716
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:00,520
Today, the new members raised by Running Man...

3717
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:00,420
(The youngest, the 1st rented member, the 2nd rented member)

3718
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:01,620
(The problem children of Running Man are here!)

3719
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:01,720
have gathered together here today.

3720
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:02,820
Let's chant together.

3721
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:04,020
- Go! - Say, "Go, Kang Hoon!"

3722
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:05,460
- What? - Go, Team Kang Hoon!

3723
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:05,420
(Problem Child 1: Retorter, Grills the older members)

3724
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:07,960
(Problem Child 2: A lovesick fool only to Kang Hoon)

3725
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:06,730
I'm telling you to give me that.

3726
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:08,130
I want my boyfriend to lead me.

3727
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:10,030
- This is our first day as a couple. - Why are they holding hands?

3728
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:10,000
(Her wish comes true.)

3729
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:12,060
I was happy to see Ye Eun during the shoot.

3730
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:12,700
(Flimsy's straightforward confession comes between them.)

3731
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:14,430
Seriously, what are you doing?

3732
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:15,870
Ye Eun, you knew how he was feeling.

3733
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:17,600
I knew he had feelings for me.

3734
01:37:17,870 --> 01:37:18,870
Jong Kook...

3735
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:20,270
said I had a thick head.

3736
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:21,710
(Problem Child 3: Filmy, Called Airhead by others)

3737
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:21,570
I thought it was a joke.

3738
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:22,940
- Try this. - No. I really can't eat it.

3739
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:24,310
- Try it. - Don't refuse it.

3740
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,280
(A guy who requires a lot of work)

3741
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:26,510
You can vote for the new member...

3742
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:26,380
(A death game...)

3743
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:28,450
(for the final problem child)

3744
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:28,450
- you consider the most problematic. - Problematic...

3745
01:37:28,450 --> 01:37:30,220
Grasshopper might vote for you.

3746
01:37:30,150 --> 01:37:32,420
(If I give my vote to the wrong member, I'll be in trouble!)

3747
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:32,520
- I won't vote for Kang Hoon. - Look at his face.

3748
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:33,590
You can't vote for him.

3749
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:34,650
Why me?

3750
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:35,690
I don't think they will vote for me.

3751
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:37,020
(Who is the new member to survive the fierce battle of wits?)

3752
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:37,160
I might have got all the votes.

3753
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:38,860
- I don't know. - He says he doesn't know.

3754
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:39,260
(Problematic New Members)

3755
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:44,260
(Running Man)
