00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,840
(2025 Pre-season Training
of Running University PE department)

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,580
- We're here.
- We've arrived.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,250
- Let's go.
- We're here.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,250
Let's do this!

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,550
It's hot.

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,020
(Pixar,
Into the World of Imagination)

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,350
(Jae Seok, a table tennis major,
enters first.)

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,120
- Hello.
- Jae Seok, I...

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,820
- Hello.
- What?

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,490
What kind of gymnast
looks like that?

11
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,490
I'm a gymnast.

12
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,730
(Running quickly)

13
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,000
(Running)

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,370
- I'm a gymnast.
- That's ridiculous.

15
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,400
- Hello.
- That's not a gymnast.

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,400
I'm Yang Hak Seon.

17
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,510
Will you cover yourself? Come on.

18
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,040
No. It can't be helped.

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,270
I hate that.

20
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,840
- I really hate it.
- And what's this?

21
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,880
Hello.

22
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,850
What... Are you a couple?

23
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,380
- No.
- I mean...

24
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,280
- This is too much.
- Are you a gymnast couple?

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,550
We are gymnasts.

26
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,450
- A gymnast couple?
- Yes.

27
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,990
Oh, no. Cover yourself.

28
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,660
What's wrong?

29
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,490
This is how a gymnast is dressed.

30
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,060
Use something to cover your body.

31
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,830
No. Just blur it out.

32
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,930
- Seriously...
- I really hate it.

33
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,270
It's so annoying.

34
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,100
- What are you?
- I play table tennis.

35
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,300
- I see.
- That's not fun.

36
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,500
Table tennis?

37
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,210
I bet Seok Jin
will go with table tennis.

38
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,970
- Seok Jin will do the same.
- But...

39
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,580
Why the weak ones?

40
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,580
People will get the wrong idea
about table tennis.

41
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,710
- Seriously...
- I bet you're good at it.

42
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

43
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,880
(At that moment,
the badminton majors enter.)

44
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
What is this?

45
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,050
- Jae Seok.
- What's that?

46
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,120
- Do you not know Lee Yong Dae?
- That's not fun.

47
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,590
- That's too weak.
- That's boring.

48
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,620
Ye Eun, what are you?

49
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,460
That's not enough.
You should do this at least.

50
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,200
(Swinging)

51
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
(Tying up with a rope)

52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,200
- Hey, what's that?
- Hey.

53
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,630
The gymnastics majors
are really strong.

54
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,740
- Am I pretty?
- Ye Eun.

55
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,970
- Thank you.
- That's impressive.

56
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,510
We can never beat
the gymnastics majors.

57
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,140
You're really...

58
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,280
(At this moment,
an old student enters.)

59
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,650
- That's too weak.
- Too weak.

60
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,180
- Oh, no.
- Too weak.

61
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,520
That's not fun.

62
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,620
(Exclaiming)

63
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,650
And...

64
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,890
- I see. You two are together.
- Seok Jin.

65
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,190
- You're right.
- Seok Jin.

66
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,420
Your wrist.

67
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,990
You should protect this one instead.

68
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,230
You don't know anything.

69
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,560
Why are you wearing it
on this wrist?

70
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,400
This is for wiping the sweat.

71
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,830
- My goodness.
- This is for the sweat.

72
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,000
- I see.
- You don't know that.

73
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You don't know much about sports.

74
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You rarely sweat.
Why would you wipe the sweat?

75
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,440
Still, I need it.

76
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,540
There's a thug.

77
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,670
- What's that?
- My gosh.

78
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,480
- What's that?
- What are you doing?

79
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,940
- Punch.
- Seriously...

80
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,310
(Even now, no one knew about
his wedding announcement.)

81
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,950
- Punch.
- His punch is too weak.

82
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,120
His punch is too weak.

83
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,390
Jong Kook.

84
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,920
(Hitting)

85
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,860
- Jong Kook.
- Why is he getting hit?

86
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,730
(Coach Kook even attacks
while wearing mitts.)

87
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,560
He keeps getting hit.

88
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,830
(Giggling)

89
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,740
(Upset)

90
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,810
(In the end, it turns into a dogfight
despite the boxing gear.)

91
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,210
You should dodge.

92
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,010
- That's too weak.
- You should dodge when I do this.

93
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,080
One, two, hook.

94
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,080
That's too weak.

95
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,710
- What are you?
- Ye Eun looks good today.

96
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,780
- Ye Eun.
- I'm a gymnast.

97
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,220
Rhythmic gymnastics.

98
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,820
- Rhythmic gymnastics?
- Ye Eun looks great.

99
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,250
- Hello.
- As expected.

100
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,720
- Ye Eun.
- Are you a kindergartener?

101
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,590
- She's a little kid.
- Seriously, what's that?

102
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,990
Is this for a school play?

103
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,430
Are you having a school play?

104
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,430
(It looks just like a talent show.)

105
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,060
- And what are you?
- What?

106
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,200
What are you?

107
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,100
- I'm Yang Hak Seon.
- Yang Hak Seon?

108
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,330
- Hey, you...
- Gymnastics?

109
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,830
Yang Hak Seon?

110
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,830
(Punished)

111
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,940
You can see people like him
when you go to the Han River.

112
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,770
My goodness.

113
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,370
It's really...

114
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,010
We have other students
who have returned...

115
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,750
from the world championship
to be with you.

116
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,880
- World championship?
- We have guests.

117
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,120
Please come in.

118
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,680
(Surprised)

119
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,720
- Hey.
- Okay!

120
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
It's them.

121
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,290
(Who are today's guests
that everyone welcomes?)

122
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,360
- Hey.
- Ha Yoon and Min Jong.

123
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,660
- It's been a while.
- Congratulations, Ha Yoon.

124
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,900
(The judo siblings returned in glory
after conquering the world.)

125
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,400
Have you been doing well?

126
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,870
(A proverb that mentions dogs)

127
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,970
A dog barks.

128
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,570
- A dog's life is the best lot.
- Hey.

129
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,870
(Ha Yoon turned out to be
the new Empty Head.)

130
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,910
(Darn it!)

131
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,910
(Throwing Kim Muscles down)

132
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,510
since I've seen Jong Kook
be out-muscled.

133
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,020
(Min Jong, the Grim Reaper
in charge of Kim Jong Kook)

134
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,190
(Min Jong and Ha Yoon
even conquered variety shows.)

135
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,360
- Min Jong.
- Hey.

136
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,620
- Have you been doing well?
- Nice to meet you.

137
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,260
- Hello.
- You dyed your hair.

138
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,390
- It looks great.
- Hello.

139
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,790
What? How did you come?

140
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,130
(Gen Z Min Jong spruced up today
as always.)

141
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,200
- Then...
- Hello.

142
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,330
- Have you been doing well?
- Ha Yoon.

143
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,530
Hey, you should've called me.

144
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,530
What? How did you come?

145
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,570
- Ha Yoon.
- Yes.

146
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,840
Didn't you win something?

147
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,910
- Yes, I did.
- I knew it.

148
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,040
- I watched it.
- He watched it.

149
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,170
Right. I watched it.

150
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,810
I can't do this.

151
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,380
- You dyed your hair.
- He wouldn't budge.

152
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,580
- He wouldn't budge.
- You dyed your hair.

153
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,050
Min Jong, you look bigger.

154
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,420
Min Jong, stand in the middle.

155
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,020
He's so big.

156
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,190
(They stand in the middle
after saying hello.)

157
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,260
- He dyed his hair after the match.
- I should stand next to him.

158
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,420
It looks good.

159
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,130
- He dyed his hair.
- Look at her go stand next to him.

160
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,830
- To look smaller.
- To look smaller.

161
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,330
- To look slim.
- Hey, you look...

162
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,900
just like a pocket girl now.

163
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,360
A skinny girl.

164
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,230
- You look like a kindergartener.
- By the way,

165
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,900
Min Jong, you dyed your hair.

166
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,470
- You've become cooler.
- I know.

167
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,740
- He dyed his hair.
- He looks really nice.

168
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,710
He looks like Ho Dong
when he was young.

169
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,340
- Seriously.
- He looks like him.

170
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,780
Min Jong has a cute face.

171
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,010
We have Kim Ha Yoon
and Kim Min Jong today.

172
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,420
(The aces of the Judo Department,
Kim Ha Yoon and Kim Min Jong)

173
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,950
They were...

174
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,990
on Running Man before.

175
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,020
Ever since, their performance
has been great.

176
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,590
- They're great.
- Right.

177
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,990
- They're on a roll.
- I watched their matches.

178
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,590
- She won the World Championships.
- Right.

179
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,960
- Yes, she did.
- Right.

180
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,160
- I'm so proud.
- That's crazy.

181
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,800
- They are not like strangers.
- How cool.

182
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,270
And about Min Jong.

183
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,400
The son of a wealthy family.

184
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,700
He won a silver medal
in the team event...

185
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,870
at the World Judo Championships
in Hungary...

186
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,770
and a bronze medal
at the Asian Judo Championships.

187
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,610
You're the best.

188
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,180
- Yes.
- Your father must be so proud.

189
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,580
By the way,
you two look like siblings today.

190
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,220
- I think that's how we look.
- I know.

191
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,050
How have you been, Min Jong?

192
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,220
After the championships,

193
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,220
I've been enjoying a short break.

194
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,560
- You're on a break.
- Yes.

195
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,660
What about you, Ha Yoon?

196
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,860
Again, I went
to the Universiade this year.

197
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,600
- That's right.
- You went there?

198
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,400
You must be tired. You need to rest.

199
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,530
So, do they go to the same gym?

200
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,970
- What?
- The same gym?

201
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,600
- Listen. They...
- Do you not know who they are?

202
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,270
- I mean...
- Do they go to the same gym?

203
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,270
Then where...

204
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,240
- They are not like us.
- Taereung.

205
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,410
- Where?
- I see. Taereung.

206
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,640
It's not Taereung. It's Jincheon.

207
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,980
- Jincheon.
- Did they move?

208
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,580
- They moved.
- They moved a long time ago.

209
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,350
Before I retired,
I trained in Taereung.

210
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,780
(Before I retired,
I trained in Taereung.)

211
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,890
(She's looking at something.)

212
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,320
- Do something about them.
- His shirt is eye-catching.

213
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,990
They are glaring at me.

214
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,560
- Do something about them.
- Why?

215
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,160
They are glaring at me.

216
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,730
- Why? What's wrong?
- Cover them with this.

217
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,760
It's not okay.

218
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,070
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

219
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,370
It's okay. What's wrong?

220
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Everyone has them.
What's wrong with that?

221
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,270
I'm dressed like Jae Seok.

222
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,010
I'm dressed like Jae Seok.

223
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,980
(Low-chested cosplay)

224
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,880
- It should be lower than that.
- A lot lower than that.

225
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,010
Good job.

226
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,520
- It should be lower.
- Jae Seok.

227
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,450
Hey, it should be that low.

228
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,250
Hey, you're really...

229
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,550
- It looks good now.
- I thought...

230
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,290
- it was Halloween today.
- Good job.

231
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,790
Today, you guys are
students in the PE Department...

232
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,300
- at Running University.
- at Running University.

233
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,430
Today is the conference
of the PE Department.

234
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,730
With the judo aces
Kim Min Jong and Kim Ha Yoon,

235
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,770
who have returned
after conquering the world,

236
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,000
- They are really good.
- we will have...

237
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,170
the Running Sports University
Prize Battle Race.

238
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,740
- That sounds great.
- By the way,

239
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,740
Director Choi.

240
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,540
You say Running Sports University,

241
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,580
but everyone here,

242
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,210
except for these two,
is from a community center.

243
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,550
- One, two.
- I mean...

244
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,550
Obviously, we are...

245
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,680
- I mean...
- Community center.

246
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,850
We just exercise
at a community center.

247
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,720
- I'm actually good at badminton.
- Hey.

248
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,820
You can see
a lot of people like us...

249
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,060
at the Mapo-gu Office.

250
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,530
(A great spectacle)

251
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,230
Today, you will have the opportunity
to win prizes...

252
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,130
- based on your performance.
- Okay.

253
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,500
Students who fail to receive prizes
until the end of the race...

254
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,140
- will get a penalty.
- Oh, no.

255
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,600
(If they don't receive a prize
until the end, they get a penalty.)

256
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,570
Before we start the training,

257
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,410
you will see an exhibition
to relieve your stress.

258
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,580
(You will see an exhibition
to relieve your stress.)

259
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,350
You tried to say that naturally,

260
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,380
but you couldn't hold back
your laughter.

261
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,020
It was spontaneous.

262
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,150
We should go and watch it.

263
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,420
- I've been here before.
- You have?

264
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,550
I've been here.
This is interesting. It's fun.

265
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,290
This place is interesting.

266
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,390
My goodness.

267
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,630
I love animated movies.

268
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,890
I love them.

269
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,500
- What's this?
- What is this place?

270
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
- Is this a theater?
- Hang on.
(The first place)

271
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
- What's this?
- My gosh.

272
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,770
What is this place?

273
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,800
Is this a theater?

274
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,900
(The information screen greets you
with characters from movies.)

275
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,900
This is amazing.

276
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,340
I watched all of them.

277
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,810
This is...

278
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,640
the thing in your head.

279
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,540
- It's "Inside Out."
- "Inside Out."

280
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,280
And the one with the guitar.

281
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,650
What was the title?

282
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,950
Are we moving on?

283
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,250
Is it over?

284
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,520
(Moving on to the next place)

285
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,580
- All right.
- My gosh.

286
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,420
- What's this?
- It's "Up!"

287
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,690
It's the house from "Up."

288
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,990
(It's the house from "Up.")

289
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,260
- The house from "Up."
- This is amazing.

290
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,360
Kids will love this.

291
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,790
It's really fun.

292
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,330
This thing blows away.

293
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,530
There's Min Jong.

294
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,370
- It flies away with the balloons.
- Jae Seok, that's Min Jong.

295
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,470
That's Min Jong.

296
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,640
It's Min Jong.

297
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,740
- Min Jong.
- It's you.

298
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,470
Stand next to it.
I'll take a photo of you.

299
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,610
You look the same.

300
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,770
- They look the same.
- I'll take a photo.

301
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,140
- My gosh.
- This is it.

302
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,240
- I'll take a photo.
- Pretend to put on the backpack.

303
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,310
- You look the same.
- That's cute.

304
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,610
It looks just like Min Jong.

305
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,650
He's so cute.

306
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,350
- You're cute.
- How lovely.

307
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,420
- This is a good photo.
- He's cute.

308
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,490
He's cute, but later, he will...

309
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,650
What will I do later?

310
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,690
He will become scary.

311
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,360
The cute guy...

312
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,560
Min Jong isn't just cute.

313
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,060
He's really...

314
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,160
He's scary.

315
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,660
Even with ten people like me,
we can't just beat him.

316
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,930
- Of course not.
- Look at this.

317
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,930
- He can even beat 100 people.
- Right.

318
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,630
Let's go in.

319
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,000
I want to live here.

320
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,300
We are in the house.

321
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,900
(We are in the house.)

322
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,940
This looks so real.

323
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,340
- Kids will love this place.
- This is really nice.

324
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,940
We're flying in the sky now.

325
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,080
- We're flying.
- Right.

326
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,150
- We're really flying in the sky.
- Yes.

327
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,410
That's Seok Jin.

328
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,820
- What?
- Seok Jin.

329
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,850
Seok Jin?

330
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,380
- That's Grandpa Seok Sam.
- My gosh.

331
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,850
- Grandpa, stand here.
- Where?

332
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,420
Stand next to the grandpa.

333
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,720
Grandpa!

334
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,630
- Grandpa.
- Grandpa Seok Sam!

335
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,190
- Don't die, Grandpa.
- He looks good here.

336
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,800
Don't die.

337
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,070
Kids who like animation
will love this place.

338
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,930
- I know. Kids will love it.
- They must love it.

339
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,400
- They'll be excited.
- Right.

340
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,740
(Something is waiting
for the excited Protein Monster.)

341
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,940
(Adorable monsters are working.)

342
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,110
This is my favorite.

343
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,380
- This is amazing.
- My gosh.

344
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,810
Monsters!

345
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,480
- This is amazing.
- This goes to children's closets.

346
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,510
Children's closets.

347
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,280
- This is...
- Children's closets.

348
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,750
This is the closet. It's cute.

349
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,450
- It's LED.
- Look at the closet.

350
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,490
It surprises kids.

351
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,890
It's LED, right?

352
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,160
- Take a picture of me with yours.
- Give me your phone.

353
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,260
- With mine?
- With yours.

354
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,690
(The Gen Z athletes can't miss
the photo zone.)

355
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,830
This is amazing.

356
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,900
(Working hard)

357
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,900
Ha Yoon is taking a picture.

358
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,800
Ha Yoon, are you taking a picture?

359
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,200
One, two, three.

360
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,500
We should go out.

361
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,740
- This is interesting.
- Haha is changed.

362
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,770
Is this the door?

363
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,540
This is Andy's bed.

364
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,110
I know what it is.

365
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,940
- Andy's bed.
- It's the bed.

366
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,250
- It's huge.
- Andy's bed.

367
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,380
Right. Now that I'm here,

368
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,920
I feel like I'm a toy.

369
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,720
This place is amazing.

370
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,620
- Mapo-gu Sheriff.
- Mapo-gu Sheriff.

371
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,590
- That's not Mapo-gu Sheriff.
- When you go to Mapo-gu

372
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,090
- It's Haha.
- He's Mapo-gu Sheriff.

373
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,190
Sheriff. Take a picture of me.

374
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,560
If I didn't cut off your legs,
you'd look really short.

375
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,830
With Woody like this...

376
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,930
(That's because
he's as tall as the toy.)

377
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,600
- This looks good.
- One, two, three.

378
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,000
Make sure the bed
is in the frame as well.

379
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,470
- Okay.
- That's so cute.

380
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,610
- Do I look cute?
- You look like a dwarf.

381
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,210
- Do you want to take a picture?
- You look like a dwarf.

382
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,610
How about here?

383
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,610
- Should I take one of you?
- Take one of me.

384
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,780
(Skipping)

385
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,120
You look tiny.

386
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,220
- Me?
- You look cute...

387
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,520
- You look cute.
- standing next to that.

388
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,790
- One, two...
- I'll take the shot.

389
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,090
You look so cute.

390
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,220
(The judo monsters
are like judo fairies today.)

391
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,260
- You look so cute.
- Thank you.

392
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,260
Thank you.

393
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,760
I should take a photo
of Buzz Lightyear.

394
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,860
I think we can go in there.

395
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,300
Can't we go in there?

396
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,030
How does this work?
Isn't this where you take photos?

397
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,470
Seok Jin, you...

398
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,870
- Don't stand inside a frame.
- Get out of there.

399
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,140
- I mean...
- I can't help it.

400
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,180
This is so sad.

401
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,150
- Seok Jin. Oh, no.
- This is so sad to watch.

402
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,510
Don't bow twice.

403
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,720
Don't bow twice in front of me.

404
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,690
- Bow down on your knees.
- Don't bow.

405
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,420
(Bowing down)

406
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,290
- Stop.
- No, don't bow down!

407
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,490
Don't bow down in front of me.

408
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,930
Don't bow when he's still alive.

409
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,990
Hold on.

410
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,900
That was sad to watch.

411
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,030
It wasn't sad at all.

412
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,330
- Shall we get going?
- Okay!

413
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,570
- Let's go.
- Kids would love this place.

414
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,670
(Running University PE Department
Team Training)

415
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,510
This place is great.

416
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,110
- Wait, what's this?
- What is this place?

417
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,610
- I wonder what this is for.
- What are we doing here?

418
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,350
(They enter a training spot
with a massive mat.)

419
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,980
- Can we step on this with shoes?
- Yes.

420
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,350
Do we start over here?

421
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,120
She thinks you can't step on mats
with your shoes on.

422
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,990
- My shoes...
- That's understandable.

423
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,390
That's etched in your brain.

424
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,990
What's this from the start?

425
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,490
I'm already scared
of what'll happen.

426
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,560
(Before they train,
an announcement is made.)

427
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,530
Before you begin
the first training session,

428
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,800
please note...

429
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,070
you'll get to win a prize
at the end of each game.

430
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,000
After every training session,
you'll be presented...

431
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,870
with two raffle boxes.

432
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,370
You may place the Running Balls
you win inside them.

433
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,410
When a box has over ten balls,

434
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,040
a raffle will take place.

435
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,940
- Sure.
- If you win a prize,

436
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,550
you'll be safe from a penalty.

437
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,650
Those who didn't win a prize...

438
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,720
will receive a penalty at the end.

439
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,020
You'll now play a game...

440
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,050
to earn the Running Balls needed
to win a prize.

441
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,720
- This is Running Sock Hunters.
- What?

442
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,730
- Running Sock Hunters?
- Running Sock Hunters?

443
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,730
- We're taking off socks today.
- You'll split into two teams,

444
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,900
and two members from each team
will compete.

445
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Those playing the game...

446
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,840
will write numbers
that add up to six...

447
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,040
under their name tags
and on the soles of their feet.

448
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,740
In the three minutes given,

449
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,380
you'll remove your opponents'
name tags or socks...

450
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,480
and win Running Balls
equal to the numbers.

451
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,620
We'll get physical today.

452
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,750
Isn't it hard
for the Table Tennis Department?

453
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,120
- It's the same for us.
- We need to split members.

454
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,860
- Since it's five on each team?
- And split the female members.

455
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,890
- Okay.
- That's not all.

456
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,690
You'll gain Running Balls
according to the numbers...

457
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,030
you uncovered from your opponents
and the ones you protected...

458
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,230
- within those three minutes.
- Min Jong and Ha Yoon...

459
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,500
- Really?
- There will be three rounds.

460
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,800
During the game,

461
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,700
if you lose your socks
and your name tag,

462
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,770
you'll be eliminated.

463
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,870
- Eliminated?
- Yes.

464
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,410
To balance out the teams,

465
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,110
Min Jong and Ha Yoon
will be team captains.

466
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,210
What a relief.

467
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,250
- As it should.
- That's true.

468
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,480
We agree.

469
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,820
You two will choose your team.

470
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,920
Ha Yoon and Min Jong.

471
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,620
The team with Jong Kook will win.

472
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,160
Not really. I hurt my shoulder
and am recovering from injuries.

473
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,520
That's good to hear.

474
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,560
It's good for us.

475
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,260
It's good news
when we're on Running Man.

476
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,560
- Your shoulder injury is good news.
- I know.

477
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,730
(A cold-hearted friend
who only cares about winning)

478
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,330
- That's a positive approach.
- I love it.

479
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,070
- That's useful in life.
- Exactly.

480
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,210
- Won't it get better someday?
- Sure.

481
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,510
I'm sure it would.

482
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,080
- It's not permanent.
- Exactly.

483
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,240
That's right. Absolutely.

484
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,750
Min Jong and Ha Yoon,
play rock-paper-scissors...

485
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,410
- to choose teammates.
- Go ahead.

486
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,550
Ladies first.

487
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,720
- Ladies first?
- Ladies first.

488
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,790
- Be cool and let me go first.
- She's right.

489
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,790
- Sure thing.
- Take Jong Kook first.

490
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,590
I choose Jong Kook.

491
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,320
- There you go.
- That's the correct choice.

492
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,760
- But the other team has Min Jong.
- Of course.

493
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,000
- Min Dong.
- But the other team has Min Jong.

494
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,130
- Min Dong.
- What?

495
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,230
Right, Min Jong.

496
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,500
How about you take me?

497
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,770
I choose Jae Seok.

498
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,800
Okay!

499
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
I choose Jae Seok.

500
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,970
(She failed to appeal to him.)

501
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,310
Ye Eun, get back here.

502
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,010
- Ye Eun, move.
- Get back here.

503
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,410
- Step aside.
- Move back.

504
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,580
- Who's next?
- I'll soon get to you.

505
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,080
- I'll call your name soon.
- Get back here.

506
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,080
Why are you trying
to get on his team?

507
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,480
- Do you prefer that team?
- That team?

508
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,120
She must want to be on his team.

509
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,890
- Here we go.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

510
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,520
(Min Jong wins.)

511
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,360
(Excited)

512
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,390
Rock-paper-scissors.

513
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,530
- I choose Daniel.
- Daniel.

514
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,360
- I choose Daniel.
- Daniel.

515
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,460
(Ye Eun isn't chosen once again.)

516
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,370
- Choose Ye Eun.
- She was looking at you.

517
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,670
Just wait a little longer.

518
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,840
Just wait a little longer?

519
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,340
He chose a guy,

520
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,370
so choose a guy as well.

521
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,370
I choose Haha.

522
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,080
- What?
- Don't you watch Running Man?

523
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,910
- Not Se Chan?
- Don't you watch Running Man?

524
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,010
(Ha Yoon chooses the belly prince
over Se Chan with strong bones.)

525
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,210
- What?
- Haha?

526
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,580
- Not Se Chan?
- Don't you watch Running Man?

527
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,620
- You should choose Se Chan.
- I'm quite burly.

528
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,320
Ha Yoon's here
just to have some fun.

529
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,490
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Ha Yoon's here...

530
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,090
(It's Ha Yoon's turn.)

531
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,490
- Choose Se Chan.
- Get Se Chan.

532
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,730
- I choose Se Chan.
- Seriously.

533
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,100
Is it us three?

534
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,430
- We'll win for sure.
- Exactly.

535
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,630
Min Jong will choose.

536
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,070
(Only these three are left.)

537
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,600
Who's left? Seok Jin?

538
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,970
- Ji Hyo's the better choice.
- Yes, Ji Hyo.

539
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,410
- Min Dong!
- Choose Ji Hyo.

540
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,610
Min Dong!

541
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,010
(Ye Eun tries being cute again.)

542
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,080
Look at her.

543
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,780
Min Dong, please.

544
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,380
I need to win.

545
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,020
(Ye Eun begs, desperate to win.)

546
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,720
Go away.

547
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,990
I want to win.

548
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,460
- Take her in.
- She needs to prove herself.

549
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,960
(Desperately appealing to someone
6 years younger than her)

550
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,030
- I choose Ye Eun.
- Okay.

551
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,860
(Fake Yeon Jae is happy again.)

552
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,830
Was that necessary?

553
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,200
(Team Min Jong)

554
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,240
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

555
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,340
(Ha Yoon wins.)

556
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,610
(Seok Sam and Ji Hyo are left.)

557
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,610
- Seok Jin.
- How is this a hard choice?

558
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,710
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

559
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
- Hey.
- You knew who to choose.

560
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,880
We're stuck with him!

561
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,280
Ji Hyo's more of a fighter.

562
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,690
- She's way better.
- She's way tougher than him.

563
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,020
We're stuck
with Ye Eun and Seok Sam!

564
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,820
What can the three of us do?

565
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,560
- Are you kidding me?
- We don't stand a chance.

566
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,260
What do we do?

567
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,800
- How are we...
- How did our team end up like this?

568
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,300
- Oh, no.
- You shouldn't...

569
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,030
- You shouldn't have chosen Ye Eun.
- You shouldn't have chosen her.

570
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,470
- Why not?
- What got into you?

571
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,300
Who knows what'll happen?

572
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,640
(Patting)

573
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,270
(Let's do this, little brother!)

574
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,480
She keeps getting closer to him.

575
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,410
Wait. Is that your underwear?

576
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,750
- What?
- Look at him.

577
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,420
It looks like he's wearing
his dad's underwear.

578
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,150
Is that his dad's underwear?

579
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,460
That looks like my dad's underwear.

580
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,990
I'm wearing mine underneath.

581
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,160
- Why do you have his on?
- He has his on.

582
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,730
What do you mean
it's my dad's underwear?

583
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,960
- Come on.
- These are boxing shorts.

584
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,900
- Come on.
- These are boxing shorts.

585
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,030
- His dad's underwear?
- Those look more like underwear.

586
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,200
These aren't.

587
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,170
- Yours look like underwear.
- Yours look more like underwear.

588
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,770
As if.

589
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,610
- Trunks.
- Whatever.

590
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,710
You'll change clothes...

591
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,780
- and decide on the matches.
- Sure.

592
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,050
- Ha Yoon.
- Yes?

593
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,080
(Jerseys with name tags on them)

594
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,680
- Se Chan.
- Thanks.

595
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,120
We need to write numbers
wearing these.

596
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,750
- I see.
- Do they get stuck on here?

597
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,320
That's right. We need
to write down numbers.

598
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
(Everyone puts on their jerseys.)

599
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,130
Check out his body.

600
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,600
- No way.
- Is he the Hulk?

601
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,370
- He'll...
- He's like the Hulk.

602
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,370
He could punch us out cold.

603
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,410
- How is that possible?
- Check out his back.

604
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,910
- No way.
- That's impressive.

605
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,510
Look at how thick his torso is.

606
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,710
Don't get me started
on how strong his grip is.

607
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,120
If he grabs us and tugs,

608
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,720
- Our bones will break.
- he could break our bones.

609
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,750
Our organs could burst.

610
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,290
Imagine how safe he must feel.

611
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,230
(They put on their socks too.)

612
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,890
We're playing
with just our socks on.

613
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,630
(Take that!)

614
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,770
(Groaning)

615
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,740
(What's happening?)

616
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,800
Ha Yoon, what's up?

617
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,440
- He attempted a shoulder throw.
- A shoulder throw?

618
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,640
I kicked my feet
off the ground, but...

619
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,110
- Why did you attempt that?
- What was that for?

620
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,740
You'll get hurt.

621
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,810
- I got pinned down.
- She pinned him down.

622
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,620
Write down who's competing
and show us.

623
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,250
- Will the games be random? Nice.
- Okay.

624
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,520
- Seok Jin, wait.
- It'll be random. One, two, three.

625
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,220
Why don't we take the first game?

626
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,360
Jong Kook and Ha Yoon can play.

627
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,130
- Let's guarantee a win first.
- Yes, let's do that.

628
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,660
That means they could
play another round.

629
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,170
- Sure.
- Next...

630
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,300
- Ji Hyo and me.
- Sure.

631
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,870
Ha Yoon and I will go third.

632
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,270
That's it. I like it.

633
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,240
I quite like this. It's good.

634
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,380
- We'll take the first game.
- Good.

635
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,010
We won't go easy on you.
Let's do this.

636
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,880
- Let's speed things up. Come on.
- Come on.

637
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,920
- All right, fine.
- Come on.

638
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,720
Since they have
Jong Kook and Ha Yoon,

639
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,690
- we're at a disadvantage.
- We're at a disadvantage.

640
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,120
- Two of them are super strong.
- I know.

641
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,790
If Ji Hyo goes up against Ye Eun,

642
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,890
Ye Eun will lose.

643
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,830
- Exactly.
- Ye Eun could throw her around.

644
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,800
- She can grab you by the hair.
- That's right.

645
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,570
You two will team up.

646
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,270
It'll then be you two,
and then us two.

647
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,600
- Like that?
- Yes.

648
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,170
- I'll win my round.
- Okay.

649
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,370
We'll hand over
who's competing in which round.

650
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,780
- You need to do your best.
- Of course.

651
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,980
- We need to win.
- Of course.

652
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,250
- I'll win for us.
- Okay.

653
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,280
Let's say they revealed our numbers.

654
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,620
It's quite random anyway.

655
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,620
- It'll be a loss...
- What if it's one?

656
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,950
if it's a good number.

657
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,920
Think that
they'll reveal the numbers...

658
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,590
- Exactly.
- and split them evenly.

659
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,130
- With all ones.
- Then, try to fool them.

660
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,200
Don't let them see it.

661
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,930
Okay, we're good.

662
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,870
- At the very end.
- Near your toes.

663
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,070
- Make them sweat.
- Your feet?

664
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,970
Socks are harder to pull off
if your feet are sweaty.

665
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,210
(They divide the 6 points.)

666
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,240
- Let's do this.
- Go, team.

667
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,580
- As long as it's not Min Jong.
- How can you avoid him?

668
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,810
I'll announce who's playing
in the first round.

669
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,520
Ha Yoon and Jong Kook.

670
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,720
- Let's go!
- All right.

671
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,050
(Team Ha Yoon:
Jong Kook and Ha Yoon)

672
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,390
(Stretching)

673
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,820
Ha Yoon and Jong Kook.

674
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,820
- Let's go!
- All right.

675
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,190
What?

676
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,460
Going up against them are...

677
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,130
(Who from Team Min Jong
will go up against them?)

678
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,070
Jae Seok and Ye Eun.

679
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,970
It's Ji Ye Eun.

680
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,000
(Jae Seok, Ye Eun
versus Jong Kook, Ha Yoon)

681
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,100
- Roar!
- Yes!

682
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,270
Let's do this!

683
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,010
- It's okay.
- We got this.

684
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,010
- Great.
- This is going to be fun.

685
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,780
- Let's win a point.
- This is going to be fun.

686
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,880
Nice.

687
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,010
Let's go!

688
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,250
(The two became pale.)

689
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,250
(Last summer, Jae Seok and Ye Eun
competed against Ha Yoon.)

690
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,920
My dear cousin.

691
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,760
- Come on, man.
- Please, just once.

692
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,130
(The two were once
completely beaten by Ha Yoon.)

693
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,860
Let's do this, Ye Eun.

694
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,870
We can win the other two rounds.

695
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,070
- We must win.
- We must win.

696
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,610
- We got this.
- You never know.

697
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,240
- We got this.
- Let's do this!

698
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,410
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

699
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,440
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Go, team!

700
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,880
Are you the captain?

701
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,980
- No, I'm not.
- We should get ready.

702
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,080
We never know what will happen.

703
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,350
- We don't know.
- In 1, 2, 3.

704
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,720
- Go, team!
- Go, team!

705
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,020
Please play the song
of "Pororo the Little Penguin."

706
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,750
- We're going to be playing.
- We are going to be cute.

707
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,920
Gosh, that man
wearing daddy's underwear.

708
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,990
Is there a time limit?

709
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,730
You will be given three minutes.

710
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,390
- If you lose everything,
- Three minutes.

711
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,700
you leave.

712
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,000
Enjoy the minute and a half.

713
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,430
- Here we go.
- Ready.

714
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,830
It's like "Toy Story."

715
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,500
Grab and throw them.

716
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,140
(Round 1 begins.)

717
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,410
Please throw Jae Seok.

718
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,280
(Jong Kook and Ha Yoon
attack as soon as they begin.)

719
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,650
- Ha Yoon...
- He's like Chucky.

720
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,250
(Chucky Kim approaches
with a smile.)

721
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,250
- Take Jae Seok.
- No.

722
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,690
(They are cornered!)

723
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,750
- No!
- They're done.

724
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,860
- They're done.
- What?

725
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,490
(Jong Kook starts to play.)

726
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,660
- They're done.
- What?

727
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,800
(He rotates Jae Seok.)

728
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,640
(He ripped it.)

729
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,410
He's done.

730
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,140
(Jae Seok's name tag
didn't have a point.)

731
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,610
- There.
- It's zero.

732
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,080
(He changes the target to Ye Eun.)

733
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,750
(Ripping)

734
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,880
It's zero.

735
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
(What's Ye Eun's score?)

736
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,320
(It's 0 again.)

737
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,220
(Jong Kook gains nothing again.)

738
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,620
- Socks.
- No.

739
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,160
- No, Jae Seok.
- It's Jae Seok.

740
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,760
- Let me go!
- No!

741
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,400
- Rip Ha Yoon's paper.
- No!

742
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,800
- Go.
- I will hold both.

743
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,530
- Ha Yoon, look.
- No!

744
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,800
There. I got them.

745
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,870
(Jong Kook the Powerful
holds them both.)

746
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,270
- No!
- No!

747
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,270
(Screaming)

748
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,510
(Ye Eun and Jae Seok
are both trapped.)

749
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,180
He got both Jae Seok and Ye Eun.

750
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,550
There.

751
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,180
Nice!

752
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,750
- Jong Kook, please!
- Nice, Ye Eun!

753
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,090
- Let me rip it just once.
- Nice one.

754
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,320
Please let me rip it just once.

755
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,760
Tear the sock.

756
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,120
(Ha Yoon takes Jae Seok's sock off.)

757
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,130
No!

758
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,330
It's too easy.

759
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,360
- Go for Jae Seok's.
- Let's go!

760
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,930
It's too easy.

761
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,730
(Jae Seok is out.)

762
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,300
Jae Seok lost everything.

763
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,540
Take everything off.

764
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,940
What? There's nothing.

765
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,170
What? There's nothing.

766
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,110
- What? There's nothing.
- Take Ye Eun's socks off.

767
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,180
(Ye Eun has all 6 points.)

768
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,710
- Take Ye Eun's socks off.
- Ye Eun.

769
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,850
Wait.

770
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,890
- Ye Eun.
- He crushed Ye Eun.

771
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,150
Ye Eun!

772
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,590
No!

773
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,320
- Go, Ye Eun.
- No!

774
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,530
(Less than 1 minute is left!)

775
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,130
(Ye Eun goes for the last resort.)

776
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,430
Go, Ye Eun!

777
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,230
(Biting)

778
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,100
Ye Eun!

779
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,500
No!

780
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,340
(Ye Eun's right sock is out!)

781
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,980
(Will there be a score?)

782
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,480
Let's see.

783
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,780
It's six points.

784
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,650
(She finds 6 points
just before the end.)

785
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,250
- It's 6 points?
- It's 6 points.

786
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,190
- This is...
- Is it over?

787
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,890
- It's six points.
- This is...

788
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,090
- They gave her all the scores.
- This is really bad.

789
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,060
This is so boring.

790
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,100
Why did you give her all the scores?

791
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,440
This is super boring.

792
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,410
It would be the same
with Min Jong anyway.

793
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,240
- Min Jong.
- Yes?

794
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,280
- What is this?
- Look.

795
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,880
- Don't go easy.
- No.

796
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,150
- Was it fun, Ha Yoon?
- It was.

797
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,880
Yes.

798
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,280
How can you be so relaxed?

799
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,020
Look at this.

800
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,120
Look how ragged it is.

801
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,250
- Why would you...
- It's ripped.

802
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,720
- It's ripped.
- You're unbelievable.

803
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,630
Team Ha Yoon didn't get ripped.

804
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,090
And they earned six points.

805
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,000
- Yes.
- They won 12 Running Balls.

806
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,430
(Team Ha Yoon got 12 Running Balls.)

807
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,540
That was the right strategy then.

808
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,040
You did so well.

809
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,610
It turned out well.

810
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,870
- We did well.
- It went really well.

811
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,340
- You got unlucky.
- Ye Eun shouldn't get hurt.

812
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,180
- It can't be helped.
- It can't be helped.

813
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,280
- But...
- We shouldn't get ripped.

814
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,920
You got all six, so just go for it.

815
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,050
- You know how he did it, right?
- Yes.

816
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,750
Be ruthless.

817
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,820
- Okay. Let's do this.
- Second...

818
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,120
The back is a bad spot.

819
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,430
You get ripped right away.

820
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,060
Let's skip the back. Let's put
3, 2, 1 points on the feet.

821
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,060
- Okay?
- It's 3, 2, 1.

822
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,700
- You get 1, 1.
- I got 1, 1.

823
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,270
- You get 2, 2.
- Yes.

824
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,770
Okay.

825
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,700
- It's better.
- It's 2, 2 on my feet.

826
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,210
It's zero.

827
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,040
This is fun.
Watch how fun this round will be.

828
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,980
This match will be Ji Hyo, Haha...

829
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,010
versus Min Jong and Daniel.

830
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,450
Go, guys!

831
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,150
(Hulk and Flimsy versus...)

832
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,580
Ready.

833
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,750
(Mapo-gu Siblings)

834
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,020
Hang in there.

835
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,020
Take it slow, Min Jong.

836
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,120
- These days...
- Go, there.

837
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,330
- We have to be split up.
- Come here.

838
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,390
They must've divided up the score.

839
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,100
Young one.

840
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,030
Go, Min Jong.

841
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,940
- Good. He's agile. Here he comes.
- Go, Min Jong!

842
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,640
(Moving swiftly)

843
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,870
- Nice.
- Go, Min Jong!

844
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,270
- It's okay.
- Daniel.

845
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,510
Take care of Ji Hyo.

846
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,380
I will drive them, Min Jong.

847
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,650
- Go.
- I will drive them, Min Jong.

848
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,550
(Haha gets caught right away.)

849
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,550
He got caught.

850
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,450
(His name tag
gets removed instantly.)

851
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,090
Hurry.

852
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,620
The leg.

853
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,930
He's going for a leg sweep.

854
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:05,160
(He takes down Haha
with a judo technique.)

855
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,830
- Gosh.
- Hey, the foot!

856
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,000
Hey!

857
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,340
(Rolling)

858
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,610
Stop it.

859
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,010
(Rolling again)

860
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,880
Great. Do another leg sweep.

861
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,950
(He desperately rolls
to keep his other sock safe.)

862
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,780
Haha, go for the leg sweep!

863
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,180
That's it.

864
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,220
My gosh, where are you going?

865
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,280
That's it.

866
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,990
(His name tag is unguarded.)

867
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,320
That's great.

868
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,090
- Get up and run!
- Go for a leg sweep!

869
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,390
He got up.

870
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,330
(Is Haha trying to counterattack?)

871
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Haha.

872
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,000
(Screaming)

873
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,530
You dog!

874
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,540
Dog?

875
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,340
- Hey!
- No!

876
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,440
He almost got it.

877
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,810
- Two points.
- Take it off.

878
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,440
(He checks the score
as if he's washing his dog's feet.)

879
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,480
So light.

880
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,180
You got it.

881
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,080
- You got it.
- Two points.

882
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,020
Haha, you are out.

883
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,050
It hurts.

884
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,050
It hurts too much.

885
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,390
(Meanwhile,
the badminton team fights.)

886
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,790
- Look at them.
- Hey.

887
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,320
(Daniel has 0 points.)

888
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,390
(Ji Hyo has 1 point on each foot.)

889
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,060
- Hey, Daniel!
- Daniel!

890
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,230
(Stepping)

891
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,430
- That's it.
- Hey!

892
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,070
(Ms. Song uses combat skills.)

893
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,100
Hey. Goodness.

894
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,140
(The two start to fight
like real siblings.)

895
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,980
- Ji Hyo.
- Look at them.

896
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,980
Don't get ripped!

897
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,750
- No!
- Don't get ripped!

898
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,150
(Ripping)

899
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,620
Are you supposed to rip it?

900
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,850
Yes, you're supposed to rip.

901
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,620
(Not knowing that he's only got 0,
Ji Hyo gives her all.)

902
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
- You're supposed to rip.
- Rip it.

903
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,530
- You have to rip it.
- Daniel, rip her tag.

904
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,690
- It's two.
- There.

905
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,030
I can't take her sock off.

906
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,700
- I can't take her sock off.
- There.

907
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,630
(He took off Ji Hyo's right sock.)

908
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,240
- It's one.
- All right.

909
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,240
He didn't rip it.

910
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,510
Rip it.

911
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,170
Daniel, come on.

912
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,410
- There.
- Daniel.

913
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,780
- No.
- I have to rip it.

914
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,150
No. You have to rip it.

915
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,150
- He got it.
- Daniel.

916
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,350
- It's zero.
- There.

917
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,350
He got two points.
- What happened?
- Two points.

918
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,590
- She got nothing.
- What happened?

919
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,220
(Daniel earned Ji Hyo's 2 points.)

920
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,960
- He got everything.
- He got two points.

921
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
- Good job.
- He got two points right away?

922
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
- What happened?
- Hey.

923
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,430
- It doesn't work.
- Right?

924
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,630
- Look.
- You can't do it.

925
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,400
He only grabbed me like this.

926
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,500
But you did well. You rolled well.

927
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,870
Great!

928
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,500
- This time, Min Jong...
- It was impossible.

929
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,140
- had all the points.
- He's a different species.

930
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,040
You failed to get any.

931
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,440
So 12 Running Balls
went to this team.

932
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,480
- Yes!
- Yes!

933
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,310
- It's a tie.
- Yes!

934
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,620
- Come here, Min Jong.
- Min Jong.

935
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,820
- Let's set the points.
- Okay.

936
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,320
You will go
with the back tag, right?

937
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,990
Isn't it better?

938
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,790
Can you beat Ha Yoon?

939
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,560
- Just wondering.
- Yes. I can beat her.

940
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,230
Should I put it here?

941
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,630
I think it should be there.

942
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,500
Seok Jin has to be zero.

943
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,600
This is the sole of the foot too.

944
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,940
It's the sole of the foot. Isn't it?

945
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,570
It's the sole of the foot.

946
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,780
- Once you rip all, they're out.
- Right.

947
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,410
- So let's make it 2 on 1.
- Yes.

948
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,280
- So...
- Remove Seok Jin?

949
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,150
Remove Seok Jin?

950
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,720
It becomes 2 on 1
only if we get rid of him.

951
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,220
But if Min Jong and Seok Jin...

952
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,790
- go after me first...
- That is possible.

953
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,520
- Their strategy is the same.
- If we were to strategize...

954
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,430
Should I get on your back?
Then your tag won't be ripped.

955
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,490
Wouldn't you crush me to death?

956
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,260
I guess I will.

957
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,430
(Laughing brightly)

958
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,770
- I guess I will.
- As someone... Look.

959
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,700
As someone strong,
this is what I would do.

960
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,440
If you keep attacking my feet,

961
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,440
- I will be distracted.
- Right. Okay.

962
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,910
You understand, right?
Don't care about anything else.

963
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,240
Just go for the feet on the floor.

964
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,150
Here's the best strategy. Do this.

965
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,150
But when you have a chance,
rip Seok Jin's tag first.

966
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,420
Here's what's important.

967
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,650
- How many points for me?
- The back...

968
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,690
- Perhaps 3, 2.
- No.

969
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,620
Isn't it better to give Ha Yoon
more points?

970
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,060
I think that would be better.

971
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,430
- That's better.
- Then I...

972
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,730
- Should I get 1 point?
- You get 1 point.

973
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,130
- They get 2, 3 points each.
- Right. They get 2, 3 points.

974
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

975
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,830
I suddenly feel like peeing.

976
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,770
(Sticking 1 on Se Chan's left foot)

977
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
- Okay.
- I see.

978
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,970
It's Ha Yoon.

979
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,070
(Ha Yoon has 3 and 2 on each foot.)

980
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,070
- Let's go!
- Nice.

981
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,540
- Let's go!
- Yes, a low kick!

982
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,080
(Both teams are tied.
This game will decide who wins.)

983
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,010
(Light on his feet)

984
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,810
- Yang Se Chan.
- Don't waste your energy.

985
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,480
- Se Chan, don't waste your energy.
- Let's go!

986
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,750
Okay. Ready.

987
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,780
Good. It's okay.

988
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,150
Show them how nimble you are!

989
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,950
Right, our two athletes...

990
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,390
and the two members
of the community center.

991
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,390
- All right.
- Nice, Seok Jin. You can do it.

992
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,130
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go!

993
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,330
Just get one first.

994
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,330
(The two strong players
start seeking each other out.)

995
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,960
- Are they going against each other?
- Just grab her.

996
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,130
- Be careful.
- Just grab her.

997
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,530
Gosh, it's so scary.

998
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,700
This is scary!

999
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,340
Gosh, it's so scary.

1000
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,600
(Grabbing)

1001
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,610
Hey, go for it.

1002
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,740
(Right then, a fight breaks out.)

1003
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,940
- Good. Hey, go for it.
- Nice.

1004
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,140
- That's it.
- Okay.

1005
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,580
- This is scary!
- Good.

1006
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,950
- Hey, go for it.
- Nice. That's it.

1007
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,680
(The old wildcat rips
Ha Yoon's name tag off in the meantime.)

1008
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,450
(She doesn't care
about the small fry.)

1009
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,820
Go for it.

1010
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,890
Gosh, no.

1011
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,230
(Taking care of Se Chan
with one hand)

1012
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,760
(Ha Yoon keeps charging.)

1013
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,030
- Help him!
- Get Se Chan!

1014
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,100
- Help him.
- Help him out.

1015
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,540
Get him!

1016
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,470
Get him! Gosh, seriously?

1017
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,540
(He charged ahead
and only lost his name tag.)

1018
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,380
(Attacking Se Chan instead of
Min Jong who won't even budge)

1019
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,210
- Se Chan, go for his feet!
- Help him.

1020
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,880
- His feet!
- Go for his feet!

1021
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,220
Se Chan, his feet!

1022
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,220
Se Chan.

1023
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,520
- His feet!
- Go for his feet!

1024
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,720
Se Chan, his feet!

1025
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,290
- That's it.
- Gosh, that's good.

1026
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,120
Yes. That's it, Ha Yoon.

1027
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,390
Just go for his feet.

1028
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,160
Just go for his feet.

1029
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,960
(Se Chan blocks
Min Jong's entire body.)

1030
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,470
Seok Jin, my socks.

1031
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,670
My socks.

1032
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,100
(Smooching)

1033
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,240
He's kissing me!

1034
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,500
(Grossed out)

1035
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,870
(Attacking mentally with a surprise kiss
as Min Jong is much stronger)

1036
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,280
Hey, you can't kiss him!

1037
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,110
(Why do I feel like
I'm getting weaker?)

1038
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,350
Nice! Good!

1039
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,020
- That strategy worked.
- It worked.

1040
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
- Success!
- Hey!

1041
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,720
(Helping?)

1042
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,090
(The old cat is kneading dough
on the side.)

1043
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,730
- Success! Ha Yoon!
- Hey! Seok Jin!

1044
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,660
Next to Seok Jin.

1045
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,260
- Success! Ha Yoon!
- Hey! Seok Jin!

1046
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,360
(Ha Yoon aims to get rid of
Seok Jin first as he is in the way.)

1047
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,900
- Attack him!
- Nice.

1048
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,470
My gosh.

1049
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,940
Nice!

1050
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,300
Jee Seok Jin, out!

1051
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,670
- There you go, Ha Yoon!
- Jee Seok Jin, out!

1052
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,810
(He becomes barefoot in 10 seconds.)

1053
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,440
- Out! Now, get out.
- Jee Seok Jin, out!

1054
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,610
- Out!
- Out, Seok Jin! Get out!

1055
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,050
- Jee Seok Jin, out!
- Get out!

1056
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,910
Mister, get out!

1057
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,450
Mister, get out.

1058
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,280
- Mister, get out!
- This is going to work.

1059
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,520
(He ends up getting dragged out
by the human tow truck.)

1060
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,820
Hurry up. There you go.

1061
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,290
- There's one left.
- Hurry up.

1062
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,290
His socks.

1063
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,590
- Min Jong, hang in there!
- Min Jong, just a little longer!

1064
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,960
Min Jong, hang in there!

1065
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,390
Hang in there, Min Jong!

1066
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,200
- Min Jong, hang in there!
- Hang in there!

1067
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,900
(His opponent is Ha Yoon,
of all people.)

1068
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,470
- Min Jong, hang in there!
- Hang in there!

1069
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,600
Hang in there!

1070
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,140
- Nice.
- Min Jong, lie down!

1071
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,200
- Min Jong, lie down!
- No!

1072
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,440
(Right then)

1073
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,270
(Yang Se Chan soars into the air.)

1074
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,380
Nice, you did it!

1075
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,250
Nice.

1076
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,420
(He escapes another crisis
with his monstrous strength.)

1077
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,020
- Let's go!
- Min Jong, let's go.

1078
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,380
- Min Jong, let's go.
- Let's go!

1079
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,790
Nice! It's okay. Let's go!

1080
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,550
Pull your socks up more.

1081
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,360
(Readjusting himself
before the big clash)

1082
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,730
- Min Jong, let's go.
- All right.

1083
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,860
Why are all of their socks...

1084
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,560
Seok Jin,
you should've taken their socks off.

1085
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,060
- Their socks...
- Can I not play anymore?

1086
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,800
- You have to get out, Seok Jin.
- My gosh.

1087
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,430
I didn't know.

1088
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:26,140
(Min Jong is guarding his back
with 6 points on it too.)

1089
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,470
There. Min Jong...

1090
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,640
Min Jong is tired now.

1091
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,810
Hang in there. My gosh.

1092
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,810
Gosh, why is this so nerve-racking?

1093
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,210
You're almost there.

1094
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,320
(The guy in the red boxers
starts twerking as he loses energy.)

1095
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,790
Go for it! Get his name tag!

1096
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,490
- Min Jong, lie down!
- You have to go now.

1097
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
You just have to get his name tag.

1098
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,720
- I got him.
- Get him.

1099
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,590
(Right then,
Ha Yoon charges at him like a bull.)

1100
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,760
(But Min Jong blocks her.)

1101
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,670
- Yes, go for it. There. You got it.
- Gosh, Ha Yoon.

1102
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,000
- There. You got it.
- Gosh, Ha Yoon.

1103
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,700
Hey, go for it!
You have to grab him!

1104
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,440
- Hey, Min Jong!
- Min Jong, lie down!

1105
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,610
- Min Jong, no!
- Min Jong!

1106
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,170
- Lie down!
- Lie down.

1107
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
Gosh, wait!

1108
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,040
(Min Jong lies down for now.)

1109
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,810
(If they just rip this off,
they can defeat Min Jong!)

1110
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,550
- Min Jong, lie down!
- No!

1111
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,750
- There you go.
- You got it!

1112
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,880
(Only 15 seconds left)

1113
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,190
- You're almost there!
- She got it.

1114
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,690
(What will be the result?)

1115
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,290
- You have to grab it!
- Rip it off!

1116
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,990
- You have to grab it!
- Okay!

1117
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,430
(Ripping)

1118
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,560
Okay!

1119
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,430
(Ha Yoon did it!)

1120
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,300
Ha Yoon! You did it!

1121
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,400
(A perfect win with no points lost
against the Hulk)

1122
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,770
- Hey, how does this make any sense?
- I told you we could do it!

1123
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,170
- How does this make sense?
- You did so well!

1124
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,180
You did so well!

1125
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,410
(The coaches are
totally excited too.)

1126
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,520
(Her celebration)

1127
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,920
- Are you okay?
- You worked so hard.

1128
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,190
- Are you all right?
- It's hard on your own.

1129
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,990
- You worked hard.
- Good job.

1130
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,660
(Min Jong fought well on his own.)

1131
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,360
Min Jong gets tired
faster than I expected.

1132
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,990
He doesn't have the stamina
to keep going.

1133
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,360
Gosh, it's a shame.

1134
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,500
- It's okay. Did you get hurt?
- No, I didn't.

1135
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,200
- Let's do another game.
- Hey, Seok Jin.

1136
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,570
You flew away like a piece of paper.

1137
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,770
The final round is over.

1138
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,940
- Seok Jin, you tore some off.
- Yes.

1139
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,870
- But they were all 0 points.
- Were they all 0 points?

1140
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,340
This team kept all six points,

1141
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,980
- so you got 12 extra balls again.
- Okay!

1142
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,110
(The benefit of no lost points,
winning 12 extra running balls)

1143
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,720
- Ha Yoon is the best! Se Chan!
- Nice.

1144
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,180
- The strategy was good too.
- My gosh.

1145
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,690
- Indeed, the strategy...
- It was great.

1146
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,590
Ha Yoon's team,

1147
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,420
you've won 24 running balls.

1148
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,090
You can split those
among yourselves.

1149
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,000
Min Jong's team won 12.

1150
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,860
- You can split those too.
- I want to go once more.

1151
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,930
I know, right?

1152
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,540
- You can divide them how you want.
- Okay.

1153
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,170
- Is that so?
- So...

1154
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,770
- Okay, 24.
- How many of us are there?

1155
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,770
Three, two, and...

1156
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:47,210
- We can split them fairly.
- Five.

1157
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Four...

1158
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,210
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1159
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,550
- The one who loses...
- Yes?

1160
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,680
- gets four.
- Four.

1161
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,780
- But let's just give them 5.
- Okay, the loser gets 4.

1162
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,350
- Okay. Give it to them.
- These guys.

1163
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,390
Give it to them.

1164
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,990
- Yes, Se Chan too.
- Gosh, thanks.

1165
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,160
- First, you get five.
- Thank you.

1166
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,990
If you don't play, you lose.

1167
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,630
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1168
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,030
(Win)

1169
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,400
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1170
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,460
(Win)

1171
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,070
- Nice.
- Is it you?

1172
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,530
Well, I don't deserve five.

1173
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,670
You need to take one more.

1174
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,600
Gosh, our team is so heartwarming.

1175
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,740
- We're so...
- Right?

1176
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,410
- We did so well at the end.
- You guys...

1177
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,310
- His strength is on another level.
- Seriously, though...

1178
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,140
- Also, good job on hugging him.
- Anyway, yes.

1179
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,280
- I kissed him.
- Right, you did well.

1180
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,910
- I usually don't give you benefits.
- Right.

1181
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,350
But this time,
I totally have respect for you.

1182
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,350
- Salute!
- Salute!

1183
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,590
- Min Jong should take three.
- Yes, Min Jong.

1184
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,620
Thank you.

1185
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,820
- Then, two.
- Two.

1186
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,720
Jae Seok, do we write
our own names on these?

1187
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,890
Yes, write your own names.

1188
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,860
You can put them where you want to.

1189
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,730
All right, then. Let's go.

1190
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,900
Okay.

1191
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,930
- Let's go.
- Where do we put these?

1192
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,400
They said to put them in somewhere.

1193
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,000
So, we will begin
the first prize contest.

1194
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,470
The prize you can enter
your name for now...

1195
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,810
is Yang Se Chan's necessity
in daily life.

1196
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,780
The battery and washer fluid set.

1197
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,110
- Hey, that's nice.
- Oh, my.

1198
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,550
It's nice to keep
one of these at home.

1199
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,580
This is so...

1200
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,080
For the Yang Se Chan set,

1201
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,920
we will draw three names.

1202
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,050
Also, there is a fruit set.

1203
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,120
Nice.

1204
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,260
- That looks tasty.
- Nice.

1205
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,190
For the fruit set,
we'll only choose...

1206
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,260
one person's name.

1207
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,760
You get to decide which of the two
you'll enter your name into.

1208
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,100
You can enter your name
in both as well.

1209
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,900
Then, can we just keep these?

1210
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,340
You can do that too.

1211
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,140
Or you could just...

1212
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,040
- put them all in 1 box now.
- Go all-in on 1?

1213
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,110
So, once we draw the names,

1214
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,910
the running balls left inside
just go away.

1215
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,710
Anyone who doesn't win
a prize today...

1216
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,410
will get the penalty.

1217
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,580
So,

1218
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,250
you have to consider...

1219
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,490
how much you'll invest...

1220
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,050
in the one with better odds.

1221
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,720
The number of running balls
you put in...

1222
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,360
- will not be revealed.
- Do you get it?

1223
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,530
Then, you should go first
since you won.

1224
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,630
- The winning team should go first.
- Yes.

1225
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,030
- You should go first.
- Yes, you guys won.

1226
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,260
Then, shall I go first?

1227
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,560
We'll have to see.

1228
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,370
- Then, I'll go first, Jong Kook.
- Okay.

1229
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,800
(Se Chan sets off first.)

1230
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,600
Gosh, should I just use up
all I have for each round?

1231
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:56,910
We don't know what might happen.

1232
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,210
Going all-in on one...

1233
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,240
- Then, do the same for the next.
- Yes.

1234
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,410
No.

1235
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,110
Should I keep them
and go all-in at the end?

1236
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,110
But what if the prize isn't
a good one later on?

1237
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,450
That doesn't matter.

1238
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,080
- We have to avoid the penalty.
- Oh, the penalty.

1239
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,390
- Seok Jin,
- Yes?

1240
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,020
when you invest,
do you divide up your assets?

1241
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,590
- No, I just go all-in.
- Or do you... You go all-in?

1242
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,390
Your name doesn't get picked...

1243
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,460
just because you put it in
many times.

1244
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,500
- Then would splitting it be better?
- It might be.

1245
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,660
Would it be better...

1246
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,670
- to have ten percent in each box?
- Yes, it might be.

1247
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,470
Hello.

1248
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,870
(Which strategy will lead to
an exemption from the penalty?)

1249
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,740
Three people.

1250
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,070
Your name could be drawn
in either one.

1251
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,070
(Se Chan has 5 running balls.)

1252
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,480
Rather than the fruit set,
I'll go with this.

1253
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,680
One, two...

1254
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,010
(Yang Se Chan set:
Batteries and washer fluid, 3 people)

1255
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,620
Three. I'll keep these two,

1256
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,550
in case there's a better prize
later on.

1257
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,620
(He puts 3 balls in his own set
and keeps 2 balls.)

1258
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,290
Hey, do these really look like
dad shorts?

1259
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,420
(Haha has 4 running balls.)

1260
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,490
(Fruit set: 1 person,
Yang Se Chan set: 3 people)

1261
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,720
What is this? Oh, Yang Se...

1262
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,590
Why would anyone want this?

1263
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,600
People won't go for this, right?

1264
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,160
(The fruit set with fewer winners)

1265
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,200
Right?

1266
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,930
Who would enter this
when only one person wins?

1267
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,400
Only someone like me would do that.

1268
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,640
I can fill it with ten balls.

1269
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,470
(His strategy is to fill
the fruit box with 10 by himself.)

1270
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,010
I'll do this my own way.

1271
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,580
(Fruit set: 1 person)

1272
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,610
Four.

1273
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,910
(He goes all-in on the fruit set
with his 4 balls.)

1274
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,020
Whatever.

1275
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,450
Actually, I'm doing this
because I like fruits.

1276
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,220
Okay, and I bet
people won't enter this that much.

1277
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,490
(Will people enter the Yang Se Chan set
more as Haha predicted?)

1278
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,690
If just one person enters this side,

1279
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,590
I'll think of putting nine more in.

1280
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,660
(Will people enter the Yang Se Chan set
more as Haha predicted?)

1281
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,530
(Running balls in his possession: 5)

1282
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,830
My gosh.

1283
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,970
Batteries and washer fluid.

1284
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,400
Gosh, this is hard.

1285
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,040
- You'll draw three names?
- Yes.

1286
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,440
This has better odds.

1287
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,880
Honestly,
the fruit set doesn't matter.

1288
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,380
(In that case)

1289
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,310
(Fruit set: 1 person,
Yang Se Chan set: 3 people)

1290
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,980
(Going all-in with 5 balls
for the Yang Se Chan set with better odds)

1291
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,780
- How many did you put in?
- Five.

1292
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,990
The batteries
and washer fluid sound good.

1293
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,220
This has better odds.

1294
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,360
I'll go with this for now.

1295
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,560
I should win the prize first.

1296
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,790
I'll put two in here.

1297
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,990
(Will everyone keep going all-in
on the Yang Se Chan set as Haha said?)

1298
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,430
I'll put my name in here.

1299
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,400
I told Jae Seok
that I'd put it in here.

1300
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,500
(Adding two of his balls)

1301
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,070
I should get any kind of prize.

1302
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,810
(14 balls were placed in the box
for the Yang Se Chan gift set.)

1303
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,180
(Just then, Daniel adds 2 balls
to the box for the fruit set.)

1304
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,080
I need to win
any kind of prize today,

1305
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,710
and I don't think people would've
gone for the fruits.

1306
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,750
(It's the same strategy as Haha's.)

1307
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,750
I'm going to add one to each box,

1308
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,820
and then place everything
I have in the end in one box.

1309
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,830
(Unlike what Haha expected,
the fruit box is being filled.)

1310
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,700
Two of mine will go
in the box for fruits.

1311
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,900
(Current: 9 balls)

1312
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,970
The other two I have...

1313
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,140
will go in the box
for the Yang Se Chan gift set.

1314
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,200
(1 more in the box for fruits
will make it 10.)

1315
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,410
You can't see how many are inside.

1316
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,140
(Current: 9 balls,
Current: 17 balls)

1317
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,510
Since my team lost the game, I'll...

1318
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,650
(Haha's strategy
will have failed...)

1319
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,750
(if Min Jong puts his
in the box for fruits.)

1320
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,550
Ha Yoon, you're no joke.

1321
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,120
(Which box did Min Jong choose?)

1322
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,720
She's so cute.

1323
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,590
- Welcome.
- Take a seat.

1324
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,330
- Ha Yoon, you were great.
- Exactly.

1325
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,960
- Sit wherever you want.
- Sit anywhere.

1326
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,600
- Sit here.
- Yes, that's a good seat.

1327
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,000
- You look so cool.
- Nice.

1328
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,060
(She sits in Seok Sam's seat.)

1329
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,330
- Fasten your seat belt.
- Sure.

1330
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,900
- That's your seat.
- That seat's for you.

1331
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,000
Then...

1332
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,510
(She tries to fasten
her seat belt...)

1333
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,840
- Where is it?
- You never know.

1334
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,740
- I can't fasten the seat belt.
- Wasn't it six goals?

1335
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,050
What?

1336
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:27,450
- It's too short.
- Try pulling on that side.

1337
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,620
I should sit here instead.

1338
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,390
No, wait. Let me help.

1339
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,720
I should sit over there instead.

1340
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,620
- What's wrong?
- It's too short.

1341
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,660
- Is the seat belt too short?
- Yes.

1342
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,390
What if this doesn't fit as well?

1343
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,430
- You should drive there.
- Sure.

1344
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,430
(She pulled too hard,
which made it get stuck.)

1345
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,430
Okay, that's good.

1346
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,500
Seok Jin couldn't
hold his pee again.

1347
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,540
(Jae Seok joins them too.)

1348
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,570
- Ha Yoon.
- Yes?

1349
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,380
I'm sorry, but my shoulder...

1350
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,510
- Wait, is her shoulder on yours?
- Also,

1351
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,810
she placed hers above mine
so naturally.

1352
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,950
(Heave-ho)

1353
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,150
- Come on, Ha Yoon.
- Yes?

1354
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,490
This is upsetting.

1355
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,090
- That's how it should be.
- I know, but...

1356
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,460
You know,

1357
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:11,960
this is like a robot vacuum cleaner
coming back to be recharged.

1358
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,060
- She lets me move out,
- Right.

1359
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,970
- but when I come back...
- She places her shoulder on yours.

1360
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,470
- Doesn't it add stability?
- It does.

1361
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:23,140
There's a box
that has over ten Running Balls.

1362
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,270
- What?
- No way.

1363
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:25,980
Before we move to the next location,

1364
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,640
- we'll hold a raffle.
- Okay.

1365
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,710
- Sure.
- The gift you'll win...

1366
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,880
is the Yang Se Chan gift set.

1367
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,920
It's a sweet gift.

1368
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,580
Can we still win the fruit set?

1369
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,290
That box doesn't have ten balls yet,

1370
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,720
so we'll see who wins the fruit...

1371
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,960
when more balls
are added to the box.

1372
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,690
I should place my balls
in the box for fruits.

1373
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,060
(Fruit set: 1 person,
Yang Se Chan gift set: 3 people)

1374
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,630
(Current: 9 balls,
Current: 17 balls)

1375
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,500
(I'll go all in after
the next game.)

1376
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,400
(Min Jong kept his Running Balls
for the next game.)

1377
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,540
(The fruits set is still up
for grabs.)

1378
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,910
The batteries
and windshield washer fluid set...

1379
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,940
- will be given to three people.
- I hope it's me.

1380
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,210
- Is the raffle happening now?
- Yes.

1381
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,650
- That's why...
- Nice.

1382
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,680
you'll quickly find out
if you're exempt...

1383
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,020
- from the penalty today.
- Exactly.

1384
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,080
- This way...
- No way.

1385
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,550
Once you win a prize,
you're free to mess around.

1386
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,720
- This is huge.
- Whisk the balls around a lot.

1387
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,590
- Three people will win the prize.
- Three.

1388
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,660
- Whisk the balls around a lot.
- Please let it be me.

1389
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,990
- Whisk them around.
- I think I'll win the prize.

1390
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,790
I have a feeling I'll win the prize!

1391
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,030
I placed my balls in there too!

1392
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,530
- I think I'll win the prize.
- Let's begin the day...

1393
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,030
knowing I won't receive
a penalty today.

1394
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,670
- I placed my balls in there too!
- I've grabbed a ball.

1395
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,170
- Let it be me.
- I think I'll win the prize.

1396
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,600
- I think I'll win the prize.
- Jee Seok Jin!

1397
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,040
- Who is it?
- Kook, Kim Jong Kook.

1398
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,040
- What did I tell you?
- What?

1399
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:32,640
(Kim Jong Kook)

1400
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,980
- He's so lucky!
- I told you so!

1401
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,140
You're always so lucky.

1402
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,050
Let Se Chan have
the Yang Se Chan gift set.

1403
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,520
- Two more people can win the prize.
- Why was his name pulled out?

1404
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,780
- Okay!
- Let it be me.

1405
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,390
Why was Jong Kook's name pulled out?

1406
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,250
It can be you, Ye Eun.

1407
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,260
- Seok Jin.
- I grabbed one.

1408
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,420
- Let it be Seok Jin.
- I placed all my balls in there.

1409
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,090
I put two of my balls in there.

1410
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,130
- Yang Se Chan.
- Ha Yoon.

1411
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:51,990
- Se Chan.
- Jee Seok Jin.

1412
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,030
Let it be me!

1413
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,160
(Who will be just as lucky
as Jong Kook?)

1414
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,400
- Kook.
- Okay!

1415
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,530
(Yang Se Chan gift set,
Jong Kook: 4)

1416
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:01,270
(Kook's ball was pulled out
once again.)

1417
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,940
- You can win the same prize.
- Of course. Nice!

1418
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,210
- That's what makes it fun.
- Jong Kook wins...

1419
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,880
- two Yang Se Chan gift sets.
- That's what makes it fun. Okay!

1420
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,280
Why are you only pulling out
Jong Kook's balls?

1421
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,680
Jong Kook's so lucky.

1422
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,620
This means one of us
won't get to win a prize.

1423
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,280
- Exactly.
- We lost a chance to win a prize.

1424
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,720
That's right.
You missed out on a chance.

1425
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,720
Only one more person
will get to win the prize.

1426
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,820
- Kim Jong Kook!
- Yang Se Chan should win...

1427
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,890
- Kim Jong Kook!
- the Yang Se Chan gift set.

1428
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,490
- Kim Jong Kook!
- Pull out my ball again.

1429
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:23,930
- That's how it should be.
- It'll be entertaining that way.

1430
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,100
- That'll be fun.
- I've grabbed a ball.

1431
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,300
(Yang Se Chan gift set,
Jong Kook: 3, Se Chan: 3,)

1432
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,670
(Jae Seok: 2, Seok Jin: 2,
Ji Hyo: 2, Ye Eun: 2, Ha Yoon: 1)

1433
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,900
Song Ji Hyo.

1434
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,240
(Yang Se Chan gift set, Ji Hyo: 2)

1435
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,470
(Lucky Ji Hyo)

1436
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,770
- Jong Kook!
- For 15 years, those two...

1437
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,040
- They've been lucky for 15 years.
- No way.

1438
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,810
- How can they be this lucky?
- Did you see his reaction?

1439
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,910
His reaction was hilarious.

1440
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,180
- His reaction was hilarious.
- Do you hate that I won?

1441
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,850
- What?
- Why are you upset that I won?

1442
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,590
- I wasn't upset.
- You seemed sour just now.

1443
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:52,190
I thought she was pulling out
another one of mine again.

1444
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:53,820
I thought I had won.

1445
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,930
- You'll receive your prizes.
- I thought I had won.

1446
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,630
(Handing over the prizes)

1447
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,860
- I thought I had won.
- Right away?

1448
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,130
- I thought I had won.
- This is nice.

1449
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,430
"Why did you look sour?"

1450
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,770
- Batteries!
- Lucky you.

1451
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:06,740
- If it's a mistake...
- Recently, I changed...

1452
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,140
the batteries in my smart door lock.

1453
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,240
- No way.
- Here.

1454
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,540
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo
are exempt from today's penalty.)

1455
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,110
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo...

1456
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,510
can still go after the prizes
in the next round.

1457
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:18,410
- You're allowed multiple prizes.
- Lucky you.

1458
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,650
- I'd love some batteries too.
- Why do Jong Kook and Ji Hyo...

1459
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:23,320
- always get lucky with draws?
- They're always so lucky.

1460
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:24,650
That's a lot of mats.

1461
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,690
- What is this place?
- What is all this?

1462
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,190
- No way.
- It must be a pillow fight.

1463
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,260
- It's a pillow fight.
- We're having a pillow fight.

1464
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,430
I'm going to win no matter what.

1465
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:32,730
I'm going to try hard as well.

1466
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,200
No way.

1467
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,600
A pillow fight?
I haven't had one in a while.

1468
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,130
It's been a while
since I had a pillow fight.

1469
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,770
It's hard to hang from up there.

1470
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:40,800
I'll do everything to win.

1471
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,070
I'll do everything to win too.

1472
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,110
(Determined)

1473
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,540
Baby Octopus
and Dad-style Underwear.

1474
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,280
Your mouth will be stuck here.

1475
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,880
Dad-style Underwear, shut it.

1476
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,510
Hee Kwan's boyfriend,
you have another thing coming.

1477
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,350
- Hee Kwan's boyfriend?
- You mean, his girlfriend.

1478
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:53,250
- Right, his girlfriend.
- Hee Kwan's girlfriend.

1479
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,280
(Baby Octopus can't
even get the words right.)

1480
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,850
That body of his...
What do we do about that?

1481
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,420
Let him crush you just a little bit.

1482
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,460
- Stand in front of him.
- Be gentle.

1483
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,560
Crush me harder, but slowly.

1484
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,430
(Groaning!)

1485
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:09,200
(He gets crushed for
fearlessly challenging Min Jong.)

1486
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,100
- You tapped out so fast.
- Sorry about that.

1487
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,670
- I should've done that slower.
- You tapped out too fast.

1488
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:13,940
It hurts like crazy.

1489
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,370
- He'll crush you.
- Absolutely.

1490
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,910
(Groaning!)

1491
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,370
(His crazy arms)

1492
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:20,980
- He's like Hulk.
- Check out his forearm muscles.

1493
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,280
Jong Kook, no way.

1494
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,210
- My gosh.
- How strong is he really?

1495
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,480
I can't reach around his torso.

1496
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,180
- My hands don't touch.
- They won't meet.

1497
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,250
Let me try.

1498
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,490
- My hands don't touch.
- Hold on.

1499
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:31,490
- What do we need to do...
- Our hands won't meet.

1500
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:32,520
to subdue him?

1501
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,160
- The four of us will come at him.
- Yes, the four of us.

1502
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,890
(They all tackle him,
but he won't budge.)

1503
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,460
You need to each take
one of his limbs.

1504
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,900
You've got to be kidding me.
Feel his legs.

1505
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:45,470
- Jong Kook, feel his legs.
- Guys.

1506
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,100
- This is refreshing.
- Feel his leg right here.

1507
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,470
(The muscle expert
appraises the leg.)

1508
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:50,040
(Solid)

1509
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,070
- Unbelievable.
- I can't believe it.

1510
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,280
- No way.
- Let me.

1511
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,780
- Does this hurt?
- No.

1512
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,110
- Doesn't this hurt?
- It doesn't.

1513
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,780
- Didn't that hurt?
- It didn't.

1514
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,110
(Is it a game where they can beat
the muscular and strong Min Jong?)

1515
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,750
- His thigh is this thick.
- He's no joke.

1516
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,350
- Did you see the new prize?
- Sure.

1517
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:06,050
(The new prize?)

1518
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,160
(Greeting them at the new location)

1519
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,260
(New gift raffle boxes
have been added.)

1520
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,990
(The prize carried forward
from the last game)

1521
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,600
(Summer set, 2 people
Luxury body lotion set, 1 person)

1522
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,930
Body lotion?

1523
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,870
I'm getting that.
That's what I'm going for.

1524
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,800
(Jong Kook is particularly eager
to win household items.)

1525
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,700
(Meanwhile, the others hope
to be exempt from today's penalty.)

1526
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,440
You may place your balls
inside the raffle box...

1527
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,480
until there are more than ten balls
at the end of the round.

1528
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,710
Physical education students
shouldn't skip their meals.

1529
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,980
You'll play to win lunch
and additional Running Balls.

1530
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,920
This is Reach the Right Answer.

1531
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,620
You'll win Chinese food dishes
equal to the number...

1532
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,190
- of correct answers you get.
- Chinese food?

1533
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,360
I love jjajangmyeon.

1534
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,560
Jjamppong is the way to go.

1535
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,130
Tangsuyuk is what I'm having.

1536
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,290
I'm hungry.

1537
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:45,860
- Let's have a tasty lunch.
- I love it.

1538
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,530
To answer the questions,

1539
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,900
you have to win the right to do so.

1540
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,270
Two people from each team...

1541
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,000
will fight with pillows
on the cylinder...

1542
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,470
and try to take
the two answer sheets...

1543
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:56,710
from the opponent's side.

1544
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:57,940
- We need to jump.
- While in a pillow fight?

1545
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,880
The team that takes
the two answer sheets...

1546
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,910
will get the chance to answer first.

1547
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:04,780
The two people playing the game...

1548
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,880
can discuss and answer
the question together.

1549
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,050
Is it a quiz?

1550
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:12,290
You'll win Running Balls
based on how well you do.

1551
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:13,820
After splitting into two teams,

1552
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,190
please choose the two members
who will play.

1553
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,060
We need to balance out the teams.

1554
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,230
Empty Heads should be on both teams.

1555
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:20,230
You need players who are smart.

1556
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,000
We need to balance out the teams.

1557
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,700
- Of course.
- It's a team game.

1558
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,870
Choose your teammates.

1559
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,340
- Ha Yoon...
- They should do that.

1560
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,340
and Min Jong,
play rock-paper-scissors.
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1561
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,940
It was just Se Chan and Seok Sam...

1562
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,610
- who switched teams.
- You're right.

1563
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,180
- Ha Yoon, I'm coming for you.
- What?

1564
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,880
- Ha Yoon.
- Play against me this time.

1565
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:37,980
Sure.

1566
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,620
- Make sure to play against me.
- Got it.

1567
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,880
Someone strong should sit
in the front...

1568
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,950
and win the pillow fight...

1569
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,290
- while the one in the back answers.
- Right.

1570
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:46,320
- That's a strategy.
- Min Jong and...

1571
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,890
- Min Jong will sit in the front.
- Sure.

1572
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,460
- Jae Seok, you sit behind him.
- Sure.

1573
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,060
- Seok Jin...
- And Ha Yoon.

1574
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,760
- and Ha Yoon.
- That sounds good.

1575
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,160
- Let's go!
- Okay, let's do this.

1576
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,930
Bring it on!

1577
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,300
Round One.

1578
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,470
Okay!

1579
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,840
Is it Ha Yoon?
I'm going to take revenge on you.

1580
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:03,670
- Ha Yoon. You...
- You're against Min Jong again.

1581
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,510
Look at Min Jong's thighs.

1582
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,680
His thighs are crazy.

1583
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,310
Look at his calf.

1584
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:09,510
(Massive calf)

1585
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,110
- Look at his thigh.
- Incredible.

1586
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,850
He's like a dinosaur.

1587
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,220
(Min Jong has the best physique.)

1588
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,320
(Ha Yoon challenges him.)

1589
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,790
- Okay.
- Get ready.

1590
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,420
- I will...
- Okay.

1591
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,560
- Get ready.
- Okay.

1592
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,630
(Falling)

1593
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:25,690
(She falls with Seok Sam.)

1594
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,200
What did you just do, Ha Yoon?

1595
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,100
- Ha Yoon.
- What?

1596
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,400
My feet won't touch the floor.

1597
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,830
- Don't kill your team.
- Wait.

1598
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,400
Ha Yoon couldn't go up.

1599
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,570
- Ha Yoon.
- So...

1600
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,710
- I was going to help her up.
- My feet...

1601
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,510
- Ha Yoon.
- My feet won't touch the floor.

1602
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,740
- They're not supposed to touch.
- Ha Yoon.

1603
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,210
Grab her.

1604
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,880
- My head's spinning.
- Are you okay?

1605
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,350
- Are you all right, Ha Yoon?
- I'm okay.

1606
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,020
- Are you okay?
- This is crazy.

1607
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,590
- Are you good?
- I'm good.

1608
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,450
- Okay.
- Ready.

1609
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,520
- Be careful.
- Okay.

1610
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,190
- Be careful.
- Okay.

1611
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:59,900
(Jae Seok attacks first.)

1612
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:03,100
So weak.

1613
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,100
(The big brothers
start the pillow fight.)

1614
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,670
(Excited)

1615
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,000
Don't cry.

1616
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,110
- You lose if you cry.
- Goodness.

1617
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,140
(Attacking)

1618
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,410
(He doesn't cry and fights back.)

1619
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,510
- He's fast.
- He's fast.

1620
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:18,580
- He's fast.
- He's not hitting him once.

1621
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,220
(Hitting the same spot.)

1622
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,020
Look how ugly Jae Seok is.

1623
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,620
(Even the facial massage
can't save his facial line.)

1624
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,690
(Already tired)

1625
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:35,300
(Hitting the spot)

1626
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,600
(The weak Jee-rasoni's
sneaky attack)

1627
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,930
I'm sorry. My arm is short.

1628
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,870
- I'm sorry.
- Hey!

1629
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,300
- Is that allowed?
- That's not it.

1630
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,440
- That's how you play.
- Sorry.

1631
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,040
I need to rip that off. Hold on.
I need to get up.

1632
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,040
- You have to get up.
- Right.

1633
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,110
- You have to get up.
- You have to get up.

1634
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,780
- Get up.
- Get up.

1635
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,680
Now it's a game about getting up.

1636
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,750
I can win.

1637
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,550
I must win.

1638
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:01,590
- He's going to fall.
- He's going to fall. Careful.

1639
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,960
- Careful.
- You have to be careful.

1640
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,390
All right.

1641
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:08,800
You are going to jump?

1642
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,570
(Supported by Ha Yoon,
Seok Sam managed to get up.)

1643
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:13,470
- You are going to jump?
- You can't do it.

1644
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,370
- He got a little bit taller.
- It's very high.

1645
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:16,400
(Will he be able to
get it on the first try?)

1646
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:23,210
(He fails to jump
even 1cm and fails.)

1647
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:24,710
Be careful.

1648
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:27,220
- Good job, Ha Yoon.
- Good job.

1649
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,650
He can't move back.
There is no space.

1650
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,520
(Jae Seok declared war.)

1651
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,860
(Will he be able to
endure the attack?)

1652
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,190
Make him fall.

1653
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,630
Nice.

1654
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,570
(One hit, and he's out.)

1655
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,340
Min Jong!

1656
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,570
(Surprised)

1657
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:52,110
Min Jong!

1658
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,750
(The two powerhouses fight.)

1659
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,280
Oh, no!

1660
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,380
(Dopamine explodes.)

1661
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:01,980
- This is fun.
- Min Jong!

1662
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,090
(They each got hit once.)

1663
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:07,120
I won't go easy on you.

1664
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,560
I won't go easy on you either.

1665
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,790
- Okay.
- Go. You are solid.

1666
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,360
Hey.

1667
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,400
Gosh, Min Jong... She's ruthless.
That's it.

1668
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,000
(The baby octopus is shocked
to see the two friends' fight.)

1669
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,610
Go, Min Jong!

1670
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:26,440
Let's go!

1671
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,280
- Wait.
- Ha Yoon, beat him.

1672
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,120
(The scary beating sound
stops them.)

1673
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,790
- That's it.
- That's it.

1674
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,990
(The two athletes are
completely immersed.)

1675
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,920
That's it. Go.

1676
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,290
Seok Jin is cowardly.
He's attacking from behind.

1677
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,460
He's a coward.

1678
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,100
He's a coward.

1679
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,400
(He's out with just one hit.)

1680
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,200
(Cracking up)

1681
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,370
Min Jong, you have to hurry.

1682
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:59,170
- You have to hurry.
- Hurry.

1683
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,240
It's very high.

1684
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:02,780
- It's not easy to get.
- It's very high.

1685
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,310
It's high. Go up.

1686
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,480
Go up.

1687
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,920
Watch your head.

1688
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,420
(Min Jong's only target is Ha Yoon.)

1689
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,360
(Jae Seok gets hit
on the dangerous spot once again.)

1690
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,130
- Good job.
- That's it.

1691
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,130
Hurry.
Min Jong.

1692
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,500
(Meanwhile, Min Jong
quickly snatched it.)

1693
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,000
(Team Min Jong earns
1 answer cloth.)

1694
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,300
- Hurry! This is our chance.
- Hurry!

1695
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,470
- This is our chance.
- This is our chance.

1696
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,270
(While they're gone,
Ha Yoon goes for it.)

1697
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,140
- What?
- Be careful.

1698
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,280
- It's high.
- I can't reach it.

1699
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,280
Leave him be.

1700
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,210
Watch out.

1701
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:39,910
- Watch out.
- I know.

1702
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:40,980
Hurry.

1703
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,690
(Team Min Jong 1)

1704
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:44,990
(Team Ha Yoon gets one too.)

1705
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,760
- Okay.
- Ha Yoon, hurry.

1706
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,290
Go up, Seok Jin.

1707
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:49,760
Don't push me!

1708
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,630
Gosh.

1709
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,790
Wait.

1710
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,800
(Tight defense)

1711
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,570
Good job.

1712
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,470
- Nice. Go up.
- She just pushed.

1713
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:02,800
- I will stop him.
- Let me go up.

1714
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,340
- Step on him and jump.
- Go.

1715
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,810
Just one more.

1716
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:07,710
(Ha Yoon gets up again.
Will she succeed this time?)

1717
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,050
She got it.

1718
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,510
(She finally succeeds!)

1719
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:14,680
I'm tired.

1720
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,950
Well done!

1721
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:16,950
(Team Ha Yoon gets
the chance to answer first.)

1722
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,720
Team Ha Yoon will go first.
If they get it wrong,

1723
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,290
- Team Min Jong will get the chance.
- Okay.

1724
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,560
- We can do it together, right?
- Yes.

1725
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,830
- They will do it together.
- Let's go.

1726
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,960
- All right. Here's the question.
- If they fail...

1727
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:30,800
What do the parts "egen"
and "teto" mean...

1728
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,870
in the coined words
referring to sex hormone,

1729
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:36,840
"Egen Male" and "Teto Female?"

1730
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,410
- In the count of three.
- One each?

1731
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:39,710
Testosterone.

1732
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:40,910
That's a big word.

1733
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:41,910
(Answer: Estrogen, Testosterone)

1734
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,380
- In the count of three.
- That's a big word.

1735
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,410
Esterterone.

1736
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:45,410
(Confident)

1737
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,150
You should've taken the hard one.

1738
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:49,220
How can you be so shameless?

1739
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,250
Did you see
how shameless Ha Yoon is?

1740
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,660
- The other team gets the chance.
- Estrogen.

1741
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,720
Testro... Testro Male.

1742
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,760
- Let me answer!
- All right.

1743
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,830
- In 3, 2, 1.
- Testosterone.

1744
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:01,660
- Testrote...
- No, you...

1745
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,100
You're supposed to give
the answer for "Egen Male!"

1746
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,100
Egen.

1747
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,840
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1748
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,300
- You got it?
- Testosterone.

1749
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,870
Min Jong will go first.

1750
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,110
Testosterone.

1751
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:12,770
Estrogen.

1752
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,440
- Okay!
- Yes!

1753
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,110
Well done, Min Jong.

1754
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:18,110
- Well done.
- Yes!

1755
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,480
- Good job, Min Jong.
- Nice.

1756
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,680
(They earn a dish for lunch.)

1757
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,950
- Wait.
- Look.

1758
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,320
You could've said "estrogen."

1759
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,090
No, he had just...

1760
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,390
- heard "estrogen."
- Estrogen.

1761
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,490
- Anyhow...
- Testosterone.

1762
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,190
- Testosterone.
- Okay!

1763
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:32,630
- Testosterone.
- Yes.

1764
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,100
What a shame.

1765
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,300
Should Jong Kook and Ji Hyo fight?

1766
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,900
- Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.
- Us two? Okay.

1767
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,670
- Daniel and Ye Eun.
- When Haha joins the game...

1768
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,240
- You two go.
- Yes.

1769
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:43,300
They are too powerful.

1770
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:44,940
Let's eat!

1771
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,410
We have to win this one.

1772
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,910
Let's win and eat something good.

1773
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:49,310
- Ye Eun!
- Yes?

1774
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:50,880
Attack with your text neck.

1775
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,880
- Don't get scared, Ye Eun.
- Right.

1776
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,820
- That's it. Move it back and forth.
- We got this.

1777
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,380
- Ji Hyo will take care of it.
- Ji Hyo.

1778
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,520
- Ji Hyo.
- Ready.

1779
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,850
(The game begins.)

1780
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:02,290
That's it.

1781
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:03,960
- Great!
- You're great!

1782
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,860
- I am sorry.
- That's it.

1783
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,730
- That's it.
- Good job!

1784
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,500
- I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.
- Good job!

1785
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,700
(Ye Eun provokes,
and Ji Hyo the Powerful awakes.)

1786
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,640
(Clenched teeth)

1787
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:16,940
- Great.
- Ye Eun!

1788
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,770
- Ye Eun.
- Look to the front!

1789
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,680
- Great.
- Great!

1790
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,410
- Great.
- Ye Eun,

1791
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:23,780
- Ye Eun.
- look to the front!

1792
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:27,220
(She gets knocked out
without getting a chance to attack.)

1793
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:30,020
(After getting rid of Ye Eun,
she moves forward.)

1794
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,820
(It wakes him up.)

1795
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,760
(She hits with power
that's at another level.)

1796
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:38,830
Look at her.

1797
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:39,930
- Gosh.
- She's in her zone.

1798
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:40,960
Look at her.

1799
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,130
(Her talent surprises
the judo scene.)

1800
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:43,600
I can't get up.

1801
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,370
- She's so strong.
- She is.

1802
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,770
(Straining)

1803
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:48,770
- Good job.
- Go!

1804
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,170
(She beats them
regardless of gender.)

1805
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,540
- Go!
- Goodness.

1806
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,440
(She clears Daniel
in an instant too.)

1807
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,110
She's too into it.

1808
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,140
(His legs go weak.)

1809
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,110
Ye Eun, you have to look
where you are swinging!

1810
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,750
(While Ji Hyo takes them down,
Jong Kook gets up.)

1811
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,520
- Great.
- Jong Kook is standing.

1812
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,050
- He's up.
- The game is over.

1813
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,120
Go.

1814
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:08,820
(He jumps towards the answer cloth.)

1815
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,830
(He gets 1 answer cloth.)

1816
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:11,990
- Ji Hyo.
- There's one more.

1817
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,030
(He just has to get one more.)

1818
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,200
One more.

1819
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,800
Daniel, what are you doing?

1820
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,070
Attack!

1821
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:20,400
- I will...
- Is it a riding game or what?

1822
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,040
- A train...
- Is it a train game?

1823
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,270
Is it a train game?
What are you doing?

1824
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,440
- Gosh.
- Jong Kook is done.

1825
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:28,840
Ji Hyo.

1826
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,850
Hit her. She's not your friend.

1827
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:33,280
(After getting rid of Daniel,
Jong Kook got up again.)

1828
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,320
(He gets two answer cloths.)

1829
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,690
Come on, Daniel.

1830
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,820
Seriously, come on.

1831
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,590
- Daniel can't do anything.
- Did we win?

1832
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,860
He always says he's good at it.

1833
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,990
He's not good at anything.

1834
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:47,230
- He's worse than me.
- This is hard.

1835
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:48,860
- Here's the question.
- It's really high.

1836
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,570
- It's high.
- Ji Hyo...

1837
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:52,630
- and Jong Kook have to go first.
- We can...

1838
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,500
- Get the answer...
- We can get the answer.

1839
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,600
Get ready, Daniel.

1840
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,440
Spell out 'Olympics'
one letter at a time.

1841
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,080
- Ji Hyo will go first.
- One letter per person?

1842
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:02,710
- O.
- L.

1843
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:04,850
- P.
- Okay.

1844
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:06,310
Next.

1845
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,680
- O.
- L.

1846
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,020
- Y.
- P.

1847
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,250
- I.
- I.

1848
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,890
- Gosh.
- Wait.

1849
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:14,690
- We're almost there.
- Let's go.

1850
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:15,790
We have to get it.

1851
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,930
- Jong Kook will go first.
- O.

1852
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:18,690
- L.
- Y.

1853
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,030
- E.
- M.

1854
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,300
- O.
- L.

1855
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,600
- Y.
- P.

1856
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,870
- I.
- C.

1857
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,100
- Okay!
- Okay!

1858
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,200
- It's wrong.
- It's...

1859
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,910
- You skipped M.
- They skipped M.

1860
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:32,370
- They skipped M.
- They skipped M.

1861
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:33,840
- Ji Hyo.
- You have to get this.

1862
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,910
- It's "Olympic."
- Again.

1863
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,150
Okay. Wait.

1864
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:39,480
- All right. Jong Kook goes first.
- Think of the word "Olympic."

1865
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,380
- M.
- O.

1866
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,380
- What's next? Y.
- L.

1867
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:45,890
- M.
- That's it. P.

1868
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:46,920
- I.
- C.

1869
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,660
- Okay!
- Okay!

1870
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,190
(Correct)

1871
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:53,090
You got it when you took it slow.

1872
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,200
You hurried too much.

1873
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,530
I should've written it down.

1874
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:56,900
Well done. Yes.

1875
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,030
- Did you forget M?
- Did you forget it?

1876
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,100
He forgot M.

1877
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:01,470
Well done.

1878
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:02,500
Retainer.

1879
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,500
(In the next quiz,)

1880
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,410
(Se Chan the Empty Head
wins 1 point!)

1881
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:07,540
- Next.
- Dong.

1882
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:08,680
- Yeo.
- Ji.

1883
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,680
- Do.
- Yes!

1884
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,850
(However, Team Ha Yoon
catches up right away.)

1885
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:13,480
This time, you and Ha Yoon...

1886
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,980
- should go.
- Okay.

1887
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,620
- It's the strongest duo.
- The strongest duo.

1888
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,690
The two of you should go next.

1889
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:19,720
The two of us? Okay.

1890
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,620
Since it takes too long for you guys
to get two answer cloths,

1891
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,230
- we'll let you answer...
- Good.

1892
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,160
- after getting one.
- Let's go.

1893
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,600
We need to win this round
to become the winner.

1894
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,300
Let's answer correctly.

1895
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,570
- Seriously.
- Food is on the line.

1896
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:31,770
- Food is on the line.
- It's important.

1897
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:32,770
This round is important.

1898
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:33,800
What should we do?
Let's come up with a strategy.

1899
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,440
- You should be at the front.
- Okay.

1900
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,410
- I'll be a tank.
- Be a tank. From the back,

1901
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:39,540
- I'll get the answer cloth.
- Okay.

1902
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,880
Ha Yoon, they're strategizing.

1903
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,610
- Jong Kook, we'll show you.
- Everyone has a plan...

1904
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:45,950
- before he gets beaten up.
- We'll show you.

1905
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,580
- That's right.
- Why would you say that?

1906
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,020
- His words make sense.
- It's a famous quote.

1907
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:52,520
It's a famous quote by Mike Tyson.

1908
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:54,920
When will Jong Kook get beaten up?

1909
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:56,660
Ha Yoon, we won't hold back.

1910
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,890
- I won't hold back either.
- Ha Yoon.

1911
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,890
- You being a man changes nothing.
- Okay.

1912
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,330
- Ha Yoon.
- Get ready.

1913
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:03,330
- You being a man changes nothing.
- Okay.

1914
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:06,300
"You being a man changes nothing."

1915
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,970
- She's hitting his head.
- Just hit her.

1916
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:09,500
- Good.
- Hurry up and do it.

1917
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:12,470
(Putting his guard up
doesn't help him.)

1918
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,910
Just hit her.

1919
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:15,480
- She's holding it tight.
- Daniel.

1920
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,280
(Groaning)

1921
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,350
- Hold on.
- Ha Yoon.

1922
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,680
- Time out.
- What's this?

1923
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,820
What's this?

1924
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:26,550
(The pillow burst!)

1925
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,120
It burst.

1926
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,530
(Laughing)

1927
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:31,960
- What's this?
- What's this?

1928
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,530
She's doing this with seriousness.

1929
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:36,730
She's doing this with seriousness.

1930
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,170
- Daniel.
- She's doing this with seriousness.

1931
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:40,300
Do it.

1932
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,940
- Do it.
- She's collecting the cotton.

1933
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,240
(She prepares to hit him again.)

1934
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,840
He always claims
that he's good at something.

1935
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,340
- What?
- Hit her.

1936
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,280
Hey, that won't be enough.

1937
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,910
(His blows are too weak.)

1938
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:55,520
(She gives him
a proper demonstration.)

1939
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,590
There you go. Ha Yoon, that's good.

1940
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:03,790
(Jong Kook joins in on the attack.)

1941
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:07,230
I'll block the blows. Go ahead.

1942
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:08,360
Go.

1943
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,530
Daniel, what are you doing?

1944
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:10,900
(Stretching)

1945
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,000
Go.

1946
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,170
- I'll block the blows. Go.
- Daniel.

1947
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:14,500
- Go.
- For goodness' sake.

1948
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,770
(After Daniel takes a hit,
Se Chan blocks.)

1949
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,140
(What are they doing?)

1950
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,710
Is he Yeong Goo?

1951
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,680
- I'll block the blows. Go.
- Daniel.

1952
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,850
(The faulty man is about to cry.)

1953
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,110
Se Chan.

1954
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,750
(At that moment,)

1955
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:31,650
(Se Chan takes a proper blow
while talking in the back.)

1956
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:33,190
- Push through.
- There you go.

1957
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:34,320
- There you go.
- Okay.

1958
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,990
There you go.

1959
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,460
It's the only time
Se Chan can hit him.

1960
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:38,490
That's right.

1961
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:41,430
(It's his chance to beat
the groom-to-be with a pillow.)

1962
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:43,430
(A missed hit)

1963
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:44,500
- Good.
- Se Chan, hit him.

1964
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,800
(Se Chan's blow lands this time!)

1965
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,970
Se Chan, hold out. Grab me.

1966
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,910
(How dare you hit me?)

1967
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,180
(Crying)

1968
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,480
(For goodness' sake!)

1969
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,580
Se Chan, hold out.

1970
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:01,950
(Jong Kook is using a pillow,)

1971
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:04,450
(but it feels like a rock.)

1972
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:05,950
Look at his eyes.

1973
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:10,090
(There's craziness in his eyes.)

1974
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:13,390
(Crying)

1975
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,570
(Se Chan is knocked out.)

1976
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:18,570
- Good.
- Everyone...

1977
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:19,870
(Everyone has a plan...)

1978
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:21,140
(until they get punched
in the face.)

1979
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:22,870
Hey, isn't it the same pillow?

1980
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,210
Everyone has a plan...

1981
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,770
Until they get punched in the face.

1982
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,080
- Hey.
- I'll do it, Se Chan.

1983
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,010
Daniel, hit Jong Kook in the face.

1984
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,050
- Jong Kook.
- Hey.

1985
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:33,880
- Daniel, hit him.
- Why don't we make one blow each?

1986
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,880
- Daniel, hit him 1st.
- Good? I'll go 1st.

1987
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,020
Hit him first.

1988
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:44,430
Everyone has a plan...

1989
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,560
until they get punched in the face.

1990
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,470
(He took care of the situation
with one blow.)

1991
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:53,770
It's over.

1992
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,870
(They get an answer cloth
after beating everyone.)

1993
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:57,940
Okay.

1994
01:03:58,310 --> 01:03:59,570
For goodness' sake.

1995
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:00,810
- Ha Yoon, let's do this.
- It's so funny.

1996
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:02,280
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

1997
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,510
- We still have a chance.
- It's so funny.

1998
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:04,610
- Focus and answer the question.
- Get a hint.

1999
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:06,180
- Get a hint from them.
- Let's answer correctly.

2000
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:08,250
Make sure to take turns answering.

2001
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,250
We need to take turns.

2002
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,350
Even the back of my head hurts.

2003
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,990
Take turns to give four proverbs...

2004
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:15,120
that are related to cows.

2005
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,620
- Ha Yoon, go. One, two, three.
- Beat them.

2006
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:17,890
A needle thief becomes a cow thing.

2007
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:18,960
- No.
- No.

2008
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,460
A needle thief becomes a cow thing.

2009
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,600
- No.
- No.

2010
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,800
"A cow thing."

2011
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,600
"A cow thing."

2012
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,870
"A cow thing."

2013
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:28,270
(She loses her change
because her tongue is tied.)

2014
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:29,340
- It's okay.
- "A cow thing."

2015
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,410
All right. One, two, three.

2016
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:32,610
You fix the barn after losing a cow.

2017
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,380
A needle thief becomes a cow thief.

2018
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,840
- Three.
- Reciting a prayer to a cow.

2019
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,550
(They quickly give 3 proverbs.
Will they succeed in the mission?)

2020
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:39,710
One, two, three.

2021
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:41,650
Reciting a prayer to a cow.

2022
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,220
One, two, three.

2023
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:44,890
- Protection of small businesses...
- One...

2024
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,120
(Protection of small businesses...)

2025
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,590
Protection of small businesses...

2026
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:49,990
(Protection of small businesses...)

2027
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:52,090
(He wanted to root
for the nation's small businesses.)

2028
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:54,960
- Small business owners, rise!
- That's right.

2029
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,200
- Cheer up.
- Small business owners,

2030
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,230
- good luck.
- Good luck.

2031
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,030
Ha Yoon, go first.

2032
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:00,940
A needle thief becomes a cow thief.

2033
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:03,640
- Three, two...
- Reciting a prayer to a cow.

2034
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,670
- Three,
- You fix the barn...

2035
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:05,710
- after losing a cow.
- two...

2036
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,840
(Will they succeed in the mission?)

2037
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:11,650
- Three...
- A cow steps back...

2038
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:12,750
and catches a mouse.

2039
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,350
Okay. I did it.

2040
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:15,720
(Correct)

2041
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,850
(After Ha Yoon does well,
Jong Kook solidifies the win!)

2042
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:19,850
- They did it.
- Okay.

2043
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:21,820
(After Ha Yoon does well,
Jong Kook solidifies the win!)

2044
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,260
I couldn't think of one.

2045
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:24,990
That was incredible.

2046
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,200
Jae Seok, it was too hard.

2047
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,930
- It was hard.
- It was hard.

2048
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,830
The result of the mission is 3 to 2.

2049
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,600
- Team Ha Yoon takes the win.
- It's too bad.

2050
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,640
I'm disappointed.

2051
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:40,510
The winning team
will receive 20 Running Balls.

2052
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:42,180
The losing team...

2053
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:44,050
- will receive 15 Running Balls.
- Not bad.

2054
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:45,310
- Like before,
- There isn't a big difference.

2055
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:47,380
- split them among yourselves.
- Shall we split them?

2056
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,450
Three times five is fifteen.

2057
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:50,180
- Jae Seok.
- Three times five is fifteen.

2058
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:51,820
- Six times three is eighteen.
- Six times three is eighteen.

2059
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,050
- Give them to Min Jong.
- Min Jong.

2060
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:54,390
For goodness' sake.

2061
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:57,290
Shall we put in some Running Balls
or save them?

2062
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:58,960
It's about time we get a big prize.

2063
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,990
- Gold.
- Gold?

2064
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:01,500
- It's too bad.
- Gold.

2065
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,330
We have it pretty good.

2066
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:05,330
Since the two of us
are exempt from the penalty,

2067
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:06,500
- we'll help you guys.
- Yes.

2068
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:07,800
- Yes.
- Please help us.

2069
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,870
We'll help you guys.

2070
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:11,440
- For fun, let's take one.
- Okay.

2071
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,770
- This team has members...
- We're nice, right?

2072
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:14,080
- who are exempt from the penalty.
- We're nice.

2073
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,580
- No way.
- We've always been nice.

2074
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:16,840
- How cool.
- The two of them are cool.

2075
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,910
I'll do that.

2076
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:19,210
- Take 1.
- We'll take 6 each.

2077
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:22,520
I told you
that the lunch menu was...

2078
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,120
- on the line as well.
- Yes.

2079
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:26,890
We'll show you the options
you can choose from.

2080
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:29,490
It's one menu per question.

2081
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:31,490
Thus, you can choose three.

2082
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:32,960
(Team Ha Yoon gets 3 menus
and Team Min Jong gets 2 menus.)

2083
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,130
Jjajangmyeon and jjamppong
come in two bowls.

2084
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:36,200
Two bowls.

2085
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,430
Firstly, we need to eat jjamppong.

2086
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:38,430
- Jjamppong.
- Jjamppong.

2087
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:40,270
Two orders of jjamppong
and one order tangsuyuk.

2088
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:41,800
- How about that?
- I like it.

2089
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,370
- It'll be the best combination.
- Yes, it'll be the best.

2090
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:44,770
Let's order jjamppong.

2091
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:46,910
One order of jjamppong
and tangsuyuk.

2092
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:50,010
Jae Seok, why don't we have
one bowl of jjamppong each?

2093
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,110
If we divide up the food...

2094
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:54,750
One order of jjamppong
contains two bowls.

2095
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:55,980
Then...

2096
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:58,250
We can choose two,

2097
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:59,520
so let's get
four bowls of jjamppong.

2098
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:01,020
Okay. Let's get
four bowls of jjamppong.

2099
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:02,620
We can play rock-paper-scissors
and have one person go hungry.

2100
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:04,590
Jae Seok, would you order
jjajangmyeon?

2101
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,490
Would you order jjajangmyeon?

2102
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,100
Daniel can't mingle with the others.

2103
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,200
- Daniel.
- Hey,

2104
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,270
- you haven't done anything.
- Seriously.

2105
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:12,300
- Exactly.
- Listen to the oldest member.

2106
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,500
- Besides,
- You haven't done anything.

2107
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,000
do you know what he always says
before the game begins?

2108
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,170
"I'm really good at this."

2109
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:17,670
"I used to be a professional."

2110
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:19,010
Seriously.

2111
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,410
- "I used to be a professional."
- Seriously.

2112
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:22,080
- I prefer jjajangmyeon too.
- Right?

2113
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:23,810
- Jae Seok.
- I think...

2114
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:25,250
- he chose jjajangmyeon for me.
- Do you guys like jjajangmyeon?

2115
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,480
What do you like, Min Jong?

2116
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:27,750
- I like jjamppong.
- See?

2117
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:28,980
- Don't lie.
- I really like jjamppong.

2118
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:30,850
Then let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2119
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:32,550
- Let's do that.
- The winner can decide.

2120
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:35,420
Look at that. That's what happens
when a team doesn't have much.

2121
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:36,490
- Ye Eun.
- Let's win.

2122
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:37,590
- Okay.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2123
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:38,930
Jae Seok, I need to win.

2124
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,060
- Hey.
- You need to win.

2125
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,300
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

2126
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,170
(Daniel wins.)

2127
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:47,800
(The faulty man is good
at rock-paper-scissors.)

2128
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,870
(Team Jjamppong loses.)

2129
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:53,440
(Giggling)

2130
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,610
- In that case...
- They began to have teamwork.

2131
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:56,780
They began to have teamwork.

2132
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,250
- They high-fived.
- They get along.

2133
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:00,780
Hey, I don't like you.
I like jjajangmyeon, okay?

2134
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:03,420
Hey, I don't like you.
I like jjajangmyeon, okay?

2135
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,720
(Don't misunderstand.)

2136
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:09,020
I'm not happy because of you.
I'm happy because of jjajangmyeon.

2137
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,190
This is driving me crazy.

2138
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,360
It isn't you.

2139
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:12,860
- So, one order of jjajangmyeon.
- Okay.

2140
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,890
What else should we order?

2141
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,330
- Tangsuyuk.
- Tangsuyuk?

2142
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,400
- Okay. Not bad.
- Not bad.

2143
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:20,300
- Now, let's move to have lunch.
- Okay.

2144
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:21,570
- Okay.
- If there's anyone...

2145
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:24,670
who wants to submit
the Running Balls for a prize...

2146
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:26,140
- Shall we put them in?
- Do it at the place you saw.

2147
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:27,270
- Okay.
- Okay.

2148
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,310
I'll do it for the last one.

2149
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:29,510
- The last one.
- I'll submit a ball...

2150
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:30,610
in case I get lucky.

2151
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,210
Then I'll pour in
the rest of the balls.

2152
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:37,250
There are more balls now.

2153
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,920
(Summer set with a tumbler
and a flamingo tube, 2 people)

2154
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,690
(Luxury body lotion set, 1 person)

2155
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:44,590
There are balls inside, right?

2156
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:47,460
(Summer set, luxury body lotion set,
fruit set)

2157
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,230
I'll go for the body lotion set.

2158
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,800
Okay.

2159
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:53,430
(Luxury body lotion set, 1 person)

2160
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,270
(Jae Seok goes upstairs
after putting in the balls.)

2161
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:01,610
I can eat now, right?

2162
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:03,340
Please wait.

2163
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,450
Why?

2164
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:05,650
Can't I eat now?

2165
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:07,110
People can begin eating
as soon as they arrive.

2166
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,450
(The mischievous man begins eating
before the cameras start running.)

2167
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:09,480
Ye Eun...

2168
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,350
Se Chan, Min Jong, and I
will finish the food.

2169
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,850
(Laughing)

2170
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:13,990
Thank you for the food.

2171
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:16,890
(The noodle-slurping of revenge
to get back at Team Jjajangmyeon)

2172
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:19,290
I'm here.

2173
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:20,330
(Min Jong goes next.)

2174
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:22,630
I want the body lotion set,

2175
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:24,770
but I don't know
who put balls in here.

2176
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,240
I'll put two balls in here.

2177
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,600
Body lotion.

2178
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,910
(Min Jong puts 2 balls and Jong Kook
puts 1 ball for the body lotion.)

2179
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:31,910
I have four balls left.

2180
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:34,510
May I go first?

2181
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:36,110
(The fruit set box
still has 9 balls.)

2182
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:37,510
Hello.

2183
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,050
I'm going to go all in
for the fruit set.

2184
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:42,750
(During the last entry,)

2185
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:44,850
(Haha put in 4 balls
for the fruit set...)

2186
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:47,390
(and promised to put in
10 balls in total.)

2187
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:50,890
(However, 5 Running Balls
from other people went in.)

2188
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:55,830
(He just knows
that the box isn't closed yet.)

2189
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,870
Let's take care
of the penalty first.

2190
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:00,570
- I'll put in six balls.
- Okay.

2191
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:03,240
(Haha puts in a total of 10 balls
as he has planned.)

2192
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,740
I put in a total of ten balls.

2193
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,970
If mine doesn't get picked
even though I added ten balls,

2194
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,480
I'll be ruined.

2195
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,610
(What will be the result
of him going all in?)

2196
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,180
I bet many people went
for the tumbler.

2197
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,450
Since I've submitted balls
for the fruit set, I'll do it again.

2198
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:21,960
- Three?
- All three balls. I'll go all in.

2199
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,190
- I don't want them to go to waste.
- Is that so?

2200
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:27,090
I'll go for a tumbler
and a flamingo tube or fruits.

2201
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:30,130
(Ha Yoon diversifies
her investment again.)

2202
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,570
I'll add one ball each.

2203
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,100
- All right.
- Then I'll save three balls.

2204
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,110
Let's see what happens.
I'm saving two balls.

2205
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:39,910
I'll put in one ball...

2206
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:41,410
for the summer set.

2207
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:47,880
You don't get picked
just because you put in many balls.

2208
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,580
- Shall I diversify my investment?
- That might be better.

2209
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,350
Will it be better to have
a ten percent possibility...

2210
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:53,950
- with each prize?
- Exactly.

2211
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:57,390
(Ye Eun is last.)

2212
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:02,360
I have four balls.
I'll put all of them in one box.

2213
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:06,030
Please help me.
Please help me this once.

2214
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:07,500
(If she puts them in the summer set,
the possibility will be 66 percent.)

2215
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,100
Two people will be picked.

2216
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,740
I'll put all of them in the box
with a better possibility.

2217
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:13,410
I'm sure 1 of these 4 balls
will get picked.

2218
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:14,580
I'll go all in.

2219
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,640
I'm sure 1 of these 4 balls
will get picked.

2220
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,250
I'm going now.

2221
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,850
(Will Ye Eun's decision exempt her
from the penalty?)

2222
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:21,850
I bet we'll see better prizes next.

2223
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:22,980
(The summer set
and the fruit set are closed.)

2224
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,980
No.

2225
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,450
It smells so good.

2226
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,320
It smells like chili japchae.

2227
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,920
I enjoyed the food.

2228
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,060
I'm so full.

2229
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:32,230
It was a good meal.

2230
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:34,430
It was a good meal.

2231
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:38,000
(What happened?)

2232
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:39,230
You know...

2233
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:40,370
Come on.

2234
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:42,040
(Is Ye Eun greeted by empty plates?)

2235
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,070
Come on.

2236
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:45,810
Why did you come so late?

2237
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:47,910
Why did you guys begin eating?

2238
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:49,480
Mister, what are you doing?

2239
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:51,210
Mister, what are you doing?

2240
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,050
- Hurry up and eat.
- What?

2241
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:54,050
It's 1st come, 1st served.

2242
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:55,320
- Is it 1st come, 1st served?
- Yes.

2243
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:57,450
Hurry up and eat
before Ye Eun comes.

2244
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,390
- Hurry over.
- Why did you guys begin eating?

2245
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:04,430
Hurry over.

2246
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:07,590
(The family has a judo athlete
and a food fighter.)

2247
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:08,660
Hurry up and eat.

2248
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:12,100
(Yu Family members
compete fiercely for food.)

2249
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,100
(Glancing over)

2250
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:15,740
(The mischievous members
eat cheerfully.)

2251
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:16,840
It's 1st come, 1st served.

2252
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,540
- Take some tangsuyuk.
- Put the pieces on your plate.

2253
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,840
Put the pieces on your plate.

2254
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:25,350
(Empty the plates
before Food Fighter comes!)

2255
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,950
(Empty)

2256
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:31,250
(The hungry Food Fighter
sees the aftermath.)

2257
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,250
Why did you guys begin eating?

2258
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:35,360
She has said that she's been hungry
for three hours now.

2259
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:37,290
Isn't this situation funny?

2260
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,590
It isn't funny.

2261
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:43,860
It isn't funny
when you play with food.

2262
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,670
(I competed against Team Jjamppong.)

2263
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,640
(I worked so hard for jjajangmyeon.)

2264
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,810
- You like funny situations.
- Seriously.

2265
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,040
Ye Eun, you'll feel somewhat full
if you eat this...

2266
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,050
- with a spoon.
- We left behind some food.

2267
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,180
Ye Eun, look at this.

2268
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,350
- Eat all of it.
- It's really tasty.

2269
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:02,020
- You'll feel somewhat full.
- It's really full.

2270
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:05,220
Ye Eun, I respect people
with a mindset like yours...

2271
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:07,590
in the variety show scene.

2272
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,990
- You know, you're a professional.
- You're a professional.

2273
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:13,090
(Laughing)

2274
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:14,930
- Min Jong.
- Yes?

2275
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:16,860
How dare you laugh?

2276
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:18,270
How dare you laugh?

2277
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,670
You haven't done
anything right, okay?

2278
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:26,010
(They cried and laughed
over jjajangmyeon.)

2279
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:27,170
Min Jong ate with gusto.

2280
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:29,140
It was a nice meal.

2281
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:31,110
If there's some leftover jjamppong,
please give it to Ye Eun.

2282
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:32,410
We don't have much food either.

2283
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:34,820
Ye Eun likes jjajangmyeon.

2284
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:37,680
I said that I liked jjajangmyeon.

2285
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:40,290
(Eating with her face in the bowl)

2286
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:41,860
I wanted to eat jjajangmyeon.

2287
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:43,460
I enjoyed the food.

2288
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:44,560
I'm full.

2289
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,560
Gosh, look at this.

2290
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,160
- What is it?
- There's 1.875g of gold.

2291
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,760
- There's 1.875g of gold.
- No way.

2292
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:52,770
- Jae Seok.
- Let's put our balls here.

2293
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:54,400
See? We should've held on
to our balls.

2294
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,640
- There's Korean beef too.
- There's 1.875g of gold.

2295
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,240
- What?
- For goodness' sake.

2296
01:13:57,570 --> 01:14:00,640
Necessity in daily life.
The battery and washer fluid set.

2297
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,710
Hey, that's nice.

2298
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:04,280
- Also, there is a fruit set.
- Nice.

2299
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:06,080
A tumbler sounds great.

2300
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,480
- What's a flamingo tube?
- Flamingo.

2301
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,680
- Tube.
- Fruits.

2302
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,680
The body lotion set is a must.

2303
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,120
I'll go for the body lotion set.

2304
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,220
The luxury body lotion set.

2305
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:15,460
- What?
- We should've collected the balls.

2306
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,020
- I prefer the Korean beef.
- There's Korean beef too.

2307
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,130
- For goodness' sake.
- There's 1.875g of gold.

2308
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:20,690
There are 1.875g of gold
and Korean beef.

2309
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:21,960
I bet Korean beef is more expensive.

2310
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,430
(Premium prizes appear.)

2311
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,130
I put in the balls
for the tropical fruits.

2312
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:28,300
Hey, 1.875g of gold is incredible.

2313
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,970
- I want 1.875g of gold.
- I put the balls in there...

2314
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:32,070
- despite not liking fruits.
- I should've waited.

2315
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,540
I have balls.

2316
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:35,780
I have ammunition.

2317
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:36,910
I want 1.875g of gold.

2318
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:38,380
What if I get rid of those balls?

2319
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:42,750
Earlier, the fruit set
didn't get ten balls.

2320
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:44,350
- Since it got over ten balls,
- Is the box full?

2321
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,950
- the entry is closed.
- Good.

2322
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,420
The entry is closed
for the summer set as well.

2323
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,860
We'll have a draw
for these 2 prizes 1st.

2324
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:53,430
- Good.
- Those who win a prize...

2325
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:55,230
- will be exempt from the penalty.
- Exactly.

2326
01:14:55,230 --> 01:14:56,300
That's incredible.

2327
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,530
Let's have a draw for one person...

2328
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:00,230
- who will win the fruit set.
- Se Chan.

2329
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:01,400
I put in one ball each.

2330
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,400
Only one person will be picked.

2331
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,240
Those who put in the balls
for the fruit set are...

2332
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,540
Haha,

2333
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:07,740
Ji Hyo, Ha Yoon,

2334
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:09,510
- Daniel, Seok Jin,
- Many people applied.

2335
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:10,810
- and Se Chan.
- There are a lot.

2336
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,080
- Many people entered.
- Why did so many people enter?

2337
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,880
- Why did so many people enter?
- Many people entered.

2338
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,080
How many balls did you put in?

2339
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,380
I put in five balls.

2340
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,380
- Five?
- How about you?

2341
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,420
- Yes.
- I put in two balls.

2342
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:19,550
I put in ten balls.

2343
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:20,620
- What?
- Really?

2344
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:21,690
I put in ten balls.

2345
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:23,020
- Really?
- Yes.

2346
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:24,190
- Ten?
- Ten.

2347
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:25,530
- No way.
- Don't lie.

2348
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:26,590
I swear I did it.

2349
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:30,830
(10 out of 23 balls came from Haha.)

2350
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,630
I put in one ball.

2351
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,370
- Please let it be me.
- I also put in one ball.

2352
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,770
Only one person will win the prize.

2353
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:38,640
- One.
- I'll pick the ball.

2354
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,040
- Please mix the balls.
- Please.

2355
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,310
- Please.
- Please let me be the one winner.

2356
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:42,510
- Mix the balls more.
- Please.

2357
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,480
- I put in ten balls.
- I put in all the balls.

2358
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,750
- I went all in.
- It'll be insane if I get picked.

2359
01:15:45,810 --> 01:15:46,850
I can do it.

2360
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:48,820
- Adding ten balls won't help.
- I grabbed a ball.

2361
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:51,320
(Will it be Haha
who put in 10 balls?)

2362
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,020
- What if it's me or Seok Jin?
- Please.

2363
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,020
Please.

2364
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:56,390
- Adding many balls won't help.
- One.

2365
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:58,060
- That's right.
- Please.

2366
01:15:58,090 --> 01:15:59,130
Seok Jin.

2367
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:01,360
(Fruit set: Haha: 10, Daniel: 5,
Ha Yoon: 4, Ji Hyo: 2,)

2368
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,700
(Seok Jin: 1, Se Chan: 1)

2369
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,870
All right. It's Daniel.

2370
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:06,930
(Daniel: 5)

2371
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:08,240
It's Daniel.

2372
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,400
(Daniel gets picked.)

2373
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,640
Haha is ruined.

2374
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:12,770
It's Daniel.

2375
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,310
(Haha's strategy of going all in
fails spectacularly.)

2376
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:15,340
- He lost ten balls.
- Ten balls.

2377
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:16,440
Why did you put in ten balls?

2378
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,210
- Daniel said that he put in many.
- Is he stupid?

2379
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:19,610
- He put in five balls.
- Daniel,

2380
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:21,880
- take the fruit set.
- I'm jealous.

2381
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:23,150
Haha is ruined.

2382
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:25,220
(Daniel acquires the fruit set
and gets exempt from the penalty!)

2383
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,520
- Gosh.
- He put balls in there.

2384
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,190
- Green grapes.
- Gosh.

2385
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,730
Thus, the ten balls Haha put in...

2386
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:33,260
- will disappear.
- Okay.

2387
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:35,730
- Okay.
- Oh, no.

2388
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:37,060
It feels nice.

2389
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:38,370
We gave you so many balls.

2390
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:39,900
- How could you waste them?
- Seriously.

2391
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,600
- This time, we'll have...
- It depends on luck.

2392
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,900
- a draw for the summer set.
- The summer set.

2393
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,510
Those who entered the draw
for the summer set are...

2394
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:47,770
Ye Eun, Ha Yoon,

2395
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,680
Seok Jin, Se Chan,

2396
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,350
- and Ji Hyo.
- I have a chance.

2397
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:53,280
- The summer set...
- I should've picked that one.

2398
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:55,080
- consists of a flamingo tube...
- I should've divided up the balls.

2399
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,820
- and a tumbler.
- That's nice.

2400
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,020
Hey, that's nice.

2401
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,350
- That's a nice prize.
- Two people will be picked.

2402
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:01,890
- Two people.
- Se Chan.

2403
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:03,490
- Please.
- I want the tumbler.

2404
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:04,560
(Two people will be saved.)

2405
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:05,590
- Just this once.
- Drumroll.

2406
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:07,860
(The draw begins.)

2407
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:08,860
- Just this once.
- Drumroll.

2408
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,200
- Please. I put in one ball.
- Please.

2409
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:13,230
Who will get picked?

2410
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:14,900
I grabbed one ball.

2411
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:16,740
- Seok Jin.
- Ye Eun.

2412
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,410
- Please.
- Ye Eun.

2413
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:21,110
- Yang.
- Show us the first syllable.

2414
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:22,610
- Ji Hyo.
- Ye Eun.

2415
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:24,440
It's Ha Yoon.

2416
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,480
(Ha Yoon: 3)

2417
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:28,620
(Ha Yoon gets picked.)

2418
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:30,720
- No way.
- Ha Yoon.

2419
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,890
- All right.
- Ha Yoon.

2420
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:33,820
- All right.
- Ha Yoon, how many did you put in?

2421
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,160
- Three.
- That's incredible.

2422
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,890
- I put in four balls.
- One more person.

2423
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:38,490
One last person.

2424
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:40,360
- Don't let it be Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun.

2425
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,830
- Ye Eun.
- Let it be Ha Yoon.

2426
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:42,960
- All right.
- Not Ye Eun, but Seok Jin.

2427
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,330
- Ye Eun.
- I grabbed a ball.

2428
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:46,130
- She grabbed a ball.
- I grabbed a ball.

2429
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:47,300
Yang.

2430
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,500
(Ye Eun: 4. Ha Yoon: 2, Seok Jin: 1,
Se Chan: 1, Ji Hyo: 1)

2431
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,900
Tell me if it starts with J.

2432
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,040
- Who could it be?
- Tell me if it starts with J.

2433
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,670
It starts with J.

2434
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:53,910
(The name starts with J.)

2435
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,040
(It's either Jee Seok Jin
or Ji Ye Eun!)

2436
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,280
I put in one ball.
How many balls did you put in?

2437
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,280
- It must be Ye Eun.
- Four.

2438
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,450
- Four. Jee Seok Jin.
- It must be Ye Eun.

2439
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:01,580
- It must be Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun has good energy today.

2440
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:02,820
It's Ji Ye Eun.

2441
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,190
(Ji Ye Eun)

2442
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:06,620
Ye Eun.

2443
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,360
(My goodness!)

2444
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,590
- Thank you.
- This is a rare occasion for her.

2445
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:11,860
This is a rare occasion for me.

2446
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:13,260
- Thank you.
- You got lucky.

2447
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,330
- This time...
- This is a rare occasion for her.

2448
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:17,060
I shouldn't have put the eggs
in multiple baskets.

2449
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,500
I should've put them in one basket.

2450
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,530
- All right.
- Gosh, this is...

2451
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:21,030
- It's a Stanley tumbler.
- Is it a flamingo?

2452
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,470
It's a flamingo.
I'll keep it for real.

2453
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:23,700
Is it a fake Stanley tumbler?

2454
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,610
- Is it fake?
- It's authentic.

2455
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:26,810
(It's authentic!)

2456
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:28,040
- "Is it fake?"
- "Is it fake?"

2457
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,510
Why would SBS give a fake prize?

2458
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:31,310
- For goodness' sake. Ye Eun.
- That'll be funny.

2459
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:32,480
Don't say such a thing.

2460
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,550
- I'm sorry.
- Seriously.

2461
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:35,250
- The tone is pretty, right?
- Yes.

2462
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,550
- I like the tone.
- It suits the vibe in your house.

2463
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:40,250
- Gosh, this is awesome.
- You can bid for the last two...

2464
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:43,220
The body lotion set isn't full yet,

2465
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,360
- so you can put in extra bids.
- Okay!

2466
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,230
But the last one is gold.

2467
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:50,430
- Many of you don't have balls now.
- This is driving me crazy.

2468
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:51,570
- Yes.
- So, the last chance to win...

2469
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:52,700
running balls is called...

2470
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,630
Escape the Heat Fashion Show.

2471
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:55,640
What is that?

2472
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,340
The team to unwrap and wear
more layers of T-shirts,

2473
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:01,210
- which are frozen solid, will win.
- Take it slowly.

2474
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:03,310
- You have to smash it.
- Gosh, Min Jong.

2475
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:05,980
- Nice.
- Gosh, Min Jong is no joke.

2476
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,210
(Cold weather training
in the middle of summer)

2477
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:08,420
Nice.

2478
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:10,550
- Good.
- That looks hard.

2479
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:12,190
- It looks so tough.
- It's not cold.

2480
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:13,620
- Gosh, that's cold. Hang on.
- What is that?

2481
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,190
- Next one. Put more on.
- Gosh, it's cold.

2482
01:19:17,290 --> 01:19:18,360
Gosh, this is no joke.

2483
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,990
- It's cold.
- Switch players now.

2484
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:22,100
- Okay. Hey, how did you do this?
- All right.

2485
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,130
- My arms are freezing.
- Hey, how did they do this?

2486
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:25,800
- It's okay.
- You have to rub it.

2487
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,000
(It looked easy when Min Jong
and Ha Yoon did it.)

2488
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:29,240
Do a better job.

2489
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:30,270
Gosh, hurry.

2490
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,140
- Just get the neck open.
- Give it to you without opening it?

2491
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:34,310
- How did you do this?
- All right.

2492
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:37,440
- Nice, Min Jong!
- Gosh, Min Jong.

2493
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,780
- Hey, you're the Hulk!
- Let's go!

2494
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:41,520
(The Hulks of Jincheon
rip the T-shirts apart.)

2495
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,320
- Nice, Ha Yoon.
- Good.

2496
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,820
- My head.
- Go.

2497
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,090
Get your head in. Okay.

2498
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:47,820
- Nice. Keep going.
- You're doing well.

2499
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:49,160
(With the two heroes putting on
a T-shirt dismantling show)

2500
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,890
- Rip it off.
- When did they do that?

2501
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,630
- There you go. Last!
- Let's take them off one at a time.

2502
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:55,930
Min Jong's team won.

2503
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:57,430
(Team Min Jong's victory)

2504
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:59,930
- One more!
- There's one more.

2505
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:01,700
(The winner and loser were decided
by a single T-shirt.)

2506
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:04,370
- To the team that won the mission,
- Min Jong, that was awesome.

2507
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:05,440
- you will get...
- You did well too, Ji Hyo.

2508
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,740
- thirty running balls.
- Thirty!

2509
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:09,080
- How many?
- Gosh, we get 30?

2510
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,510
- Hey, then 6 times 5 is 30.
- My gosh!

2511
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:12,680
- It's okay. We did well.
- But we all have some.

2512
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:15,180
- Good job.
- The losing team will get 20.

2513
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,720
- You can divide them up.
- Didn't most of us...

2514
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,050
- get exemptions?
- Yes, we did.

2515
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:20,290
- You guys did. Can you help us out?
- The three of us.

2516
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:21,820
- Yes.
- We'll help you out.

2517
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:23,090
- Are the three of you exempt?
- Yes.

2518
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,560
- It's just you and me.
- Shall we take two each?

2519
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,790
- Two each?
- Yes, two each.

2520
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:27,790
Let's just do this once.

2521
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:29,830
Then, those of you who want to bid,

2522
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:31,260
you can each go
and choose where to bid.

2523
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,000
- I want to go last.
- When you come back,

2524
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,470
- we'll draw the final names.
- Okay.

2525
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:35,470
I'll go first.

2526
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:37,100
- Half and half is the way to go.
- But this is...

2527
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,370
- Half and half.
- In a way,

2528
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:39,770
- Bidding half and half...
- this is...

2529
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:42,810
Those of you who are already exempt
from the penalty are laid back.

2530
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:44,310
- They are.
- Yes.

2531
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:46,910
- Will you avoid the penalty, or...
- This is...

2532
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:47,950
Also, as you saw with Haha earlier,

2533
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:49,550
bidding ten times
doesn't do any good.

2534
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:52,920
- Right.
- I thought I'd be exempt for sure.

2535
01:20:53,690 --> 01:20:55,460
I'll go with
the luxury body lotion set.

2536
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:57,560
I'll put 2 in the gold
and 4 in the beef.

2537
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,530
I'll divide up my investment.

2538
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:01,130
I'll just do this.

2539
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:02,700
(Most divide their investments
between the beef and golden key.)

2540
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,600
Or...

2541
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:06,700
if you want to be exempt
from the penalty...

2542
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,240
There are three boxes there, right?

2543
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,170
- Yes, three.
- Right? The two expensive prizes...

2544
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:11,910
and the box that didn't have
ten balls in it.

2545
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:13,810
- You're right.
- If you go all-in on body lotion,

2546
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:15,410
you could win.

2547
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:17,610
- But with so many balls now...
- You never know, though.

2548
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:19,280
- With so many balls...
- It might work if you go all-in.

2549
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,350
You'll increase your odds,
but it won't be 100 percent.

2550
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:23,520
- I know it's not 100 percent.
- Wait, will you go all-in?

2551
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,880
Who doesn't know
it's not 100 percent?

2552
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,090
- Do you think I'm a fool?
- Well, I'm saying...

2553
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:27,550
Who doesn't know
it's not 100 percent?

2554
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:29,160
- Do you think I'm a fool?
- Well, I'm saying...

2555
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,290
(A childish argument breaks out.)

2556
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:33,190
I know it might not work too,
but I'm saying the odds are better.

2557
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:35,300
I was talking to myself.
Why are you suddenly talking to me?

2558
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:37,530
I was talking to myself too.
Why are you telling me off?

2559
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:39,630
(The jokester keeps provoking
his older friend.)

2560
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,500
- But I was talking to myself.
- I'm talking to Ji Hyo.

2561
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:45,210
- Ji Ho?
- Ji Hyo, you punk!

2562
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:46,540
(Shouting in the end
out of built-up frustration)

2563
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:48,240
Why are you getting so angry,
Seok Jin?

2564
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,210
- Gosh, why are you getting angry?
- He lost the argument.

2565
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,010
You lose if you get angry.
You lost, Seok Jin.

2566
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,910
- Why are you getting angry?
- Are your ears just for decoration?

2567
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:56,220
- Why are you getting angry?
- Don't be angry, Seok Jin.

2568
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:57,780
I wasn't angry.
I was just talking loudly.

2569
01:21:57,820 --> 01:21:59,650
Let's just avoid the penalty,
Se Chan.

2570
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:01,190
Just get an exemption.

2571
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:03,460
(His name must be chosen from
one of these three to be exempt.)

2572
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,990
This won't work
if it's all over in one try.

2573
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:09,630
I have 1 in here, so 2 more make 3.

2574
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:12,670
Then, 1, 2, and 3 in here.

2575
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:16,200
Even for stocks,
they say not to put...

2576
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,570
all your eggs in one basket.

2577
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:18,910
I'll divide up my investment.

2578
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:20,840
(Se Chan divides up his investment again,
hoping to win at least one.)

2579
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:23,810
Please, Se Chan! Just one!
Let's just avoid the penalty.

2580
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:25,210
I divided up my investment.

2581
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:27,380
- Shall I go?
- I didn't put them all in one box.

2582
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:28,980
Seok Jin, you know how stocks work,
right?

2583
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:30,080
- Don't put them all in one basket.
- Yes.

2584
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,120
Eggs... They say this in stocks.

2585
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,920
Don't put all your eggs
in one basket.

2586
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,260
What's your rate of return?

2587
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:38,990
It's a mess.

2588
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:41,230
- He's definitely at a minus.
- What's your rate of return?

2589
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:43,830
- One in the luxury body lotion.
- His chart is never red.

2590
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,230
I'm sure many people put their balls
in the 1.875g of gold.

2591
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:48,900
I have a total of ten balls.

2592
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:53,110
Going all-in on one
does increase your chances, but...

2593
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:54,140
(Seok Sam needs an exemption
more urgently.)

2594
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,710
The same for everything.
Whatever, let's just get 1 out of 3.

2595
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:59,380
If you go all-in... Look at Haha.

2596
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:03,220
Two here.
I have exactly four in each one.

2597
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,550
That's what I'll do.

2598
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:06,920
I should divide them into two.

2599
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,690
I have some in here, so that one.
I'll put two in here for now.

2600
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:12,430
(Bidding evenly)

2601
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:13,430
Okay.

2602
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:15,460
All right. Done!

2603
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:17,630
I'm the last one, right?

2604
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:21,270
Gosh, should I go all-in or not?
My goodness.

2605
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:23,070
(Hasn't been chosen yet,
has 7 running balls)

2606
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:28,780
(Haha went all-in on the fruit box
just to avoid the penalty before,)

2607
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:34,710
(but he lost everything.)

2608
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,320
Gosh, please.

2609
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,190
(What strategy
will he use this time?)

2610
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:47,030
(The openings for these boxes
are sunken.)

2611
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:51,130
These look more sunken,
but not this one.

2612
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:55,070
Then,
it doesn't matter how many you have.

2613
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,200
Seven.

2614
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:58,510
I didn't win even with ten balls.

2615
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:00,410
Should I put one in here,
just in case?

2616
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,150
(He puts 1 bid in the gold box
as he wishes for good luck.)

2617
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,210
(Trying to look cool)

2618
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:11,550
- I'm sure there will be.
- Nice. That was cool.

2619
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:13,690
- Did you look cool?
- Yes, I was.

2620
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:14,820
- What did you do?
- Okay.

2621
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:17,120
I was so determined!

2622
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,430
(Massaging her ping pong ball cheeks
out of nowhere)

2623
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:21,290
Oh, dear.

2624
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:23,630
- That was funny.
- The dumpling girl.

2625
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:24,730
(Ddochi and Short Kid
are good friends.)

2626
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,370
- The bidding is now finished.
- Yes.

2627
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:30,300
- For the body lotion set,
- Yes?

2628
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:33,470
- Jae Seok has five balls.
- You put a lot in there.

2629
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:34,910
- That's a lot.
- Jong Kook, Seok Jin,

2630
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:36,410
and Se Chan each have three.

2631
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,680
- Okay.
- And Min Jong has four.

2632
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:40,880
- The odds aren't too bad.
- Then, Ji Hyo has two,

2633
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,450
- and Ha Yoon has one.
- Okay.

2634
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:45,290
- Let's go.
- Also, Haha has six.

2635
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:46,290
You went all-in.

2636
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:48,150
- Haha went all-in again.
- I hope Haha doesn't win.

2637
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:51,090
Please start with the body lotion
so he'll have no fun until the end.

2638
01:24:52,730 --> 01:24:56,030
If he doesn't win,
he'll be so annoyed until the end.

2639
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:57,830
- With no hope?
- Right, no hope.

2640
01:24:57,830 --> 01:25:00,170
- The ending with no hope.
- Having no hope is so sad.

2641
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:02,100
- That's the most annoying thing.
- People live based on hope.

2642
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,310
- Of course.
- But I did put one in the gold box.

2643
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:08,140
Then, those who bid for the gold.

2644
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:10,340
Daniel, Se Chan,

2645
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:11,810
- I put mine in every box.
- Seok Jin,

2646
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:13,980
- Jae Seok, Ji Hyo,
- Gosh, so many people.

2647
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,420
- Min Jong,
- That's everyone.

2648
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:17,150
Ha Yoon, and Haha.

2649
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:18,150
- Everyone bid for that one.
- We all did.

2650
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:19,720
- Everyone bid at least once.
- Didn't Jong Kook bid for this?

2651
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,820
I didn't bid for the gold.

2652
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:23,190
Then, for the Korean beef, Daniel,

2653
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:24,520
- Ye Eun,
- It was almost everyone.

2654
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:27,430
Se Chan, Seok Jin, Ji Hyo,

2655
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:29,730
- and Min Jong.
- It's almost everyone.

2656
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:31,000
- Hey, Min Jong.
- Hey, but your family...

2657
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,700
- Doesn't your family sell meat?
- Aren't your family butchers?

2658
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:34,000
We sell pork, so Korean beef is...

2659
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,200
Oh, is that right?

2660
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,170
- I like Korean beef more.
- Since your family sells pork.

2661
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:39,470
- So certain.
- First, we'll draw the winner...

2662
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:40,970
- for the luxury...
- Let's go!

2663
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:42,140
- body lotion set.
- Please just let me win once.

2664
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:43,780
- If Haha doesn't win this,
- Hey.

2665
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:44,880
- it'll be no fun for him later.
- Let's go!

2666
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,280
- Please, let me win just once.
- It'll be absolutely no fun.

2667
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,880
Can you stir it up once?

2668
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:49,020
Just once.

2669
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:50,220
All right. Let's go for it.

2670
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:51,650
Grab that one.

2671
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,290
- Let's go!
- I've picked one.

2672
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:54,320
Okay, let's go!

2673
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:57,520
- Let's go. Avoiding the penalty...
- I think it'll be me.

2674
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,960
- If it's not Haha this time,
- My feeling is...

2675
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:00,290
- I think it'll be you.
- Please.

2676
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:01,460
- Yang.
- Please.

2677
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:02,460
- Hey, it says Kook.
- Jee Seok Jin.

2678
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:03,730
- Yu!
- Jee!

2679
01:26:03,730 --> 01:26:04,900
- It's Kook.
- Yu!

2680
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:06,270
- Jee!
- There are two possibilities.

2681
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:07,800
All right.

2682
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,840
(Body lotion)

2683
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:10,840
- It's Kook.
- Jee.

2684
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,170
(Jong Kook: 3)

2685
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,540
- It's Kook.
- Jee.

2686
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:14,540
(Once again, it's Kim Jong Kook.)

2687
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:17,140
- Gosh, Jong Kook!
- I told you it was Kook!

2688
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:20,680
You little punk! Body lotion!

2689
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:24,720
(Haha fails again.)

2690
01:26:25,690 --> 01:26:27,550
(He put 6 out of 7 in,
which was all he had.)

2691
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:29,160
- Hey, how many did you put in?
- What?

2692
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:30,990
- Three.
- You only had three.

2693
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:32,890
Only three?

2694
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:34,930
- Hey, why is Jong Kook's...
- Three.

2695
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:36,900
(Humming in delight)

2696
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:37,900
Haha.

2697
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,200
(Whatever anyone says,
Kook is happy.)

2698
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,340
I mean, you picked
Kim Jong Kook three times.

2699
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:46,370
(Earlier, when they chose the winner
of the Yang Se Chan set on the bus)

2700
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:49,610
- See? I told you it was me!
- You're so lucky!

2701
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:54,010
(Kook's name was chosen
twice in a row.)

2702
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:55,480
His name was drawn...

2703
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:56,780
- three times today.
- Body lotion.

2704
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,120
(His name was chosen 3 times total,
including this time.)

2705
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:02,090
- My goodness.
- Gosh, Jong Kook. You're so lucky.

2706
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:04,360
- Gosh, how many did Jong Kook...
- Body wash.

2707
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,330
- Some guys have all the luck.
- Seriously, that's true.

2708
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,200
This time, we'll choose the winner
for the Korean beef set.

2709
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,700
- I didn't bid for the Korean beef.
- The Korean beef.

2710
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:12,370
- I put four in.
- I bid for Korean beef.

2711
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:14,800
I didn't apply for
Korean Beef University this time.

2712
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,070
- Let's draw from Korean beef.
- Four.

2713
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:19,110
Se Chan.

2714
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,370
- Yang!
- Seok Jin.

2715
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,040
Seok Jin, you should eat some meat.

2716
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,340
Okay, I have it in my hand.

2717
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:25,880
Seok Jin, you should eat some meat.

2718
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:27,410
(Or will it be
another lucky person?)

2719
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:28,650
I'm definitely getting the penalty.

2720
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:30,680
(Korean beef)

2721
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:31,880
Are you sure that's the one?

2722
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,720
(Korean beef)

2723
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,220
Jee Seok Jin. It's me.

2724
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,160
(Seok Jin, 4)

2725
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,990
- It's Jee Seok Jin.
- Yes!

2726
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:40,990
(The honor of Korean beef
goes to Seok Sam!)

2727
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:43,130
- Really?
- Yes!

2728
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:44,130
(Seok Sam is exempted
from the penalty.)

2729
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:45,970
No way!

2730
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:47,300
Gosh, seriously?

2731
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,330
- I was exempted from the penalty.
- That's amazing.

2732
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:49,940
- How many did you put in?
- Three.

2733
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:51,470
- Four.
- Oh, four?

2734
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:52,910
- My gosh.
- He put four balls in.

2735
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:54,610
- Gosh, Korean beef.
- I put four in as well.

2736
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:56,140
Okay, then. The last one.

2737
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:58,980
(Drawing the last winner
for the gold)

2738
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:01,010
- The winner of the gold.
- Please!

2739
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:03,220
- The last one.
- Who hasn't won anything yet?

2740
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,780
- Please raise your hands.
- I haven't won yet.

2741
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,490
- Haha, did you bid for the gold?
- It has to be me now.

2742
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:07,990
- How many?
- I put one in.

2743
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:10,460
It has to be 1 of these 4...

2744
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:12,630
- for another penalty exemption.
- It could be me again.

2745
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:13,990
- Please, I'm begging you.
- It could be me again.

2746
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:16,300
- Please, just once.
- I have four in here too.

2747
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:17,400
Gosh, who will get the penalty?

2748
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,030
- Please, just once.
- It would be amazing if it's Haha.

2749
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:20,300
- I want to win the gold too.
- Please.

2750
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,300
- He didn't win with ten,
- Gold!

2751
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,940
- and he failed again with six.
- Please pick me.

2752
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:25,540
Just a little bit of luck!

2753
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:27,010
But why are you so expectant
with only one?

2754
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,910
- Haha, you won't win.
- Didn't you only bid once?

2755
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:29,910
I did.

2756
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:31,210
Haha, step aside.

2757
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:33,450
- Did you not win anything yet?
- I didn't.

2758
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:35,280
- Hey, you're so shameless.
- Stop!

2759
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,180
- I got it.
- You're being shameless.

2760
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:38,620
- Don't expect anything.
- Please.

2761
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:39,690
- I can get it.
- Please...

2762
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:41,420
- If you get it, it's a miracle.
- Please get me one this time.

2763
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:42,690
- It's possible.
- We have four each.

2764
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:43,720
- Penalty.
- I have a chance.

2765
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:44,720
(Gold: Jae Seok: 4, Min Jong: 4,
Ha Yoon: 4, Seok Jin: 4)

2766
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:45,730
(Se Chan: 3, Ji Hyo: 3,
Daniel: 2, Haha: 1)

2767
01:28:45,730 --> 01:28:46,760
Please.

2768
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:49,160
- Please.
- Her face changed.

2769
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,330
It's Jee Seok Jin.

2770
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:51,360
It's me.

2771
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,870
(Who's the winner
of today's final scholarship?)

2772
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:54,100
(Will it be Haha, Min Jong,
Se Chan, or Jae Seok?)

2773
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:56,400
Congratulations. The gold goes to...

2774
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,600
(Will it be Haha, Min Jong,
Se Chan, or Jae Seok?)

2775
01:28:57,870 --> 01:29:00,240
Congratulations. The gold goes to...

2776
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:01,940
Ha Yoon.

2777
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:02,940
Me?

2778
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:04,310
(Ha Yoon)

2779
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:05,550
Ha Yoon.

2780
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:06,650
- Me?
- My gosh.

2781
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:07,980
(Clapping like a seal)

2782
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:11,750
- Congratulations.
- My goodness.

2783
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:13,690
Ha Yoon.

2784
01:29:13,690 --> 01:29:16,390
(Those who will get the penalty
are Jae Seok,)

2785
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:18,760
(Se Chan,)

2786
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:20,160
(and Min Jong.)

2787
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,290
- Ha Yoon, how many did you have?
- One?

2788
01:29:21,290 --> 01:29:22,660
- I had 4.
- You had 4?

2789
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:23,860
(Those who will get the penalty are
Jae Seok, Se Chan, and Min Jong.)

2790
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:25,630
- Oh, dear.
- I had no expectation.

2791
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:27,000
This isn't yours. Take this.

2792
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,700
- Ha Yoon.
- Ha Yoon.

2793
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:30,340
You're really...

2794
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,000
- Ha Yoon, you got it.
- You're so lucky.

2795
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:34,110
Ha Yoon got a lot of things today.

2796
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:35,270
- You won a lot of prizes.
- Thank you.

2797
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:36,640
Okay.

2798
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:37,680
- She got a lot today.
- All right.

2799
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,910
It's all right.

2800
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:41,250
We have the winner
of the last prize now.

2801
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,850
This is the end...

2802
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:44,650
of the Running Sports
University Prize Battle.

2803
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,550
The four members who failed...

2804
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:47,820
- to win the prize until the end...
- We should pick one person.

2805
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:49,960
- will get the penalty.
- Let's pick one person.

2806
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,090
- Okay.
- Among these four,

2807
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:52,690
can we pick one person to survive?

2808
01:29:52,690 --> 01:29:54,390
- To see who's the unluckiest.
- Just one person.

2809
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:55,630
- From which one?
- With just one ball each.

2810
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:57,500
- The Korean beef. No, the gold.
- The Korean beef?

2811
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,500
- Gold.
- Gold.

2812
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,870
- Did you put it in the gold?
- Yes.

2813
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:01,070
- We did too.
- We put it in the box for gold.

2814
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:02,600
I have only one ball in the box.

2815
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:03,800
- Or...
- Then you'll get the penalty.

2816
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,110
- You will get the penalty.
- You should.

2817
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:07,770
- I really want to be picked.
- If one of you is picked,

2818
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:09,440
- the person will be exempted.
- Please.

2819
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,710
- Okay. Let's do that.
- I don't think it will be you.

2820
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:11,880
- If you are picked.
- Why are you doing this?

2821
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:13,210
Is it done?

2822
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:15,950
- I don't think you'll be picked.
- Can I say stop?

2823
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:17,580
- This is the best luck.
- Say stop.

2824
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:19,190
- Okay. I will.
- The one to be exempted.

2825
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:20,450
It was Haha just now, right?

2826
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,090
It was Haha just now, right?

2827
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,560
(Nodding her head)

2828
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:25,060
Darn it!

2829
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:27,660
Why... Why are you doing this?

2830
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:29,530
Hey, you were just picked.

2831
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:31,130
(Among the 24 balls,
Haha's was actually picked.)

2832
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:33,170
You had only one,
and your ball was really picked.

2833
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:36,040
(He asked the writer
to let him say stop and got fooled.)

2834
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,070
He had one, but he got picked.

2835
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:38,100
- All right.
- Say stop.

2836
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,370
- Stop.
- The person to be exempted?

2837
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:40,910
One person to be exempted.

2838
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:42,010
(If Min Jong, Jae Seok, Se Chan,
or Haha is picked, he'll be exempted.)

2839
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:43,310
It won't be you.

2840
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:44,380
But they just picked my name.

2841
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:46,180
Then why did you
ask them to pick again?

2842
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:48,210
- I know.
- The member to be exempted.

2843
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:49,280
Seok Jin.

2844
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:50,880
Okay.

2845
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,220
It's not working. Let's stop here.

2846
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:53,620
- Yes. Just get the penalty.
- Let's do it one more time.

2847
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,190
- That's enough.
- We should stop.

2848
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:57,260
- Enough.
- So, these four members...

2849
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:58,660
will get the penalty today.

2850
01:30:58,660 --> 01:30:59,930
I was picked.

2851
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:01,490
(He's about to cry.)

2852
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:02,560
But you...

2853
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,130
- You stopped it.
- For the penalty,

2854
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:07,600
you will choose one person
between Min Jong and Ha Yoon...

2855
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,770
and let them try
a shoulder throw on you.

2856
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:10,900
That sounds good.

2857
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:12,540
That's simple. It will be quick.

2858
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:14,570
I did something like this
on a TV show before.

2859
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:15,640
- You did?
- Yes.

2860
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:16,740
You'll be fine then.

2861
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,180
Where should the microphone be?

2862
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:21,110
- It shouldn't touch the ground.
- I'll do that.

2863
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:23,180
- It should be on your stomach.
- On your stomach.

2864
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,420
- How hard will it be?
- He's such a coward.

2865
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:26,620
Gosh, he's really...

2866
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:28,120
- Don't be like that.
- You can choose a technique.

2867
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:29,520
- You can go all the way up here.
- No.

2868
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,090
- Why would I want that?
- Or I can do it lightly.

2869
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:32,390
- Do it lightly.
- Lightly.

2870
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:34,030
- Do it properly.
- Make it hard.

2871
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:35,360
Shoulder throw.

2872
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,830
- Shoulder throw.
- Try a shoulder throw.

2873
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:38,260
- Will it be quick?
- Here I go.

2874
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,270
(He's thrown down.)

2875
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,370
(Kissing the mat)

2876
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:48,410
My gosh. He fell face down.

2877
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:50,140
- Nice.
- That coward.

2878
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,410
- He's such a coward.
- It's so funny.

2879
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:58,020
You should've tried a forward roll.

2880
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,290
I should've done that.

2881
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:01,350
I bet she will be more gentle.

2882
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:02,690
Because the height is lower.

2883
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:03,860
What do I do?

2884
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:05,160
Give me your arm,
and I'll throw you down.

2885
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,260
- Just your arm.
- Just give her your arm.

2886
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:07,590
They are so weak.

2887
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:09,330
Wait. I might hurt my elbow.

2888
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,270
- Now, you're doing...
- Hey. What are you doing?

2889
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:13,530
- I just...
- What if my arm gets twisted?

2890
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:15,100
- No. It will be fine.
- Seriously...

2891
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,740
- She knows what she's doing.
- I'll go like this.

2892
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:18,040
- What do I do?
- Try a forward roll.

2893
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,070
- Just stay still.
- Stay still?

2894
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:20,070
(Just stay still.)

2895
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:21,470
(He's been asking questions
for 2 minutes.)

2896
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:23,210
- Se Chan, you need to jump.
- You said you learned this.

2897
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:24,680
- You learned judo.
- You shouldn't hold out.

2898
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:25,850
- Did you learn?
- I did.

2899
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:27,480
- You learned it, right?
- I shouldn't hold out?

2900
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:28,980
- Try a forward roll.
- Don't hold out.

2901
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:30,380
- Forward roll.
- Jump as she throws you down.

2902
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:31,820
(Groaning)

2903
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,850
This is no joke.

2904
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:36,260
Did you just laugh?

2905
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:37,660
Those who laughed should try this.

2906
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:38,860
I'm serious.

2907
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:40,760
This is different.

2908
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,930
- You have good blood circulation.
- Who do you want?

2909
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:43,060
You have done this a lot.

2910
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:44,100
I...

2911
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,670
- In the past...
- Are you an expert?

2912
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:47,200
I did a show called
"The World's Best Outsider Baseball Team."

2913
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:50,040
I did stuff like this
with the best athletes every week.

2914
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,040
- So, you're experienced.
- I have experience.

2915
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,310
- We are the experienced ones.
- Then,

2916
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:54,770
you should do it two times in a row.

2917
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:55,980
I'll just give it a try first.

2918
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:57,510
- You're used to this.
- The right side? Which way?

2919
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:59,010
- Which one works better for you?
- I'm fine with everything.

2920
01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:00,250
You are? I'm fine too.

2921
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:03,880
He's terrified.

2922
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:05,920
(He's so terrified
that he looks pitiful.)

2923
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,350
- I'm fine with everything.
- You are?

2924
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:09,160
- You look relaxed.
- It's okay. It will be quick.

2925
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:10,660
- Take it easy.
- Just be comfortable.

2926
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:11,860
Just like how I do it in a match?

2927
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:13,130
- Gosh, no.
- Not that hard?

2928
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,560
This isn't a real match.

2929
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:15,800
- This isn't a match.
- Okay.

2930
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,330
- Make it look interesting.
- Okay.

2931
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:18,400
- Make it delicious.
- With a thud.

2932
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,730
(Exclaiming)

2933
01:33:23,170 --> 01:33:24,240
One more time.

2934
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,540
- You bump your knee.
- I know.

2935
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,010
You bump your knee
when he does that.

2936
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:28,040
Right. I knocked my knees.

2937
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:29,910
It hurts.

2938
01:33:29,910 --> 01:33:31,140
(They knock their knees together.)

2939
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:32,140
Right here.

2940
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:33,680
I knocked my knee bones together.

2941
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:35,920
- I see.
- You can't help it.

2942
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,220
- Here I go.
- Go ahead.

2943
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:39,090
- I'll begin.
- You should try a forward roll.

2944
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:41,950
(The shocking preview with
the story of a man is coming soon!)

2945
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:43,860
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2946
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:44,860
(We thank Kim Min Jong
and Kim Ha Yoon for the laughter.)

2947
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:45,890
No.

2948
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:47,460
Ji Hyo, can I talk
to you for a moment?

2949
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:48,660
- You should go.
- Why?

2950
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:50,200
- What's with your face?
- Why?

2951
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,260
(Before the shoot, Jong Kook
called out the members one by one.)

2952
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:52,630
Is it true?

2953
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:53,730
- What's the matter?
- My gosh.

2954
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:55,400
I'm just happy.

2955
01:33:56,070 --> 01:33:57,840
(Laughing)

2956
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,170
Ji Hyo, are you crying?

2957
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:01,040
Yes. I'm a little touched.

2958
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,680
- Is it touching?
- Yes. This is so touching.

2959
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,810
Okay. Let's go.

2960
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:06,250
(The news of a man made
the members laugh and cry.)

2961
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:08,050
(That's how the opening began.)

2962
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:09,720
- Hello.
- Is it true?

2963
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:11,250
I still can't believe this.

2964
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,590
All right. Let's begin.

2965
01:34:12,590 --> 01:34:14,590
- Really?
- Nice to meet you.

2966
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:17,120
Hello.

2967
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:19,030
I still can't believe this.

2968
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:20,590
All right. Let's begin.

2969
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:22,600
- Really?
- It's shocking news.

2970
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,160
- I don't believe it.
- Let's stop talking about it.

2971
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:25,260
- Why?
- Let's stop.

2972
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:27,000
- Why should we stop?
- Let's begin.

2973
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,400
Why aren't you talking to me?

2974
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,940
- You will talk about it.
- Why aren't you talking to me?

2975
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:31,140
Will you talk about it
during the opening or not?

2976
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:32,570
- He should talk about it.
- You didn't tell Ye Eun.

2977
01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:33,740
Why aren't you talking to me?

2978
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:35,410
(My gosh. It's shocking.)

2979
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:36,740
It's unbelievable.

2980
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:38,110
Ji Hyo, who are you talking to?

2981
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:40,950
- It's so shocking.
- I was just saving it.

2982
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:41,980
- The date?
- Yes. I'm so happy for him.

2983
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:43,350
- I'm really happy.
- You're happy?

2984
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:44,420
- Aren't you sad?
- Are you getting married?

2985
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:45,920
- What?
- Are you getting married?

2986
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,020
- Aren't you sad?
- Are you getting married?

2987
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:48,590
- What?
- Are you getting married?

2988
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:50,660
(What? Is that true?)

2989
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:52,430
- He did?
- I thought he was joking.

2990
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:53,890
- Seriously, it's...
- Anyway...

2991
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:55,490
He suddenly came into my car.

2992
01:34:55,490 --> 01:34:56,900
- Are you getting married?
- Let's keep it down.

2993
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,860
- Is that true? I still don't know.
- Yes.

2994
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,430
- I think it's true.
- Is this a prank?

2995
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:02,600
- You should say it yourself.
- Okay.

2996
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,970
It's true.

2997
01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:06,140
- I'm getting married.
- Really?

2998
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:07,870
Yes. I'll live happily.

2999
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,110
That's amazing.

3000
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:12,410
(The old bachelor Kim Jong Kook
is finally getting married.)

3001
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:13,780
- Yes. I'll live happily.
- I feel like crying.

3002
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:15,380
- I got goosebumps.
- That's amazing.

3003
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:17,420
- A lot of you didn't know, right?
- Everyone didn't know.

3004
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:19,190
I just found out today.

3005
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:21,150
- I just found out today.
- My goodness.

3006
01:35:21,150 --> 01:35:22,820
- Seriously, I was...
- It's unbelievable.

3007
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:24,490
- Like this...
- Hey.

3008
01:35:24,490 --> 01:35:25,560
If you were born in the past,

3009
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,560
you should've joined
the independence army.

3010
01:35:26,830 --> 01:35:29,600
He didn't say anything
until the very end.

3011
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:31,260
- You're good at keeping secrets.
- Because...

3012
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:32,260
You're like an independence fighter.

3013
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:33,430
As you may know,

3014
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:35,400
I don't like
celebrating my birthday.

3015
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:36,500
- Right. You hate it.
- I really hate it.

3016
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,500
- You're shy.
- This is crazy.

3017
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,900
I want to keep things quiet.

3018
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,340
But you can't keep things quiet...

3019
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:41,440
- just because you want to.
- Right.

3020
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,310
- He's sweating on his nose.
- Is it true?

3021
01:35:43,310 --> 01:35:44,310
- Yes.
- I think so.

3022
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:45,380
- Jong Kook is...
- The thing is...

3023
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:47,910
If I announced it on another day,

3024
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:50,150
I thought you guys would have
placards here on Running Man.

3025
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:52,020
- We wouldn't do that.
- That's why.

3026
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:53,990
Seok Jin, is that true?

3027
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:55,450
- I think so.
- Really?

3028
01:35:55,450 --> 01:35:57,590
When one of our staff members
heard the story...

3029
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:00,190
Look at him.

3030
01:36:00,190 --> 01:36:01,830
You didn't know Jong Kook
would get married, did you?

3031
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:02,930
- Everyone was like that.
- Jong Kook.

3032
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:04,200
This is crazy.

3033
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,270
(Chuckling)

3034
01:36:06,270 --> 01:36:07,370
- Jae Seok.
- I thought it was a prank.

3035
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:08,830
Everything is good,

3036
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:10,400
but the most shocked one is him.
Look at him.

3037
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,970
Hey, you were...

3038
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:13,640
- I understand.
- I'm just happy.

3039
01:36:13,910 --> 01:36:15,310
- He's the same.
- I...

3040
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:16,510
- Actually, I wasn't...
- He's the same.

3041
01:36:16,510 --> 01:36:18,210
I wasn't going to tell him.

3042
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:19,350
- To me, he was...
- Right.

3043
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:21,450
- He called me out one day.
- Right.

3044
01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:23,050
- You did the same thing.
- He suddenly said he'd get married.

3045
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:25,680
- I felt really betrayed.
- I was really surprised.

3046
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,450
- Why are you sweating so much?
- I'm sweating a lot.

3047
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:29,260
- On behalf of Jong Kook,
- Yes.

3048
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:32,020
I'll briefly tell you
about the news.

3049
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:34,960
- This is really...
- We have always asked Jong Kook...

3050
01:36:35,190 --> 01:36:36,930
when he would get married...

3051
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:38,760
- every New Year.
- That's true.

3052
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:41,430
And finally, our Jong Kook...

3053
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:42,770
- is getting married!
- Yes!

3054
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:44,170
(Kim Jong Kook
is really getting married.)

3055
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:45,240
It's true.

3056
01:36:45,570 --> 01:36:47,340
- It's shocking.
- Let's begin now.

3057
01:36:47,370 --> 01:36:49,780
- Live happily.
- I will. I'll live happily.

3058
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:51,280
- Congratulations.
- I'll try.

3059
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,980
(No one knew he would make
a huge confession on this day.)

3060
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:56,050
(The guests, who had
already been invited, came!)

3061
01:36:56,050 --> 01:36:57,750
(Actor Jang Dong Yoon)

3062
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:59,420
(Running Man's official romantic,
Kim Ah Young)

3063
01:36:59,650 --> 01:37:02,020
(They are still in shock
even after seeing the guests.)

3064
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:03,320
(Why did he have to announce
his marriage like this?)

3065
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:04,420
(Whispering)

3066
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:06,860
(Marriage, all of a sudden?)

3067
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:10,200
(Jong Sook shows up.)

3068
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:13,030
(A couple race is scheduled
for today, of all days.)

3069
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:14,100
(I'm Seok Soon.)

3070
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:16,240
(Seok Soon's only target
is the younger man, Dong Yoon.)

3071
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:18,900
(As expected,
even Ye Eun joins them.)

3072
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,910
(Aren't you getting married?)

3073
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:22,510
(Jong Sook ties her up.)

3074
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:24,480
(Meanwhile, Ah Young is starting
another flirting skit again.)

3075
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,280
(While focusing
on the couple race...)

3076
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:28,950
(The lingering feeling
of the surprising news)

3077
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,650
(The destination of the couple race
is a wedding hall, of all places?)

3078
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:33,520
(Is this a wedding event
for Jong Kook?)

3079
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:37,420
(This was not intentional at all.)

3080
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:38,790
(The more you spend, the more luck
you get! Date Bursting With Luck.)
