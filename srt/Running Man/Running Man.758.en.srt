1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,710
- It's so hot.
- It really is.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,510
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,710
- Hello.
- Let's go.

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,110
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,280
Hello.

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,980
By the way, Ye Eun and Seok Sam...

7
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,390
It's a coincidence.

8
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,790
- Cool.
- This isn't "SBS Inkigayo."

9
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,490
- This is kind of...
- It's obvious.

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,090
- This is how we show our lives.
- Right.

11
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,990
Ye Eun is dressed like a milkshake.

12
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,960
- I have an announcement to make.
- Okay.

13
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,270
- Haha performed his song last week.
- Yes.

14
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,070
- Yes.
- The members said...

15
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,600
if you had something to promote,
you'd need to pay money now.

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,610
(From now on,)

17
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,310
(they will start charging fees
for promotional activities?)

18
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,540
- You can't perform for free now.
- You will get money starting now.

19
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,710
They should pay.

20
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,980
- At least R coins.
- Right.

21
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,010
I will pay.

22
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,520
(Last week,
after promoting "Sunny Day...")

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,880
We should let him pay for this.

24
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,150
We do.

25
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,320
We have to get money for this.

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,290
- I'm excited.
- To pay for our production cost.

27
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,390
Let him pay.

28
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,130
(Unfortunately, they released a song
a week later than Haha.)

29
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,690
- Starting from this week?
- We will pay.

30
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,330
What? Is it "Milkshake?"

31
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,960
- It's "Milkshake."
- The Chungju Ji Family.

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,600
- "Milkshake."
- "Milkshake."

33
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,300
Therefore,
Jee Seok Jin and Ji Ye Eun's duet song,

34
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,770
"Milkshake,"

35
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,740
can be performed for
only 30 seconds free of charge...

36
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,240
taking your opinions into account.

37
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,040
- I see. What about the rest?
- They should pay for the rest.

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,640
If you want to perform it
for 50 seconds,

39
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,710
you have to treat
the members to a private meal.

40
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,580
- Privately?
- Yes.

41
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,680
- Good.
- I should buy a meal.

42
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,290
If you want to perform
the entire song,

43
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,690
you will have to order a coffee truck
for the shoot.

44
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,160
- A coffee truck? Okay.
- Okay. Good.

45
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,190
- By the way...
- Seok Jin is spending a lot.

46
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,530
- No.
- He's the producer.

47
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,960
- Get us a coffee truck.
- Go with a coffee truck.

48
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,860
- A coffee truck sounds good.
- Let's go easy, Ye Eun.

49
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,000
- He's the producer.
- Get a coffee truck.

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,170
I'm paying
for half of the production cost.

51
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,340
How about we pay
for a coffee truck together?

52
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,700
- What's this, Haha?
- The three of us.

53
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,910
I was supposed
to wear this two weeks ago.

54
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,680
Did you cut your pants?
What is this?

55
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,110
- Right.
- Are they shorts or pants?

56
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,810
- Are they pants?
- It should be around here.

57
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,250
Does Dream wear them too?

58
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,810
- Haha.
- Maybe they share the clothes.

59
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,250
Why are you dressed like that
on an important day?

60
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,450
You are dressed like a beggar,
so you're drawing their attention.

61
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,590
- Right.
- What are you doing?

62
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,050
They are supposed
to pay attention to us.

63
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,790
- You look like a beggar.
- We are all dressed up for this.

64
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,360
I will pull down
the shorts a little then.

65
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,130
- Okay. Good.
- It's good now.

66
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,990
- They are pants now.
- It looks okay now.

67
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,400
Come on.

68
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,560
How long...

69
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,270
Will you perform the entire song?

70
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,200
- Isn't it too long?
- It's too long.

71
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,040
But there's nothing special
in the first 50 seconds.

72
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,170
It should be more than 50 seconds.

73
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,510
- For 50 seconds...
- Let's do it for 50 seconds.

74
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,570
- Okay.
- That would be enough.

75
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,970
- Right.
- We will go with 50 seconds.

76
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,110
- We will do it for 50 seconds.
- For 50 seconds.

77
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,810
What's the name of your team?
Dad and Daughter?

78
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,380
- Chungju Ji and Jee.
- No, it's Chungju Ji and Jee.

79
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,310
"Chocolate Milkshake"
by Chungju Ji and Jee?

80
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,720
Chungchi?

81
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,750
- Is that the name?
- "Choco Shake" by Chungchi.

82
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,890
- It's "Choco Shake" by Chungchi.
- "Choco Shake."

83
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,590
They are performing live today.

84
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,620
So Ye Eun kept doing this.

85
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,260
(Warming up her throat)

86
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,890
- That's what singers do.
- Singers do that.

87
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,990
She kept doing this.

88
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,500
It really bothered me.

89
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,530
- But I need to warm up.
- She can't perform live.

90
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,330
- She can't perform live.
- Why are you doing that?

91
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,770
- She can't sing.
- It's live.

92
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,200
- Live performance.
- Chungchi.

93
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
- I'm so nervous.
- Hey.

94
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,970
They are Chungchi.

95
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,010
- All right.
- Gosh, Seok Jin.

96
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,880
- Where should we look at?
- Over there.

97
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,980
Look at the prompter.

98
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,180
("Milkshake" by Chungju Ji and Jee)

99
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,480
Gosh, Seok Jin.

100
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,590
All right.
We are Chungju Ji and Jee.

101
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,020
This is "Milkshake."

102
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,490
I hope you will enjoy it.

103
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,330
(She starts singing the first verse
after 10 seconds.)

104
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,760
She's good.

105
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,130
It's nice.

106
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,200
(Her live performance is
better than they expected.)

107
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,430
Nice.

108
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,340
- Good.
- Milky color, Ji Ye Eun!

109
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,370
It's great.

110
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,410
- Hey, this is nice.
- There you go!

111
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,310
(Things are heated up
by the audience's intrusion.)

112
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,720
- Quit it, Jee Seok Jin!
- Quit it, Jee Seok Jin!

113
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,120
(Chungju Ji and Jee's performance
is getting more exciting.)

114
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,220
- What?
- It's over.

115
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,460
- What?
- It's over.

116
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,230
- The 50 seconds are over.
- Why...

117
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,800
- But...
- The chorus didn't even start.

118
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,330
- Don't spend more money.
- This...

119
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,400
You can't stop the song
at the most important part.

120
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,300
- That was 50 seconds.
- I'll call a coffee truck.

121
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,440
- This is the chorus.
- You should get a coffee truck.

122
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,700
I should call a coffee truck.

123
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,900
- You should.
- I'll do that.

124
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,410
- We will call a coffee truck.
- We didn't hear the main part.

125
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,870
- Please.
- You didn't sing the main part.

126
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,040
I was really surprised.

127
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,880
- You should spend money.
- Right. This is the main part.

128
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,610
- This is the main part.
- They have the choreography.

129
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,280
- You should spend more money.
- Right.

130
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,520
We will gladly pay
for a coffee truck.

131
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,650
- Good.
- Okay.

132
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,850
I'll call a coffee truck next time.

133
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,190
(He bought a chance to perform
by paying for a coffee truck.)

134
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,930
(He starts singing again
with the AR music.)

135
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,460
(They start dancing proudly.)

136
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,300
(The CGI of bubbles
bought with the coffee truck)

137
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,870
(The reactions
bought with the coffee truck)

138
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,100
Chungchi!

139
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,670
- Chungchi!
- Chungchi!

140
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,850
(The illustrations
bought with the coffee truck)

141
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,380
(They are done singing the 1st verse
with no problem.)

142
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,150
The music is too loud for her voice.

143
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,350
- Obviously, this is the AR.
- It's the AR.

144
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,420
(Time to prove the skills
of the rookie singer)

145
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,160
(Her raw voice without music)

146
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,500
(Like the milky color)

147
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,870
The voice is coming out
even when she's not singing.

148
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,770
Isn't it coming out
even when they're not singing?

149
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,840
(Happy taste)

150
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,610
(The 3-stage loud voice)

151
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,580
(Precious memories)

152
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,110
(Singing)

153
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,910
What was that?
She just sang like this.

154
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,550
(Her goat voice
is like window-paper.)

155
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,120
(Anyway, milkshake)

156
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,750
(Singing)

157
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,790
Good.

158
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,260
This is the fun of it.

159
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,030
This is the fun of it.

160
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,860
- This is...
- This is the fun of it.

161
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,700
- That was nice.
- I was so nervous.

162
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,270
- The song is really good.
- Nice.

163
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,330
- I love it.
- You're so funny.

164
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,370
Ye Eun.

165
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,440
- I'll give you an idea.
- Okay.

166
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,800
When you perform on a TV music show,

167
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,770
you should sing a duet
with an idol instead of Seok Jin.

168
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,840
- What?
- Yes.

169
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,010
- That would be nice.
- If it's okay,

170
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,410
- let me perform.
- Jong Kook.

171
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,410
He's paying for everything.

172
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,350
- And you want to leave him out?
- But I think...

173
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,250
- it would be better without him.
- He's the investor.

174
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,820
- It's not bad, right?
- You should spend...

175
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,850
some money on marketing though.

176
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,690
- This is...
- You should do...

177
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,320
some marketing on social media.

178
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,560
- They should.
- We will do that.

179
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,290
We will do viral marketing too.

180
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,890
And there's this person.

181
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,990
The brother.

182
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,030
- Who?
- Who's the brother?

183
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,560
The actor.

184
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,100
- Ji Jin Hee.
- Jin Hee?

185
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,600
- Jin Hee should do something.
- Right.

186
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,170
- Jin Hee? Chungju?
- Oh, right. He's younger than me.

187
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,230
He's also from the Chungju Ji clan.

188
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,600
- Is he?
- He's from the Chungju Ji clan.

189
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,740
- Yes, Jin Hee.
- I see.

190
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,900
- Sure.
- I talked to him on the phone.

191
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,210
- And there's Ji Chang Wook.
- Ji Chang Wook.

192
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,910
The Jis should do the challenge.

193
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,340
Anyway,
we will call a coffee truck...

194
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,810
- as we promised.
- Okay.

195
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,810
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

196
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,480
- Nice.
- We are...

197
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,820
- Chungju Ji and Jee.
- Chungju Ji and Jee.

198
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,120
- Cross.
- You should spend some money.

199
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,490
All right. During the last shoot,

200
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,390
among Song Ji Hyo, Yang Se Chan,

201
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,730
Choi Daniel, and Ji Ye Eun,

202
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,690
you said you wanted to see...

203
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,060
- who was the worst Empty Head.
- Oh, dear.

204
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,630
- Right.
- That's what was mentioned.

205
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,000
So we've prepared a race called...

206
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,300
the Empty Head Avengers Competition
for today.

207
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,400
- Gosh.
- Empty Head Avengers?

208
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,740
The three of you
should have a match.

209
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,080
(2 weeks ago, they declared
the Empty Head War with pride.)

210
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,510
- Daniel should join them.
- Daniel.

211
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,350
- He should join us.
- Then the four of you.

212
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,320
(That's how they selected
the elite Empty Heads.)

213
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,350
(Who was born from an egg
and founded Seorabeol?)

214
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,490
(Pak Hyeokgeose)

215
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,060
(Candidate 1. Yang Se Chan
with knowledge learned from Running Man)

216
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,530
Why was he born from an egg?

217
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,260
He was a bird like me.

218
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,500
(Candidate 2. Song Ji Hyo
with surprising wrong answers)

219
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,830
The Bundae Great Dharani.

220
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,300
(The Bundae Great Dharani)

221
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,970
- Do you know "The Scream" by Munk?
- I know.

222
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,070
Picasso.

223
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,700
(Candidate 3. Ji Ye Won
who knows only about food)

224
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,910
(Candidate 4. Choi Daniel
with the empty head beyond glasses)

225
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,980
Parisian Lady?

226
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,640
(Candidate 4. Choi Daniel
with the empty head beyond glasses)

227
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,210
His head was half-smashed.

228
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,510
I look forward to it.

229
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,080
This is not fair.

230
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,820
Today, the final quiz competition...

231
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,250
will determine the ranking
of the Empty Heads.

232
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,590
We will be doing that?

233
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,460
- Good.
- There will be quizzes.

234
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,190
The Empty Head Avengers
will bet on their own answers.

235
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,630
And the four brainiacs...

236
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,060
will bet on the Empty Heads
whom they think will get it right.

237
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,700
- I see.
- Instead of caramels,

238
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,070
we have special betting money today.

239
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,300
- They are ice balls.
- Ice balls.

240
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,710
You will get 20 ice balls each
in different colors.

241
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,480
You have to keep the ice balls safe
until the quiz competition...

242
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,950
- so you can bet them.
- Okay.

243
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,250
After you get changed,

244
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,050
we will give you ten minutes
to hide the ice balls.

245
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,120
Whether it is indoors or outdoors,

246
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,320
you can hide the ice balls...

247
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
- anywhere you want.
- But it's too hot outside.

248
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,260
- They will melt.
- We should hide them indoors.

249
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,960
They should be in the shade.

250
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,760
The ice balls will melt soon.

251
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,800
If the balls break or melt too much,

252
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
you can't use them.

253
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,330
For your information,

254
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,800
you will be competing
within your team.

255
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,640
A competition
within Team Empty Head Avengers,

256
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,140
and a competition
within Team Brainiacs.

257
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,570
- It's a competition.
- Yes.

258
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,110
I'm in Team Brainiacs
because of you guys.

259
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,510
Shouldn't you be there?

260
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,880
It's a competition among us.

261
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,110
You guys...

262
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,450
- Can I break their ice balls?
- You can.

263
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,380
If you find someone else's balls,
you can break them.

264
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,390
But you have no reason to do that.

265
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,950
I can always make up reasons.

266
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,560
All right. Please get changed
and hide your balls.

267
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,690
- The ice balls.
- Okay.

268
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,500
You can hide your ice balls...

269
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,600
- for ten minutes from now.
- Really?

270
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,530
Where should I hide them?

271
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,770
Where should I hide them
to make people think I did well?

272
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,000
We are one team.

273
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,940
- Chungju Ji and Jee.
- Chungju Ji and Jee, cross.

274
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,970
(They start hiding the 20 ice balls
of their own colors.)

275
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,510
Ice is a little hard to hide.

276
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,610
This is hard.

277
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,210
We already tried
hiding things here before.

278
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,750
So we know this place
inside and out.

279
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,490
(This is where they had the race
of hiding eggs twice.)

280
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,990
(They already used every corner
to hide eggs.)

281
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,100
I will hide it in a great place.

282
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,260
I already hid it
in a place like this before.

283
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,400
(Where should they hide
the ice balls to keep them safe?)

284
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,170
Hang on. Where should this go?

285
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,370
(Jae Seok is thinking.)

286
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,240
(He found the production staff's stuff
on the ground.)

287
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,880
The Jimmy Jib director
won't take them, right?

288
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,220
Maybe I'll hide two here.

289
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
This is good.

290
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
(He hides the sealed ice balls
in the Jimmy Jib bag.)

291
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,390
Would they notice?

292
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,330
(He hides the sealed ice balls
in the Jimmy Jib bag.)

293
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,860
Pros and amateurs have
different approaches.

294
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,900
(As a pro,
he makes use of the corner space.)

295
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,400
Pros and amateurs have
different approaches.

296
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,040
A lot of things happened here.

297
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,840
There's an empty lot
behind the building.

298
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,310
I should bury them.

299
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,880
Even I can't find my balls here.

300
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,180
In the dryer.

301
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,450
There's a van with a fridge in it.

302
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,220
My goodness. It's here.

303
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,890
I'll keep ten of them here. Half.

304
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,830
<i>Excuse me</i>

305
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,030
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook goes inside.)

306
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,900
A place like up there
can be unexpectedly difficult.

307
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,130
Or on the crossbeam?

308
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,640
(Gym Jong Kook looks up.)

309
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,840
Can I get up there?

310
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,940
(Gym Jong Kook looks up.)

311
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,410
(It's the height
that Haha can't reach.)

312
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,080
What do you think?

313
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,450
You can't see it, can you?

314
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,180
Isn't this nice?

315
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,280
They are melting.

316
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,020
(Daniel is a rookie
when it comes to hiding.)

317
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,820
(Sitting down)

318
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,120
All right.

319
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,060
(He digs the ground
at a sunny spot.)

320
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,160
(He puts ice balls in.)

321
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,630
(And he covers it with soil.)

322
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,770
(Will the ice balls remain intact
without melting until the quiz?)

323
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,540
Can I hang it in here?

324
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,750
(Now he puts it in the hot parasol.)

325
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,820
Done.

326
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,550
(To make things worse,
someone is watching him.)

327
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,790
Okay. I know
where Daniel hid his balls.

328
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,560
Where should I hide them?

329
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,060
I should hide them
when no one is around.

330
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,260
It's perfect.

331
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,300
This is a great option.

332
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,930
(Where Daniel's ball is)

333
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,700
Under these stones. Right here.

334
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,770
Sweet.

335
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,440
(This time,
she builds a grave of stones.)

336
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,610
You can't see it.

337
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,880
(Again, it's next
to where Daniel's ball is.)

338
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,180
This is insane. How clever is this?

339
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,180
(While the newcomers think alike)

340
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,320
Hey.

341
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,990
(They're even in sync
when it comes to getting caught.)

342
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,190
Ye Eun, where did you hide yours?

343
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,220
Don't ask.

344
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,620
People will find yours soon enough.

345
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,920
Really?

346
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,390
I don't care.

347
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,360
- You don't care?
- I don't.

348
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,800
Ye Eun already hid something here.

349
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,370
I didn't.

350
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,630
Wait.

351
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,070
Ye Eun, you can't leave yours here.

352
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,710
You can't leave them
lying around like this.

353
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,740
(Her ball is seen immediately.)

354
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,680
- If you leave them like this...
- Will people find them?

355
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,780
Of course.

356
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,480
I don't need to destroy yours today.

357
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,010
- Since I'm with the empty heads.
- Exactly.

358
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,750
You'll be quizzed today.

359
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,920
You're right.

360
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,450
- Ye Eun.
- Yes?

361
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,190
You can't leave yours like this.

362
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,930
(Spotted again in 5 seconds)

363
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,760
You can't call this hiding.
It's like you left them behind.

364
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,300
- What is it?
- It's like you left it here.

365
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,800
Seriously?

366
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,170
Besides, you're tipping people off
by leaving the mold here.

367
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,570
We'll know.

368
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,940
- Unbelievable.
- Come on.

369
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,840
- What is this?
- I see you're smart.

370
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,740
(While the beginners get lectured)

371
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,010
- Come on.
- It's in there.

372
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,580
This won't do.

373
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,580
Wait. Where should I hide these?

374
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,520
Someone will definitely
look for them here.

375
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,390
Let me see.

376
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,990
(Thick with dust)

377
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,300
This is a good place to hide them.

378
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,030
I'll leave 12 balls behind.

379
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,240
(A vacuum that no one
will probably open)

380
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,440
Got it.

381
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,840
(He places
a whopping 12 balls inside.)

382
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,080
I can't leave behind traces
of this blue liquid.

383
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,280
(Perfectly covering up his tracks)

384
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,380
All good.

385
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,820
(After walking around a bit,
he opens the fridge.)

386
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,490
Can someone leave theirs
in here like this?

387
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,350
Isn't this Seok Jin's?

388
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,890
I'll leave one in here.

389
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,760
(Correct)

390
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,790
Just one.

391
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,630
I'll leave one just in case.

392
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,300
(Even with 15 years of experience,
he's still just as clueless.)

393
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,500
Why did he leave this in here?

394
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,430
(And for 15 years,
Jae Seok's been on his trail.)

395
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,570
Why...

396
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,600
Is he kidding me?

397
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,270
Seok Jin's so clueless.

398
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,540
Hi.

399
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,310
Hi, puppy.

400
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,010
There aren't any places
to hide these.

401
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,880
- There aren't any adequate spots.
- There aren't.

402
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,950
I just hid them where I could.
Whatever.

403
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,590
Gosh, that's freezing!

404
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,720
Hey.

405
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,490
Wait, isn't that mine?

406
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,120
(The same thing has been happening
for 15 years.)

407
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,190
They don't even break easily.
Goodness.

408
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,430
Hey!

409
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,860
Where did you find this?

410
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,400
(Seok Jin's late ice ball,
From 10:35 a.m. to 10:40 a.m.)

411
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,100
Does this still count?

412
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,770
- No, it's been cracked.
- So it can't be cracked?

413
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,870
(Seok Sam's ball was the first
to get broken.)

414
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,200
- Hey!
- What?

415
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,970
How does he find mine so easily?

416
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,540
Am I not hiding them well?

417
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,610
There aren't any places
to hide these.

418
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,810
- Hey.
- What?

419
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,280
Is that where you're hiding yours?

420
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,680
How about we...

421
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,020
Wait.

422
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,720
- Why don't we...
- Are you in?

423
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,090
- Let's do it.
- Seok Jin.

424
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,420
Seok Jin,
why don't we put them in here?

425
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,390
We'll put them in here
and let them freeze.

426
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,420
In here.

427
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,060
Hey, let's work together.
How about we team up?

428
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,430
- Should we do it?
- Let's do this.

429
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,760
- We'll write "No entry."
- Right.

430
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,030
- What do you say?
- We'll hide one each.

431
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,370
Let's put them in there.

432
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,940
- Let's team up today.
- Okay.

433
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,010
"Prop fridge. Do not open."
Do you have a pen?

434
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,170
- Write something good.
- "Property of the supermarket."

435
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,880
"Property of the supermarket."
Yes, I like that one.

436
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,050
I'm putting my trust in you
once again.

437
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,910
I'll... Haha.

438
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,280
I mean it this time.

439
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,250
"Do not open."

440
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,450
It can't look like my handwriting.

441
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,420
And then...

442
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,120
I think this will work.

443
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,990
- This is what you call a gamble.
- This could work.

444
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,260
Seok Jin,
let's rope Se Chan into this.

445
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,500
(Just then,
Empty Head Se Chan appears.)

446
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,400
- Come here. Join us.
- Get over here.

447
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,300
- Hey. It'll be us three.
- Us three will team up.

448
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,300
Place one in here.

449
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,070
- Yes, in here.
- We put up this sign.

450
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,410
- Let's try this.
- Put it in here right now.

451
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,010
- You already saw this.
- We just have to stay loyal.

452
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,340
- Okay.
- Put yours in there already.

453
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,680
There. Now, close it fast
before someone sees us.

454
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,910
Close it already.

455
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,050
- Let's bring Jong Kook in.
- What?

456
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,580
- Jong Kook too?
- Jong Kook.

457
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,480
- Do you want to team up with us?
- What do you say?

458
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,220
- What will it be?
- Come on.

459
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,420
I know this is a long shot,

460
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,660
- but let's try this.
- There are four trays in there.

461
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,260
- What do you say?
- This is only between us.

462
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,530
- This... Okay, let's do this.
- Okay.

463
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,230
We can't betray one another.

464
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,460
- I won't betray you.
- I'll cut ties with you.

465
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,730
You know there's a chat room...

466
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,000
- for just us four.
- Sure.

467
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,500
I'll be leaving that
if you betray me.

468
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,700
- Okay.
- Okay.

469
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,300
- Seriously.
- The four of us teamed up,

470
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,510
so we'll be fine
if we don't open it.

471
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,810
- Only the four of us know.
- Exactly.

472
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,410
- Let's go.
- I'll go hide the rest of mine.

473
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,480
Let's go.

474
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,480
There aren't any places
to hide these.

475
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,980
How am I supposed to hide these?

476
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,280
Okay, good.

477
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,150
There aren't many places
to hide them.

478
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,690
(Why does Se Chan keep lurking
around the place?)

479
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,960
I'm allowed to break
other balls, right?

480
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,990
That...

481
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,660
Wouldn't that be better?

482
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,360
This is how I should play, right?

483
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,770
Where's Haha?

484
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,700
- Seok Jin's. Where is it?
- What?

485
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,870
Hold on.
He'll be upset for sure though.

486
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,440
- Let's leave them until the end.
- I bet you already betrayed him.

487
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,380
- Hey.
- Let me check.

488
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,540
Just a second.

489
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,040
- Haha, if...
- Let me take that.

490
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,280
It'll look weird if you mop up...

491
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,480
- Yours is purple, right?
- only around the fridge.

492
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,980
- I left them as is.
- Got it.

493
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,420
How about we take ours out?

494
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,450
I like the sound of that.

495
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,550
And let's break two of Seok Jin's.

496
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,060
Sure.

497
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,860
Hold on.

498
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,130
His is yellow, right?

499
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,960
(Se Chan wants to break Seok Jin's
when he's not even his competition.)

500
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Are you good?

501
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,800
(He takes off
with two of Seok Jin's balls.)

502
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,900
I don't think I can trust him.

503
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,270
I can't trust him.

504
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,870
I'm taking mine out.

505
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,280
(Haha takes his out
and hides it elsewhere.)

506
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,680
I can't trust him.

507
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,210
How could anyone trust him?

508
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,980
(Meanwhile, Se Chan left
with Seok Jin's balls.)

509
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,850
I'll place it on here.

510
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,790
(Toasty)

511
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,990
(Tanning under direct sunlight)

512
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,060
There.

513
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,260
Stick with me for this race.

514
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,560
His has already melted.

515
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,800
(Like that, Seok Jin lost
2 of his betting balls.)

516
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,500
Haha, go somewhere else.

517
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,730
- What do you mean?
- Come on.

518
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,070
I didn't do anything.

519
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,440
(Feeling nervous, Se Chan
immediately checks the fridge.)

520
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,780
(Chuckling)

521
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,150
- Where are you taking them?
- Give it here.

522
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,710
- What do you mean?
- Give it here.

523
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,550
- Give it here, or I'm leaving.
- Give you what?

524
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,580
Where are mine?

525
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,050
Why would I take yours?

526
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,150
- Really?
- Let me see. What's your color?

527
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,220
These are Seok Jin's.

528
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,090
I can't believe he has the guts
to do this.

529
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,730
He took mine.

530
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,860
He took mine, didn't he?

531
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,360
Mine aren't there. Watch your step.

532
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,500
(He left with Haha's balls?)

533
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,230
(A moment ago)

534
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,710
(Haha didn't bother to check
and took the wrong ice balls.)

535
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,640
(These are Se Chan's.)

536
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:30,050
(Because of that, Se Chan
assumed Haha took them.)

537
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,750
(So, Se Chan left
with Haha's balls.)

538
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,650
I'm going to bowl with these.

539
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,290
(Getting his revenge)

540
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,660
- What's that?
- I'm bowling.

541
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,460
- There aren't yours.
- Whose are they?

542
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,730
They're all gone. Go and check.

543
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,900
Shoot. I can't believe you boys.

544
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,030
(Meanwhile, Haha has no clue.)

545
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,710
(Tapping)

546
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,210
(Gradually,
Haha loses his betting balls.)

547
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,650
(A small mistake led
to a huge misunderstanding.)

548
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,720
(Just like that,
Haha lost 6 of his balls.)

549
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,290
Whatever.

550
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,860
(At that moment)

551
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,420
Wait. These aren't mine.

552
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,060
Whose are they?

553
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,230
Hold on. These aren't mine.

554
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,500
Hey, Se Chan!

555
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,830
Se Chan. Hey, Se Chan!

556
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,000
These are yours. Where's mine?

557
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,070
Seok Jin took them.

558
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,670
- What?
- Let's check.

559
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,740
Where are mine?

560
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,240
- Let me see.
- These are yours.

561
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,010
- Haha, seriously?
- I know.

562
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,650
- Can you help me find mine?
- I'll keep them.

563
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,280
- Where are they?
- Why are you asking me?

564
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,950
Hold on. Wait.

565
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,150
I should go to Jong Kook.

566
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,490
(He still manages to retrieve 2.)

567
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,690
Hey! What color balls are they?

568
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,460
- I think they're pink.
- Pink?

569
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,890
Haha, I'm not sure.

570
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,990
What... Whose color is that?
Aren't they Jong Kook's?

571
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,760
Whatever. I can't trust him.

572
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,830
(Fragments of the past flash by us.)

573
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,200
I can't believe he has the guts
to do this. Seok Jin, wait!

574
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,270
- What?
- Where are mine?

575
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,610
- Mine are purple.
- I don't know. I didn't touch them.

576
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,610
Earlier, Se Chan was rolling some
down the hill.

577
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,780
- Were they... What's your color?
- Darn it.

578
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,180
Don't be absurd. What's your color?

579
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,750
- What did you do?
- Are yours purple?

580
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,380
Haha, look.

581
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,120
(Shattered)

582
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,890
(Sighing)

583
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,290
That jerk.

584
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,830
(They're at each other's throats
even though they're not opponents.)

585
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,490
Darn traitors.

586
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,730
(Will they be able to defend
their ice balls until the quiz?)

587
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,070
I still managed to save two of mine.

588
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,340
- Already...
- What is it?

589
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,370
- Many are already upset.
- Hugely so.

590
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,510
- It's already over.
- Trusting them...

591
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,980
I blame myself for trusting them.

592
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,680
I have to say this.
Ye Eun wasn't hiding them.

593
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,910
She was just placing them around.

594
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,950
- Exactly.
- Really?

595
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,250
This is what I could tell
from last week's episode.

596
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,350
- You know it too, right?
- Sure.

597
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,190
I'm the smartest out of us four.

598
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,460
You'll play a game
to win more ice balls.

599
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,890
The game is
Hoping the Mustache Reaches You.

600
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,030
- Hoping the Mustache Reaches You?
- Yes.

601
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,030
One team at a time,
you will place...

602
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,130
five mustache stickers
anywhere you want on the TV.

603
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,270
You will have succeeded
when the sticker you placed...

604
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,470
is positioned directly
between a person's nose and mouth.

605
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,540
- That sounds like fun.
- Random scenes...

606
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,910
- will be given.
- This will be fun.

607
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,510
- The order will be just as crucial.
- Nice.

608
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,150
- This is clever.
- You will get to see the scenes...

609
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,220
- for ten seconds.
- Sure.

610
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,820
You will win a point...

611
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,250
- every time you get one right.
- Nice.

612
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,050
You'll win ice balls...

613
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,620
according to your finishing rank.

614
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,690
You will split into groups of two...

615
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,330
- Nice.
- and play the game.

616
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,000
The 3rd and 4th-place teams
must go outside...

617
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,500
five minutes earlier
to hide their ice balls.

618
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,070
The 1st and 2nd-place teams
can find and smash their balls.

619
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,940
- Right.
- It's a disadvantage to hide first.

620
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,610
Someone from Empty Head Avengers...

621
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,210
will choose someone
from Brainiacs to partner with.

622
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,210
You can pick your own teammate.

623
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,320
- Okay.
- You pick someone.

624
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,120
Let me promote myself.

625
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,560
I don't know what clip they'll play,
but I appeared in dramas and movies.

626
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,690
I know the placement
for bust shots and waist shots.

627
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,760
- Yes, that's right.
- I see.

628
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,860
There will be various kinds.

629
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,800
To be honest,
I want to go with Daniel.

630
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,830
Why?

631
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:10,230
He's a bit different. He can spell.

632
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,700
You get me.

633
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,600
If you can spell in English,
you're a genius.

634
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,340
- I can spell.
- He's a genius.

635
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,570
"Morning." M-O-R-N-I-N-G.

636
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,140
- What is it?
- He's a genius.

637
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,980
Ye Eun knows
many Chinese characters.

638
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,410
- Yes.
- My shoot-term memory...

639
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,720
My shoot-term memory...

640
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,050
- "Short-term."
- What?

641
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,920
Talk properly. What can you do
if you can't speak properly?

642
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,450
You lack the ability to speak.

643
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,960
I have a great short-term memory.

644
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,490
- Do you?
- "Shoot-term memory?"

645
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,590
- "Short-term."
- It's not that.

646
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,690
Say "short-term memory."

647
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,200
- Short-term memry.
- It's "memory," not "memry."

648
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,560
- She said "memry."
- "Short-term."

649
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,230
- I have a great short-term memory.
- That's it.

650
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,570
I'm great at memorizing stuff
on the spot.

651
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,000
Comedians have to memorize
short sketches really fast.

652
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,340
Right away.

653
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,940
- Ssabssab.
- Me what?

654
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,570
Pick someone.

655
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,210
Whenever we play
something like this,

656
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,840
- it's the Bucktooth guys.
- Bucktooth.

657
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,350
- The Bucktooth guys will pair up.
- Yes.

658
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,810
- The Chungju couple?
- The Chungju couple.

659
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,220
- The Chungju couple?
- The Chungju couple.

660
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,080
- Yes.
- Okay.

661
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,050
Seok Jin, why are you making
a sour face? I'm good at this.

662
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,090
- The ex flirts.
- It's just for this game.

663
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,860
- Okay.
- The ex flirts.

664
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,790
- I'll partner with Daniel.
- Okay.

665
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,390
- Okay. Sounds good.
- Sounds good.

666
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,400
- You stick them on.
- Let's do it.

667
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,600
Someone usually appears here.

668
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Each cameraman...

669
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,770
has their own preference.

670
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,610
Some like to give
extra space above the head...

671
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,340
- and some don't.
- Let's test your hunch.

672
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,450
It also depends on whether
the left or right has more space.

673
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,580
- Jong Kook, let me explain.
- Okay.

674
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,220
- When you're filming,
- That's right.

675
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,590
- you have this on your phones.
- Yes.

676
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,560
- Split the screen into nine slots.
- Yes.

677
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,120
- Why are you telling everyone?
- It's common.

678
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,390
(The others are eavesdropping
in the open.)

679
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,830
- That's a good tip.
- There are nine sections.

680
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,600
You place the eyes and nose
where the viewers...

681
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,200
are most likely to look.

682
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Let's give it a go. Let's try.

683
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,340
- Shall we go second?
- Yes.

684
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,070
- Haha, you go first.
- No, why?

685
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,970
- Why?
- You look ugly today.

686
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,040
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- What about you?

687
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,110
(Mocking smirk)

688
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,450
- What the...
- Shall we go first?

689
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,110
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Then...

690
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,550
- We'll go first.
- Shall we play... You'll start?

691
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,890
- Yes.
- Why don't you want to start?

692
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,290
You go first.
The Jee and Jis are the best.

693
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,790
- "Milkshake."
- Why don't you want to go first?

694
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,590
- Going first...
- We want to figure it out.

695
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,030
- Chungju Ji and Jee.
- Let's use the big ones.

696
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,560
- Put the big one in the center.
- Do that.

697
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,870
- About here?
- Wish them bad luck.

698
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,400
Let's recycle the rest.

699
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
About here.

700
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,940
Faces usually appear over here.

701
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,410
That places the face
way too far at the end.

702
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,880
If the face is here,
then around here?

703
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,080
That should work.

704
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,780
There's the hype from earlier.

705
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,310
Why are you so confident?

706
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,020
Seok Jin, the faces...

707
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,820
- They overlap, then.
- Don't fight, "Milkshake."

708
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,320
- The faces overlap.
- Why do you have the final say?

709
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,920
Seok Jin, the faces...
If a face looks like this...

710
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,390
The face might not be here.

711
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,960
- Really?
- Split the 5 into 2 and 3.

712
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,100
- No, it's just...
- Why do that?

713
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,600
You two don't look like
you get along.

714
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,470
We don't. We're not a good team.

715
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,700
It's just for work, right?

716
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,510
That works. About here?

717
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,840
- Isn't that too small?
- No.

718
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,210
The small one might be good too.

719
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,880
You could put one upside-down.

720
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,980
Don't think
you're the only one who's right.

721
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,210
- We're done.
- Seok Jin.

722
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,080
- Those are your five mustaches.
- Yes.

723
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,850
- We'll play a clip.
- Let's see.

724
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,020
We'll play it for ten seconds.

725
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,290
Wish us luck.

726
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,220
- They might get none.
- I wish you bomb.

727
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,490
- I wish you bomb.
- Please.

728
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,930
(The video plays.)

729
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,460
(Daniel suddenly appears?)

730
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,330
What's this? Hang on.

731
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,700
Hang on. What is this?

732
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,700
(They only care
about the mustaches.)

733
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,210
Shoot. Daniel. Come on.

734
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,210
- One!
- One.

735
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,250
What's that?

736
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,710
- One.
- One.

737
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,120
- One.
- Move downward!

738
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,380
- Two!
- Two!

739
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,380
- Two.
- Two.

740
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,950
Come on, one more.

741
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,120
- Okay.
- Two points.

742
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,390
(Team Seok Jin won 2 points.)

743
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,460
We should go lower
with the one in the middle.

744
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,890
That one should be lower.

745
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,290
(The mustache is slightly high.)

746
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,300
- Here and here.
- Jae Seok, shall we put...

747
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,530
all five in a line in the middle?

748
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,770
- We need some to the side.
- Is it the same clip?

749
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,200
- Two at the side.
- No?

750
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,800
The corners are pointless.

751
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,410
- In each corner and in the middle?
- Yes.

752
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,710
(They decide on 2 to each side
and 1 in the middle.)

753
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,580
That's a perfect spot.
In the middle but lower.

754
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,580
- This line is it.
- They're different.

755
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,610
- Daniel, you're handsome.
- Seok Jin.

756
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,280
- Here and here.
- Take them off.

757
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,480
- Here and here.
- Take them off.

758
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,980
- Hurry.
- Take them off.

759
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,190
- Our score...
- Do you want to reuse these?

760
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,450
- Why not?
- Reuse them.

761
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,590
- Let's not waste.
- Sure.

762
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,190
- Don't waste.
- Always reuse.

763
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,690
- We'll reuse these and play now.
- Recycle them.

764
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,060
- Give them to me.
- Reuse them.

765
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,830
Okay. The big ones
should go along this line.

766
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,900
Yes.

767
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,970
Jong Kook,
where should the first one go?

768
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,600
If there's just one person
on screen,

769
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,500
- they'll be around here.
- Yes.

770
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,010
- Right? The solo shot.
- Yes.

771
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,410
A bit lower?

772
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,910
- Around here?
- Yes.

773
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,310
The eyes will likely come here.

774
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,250
This much will be the background...

775
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,280
- with one person here.
- Yes.

776
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,480
- When they face each other.
- A solo shot.

777
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,520
He's a real producer.

778
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,020
You're a producer.

779
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,090
You're a producer.

780
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:01,120
- You appeared in a drama.
- That's right.

781
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,190
- You did some acting?
- I even had an on-screen kiss.

782
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,700
- You did? With whom?
- That's right.

783
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,200
- With Jae Seok's friend.
- Yeh Ji Won.

784
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,300
- With my friend.
- With Yeh Ji Won.

785
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,300
- With Yeh Ji Won.
- With my friend.

786
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,970
- For real?
- Yes.

787
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,540
It wasn't a cameo appearance.

788
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,940
It was an actual drama.

789
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,370
You have lots of flings
with my friends.

790
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,010
- Who else is there?
- Eun I.

791
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,010
Song Eun I?

792
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,310
(That was 14 years ago.)

793
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,880
Jong Kook,
how about putting one here?

794
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,920
If one appears from this side,
the other comes from there.

795
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,220
- There's the accompanying scene.
- It's a reverse.

796
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,950
- That's right.
- "Reverse."

797
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,420
- "Reverse."
- Yes.

798
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,060
- And then...
- The small ones.

799
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,060
You're taking too long.

800
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,130
- Come on.
- Let's speed up.

801
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,660
- There's not much time.
- Not the big one.

802
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,200
Let's put some small ones...

803
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,560
- There's no time.
- This one...

804
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,970
- There's a time limit.
- Let's time this stage.

805
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,600
- The time...
- There's no time limit.

806
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
You take too long.

807
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,800
- Okay.
- Don't be cheesy.

808
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,240
Step back and look
as if you're watching a drama.

809
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,310
- The only...
- What would you know?

810
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,350
Let's play already.

811
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,310
- What are you doing?
- What would you know?

812
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,280
- He's an actor.
- Let's play already.

813
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
(Actor Choi continues
with his manager's protection.)

814
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,890
- That's it.
- I'll put it here.

815
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,590
- That looks good.
- Can't you slap them on?

816
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,090
- We need one more.
- Can't you tell by a hunch?

817
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,390
- Shall we put it here?
- Isn't this part too bare?

818
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,130
- Here?
- Put one way down low.

819
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,060
- Shall we put it here?
- What about here?

820
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,630
Do you rarely have a face here?

821
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,230
- We don't need one?
- Five,

822
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,140
- four, three,
- Four, three,

823
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,770
- two, one!
- two, one!

824
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,810
There.

825
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,770
- That's it.
- We'll play the clip.

826
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,410
- Let's go.
- Just get one.

827
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,510
- None.
- None.

828
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,780
- One!
- No.

829
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,480
- That's not it.
- None.

830
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,820
(After making so much fuss,)

831
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,580
(will their turn end in 0 points?)

832
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,220
- You got her eye.
- None.

833
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,590
(They got one.)

834
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,460
- Hey!
- One!

835
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,660
- One.
- One.

836
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,490
- You got her eye.
- Hey!

837
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,660
- One.
- One.

838
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,960
- One.
- It was on her eye.

839
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,600
- Wait!
- No.

840
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,870
- No.
- One.

841
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,770
- All right, Seok Jin.
- Hooray.

842
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,800
(Team Jong Kook got just 1 point.)

843
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,300
- One.
- Hang on.

844
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,500
One point.

845
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,610
- Hey, you! They were all here!
- Jong Kook.

846
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,210
What was this clip from?

847
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,910
"Heirs."

848
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,880
- "Heirs," right?
- We'll go next.

849
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,210
It depends...

850
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,580
- on the era.
- You...

851
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,950
- It depends on the era.
- Take them off.

852
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,120
(He blames the era out of shame.)

853
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,520
- Jong Kook.
- What?

854
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,560
- It depends on the era.
- You have zero common sense.

855
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,690
I didn't take the lead. He did.

856
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,060
He took the actor's view.

857
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,760
You have zero good sense.

858
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,200
He's an actor.

859
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,200
That's odd.

860
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,900
You're useless.

861
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,670
You put them
in all the wrong places.

862
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,570
I didn't think we'd be so ahead.

863
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,670
- The scenes...
- My gosh.

864
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,210
- We did well.
- It's hard.

865
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:33,010
It's pretty hard.
It's just ten seconds.

866
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,410
Getting two in ten seconds...

867
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,710
Let's put them close by.

868
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,780
- To one side...
- Like this.

869
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,750
Okay. This is too big.

870
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,050
Shall we stick to the small ones?

871
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,820
- The small ones might be better.
- The small ones...

872
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,590
- Hurry up!
- The small ones...

873
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,790
(Paying for urging the other team)

874
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,590
- Come on.
- Let's play already.

875
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,090
- We just got started.
- Hurry up!

876
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,490
We're working fast.

877
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,460
- It's "Milkshake."
- Yes.

878
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,460
- It's "Milkshake."
- It's "Milkshake."

879
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,470
(Helping promote their song)

880
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,630
Move faster.

881
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,040
Shall we use a smaller one?

882
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,940
- A small one...
- Hang on. About here?

883
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,210
(Glancing)

884
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,110
- About here?
- I feel sleepy.

885
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,010
- How long will it take?
- Go to sleep!

886
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,840
- It's boring.
- I'm so sleepy.

887
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,950
- Hurry up.
- They'll change channels.

888
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,080
(Their patience is very lopsided.)

889
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,350
- Let's aim for getting close.
- We're done.

890
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,380
- We grouped them.
- You're done.

891
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,390
- We grouped them.
- We'll play the clip.

892
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,490
Let's go!

893
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,120
(Will they exceed 2 points?)

894
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,160
And play.

895
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,190
- None.
- Oh, dear!

896
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,660
- There are none.
- None.

897
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,960
(Flustered)

898
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,200
Hey, what...

899
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,400
(Sounding pleased)

900
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,700
(Just then)

901
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,870
- One!
- One!

902
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,670
(Wait, what?)

903
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,700
- One.
- One.

904
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,740
What? Hey.

905
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,440
- One!
- One!

906
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,940
- Two! On the left.
- Two.

907
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,010
- Three!
- Three!

908
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,180
(With the excellent
location choice,)

909
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,450
(they gain 3 points in no time.)

910
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,580
- Three.
- Zoom in.

911
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,620
- Zoom in.
- Zoom in.

912
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,750
- Four!
- No.

913
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,050
- No.
- Go a little more.

914
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,320
(Will they get 4 points
just like this?)

915
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,260
(Slightly off)

916
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,060
- Okay, three.
- Three.

917
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,160
Hey, but...

918
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,830
The third has an advantage.

919
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,900
- No, we grouped them.
- It was...

920
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,030
We grouped them.

921
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,170
- How could they all be in a row?
- I mean...

922
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,930
What was this?

923
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,870
- Hey, it was like Dali.
- It was all in a row.

924
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,070
- But...
- Wasn't that too much?

925
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,440
you decided the order too.

926
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,670
- Of course.
- Are you serious?

927
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,310
- All right. Us.
- It was pure luck.

928
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,210
- We will continue with this as is.
- Continue as is.

929
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,380
- As is?
- Us.

930
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,780
(Play it right away,
just like this?)

931
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,850
- You can't.
- As is?

932
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,680
- Then, we'll start.
- Try it as is. You never know.

933
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,850
- Let's start like this.
- Right.

934
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,590
(This spot had 3 points earlier.
What will happen this time?)

935
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,460
Oh, dear.

936
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,360
(It is in an advantageous spot.)

937
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,490
- No, this isn't it.
- One!

938
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,690
(Will they be able to get
over 3 points?)

939
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,730
- One!
- One!

940
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,300
- Two!
- No.

941
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,570
- This isn't it.
- Is this right?

942
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,700
- Two of them...
- That's not it.

943
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,900
- It's not right.
- This isn't it.

944
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,540
(If it ends like this, they'll play
against Team Seok Jin again.)

945
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,640
(They'll tie with Team Jae Seok
if they get 1 more.)

946
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,810
No, this isn't it.

947
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,240
(Turning around swiftly)

948
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,410
(Please)

949
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,380
- One more.
- Three!

950
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,550
(Success, failure)

951
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,250
- Three!
- We're in big trouble.

952
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,950
Here it comes.

953
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,560
- Four.
- No.

954
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,460
That's not right.
You have to be exact.

955
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,760
- Three points.
- Three!

956
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,490
They did get three.

957
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,800
- They got three points.
- Nice.

958
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,430
So,
the 1st and 2nd place teams are...

959
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,530
Team Jae Seok and Team Haha.

960
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,970
And the 3rd
and 4th place teams are...

961
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,900
- Team Seok Jin and Team Jong Kook.
- Okay.

962
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,540
- The first place teams...
- That was great.

963
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,510
Gosh, I trusted you as an actor.

964
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,340
Man, why did this happen?

965
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,810
(Actor Choi's team ended up
in last place.)

966
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,910
The first place teams are tied.

967
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,050
For each person,
you will get five extra ice balls.

968
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,050
That's a lot.

969
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,690
- Five ice balls each.
- They're giving those to everyone?

970
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,790
- That's a lot.
- Also,

971
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,560
three balls
for the third place team.

972
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,760
- If they get 3...
- And for the 4th place team,

973
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,190
- you will each get 2.
- Oh, we still get 2?

974
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,290
- I'm grateful to get two.
- That's not too bad.

975
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,830
- I'm grateful for that.
- The 3rd and 4th place teams...

976
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,330
will take their ice balls first...

977
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,400
- All right.
- and go to hide them.

978
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,570
Please give them the ice balls.

979
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,730
- The 3rd and 4th teams go 1st?
- Yes, give us the ice balls.

980
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,040
- That was amazing.
- My gosh.

981
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,500
- I'm sure...
- Where do we hide these?

982
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,940
- Gosh, I'm sure...
- There's nowhere to hide them.

983
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,210
Goodness, it's not easy
to find a spot to hide these.

984
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,710
(The key is to hide the ice balls
so that they don't melt.)

985
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,850
Hey, what do I do with these?

986
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,850
Where should I hide these?
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

987
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,420
(The older guys moved indoors
where it's cooler.)

988
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,720
See if someone is coming or not.

989
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,750
See if anyone is coming.

990
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,950
They're not coming?

991
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,320
Gosh, this is perfect.

992
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,460
Yes, this place is really safe.

993
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,890
Nowhere else is as safe as this one.

994
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,990
(Ddochi finds shade and hides it
unlike usual too.)

995
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,000
There. That's perfect.

996
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,500
(Niel, who was digging the ground,)

997
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,470
(chooses somewhere without sunlight
this time as well.)

998
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,800
There. You can't see it.

999
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,140
- You can go outside now.
- Shall we, then?

1000
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,610
Ye Eun and Seok Jin's...

1001
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,180
- will be found soon.
- Seriously, so easy.

1002
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,910
As we hide ours, we end up
finding those hidden before.

1003
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,310
I'll smash them all.

1004
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,150
We can find the others' ice balls
really soon.

1005
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,950
I'm sure everyone is thinking about
somewhere indoors.

1006
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,890
(Ji Hyo spied on Daniel
during the first search.)

1007
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,390
It's here, right?

1008
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,460
(Ji Hyo spied on Daniel
during the first search.)

1009
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,530
(She spots Niel's ball.)

1010
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,230
(She takes it out right away...)

1011
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,230
(and smashes it!)

1012
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,940
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok comes into
the indoor playroom.)

1013
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,040
(He hides 6 ice balls
inside the block castle.)

1014
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,510
Gosh, I feel anxious about this too.

1015
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,950
(Haha chooses
the indoor storage room too.)

1016
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,810
I'm going to leave it somewhere
that's bothersome.

1017
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,580
(The hiding experts choose someplace cool
but also safe.)

1018
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,420
(In the meantime, Se Chan
comes out to the outdoor garden.)

1019
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,220
It should be all right
to hide them here.

1020
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,090
I should hide them.

1021
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,390
(I should hide them.)

1022
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,530
Hey, this is nice.

1023
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,960
(Is he hiding them in the garden
just like that?)

1024
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,460
It's protective coloring right here.

1025
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,970
(He hides a whopping 8 balls
in the shaded area.)

1026
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,270
You can't see them now.

1027
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,640
(He hides a whopping 8 balls
in the shaded area.)

1028
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,170
(Will this shade still be the same
after 2 hours?)

1029
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,570
Hey, I hid them really well.

1030
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,770
He has no idea.

1031
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,510
Hey, let's keep going until the end.

1032
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,880
- Let's gather in the mission spot.
- Shall we go?

1033
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,080
- It's time for food.
- Okay.

1034
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,680
Gosh, it's really hot.

1035
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,880
I'm worried I won't have any left...

1036
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,150
- to bet with later on.
- I think I'll have plenty.

1037
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,550
But I think they'll all be melted
in this weather.

1038
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,350
- In this weather, I'm sure.
- Right?

1039
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,890
I want to have some soybean noodles.

1040
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,090
I want naengmyeon.

1041
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,860
- I want naengmyeon.
- I'm hungry.

1042
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,330
- Or makguksu.
<i>- Naengmyeon</i>

1043
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,830
- It would be nice and cold.
<i>- Naengmyeon</i>

1044
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,130
By the way, Ye Eun,

1045
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,900
you're talking a lot again
since it's mealtime.

1046
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,470
(Wiggling)

1047
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,440
She looks like a tadpole.

1048
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,310
(She lost her double chin
and went back to looking like a tadpole.)

1049
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,070
- She looks like a tadpole.
- Gosh, Ye Eun.

1050
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,410
You're a good dancer.

1051
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,780
Milk... It's like this, right?

1052
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,180
You will get your ice balls...

1053
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,880
- according to your scores.
- Yes.

1054
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,350
But you will also...

1055
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,520
have to pay for your lunch...

1056
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,020
- with ice balls.
- Oh, dear.

1057
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,260
So, those of you
who won extra ice balls just now...

1058
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,890
- can spend that amount.
- We can eat.

1059
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,430
Those of you who didn't win extra
must go outside...

1060
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,060
- and find your ice balls and pay.
- They have to bring them back.

1061
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,930
- Or you could use someone else's.
- Oh, they could do that too.

1062
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,470
- Even someone else's ice ball?
- Yes.

1063
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,370
Could we see how much
the dishes cost?

1064
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
- What will they be serving?
- On today's menu,

1065
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,110
we have frozen pork belly.

1066
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,570
Hey, that costs three ice balls.
We could share that.

1067
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,440
Let's share.

1068
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,840
The frozen pork belly...

1069
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,110
- costs 3 balls for 200g.
- For 200g.

1070
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,410
- Hey, that's expensive.
- Ice balls...

1071
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,620
Hey, that sounds delicious.

1072
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,250
- Two ice balls for a boxed lunch.
- What?

1073
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,090
- I'll have the boxed lunch.
- I should have the boxed lunch.

1074
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,050
- Two ice balls for cup noodles.
- I'll have the cup noodles.

1075
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,690
The cup noodles are so expensive.

1076
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,090
But if we share,

1077
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,530
- we can have a big meal.
- That's right.

1078
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,860
Then, do we get rice
with the pork belly?

1079
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,300
Will you give us a bowl of rice?

1080
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,130
Rice costs one ice ball.

1081
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,170
- Then, the boxed lunch...
- In that case,

1082
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,740
- we could gather some...
- I'll just have...

1083
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,040
Does anyone want to share
pork belly with me?

1084
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,870
- Let's eat pork belly together.
- Let's share.

1085
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:10,970
Yes, that sounds good.

1086
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,810
Jae Seok, let's order
two servings of pork belly...

1087
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,540
- and one cup noodles.
- We have to have that.

1088
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,580
- I should have the boxed lunch.
- Everyone must be happy.

1089
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,050
- What?
- You must all be happy.

1090
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,120
Oh, yes.

1091
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,520
- Well, you are...
- Oh, with these?

1092
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,550
- Let's see.
- I'm going to have to eat.

1093
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,090
- Is it really in there?
- I have one.

1094
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,760
- Oh, it's in there.
- But it melted quite a lot.

1095
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,390
Then, this one...

1096
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,530
The bowl of rice... No.

1097
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,560
(Rummaging)

1098
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,260
- With this...
- First of all...

1099
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,270
Gosh, what's that?

1100
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,270
(It has completely melted already?)

1101
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,400
First of all,

1102
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,410
- we'll measure the diameter.
- The diameter? Sure.

1103
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,140
Could you measure it quickly?

1104
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,610
It's kind of...

1105
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,740
- Isn't this kind of...
- It's on the brink.

1106
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,450
It looks like something
after you take vitamins.

1107
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,310
It is on the brink, but 3cm...

1108
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,150
I think I could have a boxed lunch.

1109
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,580
- Oh, that looks like it's enough.
- Yes.

1110
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,820
(Will it actually be useful?)

1111
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,220
But 3cm...

1112
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,320
(Will it actually be useful?)

1113
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,090
Yes, it's over 3cm.

1114
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,190
It is, right?

1115
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,330
Yes, let's eat lunch.

1116
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,930
Even if I keep this...

1117
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,030
(He used it at the right timing
before it melted even more.)

1118
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,200
It's good.

1119
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,470
I'm having the boxed lunch.

1120
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,730
The boxed lunch?

1121
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,970
Yes, I'll have the boxed lunch.

1122
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,570
Then, I'll go around smashing
other people's ice balls...

1123
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,670
after I eat fast.

1124
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,410
I'm going to order cup noodles.

1125
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,470
I have to go and get some ice.

1126
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,510
- Can I go and get them?
- Yes.

1127
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,610
(Ji Hyo sets off to find
the ice balls hidden outside.)

1128
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,840
Hang on. Mine is...

1129
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,680
I think they've all melted.

1130
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,750
- A boxed lunch.
- One boxed lunch.

1131
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,080
I'll also have a boxed lunch.

1132
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,720
We can order a bit later too, right?

1133
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,790
- Yes.
- Oh, okay.

1134
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,120
I'll have one order of pork belly.

1135
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,220
I'll have pork belly...

1136
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,590
- The pork belly.
- I'll take pork belly.

1137
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,360
- And cup noodles.
- And...

1138
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,890
And a boxed lunch?

1139
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,300
We should have a boxed lunch.

1140
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,100
- A boxed lunch.
- Indeed, it's nice to be rich.

1141
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,670
Like that. One. We'll take those.

1142
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,800
- I'm jealous.
- Let's go.

1143
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,640
- Do you want to share cup noodles?
- Shall we?

1144
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,110
- How many do you have?
- I have four.

1145
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,570
Pork belly, cup noodles,
and a boxed lunch.

1146
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,610
Shall we share those?

1147
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,540
Does that sound good?
Okay, let's do that.

1148
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,910
Gosh, that must be nice.

1149
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,450
- We'll really share, right?
- For real.

1150
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,580
We're going to order together.

1151
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,080
These are for the pork belly.

1152
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,650
Cup noodles and a boxed lunch.

1153
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,290
(They use up all of their ice balls
from the mission.)

1154
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,120
- Daniel, sit next to me.
- Okay, I'll come over there.

1155
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,390
Seok Jin, I'm sorry,
but we have to share.

1156
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,590
- I'm sharing too.
- I'll move over.

1157
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,100
- My gosh, seriously?
- Scoot over.

1158
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,200
Okay. My goodness.

1159
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,130
- Don't you think?
- Hey, the boxed lunch is awesome!

1160
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,270
My gosh.

1161
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,800
- Hey, the boxed lunch.
- Hey.

1162
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,510
- That's really nice.
- It looks good.

1163
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,240
The boxed meal is the best.

1164
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,680
- I should put this here.
- My goodness. This is...

1165
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,280
Gosh, they even have fish here.

1166
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,980
Oh, pork belly.

1167
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,520
Nice.

1168
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,920
Seriously, though, boxed meals
have gotten so much nicer.

1169
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,190
They're not the boxed lunches
we used to have in the past.

1170
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,360
Hey, could you move this?

1171
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,860
- This is the VIP section.
- Hey, mister.

1172
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,830
- I have to put my food here.
- This is for VIPs.

1173
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,430
I mean, we have to eat too.

1174
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,360
I know. Pay for the space, then.

1175
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,130
- But we're VIPs.
- Two pieces of pork belly.

1176
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,170
Thank you.

1177
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,230
- This is really in my way.
- Let's share it like this.

1178
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,870
Okay, Jae Seok.
I'll use this as a plate.

1179
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,970
- This can be my plate.
- Hey, that's a lot of food.

1180
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,340
How can 200g be so much?

1181
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,640
I can't believe it!

1182
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,980
They have good business ethics.

1183
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,080
That's so much.

1184
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,480
- That's good for 200g.
- Is that it?

1185
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,250
How much is that?

1186
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,250
Hey, look at this meat.

1187
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,450
(Frozen pork belly is delivered
to both sides of Seok Sam.)

1188
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,250
- Does Ji Hyo have any?
- By the way, Ji Hyo...

1189
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,950
- Ji Hyo.
- Hey, did you find some?

1190
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,250
- There aren't any, are there?
- Ji Hyo.

1191
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,560
I found some.

1192
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,790
- Thank you for the food.
- There were some out there?

1193
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,390
I'll have pork belly.

1194
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,290
The boxed lunch is nice.

1195
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,890
Ji Hyo, are those mine?

1196
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,560
Ji Hyo has a different color.

1197
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,830
- What? They're different colors.
- My gosh.

1198
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,070
- They look like light green.
- Red.

1199
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,070
Light green?
Then, they're not mine, are they?

1200
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,400
Hey, the light green ones are mine!

1201
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,500
She has yellow ones too.

1202
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,440
- The green ones are mine.
- Hey, where did you find...

1203
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,310
- Aren't those Daniel's?
- The green ones are mine.

1204
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,880
(Daniel's ice ball)

1205
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,340
I think they've all melted.

1206
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,380
(Ji Hyo comes outside to find
the ice balls.)

1207
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,850
I can find other ones
and not use mine, right?

1208
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,790
Earlier,
Niel was over here somewhere.

1209
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,760
No way.
Is this supposed to be camouflage?

1210
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,090
The grass has been ripped out.

1211
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,760
Oh, my.

1212
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,060
(Ji Hyo finds
Running Man newbie Niel's ball.)

1213
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,100
Gosh, I can't believe this.

1214
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,370
Then, I won't have to take mine.
There are three.

1215
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,570
- Wait, what color are they?
- What color are they?

1216
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,040
- I see green ones.
- Where did she find them?

1217
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,170
- Are they green or light green?
- Hey.

1218
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,370
- Green...
- Hey, Ji Hyo.

1219
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,910
What?
Ji Hyo, are you having pork belly?

1220
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,340
Did you just use someone else's...

1221
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,340
No way, Song Ji Hyo.

1222
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,380
- Haha, let's eat our fill too.
- That's impressive.

1223
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,610
- Ji Hyo, enjoy your meal.
- I mean...

1224
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,420
I hope
you enjoy your meal too, Niel.

1225
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,420
(Feeling bitter, slightly sorry)

1226
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,650
This looks delicious.

1227
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,720
Gosh, the pork belly.

1228
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,490
Goodness,
I haven't had pork belly in a while.

1229
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,920
Pork belly is the best
during summer.

1230
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,590
- The pork belly...
- This is so good.

1231
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,000
(Devouring)

1232
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,470
- The meat tastes so good.
- It's really good.

1233
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,030
Gosh, this is incredible.

1234
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,840
(The pork belly barbecue party
gives off summer picnic vibes.)

1235
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,140
When we eat together,
nothing beats pork belly.

1236
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,200
Absolutely.

1237
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:36,970
How is it? Is it good?

1238
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,810
(That...)

1239
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,080
- Have your fill.
- We don't have stir-fried pork.

1240
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,650
- Got it.
- It's so good.

1241
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,310
- Yes, have that. There's more here.
- Dig in.

1242
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,410
There's more over here.

1243
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,550
(Dipsy also has
some frozen pork belly.)

1244
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,890
I'd love some milkshake
after we eat this.

1245
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,420
- Same here.
- My gosh.

1246
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,360
I haven't had this in a while,
so it tastes even better.

1247
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,320
Gosh, the pork belly.

1248
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,690
It's good.

1249
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,030
- No way.
- Thank you.

1250
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,560
Lunchboxes are really worth
your money these days.

1251
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,130
They even give you meat.

1252
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,770
(Mr. Pink is obsessed
with the lunchbox.)

1253
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,170
The pork belly is so good.

1254
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,840
This is incredible.

1255
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,870
(And...)

1256
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,410
Can't Seok Jin have any meat?

1257
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,540
- This is so good.
- It's really good.

1258
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,550
(Seok Sam can't take his eyes
off the meat.)

1259
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,680
You're all having meat.

1260
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,910
We're flexing.

1261
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,520
(Sharing ramyeon)

1262
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,280
Look at you sharing.

1263
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,960
(Blowing)

1264
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,830
(They first torture him
with pork belly,)

1265
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,290
(and now with ramyeon.)

1266
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,530
- It's really good.
- This is so good.

1267
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,660
(Slurping noodles from both sides)

1268
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,900
The ramyeon is so good.

1269
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,900
This is so good!

1270
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,930
(Drooling)

1271
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,540
So much for loyalty.

1272
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,710
I'm the one
who produced "Milkshake."

1273
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,840
- Sure.
- Right?

1274
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,940
- So?
- She said, "So?"

1275
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,980
(It's clear there's some conflict
between Chungju Ji and Jee.)

1276
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,580
Why are you eating
the pork belly here?

1277
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,020
- What?
- This is right in front of me.

1278
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,350
Where else can we take this?

1279
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,120
- Why do you...
- I have the worst seat.

1280
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,120
(The hungry Jee-rasoni
is picking fights with everyone.)

1281
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,560
(Placing on the griddle)

1282
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,490
(Grilling deep-fried shrimps)

1283
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,000
- Is this allowed?
- How did you find them?

1284
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,760
You can't grill yours on this.

1285
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,100
Why not?

1286
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,070
- At least let me have that.
- No, this isn't allowed.

1287
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,240
This griddle is ours.

1288
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,100
- Go somewhere else, then.
- Take those off.

1289
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,910
The griddle is right in front of me.

1290
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,740
You're helping yourself
to our pork oil.

1291
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,680
(Subtly)

1292
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,410
- Stop it.
- Come on.

1293
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,250
Why are you heating up your bulgogi?

1294
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,220
Mister,
what do you think you're doing?

1295
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,350
They're cold, that's all.

1296
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,320
Can't you let a friend
have a warm meal?

1297
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,690
You keep taking up more space.

1298
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,220
You're pushing our meat
out of the way.

1299
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,560
I won't cross that line.

1300
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,860
I'll stay within my zone.

1301
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,160
This is better cooked.

1302
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,560
I should cook these on that.

1303
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,130
Sorry about this,
but this tastes better cooked.

1304
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,230
Give me a little space.

1305
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,700
It's so much better when heated up.

1306
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:50,610
(Sneaky)

1307
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,050
(Trembling)

1308
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,420
Why are you...

1309
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,950
wrapping meat with bulgogi?

1310
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,520
- Who did that?
- You, mister.

1311
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,260
Where's your proof?

1312
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,920
(They let him use the griddle,
but he stole their meat.)

1313
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,630
(Placing dried laver)

1314
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,960
Mister, why are you toasting
dried laver on this?

1315
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,600
Let me use some of your pork oil.

1316
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,130
Are you kidding me?

1317
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,170
The aroma of the pork is so good.

1318
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,140
He's frugal. He leads a frugal life.

1319
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,210
Tell me about it.

1320
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,570
Old people are just wired
differently.

1321
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,580
Goodness.

1322
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,040
(Stealing another piece)

1323
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,710
(In a hurry)

1324
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,480
Mister, come on.

1325
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,350
(So hot!)

1326
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,190
Don't eat uncooked meat.

1327
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,790
Just have what's cooked.

1328
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,260
You'll get sick at the rate.

1329
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,590
- It's cooked enough.
- Your butt will be itching.

1330
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:47,400
This is so annoying.

1331
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,900
Seok Jin, here you go.

1332
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,930
We need to do our best
to get the questions right.

1333
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,370
- Thank you.
- Of course.

1334
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,370
(Take your time with that.)

1335
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:00,080
(The single piece of pork belly
melts his heart.)

1336
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,180
(Chuckling)

1337
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,180
Seok Jin.

1338
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,880
- Have some.
- Really?

1339
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,120
Yes, but only some.

1340
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,220
- Thanks.
- Go ahead.

1341
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,760
(A well-raised Food Fighter
is worth more than ten sons.)

1342
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,060
Look at that.

1343
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,360
Ye Eun looks after him
like she would her own dad.

1344
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:17,660
I feel bad for him.

1345
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,030
- Right?
- I'm close to being in tears.

1346
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,060
- It looks that way.
- Right.

1347
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,430
Seok Jin had his fill.

1348
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,670
You know what?
I at least need coffee.

1349
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,900
Do you have enough ice balls?

1350
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,740
- What?
- He'll pay with others' balls.

1351
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,040
- With others' balls?
- Yes.

1352
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,370
No, they don't belong to others.

1353
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,140
He's not skipping out on anything...

1354
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,740
- even though he doesn't have much.
- He's making it work.

1355
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,680
Normally, you don't have as much
if you don't have money to spend.

1356
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,950
- By the way, did you move?
- What?

1357
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,280
- Did you move?
- Not yet.

1358
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,350
- I've been packing.
- Have a housewarming party.

1359
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:44,390
I had to pack all night
and didn't get enough sleep.

1360
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,120
Once I was in the zone,
I couldn't stop.

1361
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,490
The plastic bags will blow away,
so call for a moving truck.

1362
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,230
- I was about to talk about this.
- Sure.

1363
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:53,330
I ran out of plastic bags
to use during the move.

1364
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,830
I ran out.

1365
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:58,500
I meant to tell you,
but I kept forgetting.

1366
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,770
- How can you run out?
- That's not possible.

1367
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:02,000
I had to bring
the plastic bags back...

1368
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,610
after taking out the recyclables.

1369
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:05,410
Why do you need so many
for the move?

1370
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,780
I need them for recyclables.

1371
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,140
Everything should go in boxes.

1372
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,710
There's a lot of trash to deal with!

1373
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,380
Don't moving companies
take care of that?

1374
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,880
- There are designated trash bags.
- I'm doing it myself.

1375
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,290
I'm packing it all up myself
and sorting things out.

1376
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,450
Didn't you hire a moving company?

1377
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,720
- Maybe a truck...
- I didn't hire one.

1378
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,590
- What?
- I'm not going to hire one.

1379
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,830
- You'll move them by yourself?
- Jong Kook, you can't.

1380
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:26,160
Are you telling me
you'll haul your fridge...

1381
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,430
out of your apartment?

1382
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:28,960
- Ma Sun Ho and...
- I'm going to call everyone...

1383
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,230
including Ma Sun Ho.

1384
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,530
- I can't believe it.
- That's a creative content.

1385
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,940
I feel guilty calling them though...

1386
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,410
because I'm moving to a unit
just across from where I live.

1387
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:38,870
Just hire a moving company.
You should.

1388
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,110
This is something you need
to spend money on.

1389
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,610
You're not paying
for their strength...

1390
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:42,680
but for their experience.

1391
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,850
I may be broke,
but I'm still getting coffee.

1392
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,120
(Seok Sam is out to find balls
that could pay for his coffee.)

1393
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,350
I'll spend someone else's.

1394
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,420
Earlier, Ye Eun...

1395
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,120
Isn't it here?

1396
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,660
(The best time to hunt
since no one's here to stop him)

1397
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,720
There's nothing here.

1398
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,060
(The best time to hunt
since no one's here to stop him)

1399
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,160
Darn. It'd be great to find
someone else's ice balls.

1400
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,700
Shoot.

1401
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,460
I want to pay with someone else's.

1402
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,900
With someone else's.

1403
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,540
Where did they hide theirs?

1404
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,140
(Searching hard)

1405
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,770
There's nothing here.

1406
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,170
(He checks every corner
but finds nothing.)

1407
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,570
I should get a cup of coffee.

1408
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,310
Stay there. Film from a distance.

1409
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,950
Stay there. Don't come here.

1410
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,110
(He finally finds an ice ball.)

1411
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,920
Let's go and get my coffee.

1412
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,120
(A yellow ball?)

1413
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,450
I really need my coffee.

1414
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,920
Coffee... Okay, I'm good.

1415
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,760
What can I do
but spend my own ice ball?

1416
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,060
- What on earth?
- I couldn't find yours.

1417
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,100
I'm going to have to spend mine.

1418
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,800
- Seok Jin!
- I'd like a cup of coffee.

1419
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,200
- Isn't that a marble?
- We'll get you your coffee.

1420
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,040
- Are you back already?
- What?

1421
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,370
I couldn't find yours,
so I brought one of mine.

1422
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,140
You amaze me, Seok Jin.

1423
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,540
I should at least get some coffee.

1424
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,910
(The dad only wasted his energy.)

1425
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,880
(Freshly brewed coffee
was delivered.)

1426
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,410
- Really?
- Gosh, thank you.

1427
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,120
Hey! Don't you dare.

1428
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,720
(Like that, everyone enjoyed
their meal and rested.)

1429
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,020
Choosing who to bet on
won't be easy.

1430
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,720
I have a feeling
I'll lose all my balls.

1431
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,820
- You'll now get five minutes.
- Five minutes?

1432
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,930
Please get your ice balls
and meet us back here.

1433
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,200
(The ice balls that were found...)

1434
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,570
(were shattered without a trace.)

1435
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,570
(The hidden ice balls
have been melting.)

1436
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,410
(How many of their ice balls
will they be able to retrieve?)

1437
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:17,740
This is bad.

1438
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,840
Do we have to bring them now?

1439
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,180
We need to find our own too.

1440
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,180
Do we get ours?

1441
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,180
This won't be easy.

1442
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,010
(Jae Seok hid
a whopping 28 ice balls.)

1443
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,120
(He goes to the first location.)

1444
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,250
Someone opened this.

1445
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:33,320
(First location: Inside the vacuum
where he hid 12 balls)

1446
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,290
(He checks where he left them.)

1447
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,290
Someone opened it.

1448
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:37,730
Wait, they're here.

1449
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,190
(He retrieves all 12 ice balls.)

1450
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,930
No way. This much
will be more than enough.

1451
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,200
Right here. This is the place.

1452
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:48,070
(Second location:
The playroom where he hid 6 balls)

1453
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,240
They're still here!

1454
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,610
My gosh. They were here.

1455
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:53,840
I can't believe they're still here.

1456
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,840
(Jae Seok retrieves his ice balls
from exactly where he hid them.)

1457
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,880
What?

1458
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,580
What the...

1459
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,420
(Third location: The camera crane case
where he hid 2)

1460
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,680
Where did
the Jimmy Jib director go?

1461
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,250
(The camera crane case is gone.)

1462
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,390
I can't believe he took it.

1463
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,890
Wait. Hold on. The Jimmy Jib...

1464
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,130
(Flustered)

1465
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,260
Sir!

1466
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,030
Where's the case that was here?

1467
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,070
(Here)

1468
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,130
Over there.

1469
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:21,700
(A secret unknown
to the owner of the case)

1470
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:22,800
It's here.

1471
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,310
I almost lost it.

1472
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:25,310
I had no idea.

1473
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,540
(He was able to locate the case.
Are the ice balls still inside?)

1474
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,680
Right here.

1475
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,280
They're here.

1476
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,480
(Yes!)

1477
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,680
I have two left.

1478
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,720
(He left 2 and found 2.)

1479
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:37,590
They're here.

1480
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,190
(He retrieved his ice balls
even at the last location.)

1481
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:40,660
I managed to get all of mine.

1482
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,020
(Jae Seok retrieved
his ice balls...)

1483
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,390
(from exactly
where he had hidden them!)

1484
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:44,460
These...

1485
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,030
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook is
at the restaurant.)

1486
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,870
(The place where the members
probably came and went the most)

1487
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:53,140
(Are they still there?)

1488
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:55,740
(Exclaiming)

1489
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,110
(It's there.)

1490
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,110
Thankfully, no one found them.

1491
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,040
Look.

1492
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,780
(Ice resting on the crossbeam
in plain view)

1493
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,050
Can you see it?
These could be easily seen.

1494
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,850
(No one dared to touch them, and
they are right where he left them.)

1495
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,320
I'm sure they melted a lot.

1496
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,320
Please, I'm counting on these.

1497
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,450
(Seok Sam has fewer ice balls.)

1498
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:12,820
Please.

1499
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,830
(He hid 10 of them in the van.)

1500
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,790
Okay!

1501
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,430
(They're as he left them!)

1502
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:22,160
Okay!

1503
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,930
I wasn't very hopeful about this.

1504
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:26,470
No way.

1505
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,140
(Fortunately, Seok Sam
managed to protect 10!)

1506
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,110
(Haha who hid them inside a box)

1507
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,310
There.

1508
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:33,380
They're here.

1509
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,510
(He retrieved a lot
of his ice balls.)

1510
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,710
Nice. Of course.

1511
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,010
(The 4 brainiacs hid them well
and retrieved them easily.)

1512
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,650
This was the way.

1513
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,750
Hold on. Do you remember
where you put them?

1514
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:43,950
I can't remember.

1515
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,190
I don't remember myself.

1516
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,320
Did I put them here?

1517
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,560
Where did I hide mine?

1518
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,120
Right. I put them here.

1519
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,790
These probably melted for sure.

1520
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,160
What?

1521
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,500
I know I hid them here.

1522
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,500
(He never hid them here.)

1523
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,600
Where did I put mine?

1524
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:59,870
Hold on. Is it here?

1525
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,500
Did I leave all of them over there?

1526
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,810
They're here.

1527
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,980
Wait. I found them.

1528
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,340
(He hid 22 ice balls,
but only found 4.)

1529
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,580
Were there more?

1530
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,450
Are those all I had?

1531
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:14,850
(He can't find them because
he forgot where he hid them.)

1532
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:15,950
I don't remember.

1533
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,620
Why can't I remember?

1534
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,320
Oh, no. Is this area exposed
to the sun now?

1535
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:21,420
I'm doomed.

1536
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,460
(Under the blazing sun)

1537
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,990
(The plants camouflaged
his ice balls.)

1538
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:28,600
Hey, they've totally melted.
It's supposed to be over 3cm, right?

1539
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,670
It became this small.
Will this be usable?

1540
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:33,640
Darn it!

1541
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,140
(Se Chan's ice balls
have become seeds.)

1542
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,810
How could there be sun here?

1543
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,440
Didn't I hide eight of them here?

1544
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,910
Gosh, they're all gone.

1545
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:41,910
(All 8 of them disappeared.)

1546
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,610
Oh, it must've melted.

1547
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:44,650
(And, Ddochi's masterpiece)

1548
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:45,810
Why? Did you have more there?

1549
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:48,620
(The stone-grilled ice balls)

1550
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,120
Oh, there's no hope.

1551
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,120
(They have returned to nature.)

1552
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,490
Oh, my. They've melted.

1553
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:58,690
(The ice balls
that she cleverly buried...)

1554
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:02,500
No, they can't have melted.
Gosh, they're really all...

1555
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,170
(Natural dyes used for ice balls,
Harmless to humans or the environment)

1556
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:06,400
It melted here. And here too.

1557
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,170
This one has definitely melted.

1558
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,510
(Will she even be able to
participate in the quiz betting?)

1559
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:11,610
They've all melted.

1560
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,770
(Will she even be able to
participate in the quiz betting?)

1561
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,740
(And the elder sister who hid
a bunch in the backyard...)

1562
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,780
Oh, my.

1563
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,380
Oh, my. I can't use them.

1564
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,950
Did I originally have 2?
Did I have 4?

1565
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:24,490
We won't tell you.

1566
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:25,850
(She buried 4 cases
but only checked 3 of them.)

1567
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:27,290
Why can't I remember?

1568
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,390
My gosh. Hey, Ji Hyo is over there.

1569
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,600
Ji Hyo... Should I look at
other people's ice balls now?

1570
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,930
(Seok Sam found all of his own.
He sets off to steal Ji Hyo's.)

1571
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,570
Oh, here. What's this?

1572
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,230
Oh, they're all melted.

1573
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:42,240
They're all melted. Shoot.

1574
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,610
Oh, here. What's this?
Are they in there or not?

1575
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,510
Gosh, are you okay?

1576
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:50,550
Darn it.

1577
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,910
(Sighing)

1578
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,110
I'm okay, thankfully.

1579
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,720
- Are you okay?
- This is embarrassing.

1580
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:01,320
I'm okay, but I must've been
in a rush after seeing this.

1581
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,390
I'm okay,
but this is so embarrassing.

1582
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:06,260
(The humiliation rushes in.)

1583
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:11,130
Did you see how I didn't let go
of this just now?

1584
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:12,500
This shouldn't be that important.

1585
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:15,000
I cherished it...

1586
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,140
(Holding it tight)

1587
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,740
I can't believe
what has become of me.

1588
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,180
All of my friends are like CEOs,

1589
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,850
and some are even chairmen.

1590
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,680
I'm so mad
that I didn't let go of this.

1591
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,780
(He looks back on his life
on the stone-laden ground.)

1592
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,350
This bag of ice...

1593
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,720
Well, anyway...

1594
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,220
Gosh, after I saw this, I was...

1595
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,760
I think
there's something inside here.

1596
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:40,030
Shall I take a look?
Is this really Ji Hyo's?

1597
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,030
Gosh, they've all melted.

1598
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,970
Did I just fall over
because of this?

1599
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:48,600
(Today, they're only competing
within their groups.)

1600
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,800
I'm so embarrassed.

1601
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,810
(Therefore, Seok Jin and Ji Hyo
are not competitors.)

1602
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,410
In a way, I'm relieved.

1603
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:55,510
I didn't hurt myself at all.

1604
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,510
(So brave)

1605
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,050
- That's five minutes. Let's go.
- Okay.

1606
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,880
I could've gone over it like this.
Wait. Why did I fall?

1607
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,950
Soo Wan, this isn't something
I should be tripping over.

1608
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,090
Look, it's this high.

1609
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:11,130
Why did I fall? I was too excited
after seeing that down there.

1610
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:12,630
Gosh, I'm embarrassed. Oh, my.

1611
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,800
The important thing was to hide them
in a way that they wouldn't melt.

1612
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,070
They're usable if they're 3cm?
You have to measure mine soon.

1613
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,800
- Oh, mine have melted a lot too.
- My gosh.

1614
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,440
I'm not sure
if this will be big enough.

1615
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,240
- They have to be 3cm, right?
- Yes, this is 3cm.

1616
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,040
Okay. That's good, right?

1617
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,740
(They start measuring each one.)

1618
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:32,050
That's good, right? I'm good.

1619
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,820
(Laughing)

1620
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:36,020
Look at this one.

1621
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,220
(After measuring them
down to 1mm...)

1622
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,720
- It's not big enough, right?
- This one is out.

1623
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,820
(After measuring them
down to 1mm...)

1624
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:42,060
- You have so many.
- Yes, all of mine survived.

1625
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:45,260
Hey, you have so many here.
You could've let mine pass too.

1626
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,960
- Does Ye Eun only have 3?
- You have 3?

1627
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:48,960
Hey, how could you only have three?

1628
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,630
- Hey, Ye Eun.
- Okay!

1629
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,030
How did everyone hide them so well?

1630
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:54,140
- You have so many.
- Let's go.

1631
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,840
All right. We'll get started now.

1632
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,440
- Yes.
- The quiz competition...

1633
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,010
to see who's the top Empty Head.

1634
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,340
(Empty Head Quiz:
Battle of the Last Place)

1635
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,080
You can't lose this title.

1636
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,280
- It's a good title.
- Nice!

1637
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,010
- It's a good title.
- Nice!

1638
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:07,020
You know, I'm upset right now.

1639
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,420
Why am I here?

1640
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,620
Hey, from what I've seen,
you should be there.

1641
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,850
We'll have two rounds in total.

1642
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:15,490
In Round 1,
there will be 2 questions...

1643
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:17,830
in each category you're confident in,
so that's eight questions total.

1644
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,690
- Good.
- In Round Two,

1645
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,830
there will be questions from
categories prepared by the staff.

1646
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:24,630
For the members
who will solve the questions,

1647
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,900
you'll find out the categories first
before hearing the questions.

1648
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,600
You'll find out
the categories first.

1649
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,970
After you hear the categories
and feel confident,

1650
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:34,180
you can bet your ice balls by
putting them in front of yourself.

1651
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,510
- I'll bet them all on myself.
- If you answer incorrectly,

1652
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:39,010
- you'll lose the ice balls you bet.
- Yes, of course.

1653
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,480
If you answer correctly
without betting,

1654
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,320
you'll win one ice ball.

1655
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,520
- Only one?
- Yes.

1656
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,720
If you answer correctly,
you win double your bet.

1657
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,720
- Okay.
- Oh, okay.

1658
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,030
- Okay, good.
- The betting members...

1659
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:53,930
can also bet on the members
you think will answer correctly.

1660
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:55,600
You'll earn double your bet.

1661
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,530
- Okay.
- But you can't split your bet.

1662
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,000
- We can't?
- You can only bet on one. Yes.

1663
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,200
If they answer incorrectly,

1664
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,240
- the ice balls that you bet...
- You'll lose them.

1665
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,000
- will be taken away.
- Okay.

1666
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,410
The winner will be exempt
from the penalty.

1667
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,710
The remaining three...

1668
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:09,640
will be chosen with penalty balls
in decreasing order.

1669
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,980
Among these 4, the one
with the most ice balls at the end...

1670
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,920
- will be exempt.
- Only the winner will be exempt.

1671
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,680
- The rest will get penalty balls...
- We still have a chance.

1672
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,920
- and be chosen.
- We'll have others with us.

1673
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,790
- It's okay.
- We'll begin Round One...

1674
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:20,890
- of the quiz competition.
- All right.

1675
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:22,020
- What's the category?
- Okay!

1676
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,130
- We'll watch for now.
- First, the categories...

1677
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:25,160
that you're each confident in are...

1678
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,160
- Ji Hyo said Gyeongju.
- Yes.

1679
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,130
(Ji Hyo: Gyeongju)

1680
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:30,400
And Se Chan...

1681
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,000
- Gyeongju?
- Gyeongju?

1682
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,800
- Gyeongju.
- Hey, that's because...

1683
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,600
- I mean, isn't this too much?
- Ji Hyo, that's a bit too much.

1684
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,600
- I said Gyeongju.
- I mean...

1685
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,840
(2 summers ago, when they went on
a history trip to Gyeongju)

1686
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,940
- This is so much fun, Jae Seok.
- Isn't it so much fun?

1687
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,610
(One person in particular
really loved Gyeongju.)

1688
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,120
(Muyeongtap is correct.)

1689
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,920
(Her knowledge didn't quite measure
up to her love, though.)

1690
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,050
If that had been the case,
I would've said my family.

1691
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,090
- My family.
- I mean...

1692
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:54,060
Gyeongju can be a category?

1693
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,390
- I mean...
- Then, I'd have said Dongducheon.

1694
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:57,790
- But it's history.
- We've been to Dongducheon.

1695
00:55:57,790 --> 00:55:58,830
Gosh, I don't know about Gyeongju.

1696
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,600
- We went to Dongducheon.
- I know, right?

1697
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,830
- Gosh, I...
- Se Chan...

1698
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,970
- Se Chan said capitals.
- Capitals.

1699
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:04,970
Ye Eun said...

1700
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:05,970
- four-syllable Chinese idioms.
- Four-syllable Chinese idioms.

1701
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:07,500
- Four-syllable Chinese idioms.
- Oh, right.

1702
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,600
I'm good at capitals.

1703
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:09,900
A three-syllable capital city.

1704
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,610
(The great Empty Head Yang is
the most confident in this.)

1705
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,480
- That's...
- Do you know the capital of Egypt?

1706
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:16,880
- The capital of Egypt?
- Yes.

1707
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,050
(Meanwhile, Ye Eun lives with
no knowledge of capitals.)

1708
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,080
Let's see who knows more...

1709
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,750
- four-syllable Chinese idioms.
- Oh, right.

1710
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:25,620
(She's so good that she can even
write them in Chinese characters.)

1711
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:26,820
Oh, she's writing them out
so easily.

1712
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,860
(Maidongpung is correct.)

1713
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,230
Do you have a certificate
in Chinese characters?

1714
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:33,390
(She emptied her head for everything else
besides Chinese idioms.)

1715
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,000
This time,
we have four-syllable Chinese idioms.

1716
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,070
- That's mine.
- Gosh, this is...

1717
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:40,800
(Food Fighter binge eats
four-syllable Chinese idioms.)

1718
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,540
(Will she show off her skills
this time as well?)

1719
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,640
- Gosh, this is...
- Four-syllable Chinese idioms.

1720
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,640
- Oh, right. Ye Eun.
- Gosh, this won't be easy.

1721
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,640
Daniel said he was confident
in world history.

1722
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,910
- World history.
- He doesn't know world history.

1723
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:55,020
- What do you know?
- Well, he said so himself.

1724
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,620
But is Gyeongju really okay
as a category?

1725
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:59,120
Gyeongju sounds good.
I'm going to bet a lot on that.

1726
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,720
I'm going to bet everything
on Ye Eun right away...

1727
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,420
if there's a four-syllable
Chinese idiom question.

1728
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:04,690
This is nerve-racking.

1729
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:07,130
(Who will become top of the class
at Empty Head School?)

1730
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:08,400
- I'm going all in.
- All right.

1731
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,030
- Here's the first category.
- Okay.

1732
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:14,100
The first category is Gyeongju.

1733
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:17,040
(Category: Gyeongju)

1734
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,740
- Gosh, should I trust her or not?
- But...

1735
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,240
(Her confidence is at its highest.)

1736
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,550
I know this for a fact.
Ji Hyo studied a lot about Gyeongju.

1737
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,550
- I know. I'll bet three on Ji Hyo.
- I will...

1738
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:27,650
I will...

1739
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:28,950
- Three. Yes.
- Really?

1740
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,020
- Three on Ji Hyo.
- For Ji Hyo...

1741
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,420
I've bet everything on myself.

1742
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,860
- How many?
- Three. That's all I have.

1743
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,060
- But Ji Hyo,
- Yes?

1744
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,930
it's been a while
since we went to Gyeongju.

1745
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:38,160
Jae Seok, I...

1746
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,330
- The Great Dharani Sutra.
- What?

1747
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,160
The Great Dharani Sutra.

1748
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:44,530
But what if that's not
one of the questions?

1749
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:45,770
- What will you do then?
- No, I remember other stuff...

1750
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:47,000
besides that too.

1751
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,800
Okay, then. I will bet...

1752
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,540
- I will...
- Jae Seok, I won't let you down.

1753
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,910
All right, five!

1754
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:56,040
(He takes a big leap of faith
on her drive and bets 5.)

1755
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,180
I'll bet three as well!

1756
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,280
(Jong Kook bets 3 on Ji Hyo too.)

1757
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,110
- More than you think, Ji Hyo is...
- Ji Hyo...

1758
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:01,150
I'll bet three too.

1759
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,420
- Three?
- Yes, three.

1760
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,820
- Because what we did in Gyeongju...
- That's right.

1761
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,490
- There aren't that many.
- She studied.

1762
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:07,620
Then, two!

1763
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,590
Ji Hyo was studying like mad
back then.

1764
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:11,790
(What?)

1765
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:13,700
- That's right.
- Right?

1766
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,260
It broke! He's out!

1767
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:19,600
(1 ice ball is smashed.)

1768
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,300
Why did you break it?

1769
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,540
- If it's broken, you're done.
- But it broke on the way...

1770
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,010
You're done if it's broken.

1771
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,940
Gosh, seriously. I can't break them.
One more, then. Two.

1772
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,140
(He takes a new ball out
and bets 2 on Ji Hyo.)

1773
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,150
- How many?
- I'll bet two. I'm not sure.

1774
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:33,450
I don't think I'll know about Gyeongju.
I bet two.

1775
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:34,480
I'll bet one too.

1776
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,220
Okay, here is the question.

1777
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,250
All right, Ji Hyo. Let's go.

1778
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:40,520
- You can do it!
- All right. Nice.

1779
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,260
- Ji Hyo, I bet three on you.
- All right.

1780
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,190
- You can do it.
- You never know.

1781
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:47,200
- Okay. Seokgatap is...
- Yes?

1782
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,760
- known as the shadowless pagoda.
- Right.

1783
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,400
- She knows. We learned this.
- Yes, she does.

1784
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:53,530
- So, it's also called Muyeongtap.
- Oh, that wasn't the question?

1785
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,070
- I was going to write Muyeongtap!
- Oh, that wasn't it?

1786
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,940
- That wasn't the answer?
- I was going to write Muyeongtap!

1787
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,270
What are the names
of the married couple...

1788
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,710
- That's it.
- in the tale...

1789
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,440
- about Muyeongtap?
- You know this, right?

1790
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,450
(What are the names of the couple
in the tale about Muyeongtap?)

1791
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:07,480
- This is hard.
- You know this, right?

1792
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,250
(What are the names of the couple
in the tale about Muyeongtap?)

1793
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,690
(Answer: Asadal and Asanyeo)

1794
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,520
I said, "Asadal and Asatha."

1795
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,960
(For Se Chan and Ji Hyo,
it's an expected question.)

1796
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,130
- Hey, this is... You wrote...
- That's a Premier League team.

1797
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:25,330
(Ji Hyo had gotten it wrong by
writing the soccer team "Arsenal.")

1798
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:27,700
- Ji Hyo knows this.
- You know this, right?

1799
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:28,940
- They're a married couple?
- You know it.

1800
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,270
(Will she get the right answer
this time?)

1801
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,370
You have five seconds. Five.

1802
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:33,410
Hey, this is really easy.

1803
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:34,510
- Four.
- It's so easy.

1804
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:35,710
- It's super easy.
- Three.

1805
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:37,550
- Four.
- It's so easy.

1806
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:39,550
(He also wrote
"Pyeonggang and Ondal.")

1807
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:40,680
- Two.
- My gosh.

1808
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,020
(Meanwhile, what answer did Se Chan,
who went on the trip, write down?)

1809
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,650
- Ji Hyo is writing.
- This is insane.

1810
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:47,060
(He got it right!)

1811
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,420
- Yang Se Chan.
- You know this, right?

1812
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,730
- Oh, this.
- I had gotten it wrong.

1813
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,830
- Ji Hyo.
- She's writing.

1814
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:56,130
- Ji Hyo.
- She's writing.

1815
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,830
(Asadal appears.)

1816
00:59:57,830 --> 00:59:59,770
Hey, but it's better
if she gets this wrong.

1817
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:02,270
(Ji Hyo will also get it right
if she writes Asanyeo.)

1818
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,740
Gosh, Se Chan must know this.

1819
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,610
- Hey, let me see.
- Okay, show us your answers.

1820
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:09,010
- Se Chan. My gosh.
- Show us your answers.

1821
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,140
I don't know.

1822
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,850
(Se Chan got it right,
and these two got it wrong.)

1823
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:13,180
Oh, what do I do?

1824
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,420
(What is Ji Hyo's answer
with so many ice balls on the line?)

1825
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,250
- I think I got the woman wrong.
- Raise your answers.

1826
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,250
"Asadal and A..."

1827
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,990
- "Arsenal?"
- "Arsenal?"

1828
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,490
(Arsenal again?)

1829
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:22,720
- I got it right!
- Are you serious?

1830
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,830
- Hey.
- Are you kidding me?

1831
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:25,730
Se Chan is correct.

1832
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:26,830
What? Is he correct?

1833
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:28,530
- How could you...
- Asanyeo and Asadal.

1834
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:30,130
I wrote one down
as "Asadda" last time, right?

1835
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,430
- Ji Hyo.
- Asanyeo.

1836
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:33,840
(Excited)

1837
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,300
- Are you kidding me?
- Ji Hyo, Arsenal isn't...

1838
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,240
Are you talking about Henry?

1839
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,680
How could you write,
"Asadal, Arsenal?"

1840
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,940
Asanyeo automatically comes...

1841
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,550
- with Asadal.
- We lost balls because of you.

1842
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:46,450
- She won't do.
- She lacks the competitive edge.

1843
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:48,050
- I'm so happy.
- She won't do.

1844
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,450
- Why am I getting 3?
- Did he bet 3 balls?

1845
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:50,920
- Do I get one for the answer?
- I'm jealous.

1846
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:53,220
- Will I lose what I bet?
- Gosh.

1847
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,320
This is bad.

1848
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,820
- She lost a basket of balls.
- It's for the correct answer.

1849
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:00,360
- Ji Hyo, I lost five balls.
- Jae Seok.

1850
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,130
I'll earn them back. Just you wait.

1851
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,870
I would have known
had I gone to Gyeongju.

1852
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:05,830
I suddenly developed faith
in Se Chan.

1853
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:07,040
- Loyalty!
- Asanyeo and Asadal.

1854
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,440
Bet all the balls
when the category is capital.

1855
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,600
Asadal and Asanyeo.

1856
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,010
- Now, the category is...
- World history?

1857
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:13,540
- world history.
- World history.

1858
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,680
World history is nice.

1859
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,250
Hold on. Daniel...

1860
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,250
World history.

1861
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,380
- Two.
- I don't know much about it.

1862
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,850
- You bet two balls.
- What kind of a question...

1863
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:23,650
- will we get about world history?
- World history.

1864
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,320
- Figures of the world?
- World.

1865
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:28,060
Figures of the world?
Then I'll only bet one ball.

1866
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,660
- Will you bet one ball?
- World history?

1867
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:33,290
- Do you really have confidence?
- Yes, I do. It's world history.

1868
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:35,160
World history.
I have confidence when it comes...

1869
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,330
to the English-speaking countries.

1870
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,400
- Really?
- I'll bet a ball.

1871
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,570
- Hey.
- I'll bet a ball.

1872
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:40,030
Daniel, they bet one ball each.

1873
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,400
- I'll bet two balls.
- Good.

1874
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,970
- I'll bet one.
- Two.

1875
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,610
Seok Jin, I'll triple it.

1876
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:45,810
Okay. Let's go.

1877
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:46,870
One.

1878
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:47,980
- Hold on.
- No knowledge whatsoever.

1879
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,810
- I'll bet on Se Chan.
- Shall I bet one ball?

1880
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:51,250
- Se Chan? Will he do better?
- I'll bet on Se Chan.

1881
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,950
- I'll bet on Se Chan.
- I'll do the same.

1882
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:54,320
- For world history?
- Se Chan.

1883
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,450
- Will you bet on Se Chan?
- Right now...

1884
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:57,520
This is my category.

1885
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,590
- Why are you betting on Se Chan?
- I'll bet on Se Chan.

1886
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,290
- No! Hey!
- Three balls.

1887
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,720
- Three balls.
- But...

1888
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,020
- he doesn't know anything.
- Let's go.

1889
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,490
- Daniel really doesn't.
- Right now...

1890
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,990
I'll bet on Se Chan.

1891
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:07,030
I'll bet one ball on Daniel.

1892
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,160
- I mean...
- Hold on.

1893
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,300
- I'll bet 4 balls on Daniel.
- I bet 2 balls.

1894
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,500
Don't you know that?

1895
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,370
- I bet four balls on you.
- Haha.

1896
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:14,870
I bet four balls.

1897
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:16,400
- This is...
- Hey.

1898
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,040
- Okay.
- I bet two balls.

1899
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,340
I bet four balls.

1900
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,780
You bet three balls on Se Chan.

1901
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,810
Jae Seok, thank you.

1902
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,980
That's right.

1903
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:25,980
- No one bet a ball on me.
- No one bet any balls...

1904
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,780
- on Ye Eun.
- You'll be surprised.

1905
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,650
- Wait for the Chinese idioms.
- All right.

1906
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,520
In the late 18th century,

1907
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:34,160
- this revolution started in the UK.
- That's right.

1908
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,460
- What's the term for a period...
- You know this one, right?

1909
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,630
that brought innovation...

1910
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:38,630
- in the manufacturing processes...
- It's so easy.

1911
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,230
and big changes
in the management structure?

1912
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,530
- He got it.
- Please read the question again.

1913
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:43,930
- It was too loud.
- It's too easy.

1914
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,430
- In the late 18th century,
- What?

1915
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:47,170
this revolution started in the UK.

1916
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:48,270
No way.

1917
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:49,500
- What's the term for a period...
- It's so easy.

1918
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,270
- that brought innovation...
- The Industrial Revolution.

1919
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,040
- in the manufacturing processes...
- He got it.

1920
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,240
- The Industrial Revolution.
- Yes.

1921
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,740
- Even I know this one.
- But...

1922
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,710
In the late 18th century,
this revolution started in the UK.

1923
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:06,190
(Will they be able to think
of the Industrial Revolution?)

1924
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:08,190
- Three,
- You mentioned the UK earlier.

1925
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,920
- two,
- Don't say anything.

1926
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,960
one! Time's up.

1927
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,260
- I don't know this one.
- Hold up your answer.

1928
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,390
Daniel.

1929
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:14,460
- Hold up your answer.
- It's very easy.

1930
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,000
- Daniel.
- What?

1931
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,830
- I mean...
- Hold up your answer.

1932
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,930
- It's a well-known revolution.
- Ji Hyo, hold up your answer.

1933
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:21,700
- Social Revolution.
- It was close.

1934
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,570
Hey, Daniel.
Hurry up and hold up the answer.

1935
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:25,070
- Daniel.
- Daniel, hold it up.

1936
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,210
What kind of a revolution?

1937
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:27,540
- Grand Industrial Revolution.
- Grand Industrial Revolution.

1938
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,180
- Incorrect. Industrial Revolution.
- Why did you add "Grand?"

1939
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:30,650
(He missed the correct answer
narrowly.)

1940
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:32,680
- Incorrect. Industrial Revolution.
- It's the Industrial Revolution.

1941
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:33,810
- Industrial Revolution.
- Why did you add "Grand?"

1942
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,650
- Why did you write "Napoleon?"
- Napoleon.

1943
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:37,350
("Napoleon" is incorrect.)

1944
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:38,450
He was French.

1945
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:39,690
Renaissance?

1946
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:41,860
- It's the Industrial Revolution.
- Why did you write that?

1947
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,020
It's the Industrial Revolution.

1948
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,660
- What a fool.
- Is mine incorrect?

1949
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,530
- Why did you add "Grand?"
- The Industrial Revolution.

1950
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,460
- "Grand..."
- It was an easy one.

1951
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,070
- I lost all the balls.
- Hold on. Time out.

1952
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,630
(He lost 3 balls
by betting on Se Chan.)

1953
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:54,070
Hold on. Time out.

1954
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:56,400
Didn't you mention something big?

1955
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,510
That was why...

1956
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:58,510
- I added "Grand."
- Forget it.

1957
01:03:58,510 --> 01:03:59,970
- You mentioned something big.
- You know,

1958
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:01,510
- Haha really belongs in this group.
- Hey,

1959
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:03,280
Haha knows about
the Industrial Revolution.

1960
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,510
- I don't belong on that side, okay?
- You're right.

1961
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:07,320
- Don't ever challenge me again.
- Jong Kook.

1962
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,150
- The producer mentioned...
- Hey.

1963
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:11,820
- something big earlier.
- Hey, can you start...

1964
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,690
wearing glasses
that make you look less smart?

1965
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,720
Those glasses make him look smart.

1966
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,790
The next category is...

1967
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:19,430
- capital.
- Jae Seok.

1968
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,600
- Why is it capital?
- Jae Seok.

1969
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,560
- Capital!
- Are you confident?

1970
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,270
- Let's go.
- Are you confident?

1971
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,740
(At that moment)

1972
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:28,940
How many will you bet?

1973
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:31,240
- Eight.
- Eight.

1974
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:33,310
- Eight?
- Eight?

1975
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:34,840
Are you really confident?

1976
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:36,240
I memorized many capitals.

1977
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,850
I'll bet four balls on you.

1978
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:39,280
- Here I go.
- Jong Kook.

1979
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,450
Did you memorize them?
Did you study?

1980
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:41,950
- Here I go.
- Yes, I did.

1981
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,380
I bet eight balls for a reason.

1982
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,450
Here I go.

1983
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:47,190
- Put all of them in here.
- I'll bet three balls.

1984
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:50,090
- Four balls are too many.
- You'll enjoy the winnings.

1985
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:51,230
I'll bet three balls.

1986
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:52,560
Hey, I'll bet three balls.

1987
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,200
- I bet 8 balls.
- I'll bet 3 balls.

1988
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,130
- It won't be an easy one.
- Six.

1989
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:57,270
Three.

1990
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,500
- I'll bet two balls.
- Gosh, this is... Hold on.

1991
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:01,500
- I bet so many balls.
- He has never succeeded...

1992
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,040
- in anything.
- This hurts my pride.

1993
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,240
(What will be Jae Seok's decision?)

1994
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,810
- Hey.
- Here's the important thing.

1995
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,180
Five balls.

1996
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,750
Jae Seok is unlucky.

1997
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:11,950
Five balls.

1998
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:14,980
- Jae Seok, I'll show you.
- How many?

1999
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,380
- Seriously. I'll show you.
- Hold on a second.

2000
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,890
- You'd better do that.
- In such situations,

2001
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:19,720
you should bet on someone else
to turn the tables.

2002
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,190
- That's right.
- We bet on the same person.

2003
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:23,420
- You're right.
- Won't you bet on yourself?

2004
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:25,060
- Daniel.
- Won't you do that?

2005
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,230
Look at his facial expression.

2006
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:27,960
- Daniel, aren't you confident?
- I don't know the capitals.

2007
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,860
- Do you know the capitals?
- She doesn't know.

2008
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,430
- Ji Hyo, how about you?
- She doesn't know.

2009
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,370
This is the third question.

2010
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:37,640
This country is well-known
for the wild animals...

2011
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,810
- in the savannah,
- This one is easy.

2012
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:40,540
What's the capital of Kenya?

2013
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,740
What?

2014
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:44,110
- What's the capital of Kenya?
- What?

2015
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:46,280
- Hey.
- For goodness' sake.

2016
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,380
(He said that he was confident
in the capitals.)

2017
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,420
- We're ruined.
- Hey.

2018
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:50,220
All right. You have five seconds.

2019
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:51,650
- Hold on.
- Come on!

2020
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:53,220
How do you not know this one?

2021
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,790
- I don't know.
- Two,

2022
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,160
- This one is a country.
- I really don't know.

2023
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,960
one! All right. Hold it up.

2024
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,430
- It's a capital, not a country.
- Hold it up.

2025
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:02,030
- What? Columbia?
- It's a country.

2026
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:03,330
- Columbia.
- Gabon?

2027
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:04,670
- Gabon?
- Serengeti.

2028
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:05,800
- Gabon.
- Gabon?

2029
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,840
- Serengeti. Gabon.
- Serengeti.

2030
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,600
- Amazon.
- For goodness' sake.

2031
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,310
(Amazon)

2032
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:12,970
For goodness' sake.

2033
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,510
(Their investment
was a big failure.)

2034
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:15,780
Nairobi!

2035
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:17,450
- Nairobi!
- For goodness' sake.

2036
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:18,550
What was the answer?

2037
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:20,180
- This gets asked frequently.
- Nairobi?

2038
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:21,380
- Jae Seok.
- I've never heard of it.

2039
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:23,380
- I'm so disappointed.
- This is driving me crazy.

2040
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:24,950
What's up with this fools?

2041
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:26,690
Why are all the answers so lousy?

2042
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,220
- Amazon? Serengeti?
- Come on.

2043
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:29,860
- What are you doing?
- Nairobi.

2044
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,660
What's Nairobi?
I've never heard of it.

2045
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:33,130
- I've never heard of it.
- I don't know the capitals.

2046
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,500
- Did you know the answer?
- Yes, I did.

2047
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,700
Why didn't you write it down?

2048
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,430
I got a bit nervous.

2049
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:40,500
You can't remember anything
when you sit there.

2050
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,900
- No, you can't. You get flustered.
- You can't.

2051
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,000
- You really can't.
- You won't remember...

2052
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,140
even if you sit here, right?

2053
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:45,240
Then I'll remember.

2054
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,940
Jae Seok, you used a lot of balls.

2055
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:49,280
- Right now...
- Five balls. It's nice.

2056
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:51,180
You're terrible at investing.

2057
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,910
I became poor.

2058
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,780
- I had no idea.
- Now comes the Chinese idiom.

2059
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:55,920
- It's Ye Eun's category.
- Please make it easy.

2060
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,020
- Okay.
- Please make it easy.

2061
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,850
- It's all about the flow.
- Now comes the Chinese idiom.

2062
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:00,350
- Come on. I'll go all in.
- Okay.

2063
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,620
- I'll go all in.
- Okay.

2064
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:03,420
- I'll bet one ball.
- Chinese idiom?

2065
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,390
- I'll bet one ball.
- Chinese idiom?

2066
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:07,400
- Will you only bet 1 ball?
- I only have 1 ball.

2067
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,760
I'll bet nine balls.

2068
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,630
Ye Eun, I'll bet nine balls on you.

2069
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:11,870
You'll go all in.

2070
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:13,370
- I'll go all in.
- Then...

2071
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:14,670
if you don't have any balls
in the next round...

2072
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:16,770
- You'll get the penalty.
- You'll get the penalty.

2073
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:17,940
- Leave 1 or 2 balls behind.
- Jae Seok.

2074
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,140
- Do it for the next round.
- Leave one ball behind.

2075
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:20,610
- Leave one ball behind.
- Bet half of them.

2076
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:22,380
- I'll bet 1 ball.
- I'll take 2 balls back.

2077
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:24,450
- Give an adequate question.
- An adequate one.

2078
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:26,610
- These questions aren't hard.
- If it's too easy...

2079
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:27,680
- But...
- You're going in an order, right?

2080
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,850
- Nairobi was pretty hard.
- It was hard.

2081
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:31,020
It was hard. Nairobi was hard.

2082
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,490
I have a question.

2083
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:33,850
For example,

2084
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:35,320
do you have the questions already...

2085
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,390
- or do you make them...
- We have them already.

2086
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:37,690
- Do we have them already?
- We made them ahead of time.

2087
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:39,060
- You don't choose the new ones.
- No.

2088
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:41,660
- Ye Eun.
- We want them to answer correctly.

2089
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,570
- Ye Eun, how many should I bet?
- I don't know.

2090
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,130
You didn't get any questions
you were confident about.

2091
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:47,670
- My confidence level fell.
- Are you confident or not?

2092
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:48,700
- Tell me that much.
- I'm confident.

2093
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:49,940
- I'm confident!
- Two.

2094
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,070
- Are you confident?
- Let's go.

2095
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:52,470
- I'll bet three balls.
- I'm confident.

2096
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:53,710
I'm confident!

2097
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,580
- I'll bet 4 balls.
- I'll bet 3 balls.

2098
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:57,010
- Three balls.
- Four balls.

2099
01:07:57,010 --> 01:07:58,750
- Three balls.
- We usually answer correctly...

2100
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,210
- when we have confidence. But...
- Hold on.

2101
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,420
- the questions are hard.
- I'll pour all of them in here.

2102
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:03,020
- I'm confident!
- Okay.

2103
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,450
(Jae Seok goes all in.)

2104
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:06,090
- I'm confident!
- Okay.

2105
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:07,120
- Let's go.
- Please.

2106
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:08,320
- All right.
- Ye Eun, I hope you get it wrong.

2107
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,490
Will you bet all ten balls?

2108
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:11,230
- I hope you get it wrong.
- Yes.

2109
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:13,090
- Jae Seok, if she gets it wrong...
- I hope you get it wrong.

2110
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,060
I had the most balls.

2111
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:16,430
- It'll be better if she messes up.
- Yes.

2112
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:17,970
I bet three balls.
How many balls did you bet?

2113
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,400
- Three.
- Please.

2114
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,500
- Get it wrong.
- Ye Eun.

2115
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,800
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2116
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,040
Get it wrong.

2117
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,210
- I want to get it right.
- It's a Chinese idiom.

2118
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:27,640
- Ye Eun, good luck. Seriously.
- It's okay if she gets it wrong.

2119
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:28,810
Jae Seok will be finished
if she gets it wrong.

2120
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:30,240
- Let's end him.
- The meaning is,

2121
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,680
"Glaring like a tiger."

2122
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,150
What's the Chinese idiom
about waiting for an opportunity...

2123
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:35,320
to do something?

2124
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,320
- Like a tiger?
- What? Hold on.

2125
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,550
The meaning is,
"Glaring like a tiger."

2126
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:39,850
What's the Chinese idiom about...

2127
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,720
- waiting for an opportunity...
- Let's see if Jae Seok survives.

2128
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,220
- to do something?
- To do something?

2129
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,490
- To do something?
- Ye Eun, think hard.

2130
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:46,530
- What's the Chinese idiom about...
- I know this one.

2131
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:48,960
- Ye Eun, you know this one.
- Hold on.

2132
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:50,760
- I know this one.
- Jae Seok,

2133
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,100
I'm looking at your mouth.

2134
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:55,240
- Sitting here makes me a genius.
- Right?

2135
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:57,970
- This is driving me crazy.
- I know every answer.

2136
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:01,540
(Answer: Hositamtam)

2137
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:07,880
(Everyone writes something
that begins with "Ho.")

2138
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:09,750
- This is driving me crazy.
- Ye Eun, it isn't hard.

2139
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,720
- All right.
- Ye Eun, it isn't hard.

2140
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:12,950
All right. No.

2141
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:14,050
Don't give her any hints.

2142
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:15,890
- Don't do that.
- This is driving me crazy.

2143
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,190
Waiting for an opportunity
to do something?

2144
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:19,790
- I know this one.
- Give her some time.

2145
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:20,830
- It's easy.
- It's so easy.

2146
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:22,600
- You have five seconds. Five,
- Be quiet!

2147
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,860
- four...
- It's easy.

2148
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:25,630
Ye Eun, it's so easy.

2149
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:26,870
- Okay. Two.
- Two...

2150
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:29,640
(Did the Chinese idiom master
remember "Hositamtam?")

2151
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,370
(Will Jae Seok avoid
going bankrupt?)

2152
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:32,870
- One. Hold it up.
- Let's go. All right.

2153
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,710
- One. Hold it up.
- Let's go. All right.

2154
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:35,780
Okay.

2155
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:37,480
- All right.
- "Hosagupaeng?"

2156
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:39,650
I can't believe her.

2157
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:40,850
- It's correct.
- It's correct.

2158
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:42,720
- It's correct.
- "Hosagupaeng?"

2159
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,180
- It's correct.
- It's correct.

2160
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,490
- It's correct.
- It's correct.

2161
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:47,020
- Is it correct?
- It's correct.

2162
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,290
(Did someone get it right?)

2163
01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:50,260
(Hositamtam)

2164
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:51,430
(Ji Hyo unexpectedly got it right.)

2165
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:52,790
- Is it correct?
- It's correct.

2166
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:54,330
- Is it correct?
- It's correct.

2167
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:57,000
- Oh, my! I got it right!
- Ji Hyo got it right.

2168
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,570
(Jae Seok goes bankrupt
after betting all balls on Ye Eun.)

2169
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:04,100
- Daniel, show your answer.
- I need to pick one.

2170
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,210
- I haven't picked one.
- "Warrior guard?"

2171
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,170
- All of them are wrong.
- "Yongjaenghotu."

2172
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,610
Only Ji Hyo answered correctly.

2173
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:11,180
I got it right!

2174
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,510
- Is it "Hositamtam?"
- What's "Hohyunghojae?"

2175
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:13,980
- It's "Tosagupaeng."
- It's "Tosagupaeng."

2176
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,020
- "Hosagupaeng?"
- It's "Tosagupaeng."

2177
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,080
Come on...

2178
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,750
Hey, "Hositamtam" was so easy.

2179
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,920
- Ye Eun.
- Hositamtam.

2180
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,120
- "Hosi" means "A tiger's gaze."
- Hosi.

2181
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,560
Jae Seok will get the penalty!

2182
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:26,160
Jae Seok is finished.

2183
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:28,660
How could you not know "Hositamtam?"

2184
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:29,660
(Jae Seok goes bankrupt.)

2185
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:30,800
You forget things when you're here.

2186
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,630
- It was so hard.
- You have a point.

2187
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:36,300
Jae Seok was betrayed
by everyone he believed in.

2188
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,270
Jae Seok was betrayed...

2189
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:41,440
- by everyone he believed in.
- Guys, come on out.

2190
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,440
(He asks for a word
with the problem children.)

2191
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,750
- Hey. Seriously.
- What is it, Jae Seok?

2192
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,250
Are you guys kidding me?

2193
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:49,680
I went through so much trouble
to hide these balls.

2194
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,880
(Jae Seok lost all the balls
he worked so hard to collect.)

2195
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,120
- You know,
- Twenty-four balls.

2196
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,250
- the most ridiculous answer...
- Listen.

2197
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,960
was Ji Hyo's "Asadal and Arsenal."

2198
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:58,730
(The Arsenal fan is embarrassed.)

2199
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:00,060
I got angry for real.

2200
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,530
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

2201
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,200
To be honest, I wrote down
the movies I enjoyed as a child.

2202
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,300
- "Enter the Dragon?"
- "Enter the Dragon."

2203
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,540
- "Armour of God."
- Hey, what's "Haha hoho?"

2204
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:11,770
- I wrote it down just in case.
- Hey.

2205
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,240
- Just in case.
- "Haha hoho?"

2206
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,040
- He really is Empty Head.
- Just in case.

2207
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,480
You feel comfortable
in that group, right?

2208
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,080
- Daniel belongs in this group.
- For goodness' sake.

2209
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,310
Jae Seok, there's one more round.

2210
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:20,980
- There's one more round.
- Is there a way?

2211
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:22,050
There's one more round.

2212
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:23,720
- Let him take out a loan.
- You can take out a loan.

2213
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:24,950
I'll take out a loan.

2214
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:26,350
- That's ridiculous.
- I'll take out a loan.

2215
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:27,760
- You need to pay back later.
- Yes.

2216
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,420
- At the very end,
- That's right.

2217
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,920
- you need to pay back.
- Otherwise, I'll place last.

2218
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,630
- Yes.
- You should give me a chance.

2219
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,030
- It was hard.
- Hey.

2220
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:35,130
Thank you.

2221
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:37,060
I'll go all in this time as well.

2222
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,070
- All in.
- All in.

2223
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:40,300
The next one is
about Gyeongju again.

2224
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,570
- Yes. Gyeongju.
- Gyeongju.

2225
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:43,740
A question about Gyeongju
is better for me.

2226
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:44,770
All right.

2227
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:46,340
How many balls will you bet?

2228
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,280
- What's the keyword this time?
- Five balls.

2229
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,340
Gyeongju?

2230
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:52,050
Se Chan, you remember
many things about Gyeongju...

2231
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:54,210
- since it was fun, right?
- I remember many things.

2232
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,050
- Right?
- And by watching the episode,

2233
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:57,480
- I went over the incorrect answers.
- You watched the episode.

2234
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,050
Hold on. Arsenal.

2235
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:00,490
- Are you confident?
- Asanyeo.

2236
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:02,260
- Are you confident?
- Yes, I'm confident.

2237
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:04,390
- Are you confident?
- I'll bet on Se Chan.

2238
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:06,490
- My goodness.
- Okay.

2239
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:08,200
Same here. I'll bet on Se Chan.

2240
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,330
- After all, Se Chan...
- But this is her question.

2241
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:11,470
No.

2242
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,700
- I'll bet on Se Chan.
- I'll bet three balls.

2243
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,770
Please put one ball
in Se Chan's basket.

2244
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,340
- Thank you.
- Why would you bet only one?

2245
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:21,110
- What? No, I'll bet 1.
- Bet 2 or more.

2246
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,910
- I'll see how well Ji Hyo does.
- What?

2247
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:25,810
I'll bet one ball on Arsenal.

2248
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:27,720
But he knew about Asadal.

2249
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,550
I didn't know about Asanyeo.

2250
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:30,850
I didn't know about Asanyeo.

2251
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:33,990
How much do you remember
about Gyeongju?

2252
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:36,590
Jae Seok, I know everything
except for that one.

2253
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:38,660
- I know everything.
- Se Chan knew about...

2254
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:39,690
the shadowless pagoda.

2255
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:42,130
- He knew about it.
- I was going to write it down.

2256
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:44,060
- After all...
- Let's go.

2257
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:45,870
- What?
- How many? All of them?

2258
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:47,700
- I'll bet all of them.
- Hey.

2259
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:49,540
- Stop it, mister!
- Jae Seok.

2260
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:50,670
No more loans. It's over.

2261
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:52,270
I'm like a tiger moth.

2262
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:53,710
- I'm like a tiger moth.
- Just hold on...

2263
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:54,940
- to 2 balls.
- I'll turn them into 20 balls.

2264
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:56,280
- I'm really good.
- All right.

2265
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:57,580
- Ji Hyo, these are ten balls.
- Yes.

2266
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:59,110
- You remember everything, right?
- Of course.

2267
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:00,310
- I'll do well this time.
- Okay.

2268
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:01,880
Ji Hyo, can you answer incorrectly
even if you know?

2269
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,920
(Jae Seok bets all of his balls
on Ji Hyo.)

2270
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,450
- Have a sense of responsibility.
- Of course.

2271
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:05,690
- Ten balls.
- Ten balls.

2272
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:07,720
Here comes the question.

2273
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:08,960
I'll look at Se Chan's face only.

2274
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,390
Among the surviving woodblock prints
in the world...

2275
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:15,730
Among the surviving woodblock prints
in the world,

2276
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:17,000
this is considered...

2277
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,070
- to be the oldest.
- She knows this one.

2278
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:21,470
(A killer question about Gyeongju)

2279
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:24,200
(The Great Dharani Sutra)

2280
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:27,570
(Right before the quiz)

2281
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,980
(Whispering)

2282
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:32,610
(She even whispered it herself!)

2283
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:34,620
- Please be quiet.
- What's the name of the text...

2284
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,820
that was found
during the repairs of Seokgatap...

2285
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,790
that had been destroyed
by the grave robbers?

2286
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:39,950
Ji Hyo is writing it down.

2287
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:41,390
- Ji Hyo, you look different now.
- Ji Hyo.

2288
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:44,260
- Ji Hyo knows the answer.
- Why did you choose this question?

2289
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:46,260
- You should know this one.
- Don't you know it?

2290
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,260
Seriously.

2291
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:48,300
- I bet you don't know the answer.
- Let's go.

2292
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:49,530
(- Tripitaka Koreana.
- No.)

2293
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:51,430
She got it right last time.

2294
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:54,230
- Jikji.
- You're right.

2295
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:56,770
(Even the brainy ones are confused
by the advanced question.)

2296
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:58,910
- Ji Hyo, you look different now.
- Ji Hyo.

2297
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:02,080
(The two who didn't go to Gyeongju
get it wrong.)

2298
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:06,050
(Se Chan writes something down
as he tilts his head.)

2299
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:07,110
(Meanwhile)

2300
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:09,580
- Four, three...
- You got one wrong.

2301
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,750
(The master of Gyeongju is relaxed.)

2302
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:14,390
(The answers are revealed.)

2303
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:15,560
Hold it up.

2304
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:16,790
- Let's see Ji Hyo's answer.
- Let's see.

2305
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,330
- Yes.
- Let's see.

2306
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:20,890
- Gosh.
- What? Hold on.

2307
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,860
- Ji Hyo is incorrect.
- She's incorrect.

2308
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,500
(Is Ji Hyo incorrect?)

2309
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,400
- What did she write?
- She wrote, "Dharini."

2310
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,170
- You wrote, "Dharini."
- It's "Dharani," not "Dharini."

2311
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:32,010
(The Great Dharini Sutra)

2312
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,540
I got it right again!

2313
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:35,740
- I wrote it down.
- Ji Hyo.

2314
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:38,880
- Why didn't you do it properly?
- It's "Dharani."

2315
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,110
- She's incorrect.
- What did she write?

2316
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:41,250
- She wrote, "Dharini."
- The Great Dharani Sutra.

2317
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,720
- You wrote, "Dharini."
- It's "Dharani," not "Dharini."

2318
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,950
- The Great Dharani Sutra.
- The Great Dharani Sutra.

2319
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:45,150
- I got it right again!
- Okay!

2320
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:46,790
(He got 2 consecutive questions
about Gyeongju!)

2321
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,190
The Great Dharani Sutra.

2322
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:49,820
- I spelled it wrong back then.
- That's right.

2323
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:50,820
(The power of reviewing
the wrong answers)

2324
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,860
- So it isn't Tripitaka Koreana.
- Okay.

2325
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,190
Daniel, I wrote the same thing.

2326
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,960
- So it isn't Tripitaka Koreana.
- You're ruined.

2327
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
A conversation between me
and Seok Jin will be really funny.

2328
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,830
I said, "Tripitaka Koreana."

2329
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,440
- He said, "Jikji"
- Protect him.

2330
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,540
(Se Chan
got the difficult question right.)

2331
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:07,010
Her answer was,
"The Great Dharini Sutra."

2332
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,240
Okay.

2333
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,110
Gosh, mister.

2334
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:13,780
Mister, it's
The Great Dharani Sutra.

2335
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,450
- I'm sorry, Jae Seok.
- I thought that she'd be correct.

2336
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:17,680
I can't believe I remembered it.

2337
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,120
- For goodness' sake.
- I'm sorry.

2338
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:21,290
- Jae Seok, I'm sorry.
- I smiled in the end.

2339
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:22,390
(The betrayal of a Tongyeong bigshot
who promised to double the balls)

2340
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:24,760
- I'm sorry.
- Why did you bet all the balls?

2341
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,960
- Jae Seok.
- Ji Hyo.

2342
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,800
Jae Seok,
I just got "Dharani" wrong.

2343
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:30,830
Okay.

2344
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:33,100
(Another person
who invested in Ji Hyo)

2345
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:34,100
Haha.

2346
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,470
(You should've bet on me!)

2347
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,710
- Grasshopper is out for good.
- Okay.

2348
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:40,070
For goodness' sake.

2349
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:43,280
Jae Seok, you'll be so bored
during the shoot.

2350
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,950
- This is so much fun.
- Hey.

2351
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:46,980
You'll be so bored during the shoot.

2352
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:49,150
- Hey.
- I turned into a beggar.

2353
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:51,320
(He went from the wealthiest man
to a man in debt.)

2354
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:53,350
- Jae Seok.
- There are no more loans.

2355
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:55,660
Jae Seok, can you invest
these balls?

2356
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:57,220
- What?
- Can you invest these balls?

2357
01:15:58,330 --> 01:15:59,360
My goodness.

2358
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:01,930
- No.
- You can't do that.

2359
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:03,260
No. I don't trust you.

2360
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:04,900
- I was just saying.
- For goodness' sake.

2361
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,770
- Two, four...
- I don't know what to do.

2362
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:09,870
What are you doing?

2363
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:13,870
What are you doing?

2364
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,450
What was that?

2365
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:19,750
(Hitting)

2366
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:20,750
What was that?

2367
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:23,820
- What was that?
- Hey, what was that?

2368
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,950
- Why did you break it?
- How could you act like a thug?

2369
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,090
What was that?

2370
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,660
Why did you do that?

2371
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:31,560
- Are you insane?
- Just because you're bored...

2372
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,890
- It isn't like that.
- Seriously.

2373
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:34,130
You should get a loan too.

2374
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:35,530
A loan, my foot!

2375
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:38,800
- He acted like a thug!
- I mean...

2376
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,570
I didn't act like a thug.
It was a mistake.

2377
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:42,270
- It wasn't a mistake.
- It was a mistake.

2378
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:43,340
- If it was a mistake,
- Okay.

2379
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:45,240
- why did you break them?
- It was just wrong.

2380
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,370
Why did you do that?

2381
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:48,010
- It was just wrong.
- Were you apologizing?

2382
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:49,380
- "I'm sorry."
- Were you clapping?

2383
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:50,540
- You know,
- "I'm sorry."

2384
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,510
- I was so flustered.
- It was just wrong.

2385
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:54,050
- I'll get a loan...
- I was so flustered.

2386
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:55,050
- of ten balls.
- It happens.

2387
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:56,350
- "I'm sorry."
- Give me 12 balls.

2388
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:57,820
I was going to get a loan anyway.

2389
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:58,850
Go ahead and get it.

2390
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:00,320
- Hurry up.
- Give me 12 balls.

2391
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,920
Let's do that.

2392
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:02,920
(At that moment)

2393
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,930
- It's a mistake!
- Hey!

2394
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:06,760
- Hey!
- What's wrong with him?

2395
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,730
- What's wrong with him?
- Stay still!

2396
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,700
- I'll break them otherwise!
- This is ridiculous.

2397
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:11,830
- Calm down.
- Stay still!

2398
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:12,970
Calm down.

2399
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:15,140
- Calm down.
- I'll break them otherwise!

2400
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:17,100
- Calm down.
- Sit down.

2401
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,110
- Sit down.
- Take out a loan.

2402
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:19,370
- Sit down.
- I'm crazy right now.

2403
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:22,010
- It was hard to collect them.
- Calm down.

2404
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:23,340
- Okay.
- It'll be a sad episode.

2405
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:26,450
Seriously, I fell down
like an utter fool.

2406
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:30,450
It'll be on the show.

2407
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:31,520
Okay.

2408
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,690
Seriously, I fell down
like an utter fool.

2409
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,760
- Okay.
- Receive them. I'll spin them!

2410
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:37,860
Throw them!

2411
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:38,860
Like this?

2412
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:40,860
Shall I throw them up
and break them by mistake?

2413
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:42,730
No. Okay.

2414
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:43,800
All right.

2415
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,300
- Gosh.
- It was funny.

2416
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,930
- All right.
- He's a thug.

2417
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:50,640
It made no sense.

2418
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,710
- What was that?
- It was a mistake.

2419
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,110
- Hey.
- It was a mistake.

2420
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,610
- Twelve.
- You step on things...

2421
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:57,410
- at home by mistake.
- It happens.

2422
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:59,280
Shall we allow him
to take out another loan?

2423
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,550
- Otherwise, he'll be idle.
- Okay.

2424
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:01,950
- It makes sense.
- Too many questions remain.

2425
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:03,980
- Take out a loan.
- Okay. Give me ten balls then.

2426
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,050
- I won't go all in.
- You must pay back 20 balls.

2427
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:07,090
- Okay.
- Okay.

2428
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:08,320
- Don't go all in.
- I won't go all in.

2429
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,660
- Hold on.
- Okay.

2430
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:11,530
Did I lose two balls?

2431
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:14,460
- I can't believe it. Okay.
- Listen.

2432
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:15,960
You should've taken
good care of them.

2433
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:18,000
- I'll borrow ten balls.
- It's time for the next question.

2434
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,130
I'm so annoyed.

2435
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,640
- I'll do it for a capital question.
- Se Chan is doing well.

2436
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,340
- It's all about the spirit.
- He has a good spirit.

2437
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,880
I'm betting balls on myself
without getting intimidated.

2438
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,310
- You should do that.
- Hey,

2439
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:31,580
- how do you have so many balls?
- Five.

2440
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:34,250
- The Great Dharani Sutra.
- This time, the category is...

2441
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:35,720
capital.

2442
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,380
I'll go all in.

2443
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,090
- What was it earlier? Bolivia?
- I'll go all in.

2444
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:40,590
Seok Jin will bet nine balls.

2445
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,760
I'll bet five balls.

2446
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,020
Seok Jin went all in.

2447
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,690
- I'll bet two balls.
- All right.

2448
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:47,930
(The tiger moth
is revving to go again.)

2449
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:49,060
There he goes.

2450
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:52,370
Jae Seok, slow down.
Bet five balls at a time.

2451
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:53,970
If I bet ten balls,

2452
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:55,270
I'll get 20 balls. Then I'll be set.

2453
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:57,900
Hey, you won't be able
to take out more loans.

2454
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,370
- All ten balls?
- Ten balls.

2455
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:00,410
All right.

2456
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,680
- Two balls.
- All right.

2457
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:04,740
- Me too.
- Two balls.

2458
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,010
I'll bet ten balls.

2459
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:08,750
Do you know how many lives
depend on you?

2460
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,550
Right. I have to do my best.

2461
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:12,220
- Right.
- Yes. Because...

2462
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:14,320
- I'm not trying to be funny.
- Se Chan...

2463
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:15,820
has the highest chance
with capital cities.

2464
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:16,920
- Let's go.
- I'll give you the question.

2465
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,020
Have you all made your bets?

2466
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,660
Please say it slowly so I enjoy it.

2467
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,630
Yes. It's the capital.

2468
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:23,230
- Capital.
- Capital.

2469
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:25,530
What's the capital of Canada?

2470
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:27,030
- Goodness!
- This...

2471
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:28,140
(What's the capital of Canada?)

2472
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:29,740
(Answer: Ottawa)

2473
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:31,540
- It's so easy.
- I'll give you three seconds.

2474
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,110
- I know this.
- What?

2475
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:35,480
- Three,
- This isn't right.

2476
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,680
two...

2477
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,350
- You have to write the answer.
- Really...

2478
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:39,680
- Don't tell me...
- Three,

2479
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:40,710
- No way.
- two...

2480
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:41,780
Hey.

2481
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:42,880
We'll start with Ye Eun.

2482
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:44,220
- "Kangaroo."
- Kangaroo.

2483
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,450
(Kangaroo, not Calgary?)

2484
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:48,690
- Let's see.
- And "Ottawa."

2485
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:49,760
- Correct!
- Let's see.

2486
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:50,820
- Let's see.
- And "Ottawa."

2487
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,590
(That's right!)

2488
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:55,100
- Okay.
- You did this with me.

2489
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,200
- Right.
- Okay.

2490
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,500
- Please reveal your answers.
- Vancouver.

2491
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,770
- Vancouver.
- It's not Vancouver.

2492
01:19:58,770 --> 01:20:00,070
- Good!
- Ottawa.

2493
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:02,500
I paid back ten.

2494
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,310
The category of the next question
is world history.

2495
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:06,770
Originating in the Middle Ages,

2496
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:08,840
what word is
now more commonly used...

2497
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,740
in online games
to refer to a group...

2498
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:12,480
- Right. Easy right?
- formed by players?

2499
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,880
- What is this word?
- It's so easy.

2500
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,950
- I don't know.
- He wrote "milkshake."

2501
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:19,220
- Milkshake.
- Shake.

2502
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,550
Why did you say world history?

2503
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:21,920
- Right.
- You can't trust him.

2504
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,190
- He can't do world history.
- He can't.

2505
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:25,760
Ji Ye Eun.

2506
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,490
- Why are you so discouraged?
- Ye Eun.

2507
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:29,660
She's being beaten.

2508
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:31,300
(Ye Eun hasn't answered
a single question yet.)

2509
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:32,300
It's so...

2510
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:34,230
(Ye Eun hasn't answered
a single question yet.)

2511
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,140
- Did you know?
- I know.

2512
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:38,510
I feel bad.

2513
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,910
Ye Eun.

2514
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:42,280
Don't think of difficult words.

2515
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,180
My spirits are low.

2516
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:46,110
- Cheer up.
- Why are your spirits low?

2517
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:47,110
Let's go!

2518
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:49,420
- It's on Chinese idioms.
- I feel nervous.

2519
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:51,480
- Chinese idioms.
- How...

2520
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,550
- She really...
- It's because she...

2521
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:57,020
My trust in her dropped
after she didn't know "hositamtam."

2522
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,190
- Should I not go?
- Bet two of them.

2523
01:20:58,190 --> 01:20:59,430
I'll bet two.

2524
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,630
How many will you bet, Jae Seok?

2525
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:02,560
- Two.
- Two. Kim Jong Kook bets two.

2526
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,500
- Jae Seok will do...
- Ye Eun still knows the basics.

2527
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:06,600
- Basics. I don't have confidence.
- Just...

2528
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,930
(Cheonghak-dong Ji's confidence
is gone.)

2529
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:09,740
- It's time you get one right.
- Because...

2530
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:10,900
- Ye Eun...
- I'll bet 20.

2531
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,110
(Jae Seok bets 20 and goes all in.)

2532
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:15,210
I'll bet five on Ye Eun.

2533
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,310
- Haha will bet five.
- Do I have to put them in?

2534
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:18,310
- Please put them in.
- I should put them in?

2535
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:19,810
- Haha.
- No, guys. You...

2536
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:21,310
- No.
- What's wrong with you?

2537
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:22,380
- We'll go.
- Are you sure?

2538
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:24,020
- Ye Eun...
- Ye Eun's turn will come.

2539
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:25,390
- It would come at least once.
- She...

2540
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:26,690
- It's time it came.
- Seok Jin.

2541
01:21:26,690 --> 01:21:27,990
Get on the train, Seok Jin.

2542
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:29,960
- I...
- Get on the train.

2543
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,230
will take my risk.

2544
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:34,490
I'll bet six on Ji Hyo.

2545
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,930
- What?
- You can't do that.

2546
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,830
Why not?
You kept getting things right.

2547
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:41,070
- You really can't put it on me.
- We won't have a winner like this.

2548
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,840
- Right.
- Good choice.

2549
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,100
- Ji Hyo.
- Seok Jin.

2550
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,310
- I...
- Well done.

2551
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:46,540
You never know.

2552
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:48,280
- I trust you.
- You never know.

2553
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,710
- I'll give you the question.
- Ye Eun.

2554
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:51,310
- This way, we'll have a winner.
- Please say it slowly.

2555
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:52,580
(Who will get the answer this round
with big money at stake?)

2556
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:54,210
Beat Ye Eun, Ji Hyo.

2557
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:55,850
(The Chinese idiom quiz
is revealed.)

2558
01:21:55,850 --> 01:22:00,650
Gaining great wealth
without much effort.

2559
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:02,590
(The idiom that means:
Gaining great wealth without much effort?)

2560
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:03,820
What? "Gaining great..."

2561
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:04,860
You hear this a lot.

2562
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:06,760
- I'll give you five seconds.
- Hold on.

2563
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,700
- You hear this a lot.
- Think about it.

2564
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,500
- Gaining great wealth...
- Ji Hyo is writing.

2565
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,570
- without much effort.
- Hurry.

2566
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:15,970
- Gaining wealth?
- This is really easy.

2567
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:18,070
- This isn't right.
- It's really easy.

2568
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:19,110
- You earn wealth?
- Yes.

2569
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:22,480
(The idiom that means:
Gaining great wealth without much effort?)

2570
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,080
- It's really easy.
- You earn wealth?

2571
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,680
Gaining great wealth
without much effort.

2572
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:28,950
- You earned it?
- What's that?

2573
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:31,020
- This isn't right.
- Without much effort?

2574
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:32,050
- You earn wealth?
- Yes.

2575
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:33,720
- Wait.
- That's right.

2576
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,960
(Daniel knows the answer.)

2577
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:37,590
- You earned wealth?
- You earn it all at once.

2578
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:38,960
- Four.
- Wait.

2579
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,230
Don't cheat.

2580
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:41,430
- No.
- Gaining great wealth...

2581
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:43,400
- Don't tell her.
- Don't cheat.

2582
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,930
Kick me out
if I lose my bet this time.

2583
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:46,970
She would get it right.

2584
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:48,500
We'll first go with Ji Hyo.

2585
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,840
- Hold on.
- We'll see your answer.

2586
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,840
- Lift your answer.
- Please lift your answer.

2587
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,010
(The answer of Ji Hyo,
Seok Sam's hope, will be revealed.)

2588
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:55,280
- Ryeok?
- You wrote "ryeok."

2589
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,280
What's that?

2590
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,180
Seok Jin's bet was lost.

2591
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,810
- It was lost?
- Daniel.

2592
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,420
- Ilhwakcheongeum.
- That's correct.

2593
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:03,820
- Is that right?
- It's correct.

2594
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:06,190
- That's correct.
- Se Chan's is "earning gold bars."

2595
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,620
- Earning gold bars.
- Let's see.

2596
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,290
- Let's see. Ji Ye Eun!
- It's ilhwakcheongeum!

2597
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:14,330
(Would Jong Kook, Jae Seok,
and Haha succeed in their bet?)

2598
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:18,200
- Geumsangcheomhwa.
- Geumsangcheomhwa.

2599
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,630
(She got it wrong!)

2600
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:21,230
The correct answer
is Ilhwakcheongeum.

2601
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:22,900
Really?

2602
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,270
- It's Ilhwakcheongeum.
- I got it right.

2603
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:28,070
- Let's send him out now.
- I got it right.

2604
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:29,310
Permanently out.

2605
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:30,980
Let's send him out.

2606
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:32,980
- Send him out.
- For this.

2607
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:34,750
He has no right to sit on the board.

2608
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,220
But Ye Eun...

2609
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:38,420
But Ye Eun, this is...

2610
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:39,950
- I know this too.
- Ilhwakcheongeum...

2611
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:41,320
Out of conscience...

2612
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,560
- Send him out.
- Stop it now.

2613
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,790
- You shouldn't bet them...
- He made the bet.

2614
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:45,790
so mindlessly.

2615
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:47,490
It wasn't a mindless bet.
It's her expertise.

2616
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:49,000
I thought she'd get it right
at least once.

2617
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,130
She couldn't even get
Ilhwakcheongeum right.

2618
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:53,330
- She doesn't know hositamtam.
- This is bad.

2619
01:23:53,330 --> 01:23:55,300
- Okay.
- How could she...

2620
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:56,500
- Stop it now.
- Look.

2621
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,510
Just be the MC.

2622
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:00,270
I will get scolded by Mom.

2623
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:02,580
(Chuckling)

2624
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:06,550
Can Ye Eun throw in the towel here?

2625
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:09,550
- She's gone.
- She has lost her mind.

2626
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:12,220
- Round one ended.
- Yes.

2627
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:13,220
(Round 1 ends.)

2628
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:15,320
- Yes. Round One.
- For Round Two,

2629
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:18,390
we'll just do only two questions
that the production crew picked.

2630
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:19,860
- Okay.
- Good.

2631
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:22,730
Will you just give the question
without a category?

2632
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:24,460
- Yes.
- We'll tell you the category.

2633
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,630
- Okay.
- I don't think I'll get it.

2634
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:28,940
Pull yourself together.
You're doing great now.

2635
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:30,900
Why is Daniel doing so badly today?

2636
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,210
- Se Chan is...
- I'll go with the capitals.

2637
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:34,910
- doing good now.
- Okay.

2638
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:36,840
Seriously.

2639
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,880
He'd be really bored.

2640
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:40,080
Right.

2641
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,480
- Okay!
- This question was made...

2642
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:42,620
by the production team.

2643
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:44,080
It's about entertainment.

2644
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,550
- Entertainment.
- Entertainment.

2645
01:24:45,650 --> 01:24:46,820
- This is...
- Entertainment.

2646
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:48,660
- I have to win this.
- Entertainment.

2647
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:50,560
- Do you know this well?
- Girl groups.

2648
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,230
- Do you know this well?
- I really...

2649
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:53,590
- Come on.
- Whatever.

2650
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:55,960
- I really...
- Entertainment.

2651
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,300
(Scooping)

2652
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,470
But Se Chan...

2653
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,400
is playing with it.

2654
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,500
- He's rich.
- I'll put five.

2655
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:05,970
Se Chan is smart.

2656
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:07,340
- I'll put one.
- Put it over here.

2657
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:08,340
Okay. Go!

2658
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:10,080
- This is crazy.
- This is amazing.

2659
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,680
(Daniel submits 2.)

2660
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,310
- Since this is Running Man,
- Let them do it.

2661
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:16,120
the question might be
about idol groups.

2662
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,880
It might be a question
about idol groups.

2663
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:19,850
- Idol groups would be so hard.
- No.

2664
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:21,990
Ye Eun. Are you interested
in the entertainment industry?

2665
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:23,260
- The entertainment industry.
- Yes.

2666
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:24,260
I'm very interested
in the entertainment industry.

2667
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:25,960
- You are?
- Ye Eun might know well.

2668
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:26,990
Here!

2669
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:28,390
- Right?
- Ye Eun!

2670
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:30,300
- I know the entertainment industry.
- I'll boost your confidence.

2671
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:31,330
- Four. I'll go all in.
- Really?

2672
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:32,570
- But it's a bit...
- Four.

2673
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:35,130
(Jee Seok Sam goes all in.)

2674
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,700
It's a bit...

2675
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:39,710
- Four?
- Then I'll bet six. All in.

2676
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:41,710
- On whom?
- Six on Ye Eun.

2677
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:43,210
Ye Eun...

2678
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:45,650
- I'll bet six and go all in.
- In the entertainment industry,

2679
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:47,650
- I'm Gen Z.
- she's on the front line.

2680
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:49,950
- The next one is the last one.
- How many do we have left? Two?

2681
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,080
You can get it wrong.

2682
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,950
- Why do you bet one at a time?
- I bet six on you.

2683
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:55,090
- You'll bet two?
- I bet one of mine too.

2684
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:56,960
- Okay.
- Se Chan is strong in this.

2685
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,260
- All I do at home is watch TV.
- Ye Eun...

2686
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:00,660
- Okay.
- I'll go with Se Chan.

2687
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:02,600
- Yang Se Chan.
- Just two.

2688
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:03,700
- Two.
- Yes.

2689
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,130
- Mister.
- Yes?

2690
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:06,830
- I've been watching you.
- Yes.

2691
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:09,300
I noticed you only placed your bets
on Se Chan.

2692
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,740
- I mean...
- Come on.

2693
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:13,010
I was going to go with Ye Eun,

2694
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:14,270
- I mean...
- but...

2695
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:16,010
It should be distributed.

2696
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:17,310
Bet on Ye Eun.

2697
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:18,950
He doesn't bet on anyone
other than Se Chan.

2698
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:20,750
- He's smart.
- Thank you.

2699
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:23,220
- You bet two on Se Chan.
- Yes.

2700
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:24,650
- I bet four on you, Ye Eun.
- I'll give you the question.

2701
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:26,120
- I bet six.
- You have to get it correct.

2702
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,550
- I don't have any now.
- He bet six.

2703
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:28,720
I want to get it correct.

2704
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:29,960
Become brilliant.

2705
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:31,820
Open your eyes properly.

2706
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:33,290
- Open them.
- Are you upset now?

2707
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:35,560
- I'm sad.
- Then open your eyes properly.

2708
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:36,560
Open them.

2709
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,260
Make them look scary.

2710
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:40,030
- That's right.
- I'll give you the question.

2711
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:43,070
In this Korean drama...

2712
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,370
- released on an OTT platform,
- Yes.

2713
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:48,470
there is a prize
of 45.6 million dollars...

2714
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:49,740
(In this Korean drama
released on an OTT platform,)

2715
01:26:50,410 --> 01:26:51,680
- It's so easy.
- in a survival competition...

2716
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,010
- In a survival competition...
- This is easy.

2717
01:26:54,010 --> 01:26:56,680
that participants
risk their lives for.

2718
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:59,120
- This is so easy.
- What is the title of this drama...

2719
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,690
(What is the title of this drama...)

2720
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:02,120
in English?

2721
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,890
You can do this, right?

2722
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,760
(That was an unexpected twist!)

2723
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,290
- The spelling in English?
- Yes.

2724
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:10,330
- No way!
- I do know the answer.

2725
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:11,860
- Okay.
- Okay.

2726
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:13,770
- Hey.
- The spelling?

2727
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:15,400
- Why are you doing this?
- You're too cruel to them.

2728
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,940
You're really mean.

2729
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:18,910
You can't write the English words
in Korean?

2730
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:20,170
- In English?
- In English.

2731
01:27:20,170 --> 01:27:22,480
- Seriously.
- It was famous...

2732
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:23,810
- worldwide.
- Okay.

2733
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:26,010
- You've seen it a lot.
- You'll know when you see it.

2734
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:27,910
- But...
- I know it.

2735
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:30,750
- He knows the words.
- Don't let him explain it.

2736
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:33,020
- Hold on.
- I'll give you five seconds.

2737
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:34,290
- Is this correct?
- It's a failure.

2738
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:35,960
(Seok Sam and Haha's entire fortune
depends on the tip of Ye Eun's pen.)

2739
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,690
- Daniel would get it right.
- Five.

2740
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:39,530
- I'm sorry. I just guessed it.
- Four.

2741
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:41,460
- Ye Eun seems to know.
- I know it.

2742
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:42,830
But I don't know the spelling.

2743
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:43,960
- What?
- Write it again.

2744
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,030
I think this is correct.

2745
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:47,530
- If she gets it wrong...
- One. Put them down.

2746
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:49,970
Let's reveal the answers one by one.

2747
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,440
- Is it "squid?"
- I don't know.

2748
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:56,110
It's "Squid Game."
You got the spelling wrong.

2749
01:27:56,110 --> 01:27:57,210
- Daniel.
- Seriously.

2750
01:27:57,210 --> 01:27:59,010
Do I have to add "the?"

2751
01:27:59,010 --> 01:28:00,210
- "Squid Game."
- That's correct.

2752
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:01,950
- It's correct.
- Goodness.

2753
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:04,120
- Okay. Se Chan.
- Let's go.

2754
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:05,720
I wrote S, U...

2755
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,850
(Close, but incorrect!)

2756
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,960
- Unfortunately...
- That was close.

2757
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,030
(Did Ye Eun get it right?)

2758
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:14,830
- It's correct.
- It's correct, right?

2759
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:16,530
(She finally got it right!)

2760
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:20,100
Six!

2761
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:22,240
(Haha and Seok Sam made
a huge success.)

2762
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,270
(And Ddochi finally got it correct.)

2763
01:28:25,270 --> 01:28:26,740
Yes!

2764
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:29,080
(So far,)

2765
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:33,810
(she's been watching others
get their answers correct.)

2766
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:37,820
(College graduate Ji Ye Eun
was about to lose her mind.)

2767
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:39,720
- Count it.
- I have eight left.

2768
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:40,820
Do I get two?

2769
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:44,590
(She's finally experiencing
the joy of her first harvest.)

2770
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,230
- It's a relief.
- Her spirit went up.

2771
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,030
- It went up.
- Very much.

2772
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:51,330
You should have answered it
when I bet 20.

2773
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:53,730
- You gained confidence.
- I gained it.

2774
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,500
(Meanwhile, Se Chan couldn't
overcome the English barrier.)

2775
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,110
- Choi Daniel and Ji Ye Eun...
- Jong Kook...

2776
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:00,410
Ye Eun!

2777
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:03,180
I wanted to bet on her,
but I tried to spread out the bets.

2778
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:04,380
- But...
- Ye Eun.

2779
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:05,580
But that's...

2780
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:08,820
I'm starting to see my partner
who'll get the penalty with me.

2781
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,350
I'm losing.

2782
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:11,850
- No.
- Okay.

2783
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:12,950
My gosh.

2784
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:14,490
I suddenly got 12 balls.

2785
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,320
- I have eight.
- You got a loan.

2786
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:18,020
- You should pay it back.
- I already paid it back.

2787
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,290
(Now they have
only one question left.)

2788
01:29:20,290 --> 01:29:21,430
Nice.

2789
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:23,160
- How many do you have?
- I have six.

2790
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,800
- That's a lot.
- I got a lot.

2791
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,500
Really? I see.

2792
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:29,340
- All right.
- Ye Eun got one, but why... I see.

2793
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:30,970
- I got it right.
- Right. You did.

2794
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,870
- Gosh, squid.
- S, q, u, i, d.

2795
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:34,440
- Is that it?
- Squid.

2796
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,080
The expectation is going up.

2797
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,680
This is the last question.

2798
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:39,750
- Okay.
- This is driving me crazy.

2799
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,150
It's really hard to get it right.

2800
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:43,180
- It's hard.
- This time,

2801
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:45,220
the category is...

2802
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:47,350
- literature.
- Literature.

2803
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:48,450
Literature isn't so bad for me.

2804
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:49,890
- I'm not good at literature.
- Ye Eun.

2805
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:51,120
Literature? My gosh.

2806
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:53,760
Daniel is...

2807
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,860
- By the way, Daniel is...
- I'll go all in.

2808
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:58,160
(Daniel goes all in
and bets 6 ice balls.)

2809
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,770
Se Chan is smart.

2810
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,000
- I bet eight balls.
- Eight.

2811
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,240
I like number eight.

2812
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:03,800
This is the last one.

2813
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,100
- I'll go all in. On me.
- Okay.

2814
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,240
All right.

2815
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:07,670
It's the same
unless you take first place.

2816
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:08,710
It's the same
unless you take first place.

2817
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:10,010
How many will you bet?

2818
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:11,540
Let's see what others do.

2819
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:13,410
I'll get a loan. Ten ice balls.

2820
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:14,680
I'll also get a loan.

2821
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,150
All you need in life is one blow.

2822
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:19,190
- I'll also get a loan then.
- What?

2823
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:21,920
I should. Don't you think so?

2824
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,520
- Then...
- We should go big.

2825
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,220
We all should bet
on different members without a loan.

2826
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:26,360
- Right.
- That's better.

2827
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,130
Let's play rock-paper-scissors
and let the winner pick first.

2828
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:29,800
- We can do that without a loan.
- Okay. Let's do that.

2829
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,760
- All right.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2830
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,330
- If you don't get a loan...
- I won't.

2831
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:34,870
- Then...
- The one with the fewest balls...

2832
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:35,870
will pick first.

2833
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:37,240
- I should pick first then.
- Go ahead.

2834
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,400
Okay. I'll go first.

2835
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,670
Let me take care of it.

2836
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:41,070
No.

2837
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:42,310
Don't butt in.

2838
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:43,810
He wants to join them.

2839
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,650
I beat Jong Kook.

2840
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:47,510
(Jong Kook is deep in thought.)

2841
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:49,080
I really have no idea.

2842
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,720
I don't know them.

2843
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:52,050
Seriously...

2844
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:53,820
I really don't know them.

2845
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:55,820
I want to get it right.

2846
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,120
- I will...
- Okay. Go.

2847
01:30:58,930 --> 01:31:00,230
pick Yang Se Chan.

2848
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:01,530
(He picks Se Chan
with the highest correct answer rate.)

2849
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:04,030
You're being too much.
You only bet on Se Chan.

2850
01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:05,360
It's not like that.

2851
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,530
- I'll go all in on Ji Ye Eun.
- Okay.

2852
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:09,540
Mr. Pickled Radish, hurry.

2853
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:11,340
- Daniel!
- Seok Jin!

2854
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:13,510
- I knew it.
- Go.

2855
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,340
Hang on. I can't believe these guys.

2856
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,310
Why did you not bet on Ji Hyo?

2857
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:19,210
- Seriously...
- Would you bet on her?

2858
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:22,010
I ended up like this
because I bet on her.

2859
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:23,180
- Exactly.
- I can get it right.

2860
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:25,180
How would we bet on her
after watching that?

2861
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:26,850
What if they all get it wrong?

2862
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:28,390
- We all lose our balls?
- No one wins.

2863
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:31,260
- This is...
- You all will get penalty balls.

2864
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,530
- Okay.
- There will be no winner.

2865
01:31:32,530 --> 01:31:33,590
Let's go.

2866
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:35,130
Everyone except for the first place
gets the penalty?

2867
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:37,160
- Literature is difficult.
- Here's the last question.

2868
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:38,260
It might be about a person.

2869
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:41,070
This is a short story about
a rickshaw-porter...

2870
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:42,670
- who experienced great luck...
- All right. This is it.

2871
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:45,340
- Hey.
- eventually meets...

2872
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:47,210
- the death of his wife.
- The other day...

2873
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:49,980
"I brought seolleongtang for you,
but why can't you eat it?"

2874
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:52,910
What is the novel
famous for this line?

2875
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:54,980
- Is it a novel?
- We had...

2876
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:56,450
the same question the other day.

2877
01:31:56,450 --> 01:31:58,350
- In a different way.
- The answer was seolleongtang.

2878
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:00,150
The answer was rickshaw-porter.

2879
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:01,450
- Right. Rickshaw-porter.
- Was that it?

2880
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:03,290
In the novel, "A Lucky Day,"

2881
01:32:03,290 --> 01:32:05,930
what is the job
of the main character, Kim Cheom Ji?

2882
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:07,130
Let me answer. Taxi driver.

2883
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:08,900
- My gosh.
- Ji Hyo.

2884
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:12,230
(Will they be able to give
the correct answer, "A Lucky Day?")

2885
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:14,330
- What is it?
- I think I know.

2886
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:16,240
- Hint. Is it a Korean novel?
- I don't read.

2887
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:19,840
- By the way, the question...
- Is it a Korean novel?

2888
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,680
- Seolleongtang.
- The question has the answer in it.

2889
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,980
(Answer: "A Lucky Day")

2890
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:26,080
- I have no idea.
- Rickshaw-porter?

2891
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,380
I don't think this is it.

2892
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:29,520
(Jong Kook gave them
a crucial hint.)

2893
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,680
I have no idea.

2894
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,950
(Did the Empty Heads
pick up on Jong Kook's hint?)

2895
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:34,190
- I don't think this is it.
- This is not it.

2896
01:32:34,190 --> 01:32:35,920
- I don't know.
- If you feel that way, it's wrong.

2897
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:40,090
It has five syllables.

2898
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:43,400
(The last question
to determine the best brainiac.)

2899
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,400
I don't think this is it.

2900
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:45,700
This is hard.
It's a difficult question.

2901
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:47,500
Show us your answers
as I count to three.

2902
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,840
- This is hard.
- Ye Eun, show your answer first.

2903
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:51,570
Actually, I'm not sure.

2904
01:32:51,570 --> 01:32:53,570
(What is the fate of Haha
who went all in on Ye Eun?)

2905
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:56,810
"A Bowl of Udon."

2906
01:32:56,810 --> 01:32:58,140
- Wrong.
- What?

2907
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:00,350
(Haha is broke.)

2908
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:01,780
- What?
- "A Bowl of Udon?"

2909
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:02,850
- Hey.
- This is...

2910
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:04,020
"The Dream of a Rickshaw."

2911
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:05,520
- Wrong.
- What?

2912
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,220
He wrote, "The Dream of a Rickshaw."

2913
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:09,960
What?
Like "Jonathan Livingston Seagull?"

2914
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:12,090
- No?
- They both...

2915
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:15,160
(They both wrote,
"The Dream of a Rickshaw.")

2916
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,460
- Hey!
- See?

2917
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,360
- They cheated.
- You shouldn't cheat.

2918
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,870
I didn't see his answer.
Why would we cheat like this?

2919
01:33:21,170 --> 01:33:23,300
(Jong Kook and Seok Sam are broke.)

2920
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,040
I didn't see his answer.
Why would we cheat like this?

2921
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,410
"A Lucky Day."

2922
01:33:27,410 --> 01:33:28,540
- That's correct.
- My gosh.

2923
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:29,940
- My goodness.
- Amazing.

2924
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:33,510
(Shocked)

2925
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:34,650
- My goodness.
- Amazing.

2926
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,220
(Touched)

2927
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:38,420
- Is this correct?
- Yes.

2928
01:33:39,790 --> 01:33:41,090
- Hey.
- Hey.

2929
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:42,690
(Ji Hyo, who was not chosen
by anyone, got it right!)

2930
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:43,790
It's over.

2931
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,620
- They all are broke.
- Did I get it right?

2932
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:46,930
Ji Hyo, you should've done that...

2933
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:48,490
- when I bet on you.
- Jae Seok.

2934
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,730
- Is it "A Lucky Day?"
- I see.

2935
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:52,430
I only thought of the rickshaw.

2936
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:53,900
Me too.
I only thought of the rickshaw.

2937
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:55,870
The three of you...

2938
01:33:55,870 --> 01:33:57,100
This is hilarious.

2939
01:33:57,100 --> 01:34:00,110
A bowl of udon?
How could you come up with that?

2940
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:01,870
I said the question had
the answer in it,

2941
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:03,210
and they wrote,
"The Dream of a Rickshaw."

2942
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:05,180
- Amazing.
- They both wrote that.

2943
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:06,210
It's funny that
their answers are the same.

2944
01:34:06,210 --> 01:34:08,710
So the four brainiacs.

2945
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:10,050
- The four brainiacs.
- Now,

2946
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:12,820
Jae Seok is unable
to pay off the debt.

2947
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:14,250
So he's the bottom.

2948
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:17,260
The three of you have no ice balls.

2949
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:18,560
- I bet everything I had.
- So none of you will be...

2950
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,860
exempted from the penalty.

2951
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:21,990
- You all will get a penalty ball.
- Okay.

2952
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:23,200
- All right.
- They will pick one ball.

2953
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,100
About these four...

2954
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:26,800
Se Chan has five ice balls.

2955
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:28,430
Daniel has none.

2956
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:29,770
Ji Hyo has three.

2957
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:30,840
What's with Ji Hyo?

2958
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:32,610
And Ye Eun has no ice balls.

2959
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:36,010
The winner of the Empty Head Quiz...

2960
01:34:36,010 --> 01:34:37,410
- is Yang Se Chan.
- It's me!

2961
01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:38,540
(Yang Se Chan)

2962
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:40,110
What is all this?

2963
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:41,380
- What?
- By the way,

2964
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:42,580
it is quite convincing...

2965
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:43,780
- after the competition.
- Thank you.

2966
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:45,280
You are better than them.

2967
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,120
- Thank you.
- You're definitely better.

2968
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:48,990
What did you do?

2969
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:51,020
(He even has the dignity
to take care of other Empty Heads.)

2970
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,190
Give me ten.

2971
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:53,690
Get them.

2972
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:55,260
This is unbelievable.

2973
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:56,560
(Empty Head Captain Certificate)

2974
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:57,700
Seriously, this is...

2975
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:59,200
- My gosh.
- You are outstanding.

2976
01:34:59,370 --> 01:35:00,970
He's exceptional.

2977
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:04,270
So Song Ji Hyo
gets one penalty ball.

2978
01:35:04,270 --> 01:35:06,110
Daniel and Ye Eun get two each.

2979
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:08,270
- We had the same answer.
- We will pick one ball then.

2980
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:09,480
Today,

2981
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,440
Se Chan took first place,

2982
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,450
- so he will pick one ball.
- He will pick it.

2983
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:14,710
- Se Chan.
- This box has...

2984
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:16,480
- the balls of these three.
- Right.

2985
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,750
One of these three...

2986
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:19,020
- will be picked.
- Oh, dear.

2987
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:20,420
The brainiacs first.

2988
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:23,220
(He picks a ball
from the brainiacs' box first.)

2989
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:25,290
- Please.
- Haha.

2990
01:35:25,290 --> 01:35:26,290
- Please.
- Pick Haha.

2991
01:35:26,290 --> 01:35:27,930
Actually, Haha should be one of us.

2992
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:29,560
What are you talking about?

2993
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:31,800
(Haha went all in
on Ye Eun at the end.)

2994
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:34,970
I trusted Se Chan too much today.

2995
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,200
All right.

2996
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,170
- Jong Kook or Haha.
- Mr. Pickled Radish or Haha.

2997
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:40,310
- My goodness.
- I lost too much.

2998
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:41,370
One, two,

2999
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:43,980
three. Haha.

3000
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:45,640
- Haha.
- All right. Haha...

3001
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:46,950
will get the penalty.

3002
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:48,650
- All right.
- I'm sorry.

3003
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:50,420
- He gets picked a lot.
- Okay.

3004
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,020
- Next.
- You belong here.

3005
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:54,590
I think it will be me.

3006
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:55,960
(Picking the Empty Head
to get the penalty)

3007
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:57,620
Just pick one.

3008
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:58,790
(The fierce league of their own)

3009
01:35:58,790 --> 01:36:00,230
Se Chan.

3010
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:03,230
- Say stop.
- Stop.

3011
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:05,160
- Se Chan.
- Yes.

3012
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,270
Ji Ye Eun.

3013
01:36:07,070 --> 01:36:08,170
Three.

3014
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:10,100
Song Ji Hyo.

3015
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:11,870
(Ji Hyo gets the penalty.)

3016
01:36:11,870 --> 01:36:15,270
(Ji Hyo with only 1 ball is picked.)

3017
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:17,610
- This is amazing.
- Ye Eun.

3018
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:19,680
- She gets picked a lot.
- Ji Hyo is picked a lot these days.

3019
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:20,950
- It happens a lot.
- This is amazing.

3020
01:36:21,010 --> 01:36:23,020
- Ji Hyo.
- She rarely gets picked.

3021
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:25,080
Here's today's penalty.

3022
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:27,850
Since we had
a fierce quiz competition today,

3023
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:30,020
you will write
a letter of apology...

3024
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:32,360
- with 5 4-syllable Chinese idioms.
- Come on.

3025
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:34,560
- You will finish it quickly.
- Good for you.

3026
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,430
- You'll be quick.
- I can get it done quickly.

3027
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:37,800
It'll be easy for you.

3028
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,800
- "I went for a quick fortune..."
- That's right.

3029
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,270
- "and ended up going broke."
- Yes.

3030
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,500
Only the members
to get the penalty will stay.

3031
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,370
- The rest of you may go home.
- Let's go!

3032
01:36:45,370 --> 01:36:47,770
- Let's go!
- Yes!

3033
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:50,180
- I'm done with my letter.
- I'll see you later, Ji Hyo.

3034
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,110
(The production crew asked about
a breakfast menu before the shoot.)

3035
01:36:52,110 --> 01:36:53,380
Lobster?

3036
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:54,550
Sirloin steak.

3037
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:56,120
I'd like a buffet.

3038
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,350
Eggs benedict.

3039
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:58,620
Boiled beef slices hot pot.

3040
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:00,220
(That's how the members...)

3041
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:01,790
(gathered together
early in the morning.)

3042
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:03,860
(The dishes they mentioned
carelessly are gathered.)

3043
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:05,930
Who would eat
sirloin steak for breakfast?

3044
01:37:06,230 --> 01:37:07,960
(A breakfast that's too much
will fill the table.)

3045
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:08,990
(He's just cheerful.)

3046
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:10,300
(To collect the dishes
they mentioned)

3047
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:11,460
The interview is not easy.

3048
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:12,570
(The members are out
on the streets!)

3049
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:14,030
(She even uses her beauty?)

3050
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:15,130
Bean sprout gukbap.

3051
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:16,970
- I said that earlier!
- Pork belly!

3052
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,140
(Pork belly for breakfast?)

3053
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,240
(A series of dishes that are
worse than what the members say)

3054
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:22,210
(The lunch hour is coming.)

3055
01:37:22,410 --> 01:37:23,510
We have to hurry.

3056
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:24,540
(Before it gets too crowded
with people for lunch,)

3057
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:26,550
(they have to have breakfast
as soon as possible.)

3058
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:27,710
Do we have to finish this?

3059
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:28,980
It's merciless.

3060
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:30,180
We have only 11 minutes left.

3061
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:31,550
(Who will succeed in
the Breakfast Morning like a miracle?)

3062
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,320
(Miracle Breakfast Morning)
