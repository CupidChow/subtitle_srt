1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,710
- Look at the flowers.
- It's beautiful.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,480
This is really pretty.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,780
- It's a flower bed.
- Cosmos flowers.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,950
Cosmos

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,720
There are many beautiful places
like this in our country.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,920
There are so many,
but we don't know about them.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,920
That's true.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,860
The cosmos flowers are insane.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,790
Above all, the most important thing
is Ye Eun's return.

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,930
- Right.
- Ye Eun is back.

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,830
(Ye Eun returned healthy
after her 3-week break.)

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,370
- Ye Eun!
- Ye Eun!

13
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,800
- Ye Eun!
- You're back healthy!

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,370
- Ye Eun.
- I missed you.

15
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,900
- We...
- Say hello to our viewers.

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,610
Hello.

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,940
(She reports her return
with an even hoarser voice.)

18
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,740
I'm back.

19
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,540
- Her voice is...
- Actually,

20
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,450
- we apologized to Ye Eun.
- Right.

21
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,820
It turns out Ye Eun's double chin
wasn't because of fat.

22
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,120
- It was a thyroid problem.
- It's gone.

23
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,590
- It's gone now.
- It's gone.

24
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,220
- It's gone.
- Yes.

25
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,690
- Anyway...
- All right.

26
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,160
- Ye Eun recovered her health.
- Yes.

27
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,100
- Oh, dear.
- She's fully recovered.

28
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,900
What's wrong with your voice?

29
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,070
- I...
- You should take things easy.

30
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,340
- I recently had a shoot...
- You should work less.

31
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,840
- where I shouted a lot.
- Cut back on your work.

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,440
Seok Jin, you should work more.

33
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,540
Right. I should work more.

34
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,610
His throat is just fine.
He sounds too healthy.

35
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,450
- Too healthy.
- My throat is too healthy.

36
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,620
Right. The thing is,
I'm pressed with work.

37
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,790
I know. It happens.

38
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,490
You work a lot every day.
That's not new.

39
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,790
So I'm having a cough drop.
Please don't get me wrong.

40
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,620
You should have one.

41
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,790
- You're back quickly.
- Sooner than we thought.

42
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,000
Thank you so much for your support.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,430
- All right.
- Good.

44
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,930
- Your voice hasn't fully recovered.
- No.

45
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,600
It hasn't fully recovered yet.

46
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,070
- It'll get better soon.
- You need some time.

47
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,110
Right. That's true.

48
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,440
The sunshine is
beautiful over there.

49
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,080
It's seriously beautiful today.

50
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,450
- It looks amazing.
- Wait a second.

51
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,980
This is really beautiful.

52
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,220
(He suddenly takes out
his Apple phone.)

53
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,120
- That's Young Forty.
- Young Forty!

54
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,420
- This is crazy.
- Young Forty!

55
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,520
Stand together. I'll take a picture.

56
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,620
Young Forty!

57
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,820
This looks nice.

58
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,160
- It's amazing.
- One, two, three.

59
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,330
- Young Forty.
- It's fantastic.

60
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,430
- This is a gift from nature.
- A gift from nature?

61
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,830
He's dressed like...

62
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,370
the Korean Association president
that I like.

63
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,000
- I'm serious.
- Hey, you are now...

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,470
This is the hat
of the Korean Association president.

65
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,470
- Right.
- That's true.

66
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,470
I met the president
in LA a while ago.

67
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,010
- I saw him.
- The president in LA.

68
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,450
(The Korean Association president
in LA is thrilled.)

69
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,550
I didn't know Haha would do that.

70
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,720
It's funny that Haha is
playing along with the joke.

71
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,750
Ha LA.

72
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,420
I'm Ha LA.

73
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,690
Today's race is called
Running Man's Weekly Keyword.

74
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,830
Among the keywords that became
an issue on Running Man last week,

75
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,390
we chose three...

76
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,060
- that require intensive research.
- What?

77
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,060
- Keywords on Running Man?
- What would that be?

78
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,100
- Yes.
- Intensive research?

79
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,630
Each keyword involves
a specific task to take care of.

80
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,040
If all members work together
and take care of all the tasks,

81
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,740
you will get off work
without getting a penalty.

82
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,740
- I see.
- What would it be?

83
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,740
- Let me show you the keywords.
- What are the keywords?

84
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,980
- What are they?
- What?

85
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,240
- What keywords?
- What are the keywords?

86
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,150
- What?
- Is it Young Forty?

87
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,480
Please open the first keyword...

88
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,750
- Number 1?
- Open number 1.

89
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,950
All right. This is Running Man's...

90
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,080
- Weekly Keyword.
- What is it?

91
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,350
- Young Forty.
- Young Forty.

92
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,820
(The first keyword is
Young Forty Ha.)

93
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,960
- It's number one.
- I... Jae Seok.

94
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,030
(I didn't know when I bought this.)

95
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,630
(Haha, the leader of Young Forty
who appeared like a comet)

96
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,700
(Supreme has been popular
since we were young.)

97
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,370
(It became popular as we wore it
when we were young.)

98
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,640
(Young Forties,
gather at Yeouido Park.)

99
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,340
(Young Forty Ha became the talk
of the town as an icon of the times.)

100
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,810
- Young Forty.
- It's number one.

101
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,240
I... Jae Seok.

102
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,610
- Young Forty.
- This morning,

103
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,250
Hyo Im sent me something.

104
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,650
- What did Hyo Im say?
- Seriously...

105
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,950
- I don't know what to make of this.
- Why?

106
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,520
- She sent me a text.
- Okay.

107
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,750
- I'll read it for you.
- What did she say?

108
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,020
"Curious Story Y..."

109
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,090
- It's "Curious Story Y."
- She sent me this.

110
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,990
"'SBS Curious Story Y"
is covering..."

111
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,990
"the lives of people in their 40s,
living with a youthful spirit."

112
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,060
"If you think you're Young Forty,"

113
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,930
"know any Young Forties,"

114
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,470
- "or want to talk about Young Forty,"
- You should be on the show.

115
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,070
- "please contact us."
- She sent it to you?

116
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,810
Why did she send this to me?

117
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,940
- You should contact them.
- I should be on the show?

118
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,540
- This is funny.
- It's funny.

119
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,740
You should be there.

120
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,610
"Curious Story Y" is
a popular TV show.

121
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,620
- Young.
- I'll be there as Baby Forty.

122
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,720
- Anyway...
- As a representative.

123
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,880
- Seriously...
- Haha's been getting...

124
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,050
- a lot of ridiculous nicknames.
- My goodness.

125
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,720
Why am I fighting
with so many people?

126
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,020
So that's how he ends up. How sad.

127
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,730
- Young Forty.
- And...

128
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,590
he always tells them
to gather at Yeouido Park.

129
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,530
I told you to come to Yeouido Park!
Why did you not come?

130
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,830
KBS is the only
broadcasting station...

131
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,000
- that's left in Yeouido.
- Right.

132
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,600
There's nothing left, but he tells
people to come to Yeouido.

133
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,340
(The second keyword
after Young Forty Ha)

134
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,610
- Let's check the second keyword.
- Darn it.

135
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,680
- Let's open it.
- Young Forty is so cute.

136
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,010
- Ji Ye Eun's comeback.
- I see.

137
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,610
(The second keyword:
Ji Ye Eun's comeback)

138
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,020
- Ji Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun.

139
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,520
- Ji Ye Eun.
- Ji Ye Eun.

140
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,450
- Yes!
- Ye Eun, I'm so happy. How nice.

141
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,720
- Right.
- I'm so happy.

142
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,960
- You don't have to talk.
- I really like it.

143
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
- Doesn't your throat hurt?
- I should do this to help...

144
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,990
- my vocal cords close.
- It helps it recover...

145
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,600
- Then Jae Seok...
- It helps the recovery.

146
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,960
- All right. You should talk a lot.
- Okay.

147
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,800
I can tell Ye Eun was well fed
during the break.

148
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,730
- Right. That's good.
- You look nice.

149
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,640
- She looks really good.
- I know, right?

150
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,570
You finally look pretty now.

151
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,710
Next.

152
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,480
- "In his 50s for 3 years?"
- Seok Jin.

153
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
(The 3rd keyword:
In his 50s for 3 years)

154
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,780
- That's me.
- I see.

155
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,220
I'll get 1 year old every 3 years.

156
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,720
- What's that?
- What?

157
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,550
(My Young Fifty
is totally different.)

158
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,420
(You're Young Sixty!)

159
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,520
(I'll make it clear here.)

160
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,200
(The absurd claim
of Mr. Jee Seok Jin, born in 1966)

161
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,830
- I'll be in my fifties next year.
- Why are you being ridiculous?

162
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,100
- Listen.
- It's not ridiculous.

163
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,230
- You said we should accept it.
- Let me be honest with you.

164
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,600
Here's the thing.

165
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,810
If people don't agree,

166
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,710
I'll accept it.

167
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,210
But people think I'm in my forties.

168
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,910
- Come on!
- People think I'm in my forties.

169
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,450
(Flustered)

170
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,810
- That can't be right.
- Seok Jin.

171
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,850
Please. Seok Jin.

172
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,050
What's wrong with him?

173
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,350
What is he talking about?

174
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,320
He's driving me crazy.

175
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,730
I'm being generous
when I say I'm in my fifties.

176
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,460
- That's crazy.
- What are you talking about?

177
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,260
He's actually
six years older than me.

178
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,130
If he doesn't get older next year,
we'll be three years apart.

179
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,530
- Right.
- All right. So,

180
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,800
the first keyword is Young Forty Ha.

181
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,270
The task for this keyword is...

182
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,370
to find a look
that truly suits Haha.

183
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,440
A look that suits me?

184
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,610
- Look?
- Look.

185
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,950
- Haha's look?
- Look.

186
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,180
the representative of Young Forty,

187
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,820
- who always pursues hip fashion.
- Actually,

188
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,890
this is what's important.

189
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,250
It's not something
that suits people in their forties.

190
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,660
We should find something
that suits Haha.

191
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,720
- That's right.
- Exactly.

192
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,360
It should be a look
that we recommend for Haha.

193
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,200
You should just wear
something modern.

194
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,400
So, except for Haha,

195
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,970
the rest of the members will change
into the team uniforms...

196
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,440
- and then go shopping.
- Okay.

197
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,000
- Shopping for me.
- Okay.

198
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,440
Nice. Let's do this.

199
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,340
I should buy something for myself.

200
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,940
Hang on. With Haha...

201
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,010
What should we do about Haha?

202
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,910
There are clothes
that make Haha go crazy.

203
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,380
- When he wears them...
- Something he hates?

204
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,110
- Yes. What he hates.
- Something that suits his age.

205
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,120
Seok Jin.

206
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,480
Instead of something I'd hate,

207
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,350
choose what will make me
a genuine Young Forty.

208
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,390
- No.
- No.

209
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,950
- No.
- We can't do that.

210
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,690
I mean, people can wear
whatever they want.

211
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,790
- Sure.
- That's true.

212
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,860
- There's no certain style...
- Right.

213
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,230
- for a specific age group.
- Of course not.

214
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,230
- That's not it.
- We'll just...

215
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,430
use this as an opportunity...

216
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,630
to find the clothes...

217
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,130
- we want Haha to wear.
- I see.

218
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,670
Clothes that are appropriate
for my age.

219
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,100
- That's right.
- Something like that.

220
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,910
It's something
that Haha doesn't usually try.

221
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,040
- Okay.
- I see.

222
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,210
(Haha's usual fashion style
that everyone hates)

223
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,710
The stylists said this.

224
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,450
He looks like a jaundiced Smurf.

225
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,250
(He's wearing a sleeping bag.)

226
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,580
- Hey, you're too...
- Haha.

227
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,820
(The Jeju carrot sleeping bag look)

228
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,250
His outfit is too much.

229
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,360
(His fashion is too much
like a Hollywood star.)

230
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,190
You look like Zhu Bajie.

231
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,200
(A leader in ridiculous fashion
that only pursues youth and trends)

232
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,730
But I look good in almost anything.

233
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,800
- But...
- You do?

234
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,040
- I know...
- Haha, you know me.

235
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
- what makes Haha...
- Haha.

236
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,210
go crazy.

237
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,440
Jae Seok.

238
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,110
- You should stay with me.
- Okay.

239
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,180
Stay with me.
I can't let you go alone.

240
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,340
It's not like...

241
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,050
- the TV Rating Notice Special.
- That would be too much.

242
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,050
- That was supposed to be a comedy.
- Right.

243
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,980
- We're serious about this.
- We're serious.

244
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,450
It's about sincerity.

245
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,250
- This isn't a joke.
- What we want Haha to wear.

246
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,260
Okay.

247
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,320
- This is what it is about.
- Right.

248
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,760
We're paying for the clothes anyway.

249
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,890
- Right.
- Something I can actually wear.

250
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,530
- Something you can wear.
- Sure.

251
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,860
We won't pick anything ridiculous.

252
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,030
- Okay.
- We'll pick something pretty.

253
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,070
Seriously, something pretty.

254
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,730
- It's for real.
- There are many popular brands.

255
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,200
This place is nice.

256
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,370
I didn't know about this place.

257
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,200
The clothes are just too nice.

258
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,470
I love this place.

259
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,440
You should be serious about this.

260
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,240
I'm excited. We're going shopping.

261
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,440
All right.

262
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,480
With the president
of the LA Korean Association.

263
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,310
- Let's get it.
- Let's go.

264
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,650
Let's go.

265
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,080
President.

266
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,990
Is there a place like this?

267
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,090
This is new.

268
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,290
- Right.
- My goodness.

269
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,590
(Surprised)

270
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,690
I want to buy some clothes here.

271
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,090
- Amazing.
- It's 70 percent off.

272
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,660
It's 70 percent off.

273
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,160
It says it's 70 percent off.

274
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,030
- Nice.
- My gosh. Is it 70 percent off?

275
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,600
This place is great.

276
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,700
This is the style I like.

277
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,700
It's 70 percent off.

278
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,570
You should stay quiet.

279
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,410
This place is a large outlet mall...

280
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,870
with a variety of fashion styles.

281
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,140
When was this place built?

282
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,410
- It looks so good.
- It's really nice.

283
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,180
- I guess it's new.
- It looks so clean.

284
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,050
As I mentioned earlier,

285
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,220
you should choose...

286
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,490
clothes that you want Haha to wear.

287
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,690
Do I have no choice?

288
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,260
- Do I have to wear what I get?
- Yes. The members will choose.

289
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,290
- Haha.
- His shoes too?

290
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,490
- Everything?
- I'll make you look pretty.

291
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,790
Yes, including his shoes.

292
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,660
- It should be a full set.
- A full set?

293
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,300
- I'll be serious.
- Haha will try on...

294
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,230
the clothes you choose for him.

295
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,630
He will choose the final look
after discussing it with you.

296
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,500
For your information,

297
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,410
Haha will wear the outfit
for the rest of the day.

298
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,770
- He can't take it off?
- Actually,

299
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,370
I know what makes Haha go crazy.

300
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,540
Right. You do.

301
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,510
- Jae Seok...
- I'll choose what makes you happy.

302
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,750
We should ask Jae Seok about it.

303
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,750
I'll choose...

304
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,820
- what makes you happy.
- Already...

305
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,480
- We should ask Jae Seok about it.
- I hate it.

306
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,720
Just tie him up.

307
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,250
Please let him stay with me.

308
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,550
- Haha...
- All right.

309
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,590
Please go...

310
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,190
- and pick out Haha's outfit now.
- By the way,

311
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,990
- who will decide on the outfit?
- Let's go.

312
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,190
Let's go.

313
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,460
(What kind of clothes
will they bring?)

314
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,830
- Haha.
- Yes?

315
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,530
Haha, you should pick mine.

316
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,970
- I'll be serious.
- Okay.

317
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,070
Do you want functional clothing?

318
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,670
- Haha.
- That would be better.

319
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,270
Functional clothing
with breathable fabrics?

320
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,810
- Right?
- Okay. Good.

321
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,140
Wide-fitting or narrow-fitting?

322
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,340
Narrow-fitting clothes
are more popular these days.

323
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,950
Okay. Narrow-fitting clothes.

324
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,310
(He sets out after figuring out
the model's preference.)

325
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,820
You know, plain clothes
like checkered shirts?

326
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,350
They make him go crazy.

327
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,660
They make him shudder.

328
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,530
Plain clothes drive him crazy.

329
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,500
He hates plain clothes the most.

330
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,830
(Stylist Yu wants something
different from Haha's usual style.)

331
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,470
(Chuckling)

332
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,530
Something like this.

333
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,270
(A neat, model student look)

334
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,470
This is something Haha would hate.

335
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,570
(This is something Haha would hate.)

336
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,270
(Exhilarated)

337
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,480
Haha would be frustrated.

338
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,750
Hang on. I should choose something
that will upset Haha even more.

339
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,150
Something that would...

340
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,420
make him look like a model student.

341
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,820
Simple and plain clothes
drive him crazy.

342
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,590
Simplicity drives him nuts.

343
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,630
(Yudiana Jones
goes on a treasure hunt.)

344
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,660
That subtle ordinariness.

345
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,960
He would be really frustrated
to see this.

346
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,830
A duffle coat.

347
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,070
(Will he be able to find
something good?)

348
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,170
Like this.

349
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,200
(Will he be able to find
something good?)

350
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,370
Gosh, this is it.

351
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,880
This one.

352
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,410
It's so plain.

353
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,750
Something modest.

354
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,650
(Showing off his front teeth
in satisfaction)

355
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,350
Haha will find this...

356
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,520
This one looks quite modest.

357
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,820
(An achromatic-colored cardigan
for someone who plays go)

358
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,430
(He keeps the gardigan for now
and searches for more.)

359
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,000
(Chuckling)

360
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,900
(Laughing)

361
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,970
Ordinariness.

362
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,670
It doesn't have
any special features.

363
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,770
It's just plain.

364
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,240
Did you pick one?

365
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,840
This...

366
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,450
It's so plain.

367
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,710
(An achromatic-colored collared top)

368
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,850
I personally like
these kinds of plain clothes.

369
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,120
It doesn't stand out too much.

370
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,520
To blend in with the crowd.

371
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,690
(An extremely modest
black-and-white collared top)

372
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,020
(At that moment, Jong Kook)

373
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,190
A jacket.

374
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,690
An ordinary jacket like this.

375
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,860
Something like this.

376
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,230
A jacket like this.

377
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,400
Or something like this.

378
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
(He's busy
looking for something ordinary.)

379
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,430
A jacket like this.

380
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,400
I like this jacket.

381
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,340
(While the stylists are obsessed
with ordinariness...)

382
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,370
Gosh, this place is...

383
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,470
The clothes look nice.

384
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,070
- They have many women's clothes.
- The clothes...

385
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,980
We came to a mall
with a lot of sophisticated clothes.

386
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,480
Seriously, this place is...

387
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,180
- so nice.
- Is this for men or women?

388
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,310
You should wait here.
I'll be serious...

389
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,580
and pick something nice for you.

390
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,790
Only those who are clumsy
would want to pick something funny.

391
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,250
- That's just lame.
- Seok Jin,

392
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,260
I like boot-cut jeans too.

393
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,820
(Master Jee really wants
to dress Haha up.)

394
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,860
- You do?
- Yes.

395
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,760
How about an unbalanced look
with hip pants...

396
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,260
and a formal jacket like this?

397
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,070
I think it will be nice.
I'm serious.

398
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,300
I'm not lying.

399
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
Seok Jin, this is really...

400
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,010
I...

401
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,570
Seok Jin, this is really...

402
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,780
(A half-length coat
that makes your legs look short)

403
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,080
Seok Jin, this is really...
I'm begging you.

404
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,650
- That's my least favorite style.
- This is...

405
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,720
This is the style
I want to avoid the most.

406
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,020
This is actually...

407
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,520
the most popular thing
among those in their forties.

408
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,760
Haha.

409
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,260
You're Young Forty
because you're dressed like this.

410
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,560
At your age...

411
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,360
This is what my juniors would wear.

412
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,930
But I avoid things like that.

413
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,330
This is...

414
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,940
This is it.

415
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,940
- It's perfect.
- I really hate that.

416
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,940
Why did you suddenly
change your choice?

417
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,010
Look at this.

418
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,080
This is a very neat work outfit.

419
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,750
(A neat work outfit
for office workers in the fall)

420
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,610
With these, you need grey pants.

421
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,820
This is driving me nuts.

422
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,280
Daniel, you should save me.

423
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,050
Haha, I know your style.

424
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,120
- You know my style, right?
- Haha.

425
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,390
- I know what you like.
- Choose something dandy.

426
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,720
Something dandy.

427
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,520
- You know I wear dandy styles.
- Right.

428
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,760
- Something dandy.
- Do that for me.

429
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,730
- Haha.
- It looks strange already. What?

430
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,360
You can wear cotton pants with this.

431
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,900
Cotton pants with this.

432
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,670
You can wear cotton pants with this.

433
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,370
(Another half-length coat)

434
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,670
- Haha, this is really...
- It's so annoying.

435
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,800
This is the classic dandy look.

436
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,340
- This is the most awkward fit.
- Haha.

437
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,010
I know what's dandy. Just wait.

438
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,640
Don't do that!

439
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,950
This is not dandy at all.

440
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,320
This is more like the daddy look.

441
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,420
Haha.

442
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,520
(Ddochi is here
to get her outfit confirmed.)

443
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,590
Haha.

444
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,790
- Yes?
- What do you think of this?

445
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,760
Hey, do you have a death wish?

446
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,290
Hey.

447
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,430
(A cool-toned purple shirt
and gray suit pants)

448
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,760
Hey!

449
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,800
(They all think of the same thing.)

450
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,930
- What do you think of this?
- Ji Ye Eun.

451
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,000
- This is it.
- Stop it.

452
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,170
- I like that.
- It looks good.

453
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,870
- A social studies teacher.
- It's funny.

454
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,670
The social studies teacher
at my school dressed like this.

455
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,570
- It's funny.
- That's a good one.

456
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,710
My social studies teacher
used to dress like this.

457
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,640
Haha, you should remember
the brand name here.

458
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,650
Seok Jin, don't do this!

459
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,580
I'm serious, Daniel.

460
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,680
Hey!

461
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,920
(Everyone is picking clothes
only at this place.)

462
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,990
I should go upstairs and look.

463
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,320
I intentionally chose
a tight one for the top...

464
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,590
and a loose one for the bottoms.

465
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,760
- That's good.
- Like this.

466
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,590
- I love that.
- Good. That's it.

467
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,730
This is driving me crazy.

468
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,900
- This is so pretty.
- Go with that.

469
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,770
(Ta-da)

470
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,100
Who picked that crappy shirt?

471
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,670
(Extremely proud)

472
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,840
- Who...
- See?

473
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,310
See? He just swore.

474
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,540
Who was that?

475
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,480
Was that you?

476
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,650
(He knows exactly
what makes Haha go crazy.)

477
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,920
- Gosh, seriously...
- Haha.

478
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,320
Haha.

479
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,390
(Ta-da)

480
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,690
Come on!

481
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,060
That's actually better.

482
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,560
Okay.

483
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,130
The clothes here
remind me of Osan High School.

484
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,000
My old school.

485
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,960
I really miss my teachers.

486
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,800
I don't want people from this brand
to get the wrong idea.

487
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,930
They're pretty.

488
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,870
This reminds me of my old teachers.

489
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,970
(He has some alone time.)

490
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,170
Mr. Kang Seong Mun,
how are you doing?

491
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,240
(To Mr. Kang Seong Mun)

492
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,910
I miss you.

493
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,410
Mr. Song Gi Hyeok,
are you doing well?

494
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,980
When I looked at the clothes today,

495
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,650
I was reminded of you.

496
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,790
I'm now a father of three.

497
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,720
(At that moment, Ssaebssaeb
in the fitting room)

498
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,160
(Thinking)

499
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,730
I can tell once I try them on.

500
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,360
Wide-fitting or narrow-fitting?

501
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,300
(What do Haha's slim-fit pants
that Se Chan chose look like?)

502
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,530
This is perfect.

503
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,200
Isn't this perfect?

504
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,270
(Tight)

505
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,440
Right?

506
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,480
(The pants fit him tight
below the knees.)

507
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,710
This is nice.

508
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,180
How is this not pretty?

509
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,350
(He tried it on
in case it wasn't a snug fit.)

510
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,350
Right? This is the perfect fit.

511
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,380
Also, I think...

512
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,490
(What will he pair
with those pants?)

513
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,220
This is what Haha needs.

514
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,220
As you know, Haha likes
to wear a variety of colors.

515
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,560
He adds color here and there.

516
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,260
I want him to wear clothes
in a single color.

517
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,330
(Hunting for a top
with the same color)

518
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,100
I don't mind this two-color top.

519
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,340
This looks like what
someone his age would wear.

520
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,340
(Stylist Yang's pick:
A tone-on-tone brown hiking outfit)

521
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,140
Size 100. Okay, good.

522
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,980
I'm not trying
to be funny with this.

523
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,980
(Reflecting Haha's preference,
from fit to functionality)

524
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,410
I'm worried
this will look like a joke.

525
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,150
- Seok Jin.
- Yes?

526
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,520
We should put him in hiking boots.

527
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,520
- Is that so?
- Give him functional shoes.

528
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,760
- These look good.
- You're right.

529
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,060
- Right?
- Doesn't this look good?

530
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
(Carefully selecting
accessories for him)

531
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,390
This looks great on me.

532
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Like this.

533
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,000
Isn't this a pretty average look?

534
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,500
These two are neck and neck.

535
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,200
We're creating a fashionista today.

536
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,500
These are great.

537
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,870
You've brought
a lot of clothes for him.

538
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,010
You'll create about three outifts
for Haha to try on,

539
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,010
and we'll see
what he looks like in them.

540
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,580
He'll then choose one of the looks.

541
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,820
- Do we need to create an outfit?
- About three outfits?

542
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,720
- But I like what I chose.
- Let's take a look.

543
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,850
- This is great.
- Sure.

544
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,120
Why don't I go first?

545
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,060
- Please explain your look.
- Are you kidding me?

546
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,060
(Seok Sam presents his look first.)

547
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,690
I...

548
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,960
recently visited
the community service center...

549
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,230
to run some errands,

550
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,270
and the manager's outfit that day
impressed me.

551
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,840
He was in his 40s,

552
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,770
- and this is what he wore.
- That's nice.

553
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,470
(The outfit of a manager
at a community service center)

554
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,640
- Nice.
- That's a good look.

555
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,840
- I like the coat.
- I like it.

556
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,810
- That's pretty.
- This is the vibe.

557
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,150
- It's perfect for this weather.
- Right.

558
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,910
This is the vibe.

559
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,650
It'll get you through
any job interview.

560
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,680
- That's it.
- You'll look like a hard worker.

561
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,220
- With that outfit, he'll wear...
- Right.

562
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,190
- functional shoes.
- Exactly.

563
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,220
- Can you present them?
- Sure thing.

564
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,930
- These are the shoes.
- The white ones.

565
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,690
- That's good.
- How comfortable is that?

566
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,930
- That's nice.
- He wore sneakers like that.

567
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,500
- He wore this in the office.
- Like this.

568
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,770
- This is what he wore.
- Nice color.

569
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,100
- He was wearing this.
- That's the look.

570
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,570
- The shoes are nice.
- I was quite impressed.

571
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,610
- That's right.
- I made a mental note of it.

572
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,240
- Nice. I like them.
- That's what I chose.

573
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,780
- Let's see what Ye Eun has.
- And these socks.

574
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,410
I went with a simple outfit.

575
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,610
- Those look nice.
- I tried matching this...

576
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,850
with a jacket,

577
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,580
but it killed the shirt.

578
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,980
- I like that.
- Instead,

579
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,920
I went with
a social studies teacher look.

580
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,260
They go around dressed like this.

581
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,360
I love it.

582
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,260
(No matter the school,
we all know "that" teacher.)

583
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,030
- He can wear those sneakers.
- As for the shoes...

584
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,930
School teachers always wear...

585
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,800
- slippers.
- Absolutely.

586
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,770
You wanted to dress him up
like a teacher.

587
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,230
- Yes, like a teacher.
- That's right.

588
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,040
- In his 40s.
- A teacher in his 40s.

589
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,170
I quite like that look.

590
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,810
- Ssaebssaeb's next.
- I'll go.

591
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,710
Older guys, around 45 to 47,

592
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,140
- all dress like this.
- Exactly.

593
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,280
- Exactly.
- Right.

594
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,510
(A jacket paired
with a hiking outfit)

595
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,780
- Functional clothes...
- Who pairs a jacket with that?

596
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,280
Here's why.

597
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,650
There might be times...

598
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,020
- when you need to look formal.
- Unbelievable.

599
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,260
(There's a reason.)

600
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,430
You always keep this jacket
in your car.

601
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,290
- That's funny.
- It's true.

602
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,400
- He's right.
- To look formal...

603
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,470
- With this hiking outfit...
- Yes, exactly.

604
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,170
They always carry around
a formal jacket just in case.

605
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,200
- He's right.
- That's the idea behind my look.

606
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,410
- Nice. You chose functionality.
- That's right.

607
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,640
Ji Hyo's up next.

608
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,970
I...

609
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,480
I imagined an office worker
who wants to look stylish...

610
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,180
on the weekend.

611
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,780
- That's stylish.
- Those look nice.

612
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,590
- That's too nice. He'll look young.
- Jeans and...

613
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,850
- a sweater.
- That looks stylish!

614
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,250
- That looks nice.
- He'll look young in that.

615
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,590
- That's a good outfit.
- Let me see.

616
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,120
- He'll look young in that.
- Wait!

617
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,830
- I like this outfit.
- No way.

618
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,090
- This is what I want.
- He likes it too much.

619
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,500
- That's too nice.
- No way.

620
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,430
I imagined a dad with two kids...

621
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,700
- taking them out on a weekend.
- That's pretty.

622
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,600
- Jong Kook, those look nice.
- I took it seriously.

623
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,240
I chose an outfit...

624
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,710
- that looks like this.
- That's good.

625
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,380
- Won't he look sharp?
- That's a good one.

626
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,610
I was inspired by the older men...

627
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,080
- at the go club I saw...
- Nice.

628
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,110
when I dropped my dad off.

629
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,580
- I love it.
- So it's the old gentleman look?

630
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,260
(Every look has a story behind it.)

631
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,660
- I love it.
- So it's the old gentleman look?

632
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,190
- That's nice.
- I like it too.

633
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,690
- Isn't mine stylish?
- I like our options.

634
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,530
- Look.
- These pants have a nice touch.

635
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,400
- These are good quality pants.
- We chose the same one.

636
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,670
- I love it.
- All right.

637
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,970
I like what you all chose.

638
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,300
- Sure.
- Our pants are the same.

639
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,500
- Wait, the pants.
- The pants.

640
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,570
- Sure.
- Our pants are the same.

641
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,940
- Wait, the pants.
- The pants.

642
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,140
- Check it out.
- We chose the same pants.

643
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,510
- Do you know why?
- They're the same pants.

644
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,510
Haha absolutely detests
elastic waistbands.

645
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,050
- Let me say this again.
- But these pants are nice.

646
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,620
The designers of these clothes
should know...

647
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,190
- that we absolutely love them.
- Of course.

648
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,890
- However, Haha...
- It's just him.

649
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,490
- This isn't what he likes.
- The clothes are nice,

650
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,690
- but...
- I'll say this again.

651
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,390
- I just don't like them.
- These clothes are amazing.

652
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,490
They're great.

653
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,760
- Haha...
- I don't mind...

654
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,500
ordinary outfits like these,

655
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,330
but how about this?

656
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,070
Would you look at that?

657
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,070
- With white sneakers.
- Let's pair that...

658
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,140
- with other pants.
- Just the pants.

659
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,170
Pair it with these pants.

660
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,640
- But that...
- Brown pants?

661
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,140
- Brown pants...
- I'm against it...

662
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,210
- because it's too retro.
- He's right.

663
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,710
He'll look stylish in them.

664
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,980
- Stylish?
- Match the colors.

665
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,250
That's not a good choice.

666
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,120
- Those pants look nice.
- What about this backpack?

667
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,420
- I quite like that.
- Those pants...

668
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,420
- Isn't this a pretty shirt?
- It is.

669
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,160
- Hold on.
- Let's mix and match.

670
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,960
- When...
- Present the first outfit.

671
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,790
When did you become so quick
to get along?

672
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,000
- The first look...
- You haven't argued once.

673
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,730
- Give him these pants.
- Why don't we put him in these?

674
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,300
- We'll go with the white pants.
- We can give him three looks.

675
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,900
- But that...
- That's too pretty.

676
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,670
Jae Seok, let's go
with Ye Eun's outfit first.

677
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,770
- Yes, give him mine first.
- Go with the simplest look.

678
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,310
It's the simplest look
with only two items.

679
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,570
- Sure.
- It's just these two.

680
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,040
- What about the shoes?
- Try them on.

681
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,610
- Shoes?
- The sneakers.

682
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,740
- Match that to every look.
- The sneakers.

683
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,910
That'll go with every outfit.

684
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,150
- The shoes will always be that.
- Let's always go with those shoes.

685
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Like this.

686
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,620
(Laughing)

687
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,560
(The stylist and the one
who has to wear it both laugh.)

688
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,990
The shirt has to be tucked in.

689
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,530
Make sure to tuck in the shirt.

690
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,230
Despite what we think,

691
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,770
- He can be serious.
- Haha can pull off this look.

692
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,600
- No way.
- He looks good in a lot of things.

693
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,900
You can't go wrong with that.

694
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,800
This coat is pretty.

695
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,310
Why do the pants
have an elastic waist?

696
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,280
That...

697
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,510
Do I have to tuck in the shirt?

698
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,850
- Yes.
- Of course.

699
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,950
- You must.
- Tuck in the shirt.

700
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,880
- Haha, don't be too stylish.
- I can't wait.

701
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,020
Don't try to look stylish.

702
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,020
How can I make this look stylish?

703
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,420
That'll be impossible.

704
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,960
We're putting him in clothes
that won't help him stand out.

705
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,990
- That's right.
- An ordinary outfit.

706
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,020
Making him look ordinary...

707
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,560
- and average...
- That's our task.

708
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,960
- is our mission.
- Of course.

709
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,600
- He'll look average in that.
- Haha loves flashy clothes.

710
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,260
It shouldn't look like a penalty.

711
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,530
- Exactly.
- Keep it bland.

712
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,200
- It should be bland.
- "Why is Haha..."

713
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,100
Choose clothes that he might wear.

714
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,640
(How does he look
in the first outfit?)

715
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,640
- Are you done? Let's look.
- It can't be a penalty.

716
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,280
- Are you done? Let's look.
- It can't be a penalty.

717
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,810
(Trudging)

718
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,710
Check out the pants.

719
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,980
(A manager in his latter years...)

720
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,180
(trying to catch a cab
after a team dinner)

721
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,490
Young Forty.

722
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,060
I quite like this shirt.

723
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,390
- Check out his shoes.
- No way.

724
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,390
Can't you try on the jacket?

725
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,900
(He's at his boss's beck and call.)

726
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,630
Haha, try on the jacket.

727
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,570
- Just once.
- Try this on.

728
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,240
- Come on. Just this once.
- Try on the jacket.

729
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,640
- Try it on.
- I'll hold your mic.

730
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,910
That jacket will work.

731
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,140
- I think it'll work too.
- The jacket fits.

732
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,410
- I love it.
- This is nice.

733
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,410
- Nice!
- No, take it off.

734
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,350
- Yes!
- No, take it off.

735
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,910
- It's too nice.
- It looks too nice.

736
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,780
- Try this on instead.
- Try on the cardigan.

737
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,090
- Try this on.
- Try on the cardigan.

738
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,890
- I love it.
- This is great.

739
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,860
- Nice!
- There you go.

740
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,860
- This is great.
- Teacher Ha!

741
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,060
This is the look.

742
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,830
- This is it.
- We have our first outfit.

743
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,460
- The cardigan looks too nice.
- It looks stylish.

744
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,900
The cardigan's pretty.

745
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,930
- This jacket is better.
- It's pretty.

746
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,430
The shirt is too nice.

747
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,300
- Haha, how about this? Try this on.
- Try that on.

748
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,600
This short coat.

749
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,740
- Try on this short coat.
- It's like this.

750
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,510
- It can't be a comedy skit.
- I hate this.

751
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,710
- Give him everyday clothes.
- That's right.

752
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,640
This is the one.

753
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,480
This is the one.

754
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,610
I hate this!

755
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,490
(Manager Ha is in agony.)

756
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,720
You look better in longer jackets.

757
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,160
This is the length
that I absolutely hate!

758
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,730
- This is the one.
- I don't think so.

759
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,160
- The colors match.
- Styling matters, doesn't it?

760
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,630
- Check out those pants.
- Hey.

761
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,800
- Go ahead.
- You look about ten years older.

762
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,240
We're good. We have the look.

763
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,540
- Finally.
- You've found yourself.

764
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,080
You look your age now.

765
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,380
- Exactly.
- He looks his age.

766
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,050
- You look grown up now.
- You look like a gentleman.

767
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,910
- Now...
- You look good.

768
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,450
- You look like a dad of three now.
- Exactly.

769
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,380
- You look like Dream's dad now.
- You finally look your age.

770
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,020
You look like a dad now.

771
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,750
- Clothes...
- Clothes are like wings.

772
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,320
- They made him look his age.
- He now looks his age.

773
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,960
Dream, So Wool, here I am.
This is your dad!

774
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
(The K-breadwinner
who loves his kids)

775
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,830
- Try this on.
- Try this on.

776
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,100
- That and this jacket is a must.
- Yes.

777
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,230
That and this jacket.

778
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,670
- Haha, wear this.
- You look great.

779
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,200
- Leave this here.
- I feel so proud.

780
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,840
Haha, those pants...

781
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,540
- Those are a no.
- They're classy.

782
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,540
(The second look
is Jae Seok's pick.)

783
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,280
- You look like Leon.
- I can go into town.

784
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,640
- You look like Leon.
- I can go into town.

785
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,680
It's a downtown look.

786
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,750
I like this.

787
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,320
- The pants are a no.
- It's pretty.

788
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,080
- Forget those pants.
- It's pretty.

789
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,650
- You look like a golfer.
- I think...

790
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,920
- the first look...
- That was nice.

791
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
That's a must.

792
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,730
If I stand like this,
it looks a bit better.

793
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,260
- But that's...
- You're finding ways to tweak it.

794
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,960
You're finding ways to tweak it.

795
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,770
Haha hasn't worn anything fitting...
Let's see.

796
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,830
- My word.
- Let's see.

797
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,300
Nice. That's the perfect look.

798
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,040
(An ultra-fitting hiking look)

799
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,940
Zip it up to the top.

800
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,940
(Turning away)

801
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,980
- These are the pants.
- Yes.

802
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,820
- I hate this.
- Haha.

803
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,280
- The jacket's pretty.
- Haha.

804
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,520
The jacket with the first look
is too good.

805
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,390
You look great, Haha.

806
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,120
- This is...
- Haha!

807
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,630
- Give me that jacket.
- What should we do?

808
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,930
No, give him that jacket.

809
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,930
- You've been working out.
- It looks like it.

810
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,200
He has pretty firm
glutes and thighs.

811
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,130
- He has a nice lower body.
- Yes.

812
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,970
I like that.

813
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,100
(He tried on a downtown look
and a family-event look too.)

814
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,040
- A realtor I know wears this.
- Yes.

815
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,340
Go with the first look.

816
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,570
- Number one.
- Yes, go with that.

817
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,740
- We decided.
- Haha's new look... In 1, 2, 3.

818
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,340
- Number one.
- Number one.

819
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,580
Haha,
change into the first outfit...

820
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,120
and join the rest of the members.

821
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,420
- I think I'm...
- Can we dress Seok Jin...

822
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,920
- I think there's nothing for me.
- as a bonus round?

823
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,220
- Yes, that's fine.
- Will he try this on?

824
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,220
- No, Seok Jin's...
- What he chose.

825
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,920
- What he chose.
- The clothes he chose.

826
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,830
He'll look good in that.

827
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,460
- I'll look good in this.
- Those items suit him.

828
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,600
They work on him.

829
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,970
In real life, Seok Jin wears...

830
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,030
This brand is for people
around my age.

831
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,030
- My age.
- It's nice.

832
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,240
- It's my dad's look.
- My age range...

833
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,570
- Yes, Ye Eun's dad's look.
- Yes.

834
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,470
Seok Jin,
when you wear dark colors...

835
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,340
- that are gloomy...
- Yes, they don't suit me.

836
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,510
They suit you well.

837
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,110
- Those colors...
- For your age.

838
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,620
- What?
- At my age...

839
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,550
- Why did you interrupt him?
- That punk...

840
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,290
Why did you interrupt Daniel?

841
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,290
I didn't interrupt him.

842
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,920
- That's more your age.
- Yes.

843
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
You dressed like one of us so far.

844
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,530
- Right?
- My gosh.

845
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,730
The struggle to look young
is so funny to me.

846
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,660
- Seriously.
- It's hilarious.

847
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,600
- The fit of the pants...
- Haha, it's so funny.

848
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,100
- Seriously.
- The fit of the pants...

849
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,440
Seok Jin. Hey, you look good.

850
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,940
- Hey.
- Does he look his age?

851
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,340
He pulls it off.

852
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,710
Yes.

853
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,240
- Come over here.
- What a look.

854
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,850
- Stand over here.
- An old man...

855
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,710
- who's well-groomed.
- You look good.

856
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,120
A well-groomed old man.
It's perfect for you.

857
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,920
I look like a CEO.

858
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,690
- He looks his age.
- Does he?

859
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,760
For real? How does he look?

860
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,820
You look like...

861
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,730
You look like...

862
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,500
(Austere)

863
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,970
It really fits.

864
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,200
(A middle-aged man,
well-aged like whisky)

865
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,240
- What do you think?
- Gosh, Seok Jin.

866
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,970
- Seok Jin.
- This look...

867
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,140
A vice principal.

868
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140
- A vice principal.
- Seok Jin.
Honestly.

869
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,640
- Your mic.
- Wear your mic.

870
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,510
- Does this really look...
- Wait.

871
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,080
Manager Ha!
The managing director's here.

872
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,380
Hello. I heard a lot about you.

873
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,820
(A day at the office)

874
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,490
How are things going?

875
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,790
- I heard a lot about you.
- Good.

876
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,960
- Let's have lunch together.
- I'd love that.

877
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,390
- Dakgalbi?
- Director.

878
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,330
Are the pants a uniform?

879
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,600
The pants?

880
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,030
- Are the pants a uniform?
- The pants?

881
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,330
(Mysterious pants
that calm your look)

882
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,440
- You got them from there, right?
- That's right.

883
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,140
You're right.

884
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,140
- Let's take a photo.
- Director.

885
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,840
Thank you for coming on Running Man.

886
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,640
- Sure.
- Seok Jin looks his true age.

887
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,850
- You should've told us beforehand.
- You look so good.

888
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,280
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.

889
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,220
Let's take a group photo.

890
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,420
- Yes.
- Come on.

891
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,720
- Join us.
- Join in.

892
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,020
- Okay.
- Come and say hi.

893
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,220
- Us too?
- He's the new director at SBS,

894
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,820
and he's a new chief producer.

895
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,090
Hello, sir.

896
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

897
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,790
- Hello.
- Thanks for your hard work.

898
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,860
- Sure.
- You're the reason...

899
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,500
- SBS is doing so well.
- Thanks.

900
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,700
How about a handshake?

901
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,700
The new director.

902
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,500
A group cheer for Running Man.

903
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,670
- One, two, three, Running Man.
- Running Man.

904
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,040
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

905
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,870
Even I think this is a crazy photo.

906
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,110
It suits you so well.

907
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,980
Manager Ha, let's go get lunch.

908
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,950
- Where...
- Good luck with the shoot!

909
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,550
- Running Man's the best!
- Let's go!

910
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,850
- Let's go!
- Wait.

911
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:09,590
He fastened this button,
and I think it should be open.

912
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,190
- Haha.
- It should be undone.

913
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,560
The jacket button...

914
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,290
- Seriously.
- That should be undone.

915
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,230
- It should be open.
- Undo the button.

916
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,030
- Undo it. He tried to look good.
- He tried to look good.

917
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,530
- Let me see.
- We must see the shirt.

918
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,760
- That's wrong.
- It must be visible.

919
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,170
- It must be open.
- Don't try to look good.

920
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,870
That shirt button
should be undone too.

921
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,970
- Undo the top button.
- That should be open.

922
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,440
And stuff the rest into the pants.

923
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,610
- That's it. That's the way.
- That's so funny.

924
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,340
- You look much better.
- That's more our age.

925
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,250
- You look normal now.
- That's why Young Forty is a thing.

926
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,180
The total amount you spent
on Haha's new look...

927
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,450
includes everything
from his shoes to his jacket.

928
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,950
- It's 319 dollars 60 cents.
- That's not too bad.

929
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,090
- That's cheap.
- It costs a lot to be Young Forty.

930
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,830
- Great.
- We'll decide who pays...

931
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,130
- with a mission.
- Really?

932
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,500
The mission is called Untangle.

933
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,470
- What's that?
- Without using your hands,

934
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,740
with just your feet and body,
you must untangle a cord.

935
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,340
You play in a group of four,

936
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,410
and the losing four
will foot the bill.

937
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,810
- Okay.
- Okay.

938
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,580
- How does this work?
- Is this timed?

939
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,180
- Hang on. Wait.
- I can't see it.

940
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,850
- We must move.
- Are you ready?

941
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,380
- What should we do?
- What's happening?

942
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,720
- Ye Eun, you keep still.
- Okay.

943
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,420
- Ye Eun, keep still.
- Hunch lower.

944
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,660
- Ye Eun, keep still.
- Okay.

945
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,330
Move faster! Why are you so slow?

946
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,930
Go under again.

947
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,930
Once more!

948
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,000
Who is it?

949
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,500
- Hey!
- Who is it?

950
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,970
- It's me!
- It's you.

951
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,570
- I could've gone too.
- It's me!

952
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,100
- I could do this instead.
- It's me.

953
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,240
It's me!

954
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,110
- It's me!
- Once more.

955
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,110
- Go.
- We're done.

956
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,740
- We're done.
- We did it.

957
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,910
You took 3 minutes and 9 seconds.

958
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,780
- Okay. That's not bad.
- You took 3 minutes and 9 seconds.

959
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,950
Go over.

960
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,120
(Jae Seok, Haha, Ji Hyo, Seok Sam)

961
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,520
Hey, go slow!

962
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,290
- Sit.
- The head should stay low.

963
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,450
(Yelling)

964
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,920
(Team Jae Seok is
moaning from the start.)

965
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,730
- One move from you, and we're done.
- Go over the cord.

966
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,930
- Move.
- You move!

967
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,660
- Jump over the cord!
- Over...

968
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,300
- Jump over!
- Okay!

969
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,130
It's 3 minutes and 41 seconds.

970
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,230
We won.

971
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,770
- The first team won.
- All right.

972
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,570
I thought we'd have a disadvantage.

973
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,570
(Team Jae Seok
including Haha must pay!)

974
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,940
Do we four pay?

975
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,340
The four members
of the losing team...

976
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,950
- have to split the bill.
- Okay.

977
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,180
- It's 319 dollars and 60 cents.
- Okay.

978
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,120
- Just one of us?
- Pick a random number...

979
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,520
to decide the order you pay
and pay whatever amount you want.

980
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
- A loyalty game.
- A loyalty game.

981
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,220
- We pay in order?
- It's all about loyalty.

982
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,930
- You're done for if you go last.
- The numbers are 1 to 4.

983
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,400
- Number four...
- That's just the order.

984
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,230
I think number four will pay it all.

985
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,100
- The one you touched.
- Good. This is fun.

986
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,030
- This is fun.
- Number four will pay it all.

987
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,540
We should all chip in.

988
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,970
It's the worst if I'm four.

989
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,310
Who goes first?

990
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,310
If you're number four,
you'll pay for this yourself.

991
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,110
- Show us your numbers.
- Gosh, I'm number one!

992
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,410
Pay ten cents.

993
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,480
Pay at least ten cents.

994
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,520
I go second.

995
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,180
Jae Seok doesn't mind paying.

996
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,320
- True.
- Right.

997
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,050
- Haha. Jae Seok's generous.
- Yes.

998
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,160
I trust him.

999
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,860
Number four's the worst.

1000
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,330
- That's more like a penalty.
- It is.

1001
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,730
Hey, I'm number four.

1002
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,500
For real?

1003
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,970
This is a rotten day for me.

1004
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,470
How can I be this unlucky?

1005
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,600
That's incredible.

1006
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,340
If Haha has to pay
the full amount...

1007
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,340
He'll buy his own clothes.

1008
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,710
- He must wear it, then.
- He must.

1009
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,640
- Isn't that the worst?
- It's the worst.

1010
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,150
Still, I should pay a little.

1011
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,750
- How much is it?
- It's 319 dollars and 60 cents.

1012
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,680
It's 319 dollars and 60 cents.

1013
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,850
Then...

1014
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,690
(His personal credit card)

1015
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,460
Leave 300 dollars,
and I'll pay the rest.

1016
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,120
- The change...
- Really?

1017
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,630
- What?
- You'll pay 19 dollars 60 cents?

1018
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,200
Yes, just that.

1019
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,230
(Seok Jin pays 19 dollars 60 cents.)

1020
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,030
The four of us are splitting it.

1021
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,130
Oh, I see.

1022
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,870
- It's 19 dollars and 60 cents.
- Yes.

1023
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,970
Someone else will come up.
I paid a certain sum.

1024
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,240
How much is left to pay?

1025
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,410
(Jae Seok is second to pay.)

1026
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,080
What? There are 300 dollars left?

1027
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,980
He put himself through all that.

1028
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,480
Help me out here.

1029
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,420
I don't feel that great,
to be honest.

1030
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,950
I'm sure Jae Seok will pay.

1031
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,220
(How much did Jae Seok pay?)

1032
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,390
Thank you.

1033
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,720
The third person to pay
can go up now.

1034
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,100
How much is left?
I'll pay... Hang on.

1035
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,230
(What will loyal Ji Hyo do?)

1036
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,200
It looks like Ji Hyo will pay a lot.

1037
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,700
She must be willing to pay.

1038
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,330
Because she lives in Mapo-gu too?

1039
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,870
- Thanks, Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

1040
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,540
Thanks.
This is the only card I have.

1041
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,310
- That's fine.
- Haha, you pay the rest.

1042
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,240
- Good for you.
- Gosh.

1043
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,110
How much is left?

1044
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,410
- We paid a lot.
- Were they loyal?

1045
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,680
"Amount paid..."
This isn't what's left to pay?

1046
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,220
I have to pay 289 dollars?

1047
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,090
(The remaining balance
is 289 dollars.)

1048
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,760
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- How much did you pay?

1049
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,960
How much did you pay?

1050
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,560
- Is there a minimum amount?
- No.

1051
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,230
Then I'll pay just ten dollars.

1052
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,700
(Jae Seok paid 10 dollars.)

1053
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,930
I'll pay one dollar.

1054
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,470
Yes.

1055
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,940
- You paid a dollar?
- You paid a dollar?

1056
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,110
That's a lot.

1057
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,140
- You paid a lot.
- That's a lot.

1058
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,140
(Grimacing)

1059
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,550
- Ji Hyo...
- She's so frugal.

1060
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,380
- Haha can take it all home.
- So Haha...

1061
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:09,220
paid the remaining amount
which was 289 dollars.

1062
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,320
- It's actually cheap.
- He practically bought...

1063
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,420
- his own clothes.
- In an outlet...

1064
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,190
How much is that?

1065
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,590
That was cheap.

1066
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,030
He bought it himself.

1067
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,130
Congratulations.

1068
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,930
Congratulations.

1069
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,430
You found your new look!

1070
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,700
- Yes. At last.
- Good for you.

1071
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,130
You look your age.

1072
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,730
- He bought it himself.
- This is so funny.

1073
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,870
- Good for you.
- You paid for it yourself.

1074
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,300
This is awesome.

1075
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,670
You look great.

1076
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,980
I should call my father.
I'm reminded of him suddenly.

1077
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,240
This is just great.

1078
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,950
We'll move on to the next keyword.

1079
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,120
Running Man's
second weekly keyword is...

1080
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,720
- "Ji Ye Eun's comeback."
- Her comeback.

1081
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,620
To celebrate the comeback
of our own food fighter,

1082
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,320
the members can prepare...

1083
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,660
all of the foods that Ye Eun
would like to eat.

1084
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,700
(A food party for Food Fighter
prepared by the members)

1085
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,760
- We have to cook?
- Yes.

1086
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,800
Ye Eun,
ask for all of the foods you want...

1087
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,230
- without minding how many they are.
- Okay.

1088
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,300
Also, you can buy ingredients
and cook the food yourselves...

1089
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,670
or you could buy it and eat it here.

1090
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,710
Getting takeout is nice.

1091
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,040
But Ye Eun...

1092
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,980
- She eats so much.
- Oh, really?

1093
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,210
- Seriously. My gosh.
- Yes.

1094
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,010
- Her appetite is...
- Okay, let's eat.

1095
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,850
(Eating without using hands
is a basic skill.)

1096
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,490
I can't stand it!

1097
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,660
I think we have to take
Ye Eun's chopsticks away.

1098
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,390
Delicious.

1099
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:26,730
(Once the food bulldozer starts eating,
she eats everything.)

1100
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:31,830
(Food Fighter returned in good health.
Is her appetite back too?)

1101
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,340
So, Ye Eun, please tell them
what you want to eat.

1102
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,810
The members have to...

1103
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,240
- take care of all of them.
- Yes, sounds good.

1104
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,210
However,
since it's to celebrate her return,

1105
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,880
the staff will pay for
all of the food.

1106
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,620
- That's great.
- Can I tell you now?

1107
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,680
(Feeling giddy)

1108
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,990
- Tell us what you want to eat.
- Right now, I kind of...

1109
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,390
- want to eat raw fish.
- Oh, raw fish sounds good.

1110
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,520
Raw fish is great.

1111
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,960
(Ye Eun's Food Bucket List:
Raw fish)

1112
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,090
- Ox bone... Beef bone soup.
- Beef bone soup.

1113
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,760
(Raw fish and beef bone soup?)

1114
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,760
- Beef bone soup.
- I want to have beef bone soup.

1115
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,860
This is going in
a different direction.

1116
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,930
Also, something like...

1117
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,600
- Tell us what you're craving.
- yangjangpi.

1118
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,940
- Yangjangpi?
- Yangjangpi...

1119
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,300
Yangjangpi.

1120
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,600
- Yangjangpi...
- I'm craving that.

1121
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,340
(All over the place as she goes on)

1122
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,510
- Yangjangpi?
- Well, fritters...

1123
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,680
Gosh, yangjangpi?

1124
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,740
Hey, these are
all in different directions.

1125
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,910
Oh, then...

1126
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,610
- Can I really say what I want?
- Of course.

1127
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,550
- Tell us what you really want.
- What I really want is...

1128
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,920
- Right now?
- Yes.

1129
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,420
It's kind of like...

1130
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,750
- Never mind.
- What? Why?

1131
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,620
- Well, what is it? Why hesitate?
- What is it? Tell us.

1132
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,860
Do we have to go somewhere?
We don't have to go...

1133
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,090
- to another area, right?
- What is it?

1134
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,530
Don't ask for walnut cake
from Cheonan or something.

1135
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,630
I just...

1136
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:31,830
- Just say it.
- Tell us.

1137
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,060
It was Peking Duck.

1138
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,700
(Peking Duck suddenly appears.)

1139
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,230
- Oh, Peking Duck.
- Yes.

1140
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,270
- What?
- Oh, Peking Duck.

1141
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,700
(Flustered by her food bucket list
that spans the whole world)

1142
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,340
- Hey... Peking Duck.
- Peking Duck.

1143
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,070
- You mean Peking Duck, right?
- Peking Duck, yes.

1144
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,570
- It's just what you want to eat.
- Nice.

1145
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,280
If you want to eat Peking Duck,
we can prepare it for you.

1146
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,740
- Peking Duck...
- Just slaughter a duck first.

1147
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,910
- But Peking Duck...
- Slaughter a duck...

1148
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,280
They usually take orders
in advance at restaurants.

1149
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,650
- I want to have dessert too.
- Do you mean...

1150
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,050
- Dessert.
- What is it?

1151
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,850
- Tiramisu. Then,
- Tiramisu.

1152
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,750
- a cafe latte?
- A latte.

1153
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,890
Do you want it iced?

1154
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,060
- No.
- Hot?

1155
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,520
- Oh, iced for now.
- Iced.

1156
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,560
- Next, gelato?
- Gelato.

1157
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,600
- By the way, you...
- Hey.

1158
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,960
It's all over the place.

1159
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,070
- Well, they said to say everything.
- So far...

1160
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,100
Bring it down to about three dishes
while I'm being nice.

1161
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,170
I'll find a Chinese restaurant...

1162
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,800
- You're all over the place.
- Then, what should I choose?

1163
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,870
- Raw fish?
- First of all,

1164
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,910
the beef bone soup.

1165
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,340
- Beef bone soup?
- Beef bone soup.

1166
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,410
- Yangjangpi.
- Then,

1167
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,710
- raw fish.
- Raw fish.

1168
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,610
- What else?
- Yangjangpi?

1169
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,450
- Yangjangpi? All right.
- Okay.

1170
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,610
Then, for dessert,

1171
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,020
- a latte.
- A latte.

1172
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,820
- A latte.
- Then, for now,

1173
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,520
we found a big supermarket
where we can shoot.

1174
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,720
You can go there
and take a look at the ingredients.

1175
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,060
- That sounds good.
- If you can't find something there,

1176
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,360
- you can buy it...
- Let's do that.

1177
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,660
- and eat it here.
- Yangjangpi is better if we buy it.

1178
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,100
- We'll get going, then.
- Okay, let's go!

1179
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,260
Beef bone soup is nice too.

1180
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,730
It's really delicious.

1181
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,030
Not the ready-made version, though.

1182
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500
Nice.

1183
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,000
(They board the bus one by one.)

1184
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,940
- Let's have Ye Eun sit here.
- All right.

1185
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,340
I don't have the courage.

1186
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,610
(A crowd has gathered
in front of the bus.)

1187
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,680
(Running)

1188
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,450
Haha, in the middle...

1189
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,180
(He comes inside
with his face covered.)

1190
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,320
I've prepared your seat...

1191
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,020
Gosh, today... Hey.

1192
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,490
- What?
- This isn't your seat.

1193
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,660
(Laughing)

1194
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,830
Just for today, fine.

1195
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,390
I'll be understanding today.

1196
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,100
Well, today...

1197
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:16,100
By the way, Ye Eun wants raw fish,

1198
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,870
- Beef bone soup.
- yangjangpi, and beef bone soup.

1199
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,600
Ye Eun, is there anything else
you want to eat?

1200
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,640
- Not something like beef bone soup.
- Yes, well...

1201
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,570
- Sides, like dumplings.
- Yes, we can go there...

1202
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,740
- Dumplings, boiled pork...
- Oh, dumplings?

1203
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,940
- Ji Hyo cares so much about Ye Eun.
- And boiled pork?

1204
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,080
Right, she messaged me too.

1205
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,050
- Did she message you often?
- Yes.

1206
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,750
- We thought about you...
- Right.

1207
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,320
- so much, Ye Eun.
- Thank you, really.

1208
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,490
Personally, while Ye Eun was sick,
I called her often.

1209
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,190
- Really?
- But as I was calling often...

1210
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,560
- Did you become fond of her?
- I didn't become fond of her.

1211
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,290
I was worried she would fall for me.

1212
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,330
(Did her heart sink?)

1213
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,330
- Because when you're really sick,
- Yes, that's right.

1214
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,970
- if you keep calling, she might...
- That could happen.

1215
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,740
Also, she doesn't really hang up
during phone calls.

1216
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,040
- Is that so?
- So,

1217
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,400
I thought, "Is she perhaps..."

1218
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,340
That's why I didn't call you that much
in case you got the wrong idea.

1219
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,870
- Good job.
- My goodness.

1220
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,240
To be honest,
you felt it, didn't you?

1221
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,210
Look at her face.

1222
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,480
Gosh, I just imagined
the two of you kissing.

1223
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,450
That was awful.

1224
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,480
- Director.
- What?

1225
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,820
- Oh, yes?
- Today,

1226
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,390
- just get a glimpse and leave.
- Our show is for ages 15 and over.

1227
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,920
Stop throwing out ad-libs.

1228
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,290
Come on.
I'm a professional in that field.

1229
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,430
(While listening to
the director's nonsense...)

1230
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,930
- You should just go.
- Director.

1231
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,530
Let's go.

1232
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,100
Giheung Grocery Store.

1233
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,330
(They set off to fix
an invigorating meal for Ye Eun.)

1234
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,600
Hey, young ones.

1235
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,510
Come here.
Link arms and walk together.

1236
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,770
Hey, go and stand over there.

1237
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:31,910
Come here.

1238
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,340
(Short Coat Man enters
with Se Chan by his side.)

1239
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,040
Come here.
We're going to walk like this.

1240
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,810
Gosh, the tangerines look delicious.

1241
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,650
Seok Jin,
tangerines are so good these days.

1242
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,750
- Do you want to buy tangerines?
- Shall we buy some tangerines?

1243
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,920
Who wants tangerines?

1244
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,450
- You should ask Ye Eun first.
- Ye Eun...

1245
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,190
- Ye Eun.
- I like tangerines.

1246
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,260
Seok Jin, Ye Eun needs to eat fruit.

1247
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,260
(Young Forty Ha enters too.)

1248
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,190
- Let's buy one.
- Sounds good.

1249
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,930
Hello, there.

1250
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,730
You, come here. You're big,
so you can hide me from view.

1251
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,140
Hey, I...

1252
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,840
- You have a permanent marker, no?
- Why?

1253
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,940
- Draw a mustache on me.
- Forget it.

1254
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,110
Hurry up and draw it on me.

1255
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,540
Just go like this.

1256
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,780
- Come on.
- No.

1257
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,940
Hurry up and draw it.

1258
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,010
- Jae Seok.
- You can't.

1259
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,750
Why can't I? Why not?

1260
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,310
- That would be a skit.
- I want to be funny!

1261
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,380
- Just go.
- That's not funny.

1262
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,150
Don't do anything unnatural.

1263
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,020
Forget it.

1264
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,520
- I'll do it. Come here.
- Forget it.

1265
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,890
- I'll draw it for you. Come.
- I don't want to.

1266
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:21,990
I'll do it.

1267
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,730
(Giving in easily)

1268
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,830
(What? That's lip balm.)

1269
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,470
(Darn it!)

1270
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,570
(Giggling)

1271
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,000
(Ha Dong Hoon was
harassed miserably.)

1272
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,470
Haha, I drew it on for you.

1273
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,440
You complain when I draw it on you,

1274
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,040
and you complain when I don't.

1275
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,240
Do whatever you want!

1276
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,340
(Blaming the victim)

1277
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,180
(Laughing)

1278
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,380
(He has lost his mind.)

1279
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,520
Ye Eun.

1280
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,390
How about laver?

1281
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,320
- This laver is really delicious.
- How about laver?

1282
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,660
Hey, eat a lot of protein, Ye Eun!

1283
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,790
Protein.

1284
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,990
Ye Eun, you should buy some fruit.

1285
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,490
I should buy some fruit.

1286
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,990
Then, let's buy Shine Muscat too.
It's good.

1287
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,200
Okay, buy some Shine Muscat.

1288
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,230
(He wants to feed Ye Eun all sorts
of things as she was sick.)

1289
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,830
- I like peaches too.
- Buy some peaches.

1290
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,830
- Hey, still... Ye Eun.
- Yes?

1291
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,100
Doesn't it feel great
to have everyone...

1292
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,140
- welcome you?
- Of course.

1293
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,670
I got choked up earlier,
but I held back my tears.

1294
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,110
- Oh, you got choked up?
- Lately, I've been having...

1295
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,240
some hormone issues.

1296
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,440
I can't control my hormones.

1297
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,040
- Oh, did you get choked up?
- Yes.

1298
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,250
All right. Let's check out.

1299
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,150
Oh, nice. We got lots of stuff.

1300
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,180
I can see that Ye Eun likes fruit.

1301
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,250
- Ye Eun likes fruit...
- Yes, fruit.

1302
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,990
- You need to eat lots of fruit.
- Fruit is... Yes.

1303
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,890
- I eat a lot of fruit.
- You should.

1304
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,120
Seok Jin, over there...

1305
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,860
Haha is over there,
but I didn't recognize him.

1306
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,460
- I didn't recognize you! Sorry!
- Hey.

1307
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,730
- Hey!
- You were over there.

1308
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,400
- I thought you were one of them..
- I seriously...

1309
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,370
I'm sorry, Haha.
I didn't recognize you.

1310
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,630
Hey, but I really didn't know.

1311
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,740
I didn't know it was Haha.

1312
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,200
We're shooting right now.

1313
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,040
Please give us some space...
I'm sorry.

1314
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,110
- Gosh, seriously...
- The cameramen won't let me in.

1315
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,040
(His celebrity vibe is gone
just from his different clothing.)

1316
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,340
- I'm a member.
- The cameramen won't...

1317
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,610
I'm a member,
but they won't let me through.

1318
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,680
Hey, then the yangjangpi,
raw fish, and boiled pork...

1319
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,220
- We should split up...
- We need to buy those.

1320
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,720
Let's split up and buy those.

1321
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,790
- All right.
- Okay.

1322
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,350
- Then, shall we...
- I know quite a lot about fish.

1323
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,190
- Should we just get beef bone soup?
- Do you want to buy the raw fish?

1324
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,020
- Yes, I'll do that.
- Shall we go as teams from before?

1325
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,760
Then, we'll get the yangjangpi
and the latte.

1326
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,790
Oh, nice.

1327
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,330
- Yes, hello?
- Hello.

1328
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,230
I was wondering if we could order
in advance...

1329
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,330
- and pick it up.
- Yes.

1330
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,540
- We'd like some yangjangpi...
- Yes.

1331
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,170
- One large yangjangpi.
- A large.

1332
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,300
- One large?
- One order of tangsuyuk...

1333
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,940
We have a small or medium.

1334
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,470
- A medium.
- A medium.

1335
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,340
Please make it delicious for us.

1336
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,210
- Of course.
- Yes, thank you.

1337
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,780
We'll be there to pick those up.
Thank you.

1338
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,150
- We're at the cafe.
- What will we buy at the cafe?

1339
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,550
- Is this the cafe?
- The latte.

1340
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,580
Oh, the latte?

1341
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,850
- By the way...
- I'll stay in the car.

1342
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,050
- Come on. Let's go together.
- Get out.

1343
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,560
- Come on.
- Hurry up and get out.

1344
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,790
The celebrities should go.

1345
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,990
- Hurry up and get out.
- You must bring the company card.

1346
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,260
Haha, why have you lost
so much confidence?

1347
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,960
- Seriously, an outfit can make...
- Thank you.

1348
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,270
Gosh, this is it.

1349
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,470
- Hello.
- Let's order. Hello.

1350
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,570
- Is it okay if we shoot for a bit?
- Yes.

1351
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,970
- Oh, thank you.
- One light latte.

1352
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:50,410
Do you have iced Vienna coffee?

1353
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,840
Then, I'll take an iced Vienna.

1354
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,310
(Ye Eun's Food Bucket List:
Raw fish, yangjangpi, bone soup, latte)

1355
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,340
- Jae Seok.
- Yes?

1356
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,640
I'll take
a pineapple banana smoothie.

1357
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,880
Yes, I'll get that for you.

1358
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,780
- What is that?
- This is the banana pineapple...

1359
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,380
- Gosh, this is it.
- Yes.

1360
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,490
- The owner here...
- This is good.

1361
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,420
- You highly recommended this.
- This is so sweet.

1362
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,590
You know what this is, right?

1363
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,820
Back in the day, in our early 20s,

1364
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,030
- when we were in college...
- Shall we go now?

1365
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,030
(Cutting off his memories)

1366
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,230
Hey, you little...

1367
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,900
- That guy... In early 2026,
- But...

1368
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,070
I'm going to...

1369
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,340
beat that guy up.

1370
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,570
- I have to get him early.
- You don't have to worry.

1371
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,110
It will have zero effect on me.

1372
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,610
- I'll get him early in the year.
- Sure.

1373
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,880
- It won't affect me at all.
- Perhaps,

1374
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,380
if you see him with a busted lip
or something,

1375
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,880
you can just think that
I laid my hands on him.

1376
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,280
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1377
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,050
Thank you. Bye.

1378
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,650
- Hey, let's walk.
- The juice is good too.

1379
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,450
- Why would we walk?
- Be quiet. Just walk.

1380
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,290
If I try to button this up
because I'm cold,

1381
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,390
you don't let me.

1382
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,390
- It's not cold.
- Why are you cold?

1383
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,360
- We're dressed more lightly.
- That's right.

1384
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,200
Gosh, it's nice to take a walk.

1385
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,260
(Timid)

1386
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,500
Hello.

1387
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,440
(People start to gather one by one.)

1388
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,070
- Hello!
- Oh, boy.

1389
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:59,440
- Yes, hello.
- Hi!

1390
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,210
This is so fascinating.

1391
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,580
You must be going to eat
after sending the kids to school.

1392
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,780
Seok Jin.

1393
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,880
It's 12 p.m. No, it's 1 p.m.

1394
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,150
- Going to eat...
- The kids...

1395
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,790
Do you know what time
kids get out of school?

1396
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:11,850
(Ji Hyo checks on Haha.)

1397
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,960
- The kids will be in school...
- Goodness, Haha keeps walking...

1398
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,160
separately from us.

1399
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,030
- Gosh, seriously. That guy...
- Hey.

1400
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,290
(Usually,
Haha from the streets is...)

1401
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,460
What's up?

1402
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,200
- Mr. What's Up.
- What's up?

1403
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,500
(Known for sticking out
whenever they hit the streets)

1404
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,700
(Also known as Road Man)

1405
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:33,980
(The man whose joy was to
stand out in front of the public)

1406
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,980
- Gosh, seriously. That guy...
- Hey.

1407
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,110
(Today, he's quiet.)

1408
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,410
- I mean, why are you doing that?
- Hey.

1409
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,520
What?

1410
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,620
- Did you take your bag off?
- I usually walk like this.

1411
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,820
No, but why are you...

1412
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,950
- This is how I normally walk.
- My gosh.

1413
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,290
- Why are you yelling at me?
- Other people...

1414
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,360
don't care about you!

1415
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,590
I know. I don't pay attention
to them either.

1416
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,430
I just want to walk like this.

1417
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,860
Why are we walking,
wearing out the cameramen?

1418
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,660
It's nice to take a walk.

1419
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,270
We shouldn't keep walking.

1420
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,470
You look great.

1421
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,570
- Check out Haha.
- Hello.

1422
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,500
- Doesn't he look great today?
- Doesn't he look cool?

1423
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,770
- What do you think?
- He looks amazing.

1424
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:05,370
- Does he?
- Of course.

1425
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,010
- Isn't he stylish?
- What do you think of his outfit?

1426
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,640
- It's the best.
- You look young.

1427
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,780
Doesn't it suit him?

1428
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,280
He looks like he could be my son.

1429
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,220
She says you look young.

1430
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,550
See how everyone loves you in this?

1431
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,390
- Bye!
- Do they really think...

1432
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,090
- I'm wearing my own clothes?
- Yes.

1433
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,160
See?

1434
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,620
No one's that interested...

1435
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,360
- in what you wear.
- Exactly.

1436
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,560
The people are all busy
with their own lives.

1437
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,130
- They couldn't care less.
- Exactly.

1438
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:31,570
They're not interested at all,
so don't be embarrassed.

1439
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,140
Is it really necessary
to walk like this?

1440
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,710
An older gentleman is approaching.

1441
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:38,910
(The stylish man in red appears.)

1442
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,710
- He looks cool.
- I love his outfit.

1443
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,610
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1444
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,750
You look amazing.

1445
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,210
- Hello, sir.
- You look great.

1446
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,380
- Were you out for a walk?
- This is Haha.

1447
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,120
- Who?
- Haha.

1448
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,550
- Oh, Haha.
- Hello, sir.

1449
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,550
It's good to see you.

1450
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,020
- How does he look?
- What brings you here?

1451
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,420
We're here to film an episode
for our show.

1452
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,820
- I see.
- Are you off to exercise?

1453
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,660
- Yes, to the gym.
- We'll let you be on your way.

1454
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,760
(A younger man approaches them.)

1455
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,430
Hello, sir.

1456
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:00,760
- Here's Haha.
- Say hi to Haha.

1457
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,760
It's good to see you.

1458
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,130
- Here's Haha.
- Say hi to Haha.

1459
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,270
It's good to see you.

1460
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,200
What is it?

1461
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,500
It's not like him to dress
like an old gentleman.

1462
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,840
(It's not like him to dress
like an old gentleman!)

1463
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,640
(Groaning!)

1464
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,080
(The delivery man noticed
Haha's change of style.)

1465
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,220
- You figured it out.
- Is there a big difference?

1466
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,820
- There's a huge difference.
- Really?

1467
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,520
The second you saw him,

1468
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,850
you knew something was off.

1469
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,090
Is this fun for you?

1470
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,420
- Could we...
- How about a photo with him?

1471
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,060
- Would you like to take one?
- Go ahead.

1472
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:33,000
All right. 1, 2, 3.

1473
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,930
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1474
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,270
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

1475
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:37,470
- Thank you.
- Have a good one.

1476
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:39,130
Always be safe on the road.

1477
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,340
When he saw you
as he was approaching...

1478
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,140
He knew something was off
right away.

1479
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,780
He must've been aware
of how you normally dress.

1480
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,210
- Can we shake hands?
- Of course.

1481
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,910
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1482
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,350
- Hello.
- Hi, sir.

1483
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:53,850
What are you filming here?

1484
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,390
- This is for Running Man.
- Is that so?

1485
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,350
- It was nice to meet you.
- Right.

1486
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,490
- Have a good day.
- Come by sometime.

1487
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:01,120
- Where?
- What is this place?

1488
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,290
Where are we?

1489
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:04,130
- It's an auto shop.
- An auto shop?

1490
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,160
That's right.

1491
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,530
Is it a place
we can visit to hang out?

1492
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,860
Of course.

1493
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,060
- Can we go there?
- Come by for some coffee.

1494
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,630
- We're already having some.
- I see.

1495
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,670
- Have a good day.
- We wish you good health.

1496
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,270
- Take care.
- Thank you.

1497
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,940
- Go, team!
- He told us to come by sometime.

1498
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,610
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1499
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,080
Haha's right here.

1500
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,810
- I'm a fan.
- Right.

1501
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,550
- You gained a lot of weight.
- How does Haha look?

1502
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,950
- What?
- He said you gained weight.

1503
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,150
(Snorting)

1504
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,250
Take care, guys.

1505
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,920
He said you gained a lot of weight.

1506
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,460
(A neighborhood full of extroverts
who speak their minds)

1507
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,890
He's been hiding his figure
under his clothes, you see.

1508
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,360
- You're the best!
- Thanks.

1509
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,900
- Hello.
- Hello.

1510
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,330
- Is that Haha?
- Hello.

1511
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,730
- He just asked if that was Haha.
- What?

1512
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,170
He asked, "Is that Haha?"

1513
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,340
Yes, it's Haha.

1514
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,370
Can I take a photo?

1515
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,370
- Of course.
- You should take a photo.

1516
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:52,740
One, two, three.

1517
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:54,440
Wait, I'm not in the photo.

1518
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,110
- Have a good day.
- Have a good day.

1519
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:00,350
- Thank you.
- Seok Jin wasn't in the photo.

1520
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,720
I wasn't in the photo,

1521
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,520
- but she didn't care.
- That was hilarious.

1522
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,120
- This is the place.
- Okay.

1523
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,760
The two sitting in the front row
will pick up the food.

1524
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,160
- Thanks.
- We'll be right back.

1525
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,360
We won't be gone long.

1526
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,460
Hello.

1527
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,130
It must come
with a lot of side dishes.

1528
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,930
Cockle bibimbap looks good.
That's delicious, you know.

1529
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,230
Grilled mackerel too?

1530
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:19,740
(A variety of side dishes,
including cockle and grilled mackerel)

1531
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,540
They're slicing the fish to order.

1532
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,110
- There's a lot of food.
- Really?

1533
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,740
- Is there a lot?
- There's octopus too.

1534
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,240
- Really?
- And there are side dishes.

1535
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,710
- What do we have? Flatfish,
- Flatfish,

1536
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:28,910
- rockfish, and gray mullet.
- rockfish, and gray mullet.

1537
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:30,210
Is that gray mullet?

1538
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:31,880
Back in the day,

1539
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:35,550
when Se Hyeong and I
didn't have much to eat,

1540
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,650
we used to look through...

1541
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,120
a window like this
and leave feeling full.

1542
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,920
- Seriously. We were that broke.
- As if.

1543
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,360
- Don't you lie.
- It's the truth.

1544
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,830
- Don't you lie.
- Why would I say this? It's true.

1545
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,400
- We had it rough.
- How can you feel full...

1546
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,730
after looking at the food?

1547
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,630
We felt full
after looking at the food...

1548
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,400
and just went home.

1549
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,940
- It's true.
- Was that your dinner for the day?

1550
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,970
- Back when I was young.
- Don't you lie.

1551
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,170
It's the truth.

1552
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,480
We once had dinner just by
looking at food through a window.

1553
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,710
This is a lot.

1554
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,750
This is a lot of food. Hold on.

1555
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,920
- These...
- Food incoming.

1556
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,220
- Goodness. Nice.
- That's a lot of food.

1557
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,820
There it is. China.

1558
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,250
- That's the place.
- There it is.

1559
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,860
- This looks good.
- This smells incredible.

1560
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,090
- No way.
- Is that raw fish?

1561
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:17,490
- It's not.
- It's not raw fish.

1562
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,590
- What is this?
- The sauce.

1563
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:19,830
- I see.
- We need to pour that sauce.

1564
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,030
Thank you.

1565
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,760
- Thank you. Have a good day.
- Bye.

1566
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,930
- Right.
- Hello.

1567
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,130
We're here.

1568
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,600
- Come on in.
- Thanks for making the rounds.

1569
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,540
Guys, we're having a buffet today.

1570
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,080
- It took us a while.
- There's a lot of food.

1571
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,240
Let's set the table.

1572
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,650
- This is a lot.
- Ye Eun, this is what you wanted.

1573
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:38,280
- Nice.
- This is great.

1574
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,580
- Everything looks good.
- Unbelievable.

1575
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,150
(Beef bone soup is a recent favorite
of Ddochi, who needs energy.)

1576
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,820
- This is a feast!
- The beef bone soup looks good.

1577
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,920
Look at these boiled meat slices.

1578
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,660
Check out that boiled meat.

1579
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,930
(Thick cuts of raw fish
to boost her protein levels)

1580
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,530
Get your sushi!

1581
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,270
- There's grilled fish.
- It's grilled mackerel.

1582
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,240
- Are these all side dishes?
- Unbelievable.

1583
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,140
- Yangjangpi.
- Yangjangpi?

1584
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,940
Ye Eun, you're the lady of the hour.

1585
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,040
Ye Eun, are you loving this?

1586
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,880
- I am!
- Nice.

1587
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,080
- No way.
- Take a seat.

1588
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,110
- Ye Eun, come this way.
- This is no joke.

1589
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,910
- This is what you wanted.
- Ye Eun!

1590
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,550
I'm so happy right now.

1591
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,180
It's good to have you back.

1592
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,890
(Celebrating her return
with a variety of food)

1593
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,520
- Let's applaud.
- Let's applaud!

1594
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,560
Yes!

1595
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,190
- Welcome back.
- Ji Ye Eun!

1596
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:24,260
- Congratulations on your return.
- Ji Ye Eun!

1597
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,660
- Congratulations on your return.
- Thank you.

1598
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,700
You cleared the task
for the second keyword,

1599
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,200
so please go ahead
and enjoy your lunch.

1600
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,570
Thank you.

1601
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,670
Sit with us.

1602
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:33,900
- Thank you.
- Let's eat.

1603
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,070
I'll enjoy this.

1604
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,040
- I'll enjoy this too.
- I'll enjoy this.

1605
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,640
- No way.
- Thank you for the meal.

1606
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,040
Ye Eun, I'll mix
the yangjangpi for you.

1607
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,140
Right, the yangjangpi.

1608
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,580
Nice. I'll enjoy this.

1609
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,210
- Ye Eun, enjoy your lunch.
- You too.

1610
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,880
- I'll enjoy this.
- Thanks, Ye Eun.

1611
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,250
We're having a feast thanks to her.

1612
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,250
I'm having yangjangpi...

1613
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,520
for the first time in ages,
thanks to her.

1614
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,550
- Exactly.
- Yangjangpi.

1615
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:51,890
- Your choices are unique.
- Did you crave this?

1616
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:53,190
Yes, it came to mind.

1617
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,560
She's a food fighter for a reason.

1618
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,730
- Right?
- Is the soup good?

1619
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,090
Yes, the soup's delicious.

1620
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,030
- Scallions.
- I forgot the scallions.

1621
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,860
(Adding a heap of scallions)

1622
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,430
I don't want scallions in mine.

1623
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,130
- This is good as well.
- Really?

1624
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,400
It's like raw fish with bones.

1625
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,570
(Groaning with satisfaction)

1626
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,740
What's this clear soup?

1627
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:13,680
- That's good.
- Keep that over there.

1628
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,740
This is incredible.

1629
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,710
(Groaning with satisfaction)

1630
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,010
The soup is to die for.

1631
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,820
- It's really good.
- This is unbelievable.

1632
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,720
- The soup is incredible.
- What on earth?

1633
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,650
- No way.
- Isn't the soup delicious?

1634
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,320
This is absolutely delicious.

1635
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,560
This is Naju beef bone soup.

1636
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,360
- This is Naju beef bone soup.
- It's delicious.

1637
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:31,760
- This is insane.
- Right?

1638
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,830
- Right.
- After your body becomes...

1639
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:35,130
- seriously ill...
- It craves something.

1640
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,300
- Something's changed.
- You get cravings.

1641
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,100
- My appetite has changed.
- Right?

1642
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,870
- Yes.
- Have you been craving raw fish?

1643
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:42,040
Yes, a little.

1644
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,210
- Invigorating food.
- That's right.

1645
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:45,470
- I crave food that gives me energy.
- Now that she's eating,

1646
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,810
there's strength to her voice.

1647
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,480
Earlier, her voice kept cracking.

1648
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,780
Her voice isn't cracking anymore.

1649
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,380
I'm not kidding when I say
you love eating.

1650
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,220
I don't eat as much as I used to.

1651
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:57,490
- Really?
- I can't digest food that well.

1652
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,350
(A mouthful
of the well-mixed yangjangpi)

1653
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,760
- Ye Eun, eat well.
- This is delicious.

1654
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,430
- It's really good.
- It really is.

1655
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,490
Everything's delicious.

1656
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,700
- This is good.
- Do you like japchae?

1657
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,400
I haven't had yangjangpi in a while,
and it's good.

1658
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:10,930
- Tell me about it.
- Right.

1659
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,940
(Yummy)

1660
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,240
- This is good.
- Do you like japchae?

1661
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:19,770
- This is so good.
- Everything's delicious.

1662
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,140
Even the raw fish is nice and firm.

1663
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,450
It's cute to hear her say
how good the food is.

1664
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:25,910
The yangjangpi's delicious.

1665
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,450
This is really good.

1666
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,120
Their yangjangpi is great.

1667
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,120
- Isn't it delicious?
- It is.

1668
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,850
Restaurants in an office district
can't survive...

1669
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:33,360
- unless they serve tasty food.
- Exactly.

1670
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,090
- Especially in an office district.
- I agree.

1671
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,890
I forgot that this restaurant
is in an office district.

1672
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,360
It'll be on the company's
online bulletin board in no time.

1673
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,360
- Of course.
- If the food isn't good.

1674
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,100
- The food is delicious.
- This is amazing.

1675
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,400
(Yummy)

1676
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,940
- It's so good.
- It's even better...

1677
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,040
with mustard sauce.

1678
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,410
- This is so good.
- It's really good.

1679
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,810
Even the raw fish is nice and firm.

1680
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,680
No way. How is it this good?

1681
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,740
Isn't it incredible?

1682
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,410
Where did we get this from?
It's delicious.

1683
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:58,610
The raw fish is tasty.

1684
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,820
(Dipping the raw fish in soy sauce
before bringing it to her mouth)

1685
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,750
The raw fish is good.

1686
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,320
- The yangjangpi is good.
- That's delicious.

1687
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,050
(Food Fighter is nearly
back in form again.)

1688
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,820
We're having a feast,
thanks to Ye Eun.

1689
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,720
- What a treat.
- This is no joke.

1690
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,190
I knew Food Fighter
would pull through.

1691
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,330
I wonder what we'll be doing
for Seok Jin's keyword.

1692
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:16,630
After you finish lunch,

1693
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,930
you'll learn your next task...

1694
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,100
- and take on the next mission.
- Sure.

1695
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,510
(They'll regroup
after finishing their meal!)

1696
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:24,940
One, two, three.

1697
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,910
Goodness. Are we doing another quiz?

1698
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,480
It's a quiz.

1699
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,580
(Are the desks lined up
in one row for a quiz?)

1700
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,680
- You fail a lot in this seat.
- Where do we sit?

1701
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,250
- Haha will...
- For now, sit where you want.

1702
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,990
- For now?
- Why is that one further away?

1703
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,320
That must be part of the game.

1704
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:39,350
Let's sit.

1705
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,620
(Observing)

1706
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,620
Why are you all sitting close to me?

1707
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,290
- The Empty Heads.
- Sit apart, guys.

1708
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,290
Mix it up.

1709
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:46,530
I don't think it's a quiz.

1710
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,730
- It doesn't feel like it.
- Jong Kook, can't you sit here?

1711
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,900
I think they're going
to test our telepathy.

1712
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:51,900
Is this a quiz?

1713
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,940
I think that's your seat, Seok Jin.

1714
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,440
Seok Jin, sit in the middle.

1715
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,810
- Is this my seat?
- It's your keyword.

1716
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:58,370
- I think so.
- I don't mind where I sit.

1717
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:00,310
- Ye Eun, does it feel good...
- Yes?

1718
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:01,440
to be back after three weeks?

1719
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,180
I felt emotional being back
after so long.

1720
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,210
Really? Earlier...

1721
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,020
Rather than it being fun,
I got emotional.

1722
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,680
I bet you got emotional
because it was fun to be back.

1723
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,050
- Sorry about that.
- She's about to cry.

1724
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,690
I bet you got emotional
because it was fun to be back.

1725
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,120
- Sorry about that.
- She's about to cry.

1726
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:19,460
- I've gotten sentimental.
- I bet you got emotional...

1727
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,300
I've grown sentimental.

1728
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,860
Ye Eun's in tears.

1729
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,500
- Why is she crying?
- I've grown sentimental.

1730
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,670
- What's wrong?
- I got emotional.

1731
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,940
Coming back after three weeks
made her emotional.

1732
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:32,070
- Why are you crying?
- Why are you crying?

1733
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,110
- What's going on?
- What is this?

1734
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:36,910
Why are you crying?

1735
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,880
(Laughing)

1736
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,420
She's wailing.

1737
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,180
Why did you suddenly burst
into tears?

1738
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,190
Her hormones are still
all over the place.

1739
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,420
She's wailing.

1740
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,520
It's the hormones.

1741
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,460
I'm sorry I teased you
about your double chin.

1742
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:52,960
- I'm sorry.
- She only cries if you tease her...

1743
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,000
because she's happy.

1744
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,630
I'm sorry I teased you
for having an Adam's apple.

1745
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:00,540
Okay, our last
Running Man Weekly Keyword is...

1746
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,240
- "In his 50s for the next 3 years."
- In his 50s for the next 3 years.

1747
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:04,510
In his 50s.

1748
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,340
- Seok Jin declared that he was...
- That's right.

1749
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,340
- in his 50s for the next 3 years.
- I know.

1750
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,480
- I won't accept my 60s.
- How does this make any sense?

1751
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,480
- I won't accept it.
- Who doesn't age?

1752
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,910
Are you obsessed with age?
You're being...

1753
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,150
- so ridiculous.
- You're being ridiculous.

1754
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,320
- I'm not ready to accept it.
- For Seok Jin...

1755
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,590
For Seok Jin,
who doesn't want to get older,

1756
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:22,660
we've prepared two therapies
good for a youthful appearance.

1757
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,230
- What are they?
- What's a "sherapy?"

1758
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:25,530
- The first therapy uses...
- What's that?

1759
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,860
- feet instead of hands...
- Oh, therapy.

1760
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,030
for the treatment.
It's called foot therapy.

1761
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,870
Like so, we've prepared for you
to get a foot therapy session.

1762
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,040
- Oh, that.
- They put their feet on your face?

1763
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,500
- Therapy...
- Are you sure that's therapy?

1764
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,710
- That is... They use their feet?
- Who does that for you?

1765
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,940
- A professional therapist...
- A professional.

1766
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,280
Gosh, with their feet?

1767
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,480
- Therapy with their feet?
- We tried...

1768
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,180
- this therapy ourselves.
- Okay.

1769
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,120
- It was really effective.
- Oh, really?

1770
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,480
- Like a facelift?
- You're lying.

1771
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,290
- I want to get it.
- That's really nice.

1772
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:52,020
- I like it.
- The second one is...

1773
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,720
a treatment where they light
your body on fire.

1774
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,620
They light your body on fire.

1775
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,130
It's fire therapy.

1776
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,890
- That's great.
- Fire?

1777
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,730
What if Seok Jin's entire body
gets lit on fire?

1778
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,030
Are you trying to roast me?

1779
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,030
(Serious)

1780
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,100
- My gosh.
- Are you trying to...

1781
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,000
stomp on me with your feet
and roast me?

1782
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:12,110
What is that good for?

1783
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,040
- I think I might get burned.
- What is that?

1784
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,210
- It gets rid of the toxins. Anyway,
- Oh, really?

1785
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,810
- we've prepared two therapies...
- To become younger. Oh, nice.

1786
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:21,120
- that are effective in anti-aging.
- If it can make me younger, sure.

1787
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,590
Seok Jin, the person
who this keyword is about,

1788
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:26,190
- will experience both therapies.
- Oh, my.

1789
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,660
- But...
- Okay. Good.

1790
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,460
- it might be boring to do it alone.
- Of course.

1791
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,130
So, we'll do a mission
where you can decide...

1792
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:34,730
the members who will receive
the treatments with you.

1793
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,770
- Of course. I knew it.
- I'm nervous.

1794
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:39,630
This mission is
Draw Pictures with Words.

1795
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,470
- What is that?
- Only one person...

1796
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:43,000
can look at the keyword,

1797
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,570
and for one minute,
as you draw a picture,

1798
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,480
you will only explain
how to draw it with words.

1799
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:51,810
When you explain, you can't say
any specific body parts like...

1800
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:54,120
- eyes, nose, or mouth.
- You can't do that.

1801
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,990
You must explain it by comparing it
to shapes or things.

1802
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,990
The other members will draw pictures
according to the explanation...

1803
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,620
and write down their guesses.

1804
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,590
- This is hard.
- If everyone guesses correctly,

1805
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,830
- you will succeed in that round.
- Everyone has to be correct?

1806
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,430
- I think we can do it.
- So, we'll only play three rounds,

1807
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:12,230
and every time you fail,
we will add one more person...

1808
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,570
- who will get the therapy.
- Oh, boy.

1809
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:16,600
If more people are added,
Seok Jin gets to decide...

1810
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,640
- who will receive therapy.
- I decide?

1811
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,640
Gosh, but...

1812
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,610
- in this case...
- So, in fact,

1813
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:23,580
I have no reason to try hard.

1814
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:24,610
- I'm getting the therapy anyway.
- I mean...

1815
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,510
- You have to try hard, though.
- But if I try hard...

1816
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,620
In this case,
I'll be included for sure.

1817
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,590
- Hey, you know that already.
- You have to do it.

1818
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,020
- But he will definitely pick me...
- No.

1819
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,420
If you really do your best
and contribute,

1820
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,460
- I'll consider your contribution.
- Okay.

1821
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:37,490
- Okay.
- Because it's no fun...

1822
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:38,530
- if it's obvious.
- That's right.

1823
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,660
This will be a fire show.

1824
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,770
Then, the person in this seat
has to talk, right?

1825
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,000
- Let's see how it goes with you.
- Right.

1826
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,040
- Should I give it a go?
- You should.

1827
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,200
We need to know how this goes.

1828
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,100
- You can go first, mister.
- Then, I'll explain a rabbit.

1829
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,410
(For Round 1,
Haha explains the keyword.)

1830
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,440
- Draw a big circle.
- Okay.

1831
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,210
- On top of the circle,
- Elongated circles.

1832
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,910
draw two long,
sausage-shaped circles.

1833
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,410
- I'll explain it like that.
- That's it.

1834
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:00,720
- That was okay.
- Good explanation. Do that.

1835
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,320
Then, we'll only show Haha
the first keyword.

1836
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,550
- Okay.
- We should focus.

1837
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:07,590
Let's focus.

1838
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,260
- Precisely...
- Okay.

1839
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,230
Draw a big circle.

1840
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,130
- Okay.
- Draw a big circle.

1841
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:15,460
(They all draw a big circle.)

1842
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:18,970
Then, in the middle of that circle,
draw another circle...

1843
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,240
near the center.

1844
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,640
- Okay.
- Oh, this is nice.

1845
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,410
Then, draw another circle
near the center.

1846
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,470
- Okay.
- All right.

1847
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,010
(They're following along well
with the easy explanations.)

1848
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:29,040
- Oh, this is nice.
- All right.

1849
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,350
- Then...
- You have to go fast.

1850
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:33,580
The small circle in the center.

1851
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:36,350
Inside that, draw...

1852
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,850
Darn it. I drew it too small.

1853
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:39,220
What? I made it too small.

1854
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:40,990
Write 1... No, write down 11.

1855
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:42,820
- Eleven. Yes.
- Oh, I get what this is!

1856
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,190
Write 1... No, write down 11.

1857
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:46,030
- Eleven. Yes.
- Oh, I get what this is!

1858
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:47,230
- Hang on!
- And then...

1859
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:48,860
Oh, it's this.

1860
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,730
(Haha expressed the key point,
which is the pig's nose.)

1861
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,200
Right.

1862
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,840
(Even the bad artist
finished the drawing.)

1863
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,740
- At the top of the circle...
- Yes?

1864
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,370
At the top of the big circle,

1865
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,610
put two triangles.

1866
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:02,610
- Right!
- We got it!

1867
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,750
Put two triangles.

1868
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,910
- Right!
- We got it!

1869
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,020
- There's the answer.
- We got it.

1870
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,920
(They finished drawing the pigs
at the perfect explanation.)

1871
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,950
I did it.

1872
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,220
At the bottom of the circle...

1873
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,360
Okay. Ten.

1874
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,420
- Let's make some curly cues.
- Nine. Eight.

1875
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,630
- Oh, I get it.
- That much should be good.

1876
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:20,090
Six.

1877
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,000
There we go.

1878
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,830
- Then, write your guess below.
- Like that.

1879
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:25,400
- I know this.
- Okay.

1880
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,670
I think we got it.

1881
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,540
- Okay.
- One person at a time.

1882
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,540
- Please show us your drawing.
- I get it.

1883
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,040
- This is totally...
- I think this is correct.

1884
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,940
- Okay, whoever gets this wrong...
- If you get this wrong...

1885
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,580
- All right.
- Whoever gets this wrong, this...

1886
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,340
- I'm keeping score right now.
- Seriously.

1887
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,510
- I'm really not it.
- Let's see your drawings.

1888
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:39,180
- Let's start with Daniel.
- I think this is correct.

1889
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,210
- This.
- Whoever gets this wrong...

1890
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,720
(Pig)

1891
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,420
Okay. Pig.

1892
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,250
- Pig.
- Pig.

1893
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,690
- I said pig.
- Pig.

1894
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,390
- A piggy bank.
- Pig.

1895
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:51,590
What? It's a coin bank?

1896
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,030
- A piggy bank.
- Pig.

1897
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:54,060
(Suddenly a coin bank?)

1898
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,300
- Why is it a coin bank?
- A coin bank?

1899
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,400
- All of a sudden?
- Suddenly...

1900
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,600
- Piggy bank is incorrect.
- What do you think...

1901
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,170
- you're doing?
- Why is it a piggy bank?

1902
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,400
- What do you think you're doing?
- Why is it a piggy bank?

1903
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,570
Hey, it's a pig. A coin bank...

1904
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:03,810
Gosh, why did you say
it was a coin bank?

1905
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:05,140
- Why is it a coin bank?
- Where did you get that from?

1906
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,410
- But it was...
- Jae Seok, what is this?

1907
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:07,910
- Hey!
- Where did you get coin bank from?

1908
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:09,540
- Jae Seok!
- Why would you say a coin bank?

1909
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:10,980
- That guy is weird.
- Hang on a minute.

1910
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,650
- It's a pig.
- Why would you say a piggy bank?

1911
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,080
- Where did you get that from?
- This guy is so weird.

1912
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,950
- Well, you said it was circular...
- But why coin bank?

1913
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,150
(Jae Seok)

1914
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:21,790
(He added these curly cues
instead of a tail.)

1915
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:24,330
(I think this is that thing.)

1916
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:28,960
(Writing his answer full of confidence)

1917
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,170
- Well, you said it was circular...
- But why coin bank?

1918
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,200
Why don't you understand?

1919
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,570
- Why is it a coin bank?
- Why?

1920
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:34,600
- I never mentioned coins.
- Why would you say piggy bank?

1921
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,940
Where do you put the coins in?

1922
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,870
- Everyone!
- He didn't mention that. Why?

1923
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,340
- Are you a spy?
- Don't be upset. I'll take him.

1924
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,210
- I mean... But didn't he...
- Okay.

1925
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:43,540
- A pig...
- You know...

1926
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,580
- He never said it was a coin bank.
- What's up with you?

1927
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,680
The staff basically gave us
a freebie.

1928
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,550
- No.
- It was a freebie. The number 11...

1929
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,850
So, one more person will be...

1930
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:53,050
- receiving therapy.
- It was easy.

1931
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,390
- Only Jae Seok was wrong,
- One person.

1932
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:57,160
- so he will explain this time.
- I'll try. No, but this seemed...

1933
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,990
like it was in the shape
of a piggy bank.

1934
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:01,430
Guys, this is what I'll do.

1935
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:03,930
- I'll take whoever sticks out.
- Okay.

1936
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:05,970
- Got it? Work hard.
- Take them like the Grim Reaper.

1937
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:08,600
It's been so long
since we were united as one.

1938
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,570
- Of course.
- We're united as one after a while.

1939
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,710
- We have to show them!
- Got it.

1940
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,280
- One guy keeps muddying the waters.
- That's right!

1941
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,380
The guy with buckteeth.

1942
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,680
- Who is that guy right now?
- Gosh, that grasshopper.

1943
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,050
Let's do a good job.

1944
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,280
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1945
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,250
Here is the second keyword.

1946
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,650
- Let's draw.
- Oh, this.

1947
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,620
Next to the center...

1948
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,190
- The center?
- It's not a circle... What is it?

1949
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,590
An egg shape.

1950
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:35,130
- Next to the center...
- Where is "next to?"

1951
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:37,230
- The center?
- It's not a circle... What is it?

1952
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:38,700
An egg shape.

1953
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,130
- An egg?
- Next to the center?

1954
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,900
- An egg?
- An egg shape next to the center?

1955
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,210
- An egg shape?
- An egg shape.

1956
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:45,710
- The center?
- Next to the center?

1957
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:48,010
(An egg shape is an oval.)

1958
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:50,650
- What is it? An egg shape.
- An oval!

1959
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:53,280
- So, draw it like a UFO, right?
- Then...

1960
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,580
(Se Chan draws it vertically.)

1961
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:59,020
(Vertical eggs pop up
here and there.)

1962
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:01,460
Then, a long...

1963
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:03,390
- Long?
- At the edge, a long...

1964
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:04,560
billy club. Draw that.

1965
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,130
- Oh, a long...
- On...

1966
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:07,300
On both sides?

1967
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,400
- No, just on 1 side.
- Just on 1 side?

1968
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,400
What is this?

1969
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,030
Oh, a long...

1970
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:13,300
On both sides?

1971
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,040
(Totally different from
Jae Seok's drawing)

1972
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,540
(Adding a thin stick
instead of a billy club)

1973
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:22,280
(Se Chan)

1974
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:25,010
Oh, this is a tail.

1975
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,120
A billy club?

1976
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:30,890
And then,

1977
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:33,590
on top of that long billy club,

1978
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:36,860
draw another small club
horizontally.

1979
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:38,330
- Horizontally?
- Horizontally?

1980
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,160
Gosh, he's so bad at explaining.

1981
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,160
- What is this?
- Horizontally?

1982
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,200
- Then...
- On top?

1983
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,400
- Horizontally? On top?
- Then...

1984
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,970
- A long billy club...
- What is this?

1985
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:49,040
What is this?

1986
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,710
What is this?

1987
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:53,010
(They're all confused at
the constant talk of billy clubs.)

1988
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:54,980
- Gosh, what is this? Horizontally?
- Horizontally? On top?

1989
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:57,810
- Okay. Then...
- Horizontally? On top?

1990
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:01,750
Underneath,
on the audio directors' cameras...

1991
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:02,920
This straight line.

1992
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:06,690
On the audio directors' cameras...
This straight line.

1993
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,960
- Just draw two of those.
- Where?

1994
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,160
(What did you say?)

1995
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,590
What? Audio directors?
Two horizontal straight lines?

1996
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:15,430
What's the audio directors'
horizontal straight line?

1997
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:17,060
(The identity of the straight lines
that confused everyone)

1998
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,300
(The legs of the tripod
attached to the camera)

1999
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,000
(This thing that has two legs is...)

2000
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,170
(an ostrich.)

2001
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:28,110
(He drew this for an ostrich.)

2002
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:29,110
(Se Chan)

2003
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:30,580
(Meanwhile, he understood
what the tripod legs were.)

2004
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:33,920
Then, you know that thing?
On the floor.

2005
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,280
Draw that into offshoots.

2006
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,220
- Make that into three offshoots.
- What? Where?

2007
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,690
- Sections?
- Where?

2008
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:40,790
- Where?
- Where?

2009
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,460
Under the straight line.

2010
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,960
- What?
- And...

2011
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,990
- Three sections.
- And...

2012
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,860
- Three?
- Earlier...

2013
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:48,030
What's this?

2014
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,070
- Earlier, you drew a big oval.
- Yes.

2015
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,370
Inside it,

2016
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:54,340
draw a small oval.

2017
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,700
(Draw a small oval.)

2018
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:57,610
(I see!)

2019
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:58,770
- What's this?
- What's this?

2020
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,140
I get it.

2021
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:01,140
I don't get it.

2022
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,780
(A completely different result)

2023
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:04,410
- All right.
- What's this?

2024
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:05,650
- Three,
- What's this?

2025
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:06,810
- two,
- I get it.

2026
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:08,580
- I don't get it.
- Please write your answer...

2027
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:09,620
- at the bottom.
- Okay.

2028
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,320
- What's this?
- What's this?

2029
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,190
- This is...
- It's obvious, isn't it?

2030
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:14,390
- I explained it so well.
- Could it be...

2031
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:16,320
- I really...
- This time, hold it up together...

2032
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,790
on the count of three.

2033
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:18,790
- Okay.
- What's this?

2034
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:20,490
- Is it an animal? I don't know.
- I have no idea.

2035
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,100
One, two, three.

2036
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,130
Ostrich.

2037
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,200
- Isn't it a log?
- What?

2038
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,800
Ostrich?

2039
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,870
(Keyword: Ostrich)

2040
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:27,900
What?

2041
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,470
(Helicopter)

2042
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:31,670
(There's a variety
of incorrect answers.)
(Log, Mount Fuji)

2043
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:33,770
Ostrich.

2044
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:34,810
- What?
- What?

2045
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,080
Ostrich?

2046
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,510
- I got "Ostrich!"
- What?

2047
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:39,110
(I got "Ostrich!")

2048
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:41,150
(Ostrich)

2049
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:42,780
(How did he get it right?)

2050
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:44,050
- I got "Ostrich!"
- What?

2051
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,890
(Se Chan: Ostrich)

2052
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:47,120
Really?

2053
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,660
- Really?
- Hey.

2054
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,060
(In disbelief)

2055
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,790
It's incredible
that he got it right.

2056
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:55,530
- What?
- Ostrich!

2057
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:56,600
- What?
- What's...

2058
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,100
- What's that?
- Mount Fuji.

2059
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,700
- How did you get an ostrich?
- How did you get an ostrich?

2060
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,340
- It's an ostrich.
- Fish.

2061
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,540
Hey, two long lines.

2062
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:04,770
- I can't believe you got it right.
- Jae Seok.

2063
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,410
- I drew this part.
- That's what it looks like.

2064
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:07,980
- Let's see the drawing.
- What's wrong with you?

2065
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,040
I mean...

2066
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,150
- I can't believe they got it right.
- Hold on.

2067
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,880
Do you guys take
art lessons at Antenna?

2068
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,080
- No.
- No?

2069
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,420
- No?
- How did you get it right?

2070
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,850
- This is incredible.
- You understand my art.

2071
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,020
- Exactly, Jae Seok.
- That's right.

2072
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,220
Seriously.

2073
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,790
Let's move on to the next one.

2074
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:22,660
One more person has been added.

2075
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,290
(Due to their failure in Round 2,
2 people will receive the therapy.)

2076
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:26,390
- It was an easy keyword.
- Seriously.

2077
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,900
- It was practically given.
- Why couldn't you get it right?

2078
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,300
- This is driving me crazy.
- How did he get an ostrich right?

2079
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:32,770
He didn't even draw it
like an ostrich,

2080
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:34,500
- but he got it right.
- He didn't draw an ostrich.

2081
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,870
- Hey, just describe one key point.
- Okay.

2082
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:38,640
- I just described a pig snout.
- One key point.

2083
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,840
- Yes. Describe a key point.
- Something like a pig snout.

2084
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,140
Here is the keyword.

2085
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,840
(Keyword: Monkey)

2086
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,010
Get ready.

2087
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:47,880
Draw a big circle in the middle.

2088
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:48,950
- A big one.
- A big one?

2089
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:50,250
- How?
- Make it big.

2090
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,720
- A circle.
- Then...

2091
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:53,720
At the center... At left and right,

2092
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,790
draw two circles.

2093
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:55,990
- What?
- Left and right?

2094
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:57,360
On the top? Where?

2095
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:58,590
Left and right.

2096
01:05:58,590 --> 01:05:59,790
- Somewhere in the middle.
- I get it.

2097
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,000
- Okay.
- On top of the circle?

2098
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,330
- Inside the circle.
- Inside.

2099
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:03,430
- Inside the circle.
- Okay. Inside.

2100
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:04,530
Under?

2101
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:06,100
- Inside?
- Under?

2102
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,440
Inside. Then what?

2103
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,970
- Inside.
- Then what?

2104
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,270
Then, inside those circles...

2105
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:12,770
- Color half of them.
- Should we draw more circles?

2106
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:13,810
Color half of them.

2107
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:15,580
Then left and right, triangle.

2108
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:16,780
- What?
- Triangle.

2109
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:18,550
Then left and right, triangle.

2110
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:19,710
- What?
- Triangle.

2111
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:21,120
You need to enunciate, okay?

2112
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:22,520
Listen,

2113
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,490
you need to speak more clearly.

2114
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,990
- Afterward...
- At the center?

2115
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:28,360
Right. On the right side...

2116
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,990
of the big circle, draw...

2117
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:32,060
Draw a worm.

2118
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:33,260
- On the right side...
- A worm?

2119
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,300
- A worm?
- Horizontally or vertically?

2120
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,330
(A worm?)

2121
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:37,200
- A worm.
- All right.

2122
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,530
- It's ruined.
- Five...

2123
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:41,670
(How is this a monkey?)

2124
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:43,540
- One, two, three.
- A worm?

2125
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:44,640
- Please hold it up.
- It must be a tail.

2126
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,470
- Isn't it Jae Seok?
- Hold on.

2127
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:48,040
- Is it a panda?
- Jae Seok.

2128
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,080
- What's this?
- I think it's a person.

2129
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,610
- A salamander?
- Something like that.

2130
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,180
It's a monkey.

2131
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,610
For goodness' sake.

2132
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:54,880
It's a monkey.

2133
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,350
For goodness' sake.

2134
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:58,120
(A horned monkey)

2135
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,790
- Are you kidding me?
- It's a monkey.

2136
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:01,590
- Hey.
- I described a monkey.

2137
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:02,790
Jae Seok, you were nearly there.

2138
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:04,060
- How is that a monkey?
- I mean...

2139
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,660
- You guys drew the same thing.
- Hey.

2140
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:08,130
(Their outputs are similar.)

2141
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,760
- You guys drew the same thing.
- How...

2142
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,230
- How are you guys the same?
- Let me see.

2143
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:12,470
- You guys are the same.
- Seriously.

2144
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:15,140
Monkey's ears are round.

2145
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,570
- I'm sorry.
- No one got it right.

2146
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:17,640
It was hard to draw a monkey.

2147
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:19,470
Let's have one more round.

2148
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:21,340
You had three rounds.

2149
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,240
- Let's have one last round.
- Who wants to describe it?

2150
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,310
- Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun.

2151
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:25,380
- Ye Eun, try it.
- Shall I explain it?

2152
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:27,080
- Go ahead.
- If you succeed in...

2153
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,350
- the last round,
- I'll take the sketchbook.

2154
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:31,220
- one person will avoid the therapy.
- Okay.

2155
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:33,190
- Will I be able to explain it well?
- Focus on one key point.

2156
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:35,790
- Here is the keyword.
- This is so funny.

2157
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,430
- Get ready.
- Okay.

2158
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:38,790
(Viewers, guess with the members.)

2159
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:41,060
On the left and right,

2160
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,400
draw a triangle.

2161
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,730
- A triangle.
- This is easy.

2162
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:44,770
A triangle.

2163
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,570
Let's draw a triangle.

2164
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:48,140
- Let's draw it.
- Let's give it a go.

2165
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,100
Let's draw a triangle.

2166
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,510
- Let's draw it.
- Let's give it a go.

2167
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:53,710
Am I doing this right?

2168
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:54,810
Put the triangles...

2169
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:56,640
together.

2170
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,950
- Hey.
- How are we supposed to do that?

2171
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:00,880
- Hey.
- Do you think this is...

2172
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,720
(Ddochi thinks it's a tablet PC,
not a sketchbook.)

2173
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,550
(Confused)

2174
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,550
- What are you doing?
- How...

2175
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:08,120
Okay. I'll put them together.

2176
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,890
- Triangle...
- We can't move what we've drawn.

2177
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:11,030
- Are the triangles big?
- Yes.

2178
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:12,430
Put the triangles together.

2179
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,030
- In the middle of the triangles,
- Okay.

2180
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:17,530
draw any pattern.

2181
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:18,730
What?

2182
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:19,970
Any pattern?

2183
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,740
- Door?
- Yes. Draw any pattern.

2184
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:22,800
- What's that? Door?
- Yes.

2185
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,140
- A pattern.
- A pattern.

2186
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:25,210
- What's that? Door?
- A pattern.

2187
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,370
A pattern.

2188
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:27,810
(They do as they're asked.)

2189
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:28,880
- A pattern.
- A pattern.

2190
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,150
From the point
where the triangles meet,

2191
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,510
draw a long line.

2192
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,980
- What?
- Should it go up or down?

2193
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,550
Draw a long line.

2194
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:37,990
- What?
- Should it go up or down?

2195
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:38,990
- Should it go up or down?
- Up.

2196
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,890
- Up?
- Draw two lines upward.

2197
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:42,490
- Upward?
- Two lines?

2198
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:44,230
In the middle?

2199
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:45,230
- Upward.
- In the middle,

2200
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:46,660
draw two long lines
that stretch upward.

2201
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:48,600
- All done. I drew them.
- Long lines that stretch upward.

2202
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,000
Okay. I drew the lines.

2203
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,900
- All right.
- Two lines?

2204
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:52,970
Two lines?

2205
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,130
(Despite the clumsy explanation,
the outputs look similar.)

2206
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,200
- I drew the lines.
- Five...

2207
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,040
- That's all.
- What did you say, you punk?

2208
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,370
- That's all.
- Three,

2209
01:08:58,540 --> 01:08:59,610
two...

2210
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:01,710
Please write down the answer.

2211
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:03,980
- What's this?
- I get it.

2212
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:06,310
I get it.

2213
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:08,350
(It looks like everyone
has figured out the answer.)

2214
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:09,520
- This is it.
- I get it.

2215
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:10,890
- Hold it up.
- Okay.

2216
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,090
- This one.
- It's this one, right?

2217
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,150
- It's this one, right?
- I think it's this one.

2218
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,220
- Hold it up.
- It's this one.

2219
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,890
(Butterfly)

2220
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:17,160
- Butterfly.
- Butterfly.

2221
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:19,990
- Butterfly.
- Why did you think it was a moth?

2222
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,300
- It's this one.
- Butterfly?

2223
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:22,530
- Butterfly.
- Moth.

2224
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,370
- Butterfly.
- Butterfly.

2225
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:27,670
(Many people shout, "Butterfly!"
Did everyone succeed in it?)

2226
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:30,570
(Starfish)

2227
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:31,640
I thought it was a starfish.

2228
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,010
What did you get?

2229
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,940
- Triangles startled me.
- I...

2230
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:36,410
I wrote, "Starfish."

2231
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,750
- What?
- Butterfly?

2232
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,080
- Butterfly.
- Moth.

2233
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:40,920
I thought it was a spaceship.

2234
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,020
How is that a butterfly?

2235
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:44,790
All the keywords have been animals!

2236
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:46,290
- How did you get a spaceship?
- What?

2237
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:47,860
- Triangles startled me.
- I...

2238
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:49,420
I wrote, "Starfish."

2239
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:51,560
- Starfish.
- Moths have fancy patterns.

2240
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,030
That was why I thought
it was a moth.

2241
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:55,060
- For goodness' sake.
- Butterfly.

2242
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,730
We gave you a chance to lessen
the number of people by one,

2243
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:00,270
- but you failed.
- Okay.

2244
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:02,600
- Four people, including Seok Jin,
- Four people.

2245
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,310
will receive the therapy.

2246
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:05,940
- Okay.
- Those who will receive therapy...

2247
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,710
- will be chosen upstairs.
- I worked so hard.

2248
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,440
- Seok Jin will pick.
- Okay.

2249
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,580
I worked so hard.

2250
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,450
- That's right.
- I got most of the keywords right.

2251
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:15,120
Seok Jin, I also did my best.

2252
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:16,850
(What?)

2253
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:17,990
What's this?

2254
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,150
Gosh,

2255
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:20,420
the setup is unusual.

2256
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,190
- Seriously.
- No way.

2257
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:23,460
Are the beds for the fire therapy?

2258
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:25,030
The beds are for the fire therapy,
and the mat is for the foot therapy.

2259
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:27,360
Am I imagining
the smell of gasoline?

2260
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,230
- It smells like fire.
- You know...

2261
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:31,500
You know, Seok Jin
might not choose me...

2262
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:33,500
since I'm the obvious choice.

2263
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,670
That's right.

2264
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,070
I might not choose you
since you're the obvious choice.

2265
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:38,140
- Seok Jin, choose the members...
- Yes.

2266
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,870
- who'll receive the therapy.
- Okay.

2267
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,040
For the foot therapy,

2268
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,550
pick one member...

2269
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:46,610
- other than you.
- One.

2270
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:48,620
For the fire therapy,

2271
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:49,750
pick two members.

2272
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:52,020
Three people will receive
one therapy at a time.

2273
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,590
To be honest,

2274
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:54,790
there are...

2275
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,820
There are people I want to pick.

2276
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,130
I'm not doing this...

2277
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:00,530
to get my revenge
for a previous wrongdoing.

2278
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:02,560
- I'm doing this for you guys.
- Okay.

2279
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,900
(Laughing)

2280
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:08,400
That's why I'm curious
about your opinions.

2281
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,340
- Why do his eyes look so sad?
- I...

2282
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,010
Haha.

2283
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:14,510
- So...
- Why do his eyes look so sad?

2284
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,940
- I...
- His eyes look so sad.

2285
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,480
I almost farted.

2286
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:20,150
- Apparently, the fire therapy...
- The fire therapy.

2287
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,620
helps you lose stomach fat.

2288
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,250
So I want to choose someone
with a big belly.

2289
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,290
Then he'll choose Haha.

2290
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:26,520
Haha.

2291
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:29,520
- Haha should receive it.
- Yes.

2292
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,130
- He really needs it.
- He hasn't fit in today.

2293
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:33,530
- There must be anger inside him.
- Yes.

2294
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:36,060
Since there's inside him,
he should roast his back.

2295
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,130
- That's good.
- It'll balance things out.

2296
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,270
I've struggled emotionally
all day long.

2297
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,040
Please reconsider.

2298
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,940
I need one more person.
Who will be a good choice?

2299
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:45,940
I need someone who'll flap around.

2300
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:47,140
Someone who'll flap around.

2301
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:48,440
- What?
- Choose a coward.

2302
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,680
- Choose a coward.
- Daniel is a coward.

2303
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,350
- I have long limbs.
- He has good reactions.

2304
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:52,480
- I can't flap around.
- He'll flap around.

2305
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,480
He has good reactions.

2306
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,550
I think he'll flap around.

2307
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:56,350
- I can't flap around.
- Okay.

2308
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:59,090
- The other one tightens the skin.
- Yes.

2309
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,490
So...

2310
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:02,060
- Jae Seok should get it.
- Yes.

2311
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:05,330
I want him to become young
and stay with Running Man.

2312
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:06,990
- Are you okay with that?
- Let's go.

2313
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,530
- I love it.
- All right.

2314
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:10,830
- It'll tighten the skin.
- I love it.

2315
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:13,800
The first therapy is
the foot therapy.

2316
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,870
- Yes.
- Using feet instead of hands,

2317
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:18,470
the therapist will work on
the broad and deep muscles.

2318
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:21,010
Foot therapist, please come on in.

2319
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:22,110
(Foot therapist of the day)

2320
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:24,140
- My goodness.
- Welcome.

2321
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:25,150
(Jung Bo Young, 13 years
of experience in foot therapy)

2322
01:12:25,150 --> 01:12:26,980
- She's a therapist.
- Yes.

2323
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:28,920
- She's an expert.
- That's right.

2324
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:29,920
Is the condition of your feet okay?

2325
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,190
- Her feet are very...
- Ms. Jung.

2326
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,020
- Her feet are very clean.
- For the show,

2327
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,660
- you must've taken care of them.
- Yes.

2328
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,790
I got a pedicure.

2329
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:38,960
My feet are always ready.

2330
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:42,000
You actually use your feet
for therapy, right?

2331
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,800
Yes. We only use our feet
to take care of the skin.

2332
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:44,930
- Really?
- Yes.

2333
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:47,500
What's better about
using feet instead of hands?

2334
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,700
The effects came three times faster
when I used my feet.

2335
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,000
- Really?
- Yes.

2336
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,040
- It must be the pressure.
- The strength.

2337
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,870
- Yes. The pressure is the best.
- The strength.

2338
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,910
Good results are guaranteed.

2339
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:57,910
- It'll tighten the skin.
- Good.

2340
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:00,480
I put a lot of care
into tightening my skin.

2341
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,280
- You can lie down right away.
- Good.

2342
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,780
- Who wants to go 1st?
- I'll go 1st.

2343
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:05,550
Before and after.

2344
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:07,420
I wonder how he'll look
after the therapy.

2345
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,160
- I know. Like this?
- I'll take off ten years.

2346
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,460
Seok Jin, you'll become
ten years younger.

2347
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:12,560
- Ten years?
- Yes.

2348
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,090
Will I go back to my 30s then?

2349
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:15,500
I look like I'm in my 40s now.

2350
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,630
- He's so shameless.
- Where did 30s come from?

2351
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:19,530
- Seriously.
- He got too greedy.

2352
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:20,730
- You know,
- It's too much.

2353
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,470
you should get a consultation.

2354
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,440
- Okay.
- You'll go back to your 40s.

2355
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:26,070
Seriously,

2356
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:27,980
- I'll go back to my 30s.
- How fascinating.

2357
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:29,380
This is a blanket.

2358
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:31,040
- Is that a blanket?
- Will you put it over him?

2359
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,450
- A blanket.
- Why do I need a blanket?

2360
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:35,880
This is making me sad.
Don't do this.

2361
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,580
- No! Stop!
- Don't do this.

2362
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,490
(She just put a blanket over him.)

2363
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:41,160
No! Stop!

2364
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,620
- Stop!
- No!

2365
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:44,320
- No!
- Don't do this.

2366
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:45,860
- What are you doing?
- Ms. Jung.

2367
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:47,390
- Don't do this.
- Don't do this.

2368
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:50,560
- Don't do this.
- Chief director!

2369
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,430
(It's unfortunate
that the blanket is white.)

2370
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:54,070
- Don't put it over him.
- Ms. Jung,

2371
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:55,300
- don't do this.
- Seriously.

2372
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,540
- Open your eyes.
- Seriously.

2373
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:59,810
- Keep talking to us.
- Okay.

2374
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:00,940
I'm okay.

2375
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:02,810
Seok Jin, don't close your eyes.
Seriously, don't do it.

2376
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,410
- Okay.
- Lie in a relaxed way.

2377
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:07,820
- I'll apply oil first.
- Okay.

2378
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:09,750
(She starts by applying oil.)

2379
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,590
Should I remove my makeup?

2380
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:13,590
It's a bit cold. No, it's okay.

2381
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,390
- I bet it's refreshing.
- I bet it's refreshing.

2382
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:17,460
Are you using feet or hands?

2383
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:19,160
- Hands.
- Seok Jin.

2384
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,290
Come on, Seok Jin.

2385
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,330
- Ms. Jung will be startled.
- You're too much.

2386
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:24,570
She said that
she would use her feet.

2387
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:26,400
(He becomes absorbed
in the therapy.)

2388
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,040
I haven't received such therapy.

2389
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,700
I'm wearing makeup.

2390
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,570
Your hair might get a bit messy.

2391
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:33,110
It's okay. My hair...

2392
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,310
I didn't do anything
after washing it.

2393
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:37,180
(The mischievous member
thought of a prank.)

2394
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,550
(Please keep going.)

2395
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:40,250
(Okay.)

2396
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:44,080
- Okay.
- Take your time.

2397
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,750
- Keep your eyes closed.
- Okay.

2398
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:47,390
- Here it comes.
- Okay.

2399
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:49,290
(Here comes Jae Seok's foot.)

2400
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:51,230
It'll be soft.

2401
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,860
It'll be soft.

2402
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:57,900
(Seok Jin takes it
in a docile manner.)

2403
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,170
How is it?

2404
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:03,640
Well... Are you sure
you've done this a lot?

2405
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:08,510
(The touch is rougher
than he has imagined.)

2406
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:10,710
Of course. I've done this
for 13 years.

2407
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:11,910
It hurts.

2408
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:13,150
Gosh, who's this?

2409
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:14,410
Hey!

2410
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:15,450
Who is that?

2411
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,820
(Jae Seok gets caught.)

2412
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:19,890
Come here. You...

2413
01:15:20,290 --> 01:15:23,290
(Tom and Jerry are at it again.)

2414
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,830
(He can't even chase
after Jae Seok.)

2415
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:29,460
I knew it. It didn't feel like
an expert's touch.

2416
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,900
The foot just pressed hard.

2417
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,130
The foot just pressed hard.

2418
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:35,900
(Young Sixty got stepped on.)

2419
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,570
I knew it. That was why I asked,

2420
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:39,110
"Are you sure
you've done this a lot?"

2421
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:40,570
You're quick-witted.

2422
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:41,680
- It's too bad.
- You're quick-witted.

2423
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,740
It's not about being quick-witted.
Anyone would've known.

2424
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,550
Did it relieve your stress?

2425
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:46,680
It really relieved my stress.

2426
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:47,980
Jae Seok had so much fun.

2427
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,050
- I'll do the therapy for real.
- Okay.

2428
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,090
She'll do it for real.

2429
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:54,890
- If it hurts, say so.
- Don't do it.

2430
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:57,420
Punks, don't do it.
I'll know right away.

2431
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:00,460
This is a bit...

2432
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,060
How is it?

2433
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:03,430
Are you using your hands or feet?

2434
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,800
- I'm using my feet.
- Hands.

2435
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:06,300
- Your feet?
- Yes.

2436
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:07,970
It's different than before.

2437
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,400
- Is it different?
- Yes.

2438
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,570
(It's the same foot.)

2439
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:14,270
The massage I received earlier
was so rough.

2440
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:17,510
- Really?
- Yes. This is a bit...

2441
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:21,320
(When will Seok Jin notice?)

2442
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,520
(Slapping)

2443
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:31,690
(Catch Jae Seok.)

2444
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,160
Hey, come here.

2445
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,600
(He runs outside this time.)

2446
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,730
Hey, you...

2447
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:39,570
Hey, he's 60 years old.

2448
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:41,570
Seriously. Hey!

2449
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:43,170
(He chases after Jae Seok
at the age of 60.)

2450
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:44,770
I'm so angry.

2451
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:47,210
(His heart is finding
childhood innocence first.)

2452
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:49,210
I'm so annoyed.

2453
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:50,710
(His heart is finding
childhood innocence first.)

2454
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:52,750
The second massage
felt pretty professional.

2455
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:55,250
I'll go home now.

2456
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:56,750
It was funny.

2457
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,190
I had so much fun today.

2458
01:16:58,350 --> 01:17:00,690
With Haha's clothes and this,
I've done enough.

2459
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:03,820
I'll be able to laugh for a month.

2460
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:05,930
(He has done more than his share
as a mischievous member.)

2461
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:06,960
Don't do it now.

2462
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:09,030
Comedy is in repetition.

2463
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:10,700
- Did it relieve your stress?
- Yes, it did.

2464
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,400
- It was so nice.
- If you do it again,

2465
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,400
you'll get scolded for real.

2466
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,340
Ms. Jung, you've done
this process many times.

2467
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,640
You've worked on this area
3 or 4 times.

2468
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,940
- I'll begin.
- Okay.

2469
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:24,380
- For real...
- It's different.

2470
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,510
- For real...
- It's different.

2471
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,250
- Are you serious?
- It must be refreshing.

2472
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,320
It's refreshing for real.

2473
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,120
It's so refreshing.

2474
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,320
Ms. Jung.

2475
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,190
- The pressure is different.
- Won't she get a cramp?

2476
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:35,490
- How fascinating.
- I won't get a cramp.

2477
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:36,960
- Seok Jin.
- It's so refreshing.

2478
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,130
- I always get a knot here.
- Really?

2479
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,490
It's so refreshing.

2480
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:40,760
I'll do it again.

2481
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:42,360
It's seriously refreshing.

2482
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,300
I have pain in the same area.

2483
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,570
I want to experience it too.

2484
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:47,500
The pressure must be different
from that of the hands.

2485
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,040
- Gosh.
- The neck too.

2486
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,400
- It's so refreshing.
- Ms. Jung.

2487
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:53,010
- Gosh.
- It's so refreshing.

2488
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,010
- It must be refreshing.
- It's so refreshing.

2489
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:56,640
- This area hurts so badly.
- My goodness.

2490
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:58,710
- What?
- Let's go.

2491
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:00,150
Isn't this Jae Seok?

2492
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:02,120
- No, it's me.
- It's...

2493
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,680
It hurts so badly.

2494
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,150
- As you aged,
- Okay.

2495
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:06,690
this area sagged a lot.

2496
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:08,060
It's this area.

2497
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:10,760
- Seok Jin, hold it in.
- This area stores bodily waste,

2498
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:12,860
so you're bound to feel pain.

2499
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:14,390
It hurts so much.

2500
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,330
- His jawline became sharp.
- His skin became tight.

2501
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:18,370
- His jawline became sharp.
- Did my skin become tight?

2502
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:19,370
- Seok Jin.
- Really?

2503
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:20,570
- Really?
- The sagging skin is gone.

2504
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:21,900
How did that happen?

2505
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,840
- Suddenly...
- This side became really sharp.

2506
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,940
- Seok Jin, this is incredible.
- This is incredible.

2507
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,710
- Your jawline became sharp.
- You got...

2508
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,680
- Your jawline became sharp.
- You got a defined jawline.

2509
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:31,780
- Really?
- Of course.

2510
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:33,050
- Really?
- Yes.

2511
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:34,380
How did it happen?

2512
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:35,620
(At that moment,
Ms. Jung stands up.)

2513
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:37,550
This side became really sharp.

2514
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:39,590
- Seok Jin, this is incredible.
- This is incredible.

2515
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,590
- Your jawline became sharp.
- You got a defined jawline.

2516
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:43,660
- Really?
- Of course.

2517
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:44,830
Will you go up there
and step on him?

2518
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:45,860
- Yes.
- Do you need help?

2519
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:47,490
- No.
- Will you jump from there?

2520
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:50,700
Will you jump and step on him?

2521
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,530
Maybe she'll turn his face
into a dough.

2522
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:54,400
Shall I show a trick today?

2523
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,670
Ms. Jung, you don't need to be
so ambitious.

2524
01:18:58,370 --> 01:19:00,170
- Please stay in position.
- Okay.

2525
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:02,610
Seok Jin, don't move.
She'll jump and step on you.

2526
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:05,280
Seok Jin, don't move.

2527
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,350
- This is...
- It's okay.

2528
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:07,750
- What's this?
- She'll put her weight on it.

2529
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,550
I'll use my foot.

2530
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:13,350
(She puts her weight on her foot
and begins the therapy in earnest.)

2531
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:14,650
Ms. Jung, won't I lose hair?

2532
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:16,490
When I was little,
teachers shaved off hair like that.

2533
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:17,820
- They shaved off hair like that.
- That's it.

2534
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,360
This is like
that old-fashioned penalty...

2535
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,930
- of shaving off hair.
- Yes.

2536
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:22,160
(It's a familiar pain.)

2537
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:23,860
It must hurt.

2538
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,430
- Ms. Jung.
- Yes?

2539
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,000
- It hurts so much.
- Ms. Jung.

2540
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,470
That's bound to tighten the skin.

2541
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,710
(Guaranteed results)

2542
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:32,910
- If you do that...
- It'll tighten...

2543
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:34,270
- Ms. Jung.
- the skin.

2544
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,480
- Isn't this a penalty?
- That's bound to tighten...

2545
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,610
No, it's this way.

2546
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,210
- Now, stay in position for real.
- Okay.

2547
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:39,380
Stay in position.

2548
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:41,350
I'll use both feet now.

2549
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:43,980
I'll use both feet now.

2550
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:46,690
(I'll use both feet now.)

2551
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:52,830
(Let's take the highway
to rejuvenation!)

2552
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,900
(Escaping)

2553
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,300
Why did you do that?

2554
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,570
- You can't move.
- It hurts so much.

2555
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:06,840
- Are you really a therapist?
- Yes, I am.

2556
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,240
- It hurts so much.
- But...

2557
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,810
Are you sure it's a therapy?

2558
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,280
"I'll use both feet now"
was so funny.

2559
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,010
- "Here they come."
- "I'll use both feet now."

2560
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:15,480
- Can you handle both feet?
- Yes.

2561
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:17,820
Let's go with both feet, Ms. Jung.

2562
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:21,620
- Endure it. You'll become young.
- I'll use both feet now.

2563
01:20:23,390 --> 01:20:29,260
(He needs to endure this
to stay in his 50s forever!)

2564
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,000
I can't do this!

2565
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,370
(He gives up after getting
the right side massaged.)

2566
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:37,670
- I need to wrap up.
- He couldn't endure it.

2567
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:38,970
Seriously.

2568
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:41,980
- I need to wrap up.
- He couldn't endure it.

2569
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:44,680
(Jae Seok is next.)

2570
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:46,850
Ms. Jung, you don't need
to do that for me.

2571
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:48,250
Okay. I'll use one foot only.

2572
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,120
- Please step on me instead.
- Okay.

2573
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,480
That was unbelievable.

2574
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,950
Seok Jin, get up.
Let's see the result right away.

2575
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:54,290
- Put on your hat.
- Get up.

2576
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:55,660
- Right now...
- Seok Jin, you look good.

2577
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:58,020
- Wear it backwards. Let's see it.
- Right away.

2578
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:00,330
- One side got lifted up.
- Really?

2579
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:01,630
- It got lifted up.
- Let's see.

2580
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,100
Are the two sides different?

2581
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,500
- Really?
- Let's see.

2582
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:09,240
(The massaged side, untreated side)

2583
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,300
- Which side is it?
- Seok Jin. Look at this.

2584
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,210
- Oh, my.
- It got lifted so much.

2585
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:14,770
How fascinating.

2586
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,280
- How did it get lifted so much?
- How fascinating.

2587
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,310
- This side went up.
- Seok Jin.

2588
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:19,650
- It looks so different.
- Seok Jin.

2589
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:21,510
What are we going to do
with this side?

2590
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:24,020
(Only one side of his face
got rejuvenated.)

2591
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:25,520
- Did only one side improve?
- How about this side?

2592
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,090
- Seok Jin.
- This side got lifted.

2593
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,190
- Seok Jin.
- For real.

2594
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:30,090
- Ms. Jung, how about this side?
- I mean...

2595
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,960
Seok Jin, you look scary.

2596
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:34,490
- Seok Jin.
- Let me see.

2597
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,400
- Are they really different?
- You're doing this right now.

2598
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,930
You're doing this right now.

2599
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:40,330
- I mean...
- I'm smiling naturally.

2600
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:41,970
- You look scary.
- No.

2601
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:45,240
- You look like Baron Ashura.
- Baron Ashura.

2602
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:47,440
- You look scary.
- No.

2603
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:48,580
He looks strange, right?

2604
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:50,410
I think I'd like you to work
on this area.

2605
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:53,180
- Yes. The jawline.
- My jawline...

2606
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:56,350
- Now, lie down.
- All right.

2607
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:58,350
- Ms. Jung, please lift...
- Okay.

2608
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:00,450
both sides.

2609
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:01,990
You want tight skin. Okay.

2610
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:04,360
With Seok Jin,
only one side got lifted.

2611
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,530
- Okay.
- That's right.

2612
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:07,990
We're seeing
so many fun things today.

2613
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:09,630
Don't doubt it.

2614
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:11,630
(He dreams of getting his revenge.)

2615
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,370
(The target is clueless.)

2616
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:14,970
She's checking out
my facial shape first.

2617
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:16,000
Yes.

2618
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,740
(I'll pay back
for today's humiliation.)

2619
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,980
Why aren't you closing your eyes?

2620
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,280
(Wide open)

2621
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,150
- Why would I do that?
- Hey.

2622
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:34,290
That punk isn't closing his eyes.

2623
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:37,520
What's wrong with him?

2624
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:40,330
- I'll begin the therapy.
- Okay.

2625
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:42,560
- Tell me if you feel uncomfortable.
- Okay.

2626
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,130
- He failed.
- This isn't easy.

2627
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:47,230
- Does it hurt?
- This is...

2628
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:49,040
so refreshing.

2629
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:50,270
Right.

2630
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:51,770
It's really refreshing.

2631
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:53,770
- This is...
- It's really refreshing.

2632
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:55,080
I want that massage.

2633
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,010
Ms. Jung's massage feels amazing.

2634
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:58,710
I'm so scared of fire.

2635
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:00,980
That must hurt.

2636
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:04,720
Ms. Jung, I've never heard
of this massage.

2637
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:07,320
Right? People think
it's from abroad,

2638
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,720
but it's Korean massage.

2639
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,590
(Here comes the camera.)

2640
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:12,630
Gosh.

2641
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:15,100
(We need a close-up shot
of his pretty face!)

2642
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,300
- He's so ugly.
- You can endure it.

2643
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,700
Two more times.

2644
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,700
He's seriously ugly.

2645
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:23,240
- You can endure it.
- Two more times.

2646
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,440
(His face looks like dried durian.)

2647
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:26,870
One more time.

2648
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:28,840
You punk, move the camera.

2649
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:32,510
Ms. Jung, please brush up
his sideburns just once.

2650
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:35,120
I want to see that
"I'll use both feet now."

2651
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,350
- Both feet.
- Please use both feet.

2652
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:38,450
- The two feet.
- Okay.

2653
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:40,250
Right here. Do it here.

2654
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:41,320
- Yes.
- Here?

2655
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,320
- Please do it.
- Like this?

2656
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,120
Your face gets lifted
when you do that.

2657
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,690
I feel a bit of change here.

2658
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,030
- Really?
- A bit.

2659
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:49,330
You shouldn't avoid my feet.

2660
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:51,430
Why would I avoid them?

2661
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,700
Your feet... Wait.

2662
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:56,940
- Hold on.
- Two feet.

2663
01:23:56,940 --> 01:24:00,640
(The grasshopper is being crushed.)

2664
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:03,980
(They hold his legs.)

2665
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:05,780
- It hurts.
- This is what happened.

2666
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:08,150
I'll use both feet.

2667
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:09,750
Goodness!

2668
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:14,920
(Squeezing durian juice)

2669
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:20,690
(He gives up.)

2670
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:22,260
It hurts so much.

2671
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,830
It hurts so much.

2672
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:24,930
Goodness.

2673
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:27,430
This really hurts.

2674
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:29,200
- Get it a little bit more.
- Do it.

2675
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,840
- It went up.
- You look different.

2676
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,140
- Do I look different?
- Jae Seok.

2677
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:34,310
Look at yourself.

2678
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:35,740
- Did it change?
- It changed.

2679
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:36,840
- How do I look?
- It was lifted.

2680
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:37,940
- Seriously.
- You look like...

2681
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:39,250
Koo Kyo Hwan on this side.

2682
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,810
- Really?
- Really.

2683
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:42,880
It makes sense.

2684
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:44,420
(The side that looks
like Koo Kyo Hwan)

2685
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:45,620
This side is crumpled.

2686
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:47,190
This side is crumpled,
and this side looks like Koo Kyo Hwan.

2687
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:49,420
- Gosh, Jae Seok.
- How is this possible?

2688
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:50,820
Please lie down on the other side.

2689
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,790
- I should get it on the other side.
- Yes.

2690
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:54,260
- Yes.
- His eyes look different.

2691
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,400
How is this...

2692
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:56,930
- How does...
- The shape of his eyes changed.

2693
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:58,730
- half of the face change from that?
- Let me see.

2694
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:02,040
- It's really refreshing.
- You can feel that?

2695
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,170
It feels like my circulation
got better too.

2696
01:25:04,170 --> 01:25:06,140
Yes. It's different.

2697
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:09,310
You could be called Feet Heung Min.

2698
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:12,550
The way you use your feet
is like Son Heung Min.

2699
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,980
This part feels really good.

2700
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,320
Your cap.

2701
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,920
- It looks okay, right?
- Yes.

2702
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:20,290
He became handsome.

2703
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:21,720
- He's not handsome.
- How do I look?

2704
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,920
- Let me see.
- I became handsome, right?

2705
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,890
- Let me see.
- It's balanced on both sides.

2706
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:25,990
- I'm not sure if he got handsome.
- Jae Seok.

2707
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:27,060
- Your face got lifted a lot.
- It's a bit...

2708
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,630
- It got lifted.
- It went up.

2709
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:31,060
It became flat.
This part became flat.

2710
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,630
- It got lifted a lot.
- That's interesting.

2711
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:35,940
- It's like it was ironed.
- Can we do it to our spouses?

2712
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:37,940
You have to learn it
before you do it.

2713
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:39,540
- You can't just do it.
- I think it'd make us fight.

2714
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:41,340
- Understood.
- Thank you.

2715
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:42,840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2716
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,880
- It's interesting.
- It feels so nice.

2717
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:46,310
It feels really good
when you get massaged here.

2718
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:48,150
It felt really good here.

2719
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:49,920
But the one with both feet
hurts really badly.

2720
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,190
Now, the second therapy...

2721
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:54,090
is the fire therapy.

2722
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:57,320
You increase the body temperature
by lighting a fire on the body...

2723
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,690
to promote blood circulation,

2724
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:00,060
- This isn't nice.
- and it even helps...

2725
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,460
with maintaining
a youthful appearance.

2726
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:04,830
The fire therapy
is for Haha, Daniel,

2727
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:07,100
and Seok Jin.
It will be the three of you.

2728
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,230
Seok Jin will get another one?

2729
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:10,440
- You're going to get younger.
- But you...

2730
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:12,540
- You're going to get really young.
- Right.

2731
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:15,740
Before the fire therapist comes in,

2732
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:18,410
you should only be wearing T-shirts.

2733
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:20,380
- We should?
- Wear T-shirts.

2734
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:22,780
(He finally took off
the manager outfit.)

2735
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:24,720
- You look younger.
- Haha can take the middle one.

2736
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:27,220
- Haha can take the middle one.
- Me?

2737
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:30,120
What? Goodness.

2738
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:33,430
This way.

2739
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:35,090
This isn't scary, right?

2740
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:36,300
It's not scary.

2741
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,930
We just light a fire.

2742
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:40,300
Fire?

2743
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,800
It's okay.

2744
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,800
- Haha.
- This is just...

2745
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:47,440
- They'd do it because it's doable.
- Should I lie face down?

2746
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,710
No. On your back.

2747
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:50,040
Why does he lie face down?

2748
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:54,150
I thought it would be better
for you to get it on your stomach.

2749
01:26:54,150 --> 01:26:55,180
So you'll get it on your stomach.

2750
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:57,420
Did you put something
on your belly, Haha?

2751
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,320
(Young Forty Ha will get it
on his stomach.)

2752
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,520
It's different for all of us.

2753
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:04,460
What is this?
Why are you covering my face?

2754
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:05,590
Your head.

2755
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:07,060
Why are you covering my head?

2756
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:10,460
- It's...
- You could get burned.

2757
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:11,730
I could get burned?

2758
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,300
Hold on. I could get burned?

2759
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:18,740
The fire wouldn't reach there.

2760
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:20,070
Please.

2761
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:21,140
(Please don't set me on fire.)

2762
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:22,380
Please don't set me on fire.

2763
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:23,380
This...

2764
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:24,710
I...

2765
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:28,010
I didn't wish...

2766
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:29,620
to get so young.

2767
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,620
- Even Seok Jin.
- I'd take care of myself.

2768
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:33,520
Why are you making me do it here?

2769
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,920
How much is this per session?

2770
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,190
It's 500 dollars.

2771
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:40,190
The price is high...

2772
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:42,300
because the therapists
are putting a lot of care into this.

2773
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,560
That's right.

2774
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:45,060
That's right. It's the first time
we're giving an off-site therapy.

2775
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:46,300
- Right.
- Really?

2776
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:47,930
It's the first one in 20 years.

2777
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,700
It would be your first experience
at a different location.

2778
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:51,000
That's right.

2779
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,570
- But this is a different location.
- That's...

2780
01:27:52,570 --> 01:27:54,140
It's their first time.

2781
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:55,940
- It's their first therapy outside.
- This is the first time?

2782
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:57,040
- Wait.
- Is this all right?

2783
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,910
- You have to try this.
- This...

2784
01:27:58,910 --> 01:28:01,310
- But...
- Fire gets lit easily. Don't worry.

2785
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:03,420
- Fire gets lit easily.
- This is the first try.

2786
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:05,420
I like that she's honest.

2787
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:07,190
- I can trust her.
- That's right.

2788
01:28:07,190 --> 01:28:08,920
- It's their first outdoor therapy.
- The first one.

2789
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:11,390
This is nice.

2790
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:14,430
I'll bring the torch from outside.

2791
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:19,470
(He'll bring the fire
to burn Seok Jin.)

2792
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:21,430
You have to sear him.

2793
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:23,300
I'll bring the torch
like at the world sporting events.

2794
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:25,440
- Like the world sporting events.
- Like the world sporting relay.

2795
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,540
(That's the Seok Sam therapy.)

2796
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:29,940
Do you pour something on top?

2797
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,810
It's alcohol. The enzymes from wine.

2798
01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:32,810
- So...
- Wine.

2799
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:34,550
Yes. We'll set it on fire.

2800
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:37,420
It's not that high. It's okay.

2801
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:40,890
It's nothing much.

2802
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:41,890
That's right.

2803
01:28:41,890 --> 01:28:43,290
I can smell the wine.

2804
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:44,820
Yes. It's wine.

2805
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,830
You can just get a good sleep.

2806
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:47,930
It smells like wine.

2807
01:28:48,330 --> 01:28:50,360
I'm going to start now.

2808
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,470
Goodness.

2809
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:55,440
(The fire show begins.)

2810
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:57,300
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

2811
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:58,910
It's not that bad.

2812
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:00,070
Is my back on fire?

2813
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:01,470
- Yes.
- It's on fire.

2814
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:02,480
How is it?

2815
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,840
It's warm.

2816
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:06,910
It feels like we're at a campsite.

2817
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:09,350
- This is a campfire.
- Seok Jin.

2818
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:10,450
- Seok Jin.
- We can sit by the fire a bit.

2819
01:29:10,450 --> 01:29:12,290
Give me some sweet potatoes.
I'll roast them.

2820
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:13,620
- Let's roast some marshmallows.
- Yes.

2821
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:14,720
- This is nice.
- Goodness.

2822
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:15,860
This is a campfire.

2823
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,890
- This is nice.
- It's nice.

2824
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,130
This is how it's done?

2825
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,930
- I'll say it again.
- Yes?

2826
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:25,330
I didn't wish to go this far
just to look younger.

2827
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:28,070
You'll need to stick to your
right side for profile shots.

2828
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:31,400
- You know that, right?
- It's hot. The left side feels hot.

2829
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,740
- The left side is done.
- It's done.

2830
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:34,010
- Is it over?
- Yes.

2831
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:35,410
- It's over.
- It's over for the left side.

2832
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:36,840
- It's over.
- The right side is burning now.

2833
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,640
- The right side is burning.
- Why did I feel that?

2834
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,680
The left side felt hot.

2835
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:40,850
- No.
- It's just a feeling.

2836
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:45,020
(Haha is set on fire next.)

2837
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:47,420
It's catching fire.

2838
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:50,390
(Exclaiming)

2839
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:52,660
Why? Is it hot?

2840
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:54,730
- Watch the middle part.
- Right.

2841
01:29:54,730 --> 01:29:56,460
(Be careful)

2842
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:58,730
- Yes.
- Just in case.

2843
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:01,370
- He might want a fourth child.
- Yes. He's still...

2844
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:03,770
It decreased.

2845
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:07,410
It's cool, Haha.

2846
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:08,740
- You're like a hero.
- Haha.

2847
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:10,580
- It's so cool.
- You're like a hero.

2848
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:12,950
- You're the Flame Man.
- It's like...

2849
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:14,380
you have a superpower.

2850
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:16,020
Fire is burning on my body!

2851
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:18,750
- You're really cool, Haha.
- It's really cool.

2852
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,520
- I have a superpower!
- He's a superhuman.
Haha.

2853
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,290
Finally,

2854
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:25,630
you're becoming a superhuman.

2855
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:28,130
The left side is hot. My left foot!

2856
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:30,060
- There's no fire.
- There's nothing.

2857
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,630
There's nothing.

2858
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:33,000
- Your back would be warm.
- Seok Jin.

2859
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,730
- There's nothing.
- There's nothing.

2860
01:30:34,730 --> 01:30:35,840
- My calf.
- It's over.

2861
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,470
- There's nothing.
- There's nothing.

2862
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:39,070
- The fire went out.
- I felt it.

2863
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:40,770
The fire is burning well
on Daniel too.

2864
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:41,910
You're really burning fiercely.

2865
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:43,210
- I'm burning fiercely?
- Yes.

2866
01:30:43,210 --> 01:30:45,380
- Niel.
- It's blazing. Are you okay?

2867
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:46,480
The fire caught really well.

2868
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,410
- I'm burning fiercely?
- You're burning fiercely.

2869
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:50,520
- Really?
- She's passionate.

2870
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:51,720
This...

2871
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:55,020
Don't you see this in movies
when people get burned?

2872
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:56,120
- Are you all right?
- Am I on fire?

2873
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:57,960
- Yes.
- Do you see this?

2874
01:30:58,720 --> 01:30:59,730
This is you right now.

2875
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:01,390
- Is that me?
- It's you.

2876
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,530
- Miss!
- Yes?

2877
01:31:03,530 --> 01:31:05,700
- The left side is hot.
- There's nothing.

2878
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:07,030
- There's no fire.
- There's nothing on you.

2879
01:31:07,030 --> 01:31:08,500
There is no fire.

2880
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,240
- There's no fire?
- Yes.

2881
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:12,000
- Then why is it hot?
- Seok Jin.

2882
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,140
Maybe you just had a dream.

2883
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:15,340
No. Why is it hot?

2884
01:31:16,510 --> 01:31:19,610
- How is it?
- I'm drenched in sweat.

2885
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:21,510
I'm drenched in sweat.

2886
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:22,750
I guess you sweat.

2887
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:24,050
Let me see your face.

2888
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:26,490
You're in your 20s now.

2889
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:28,720
- Jump like this for a bit.
- You're in your 20s.

2890
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,760
(His back is wet.)

2891
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:32,890
Jump around like that.

2892
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:35,090
He's healthy.

2893
01:31:35,290 --> 01:31:36,900
- You have to cool down.
- He's healthy.

2894
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:40,830
(A Peter Pan dreaming
of being forever in his 50s.)

2895
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:42,300
You look the best today.

2896
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:43,470
This doesn't make sense.

2897
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:45,140
Look at me.

2898
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:47,440
- The bottom of his eyes went up.
- It really did.

2899
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,640
- His legs look so pretty.
- This is nice.

2900
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,510
Goodness.

2901
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,610
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2902
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:53,610
Thank you.

2903
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:55,510
Well done, everyone.

2904
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:56,820
You can just get off work now.

2905
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:58,480
- Okay!
- Okay!

2906
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,290
Thank you!

2907
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:02,620
(An elegant poetry club
held in the season of literature)

2908
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:03,820
(He's shameless.)

2909
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:06,730
(Kim Byoung Cheol, SUNMI,
and MIYEON came to write poetry.)

2910
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:08,130
(Why are you looking at Seok Jin...)

2911
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:10,930
(A rookie whose strength is getting
deeply absorbed in emotions.)

2912
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:12,200
(Is there a poem you like?)

2913
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:13,930
(My boob and booty is hot)

2914
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:15,330
(I'm a star, star, star)

2915
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:16,370
(We also have a poet
who doesn't know what poetry is.)

2916
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:17,540
(Do you have a poem, Byoung Cheol?)

2917
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,640
(If you earnestly wish for it,)

2918
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,270
(it will come true.
By Poet Kim Byoung Cheol)

2919
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:23,240
(Isn't that just a true saying?)

2920
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,540
(Beyond the faces of poets
who only seem elegant...)

2921
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,480
(lay the true nature
of card sharks.)

2922
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:29,450
(Even using
finely honed hand skills.)

2923
01:32:29,450 --> 01:32:31,850
(With veins bulging in their necks,
there's only one thing they want.)

2924
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:33,290
Everyone gets a prize
if they get jangttaeng.

2925
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:35,760
(They must get jangttaeng
and avoid ttonggwang, the penalty.)

2926
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,190
(The game has started.)

2927
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:39,430
(Who will win the fierce battle
of getting jangttaeng in the fall?)

2928
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:41,260
