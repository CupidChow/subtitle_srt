1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,640
Hello.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,480
Why am I alone here? Why?

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,550
(As early summer begins,
Jae Seok opens the show alone.)

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,010
What? What is this?

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,250
(In front of Jae Seok,
who's standing alone...)

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,290
- Please pick up the marker.
- Okay.

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,860
Within five seconds,
please draw the place you're in now.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,860
What did you say?

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,130
(Within 5 seconds,
please draw the place you're in now.)

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,060
(Jae Seok is well known
for his drawing skills.)

11
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,270
(Deer)

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,300
(Mother)

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,240
(Son Heung Min)

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,710
(The heretic of the drawing world)

15
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,980
(The pioneer
of clumsy drawing, Painter Yu)

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,480
It does look the same.

17
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,650
You can't give direct hints
by including patterns or letters.

18
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,680
- Ready.
- Hang on.

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,650
- This is... Wait.
- Start. Five...

20
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,290
- Five,
- Hang on a second.

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,260
four, three,

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,430
Hold on.

23
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,530
- two,
- Hang on.

24
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,730
- one. Time's up.
- Hang on.

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,530
- Stop drawing.
- I'm not done yet.

26
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,530
Put it down.

27
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,870
But how would I... I mean...

28
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,900
How would I draw it in five seconds?

29
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,540
Five seconds is too short.

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,040
(An unknown work is born.)

31
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,780
How am I supposed to draw this?

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,780
(Why is Jae Seok drawing
such a strange thing alone?)

33
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,810
Hang on.

34
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,350
This is the place
for today's opening.

35
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,550
- Without knowing that,
- Hello.

36
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,690
the other members are waiting
at different places now.

37
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,320
- This is too much.
- Only with your drawing,

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,160
all the members need to gather here
within the 30-minute time limit.

39
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,730
Then we will start the opening.

40
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,870
You will also get a benefit
that will help you with the race.

41
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,100
Come on. How would I
draw something in five seconds?

42
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,670
How would the members recognize
this place only with the drawing?

43
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,510
If the members don't make it here
in ten minutes,

44
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,410
you will get to draw more,
and we will send it to them.

45
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,180
This is just too much.

46
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,380
How would they find this place
with the drawing?

47
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,380
That's impossible.

48
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,920
(The drawing hint is received.)

49
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,960
What is this?

50
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,190
Am I supposed to find it out
only with this drawing?

51
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,430
Come on. What is this thing?

52
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,870
Is this it?

53
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,430
Even Dream drew better than this
when he was a one-year-old.

54
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,000
What is this? Was he told
to draw it in only a few seconds?

55
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,540
What is this?

56
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,270
(They can't even guess
what the drawing is about.)

57
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,240
Is it possible that we will be
doing the opening next week?

58
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,810
Hang on. We might end up
doing the opening next week.

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,780
Hang on.
Is this supposed to be a face?

60
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,590
Is this a face?
But it doesn't seem like one.

61
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,160
(Detective Kim with a good hunch
thinks it is a face.)

62
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,660
Isn't it a face?
But it looks like a face.

63
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,300
It's a face and a hat.

64
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,460
It looks like a gat.

65
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,500
What would this be?

66
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,500
(Meanwhile, Seok Sam
got in the car anyway.)

67
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,670
Sir, what do you think this is?

68
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,370
The thing that looks like a hat.

69
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,040
I think it's a gat.

70
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,670
Gat? Is it a gat?

71
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,980
I also thought it looked like
a person wearing a gat.

72
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,180
I thought it was a man with a hat,
but this is a location.

73
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,680
It does look like a gat though.

74
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,950
(He doesn't understand Jae Seok's drawings
even after 15 years.)

75
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,320
It totally looks like a gat.

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,190
Gosh, will they be able to find this place
with the drawing?

77
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,960
That's impossible.

78
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,560
Which member do you think will be
the first one to be here?

79
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,500
Se Chan might understand my drawing.

80
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,200
Se Chan, whose drawing style
is similar to mine.

81
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,500
Yes.

82
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,610
(Would his neuron brother,
Ssaebssaeb, recognize this?)

83
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,570
I think this is indoors.

84
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,610
(It doesn't seem easy this time.)

85
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,640
This is too much.

86
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,580
(He calls someone
feeling frustrated.)

87
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,150
- Haha.
- Se Chan.

88
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,050
I have no idea where to go
with this drawing.

89
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,860
Here's what I'm thinking about.

90
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,130
I wonder if this is outdoors...

91
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,630
or indoors.

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,360
Maybe it's a cafe or something.

93
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,230
I don't think it's a cafe.
This is...

94
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,540
- Here's what I think.
- Okay.

95
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,410
- What just crossed my mind is...
- Okay.

96
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,910
- Go on.
- We should find a place...

97
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,180
- for the opening anyway.
- Right.

98
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,510
If you think of everything,
maybe it's...

99
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,410
There's the Ahn Chang Ho statue.

100
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,380
- Dosan Park?
- Yes. It's probably Dosan Park.

101
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,550
(Running Man's favorite place
for the opening, Dosan Park)

102
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,360
(They bowed to the statue
every time.)

103
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,800
(It is possible that
Jae Seok drew him like this.)

104
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,600
(They head to Dosan Park
according to Haha's guess.)

105
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,670
I'll go to Dosan Park now.

106
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,500
- I don't think it is though.
- Let's go to Dosan Park.

107
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,040
Come to Dosan Park then.

108
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,470
- Okay.
- All right.

109
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,570
(Is Dosan Park the place
for the opening?)

110
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,470
Please go to Dosan Park.

111
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,710
I should call Jong Kook.

112
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,250
- Se Chan.
- Hello? Where are you?

113
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,780
I'm... For now...

114
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,450
You know, we often have
the opening at Dosan Park.

115
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,520
- Yes.
- When we're in this neighborhood.

116
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,260
So I was going
to stop by Dosan Park.

117
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,790
- Okay. Then...
- Where are you?

118
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,530
I'm in front of Dosan Park now.

119
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,200
Jong Kook. Hang on.

120
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,530
At the entrance of Dosan Park,

121
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,670
there's something
similar to the drawing.

122
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,700
Really?

123
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,670
At the entrance of Dosan Park,

124
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,610
there's something that's
somewhat similar to his drawing.

125
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,840
- Seriously?
- Yes, it's ambiguous though.

126
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,010
Is there something?

127
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,610
- I'll send you a photo now.
- Okay.

128
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,520
- I sent it. Check the photo.
- My gosh.

129
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,690
(The joint investigation
begins to gain momentum!)

130
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,320
Hey, I think this is it.

131
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,420
Did he draw this?

132
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,960
Is this it?

133
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,330
I think he's looking at this
from somewhere.

134
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,330
(He sounds certain.)

135
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,430
This does feel right.

136
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,500
I know, right?

137
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,860
It has a similar vibe.

138
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,840
- I'll wait at Dosan Park then.
- Okay.

139
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,300
- All right, Jong Kook.
- Bye.

140
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,970
(Will their guess be correct?)

141
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,280
They would need
the second hint anyway.

142
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,740
Otherwise, they wouldn't know.

143
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,610
This place is...

144
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,650
a thousand-year-old temple
in the city...

145
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,580
- and one of Gangnam's landmarks.
- Right.

146
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,980
It's the Bongeun Temple.

147
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,920
How would they find this place?

148
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,420
It's impossible to draw
this place in five seconds.

149
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,820
They will notice it
after getting the second drawing.

150
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,330
(Will the members be able
to recognize it and come here?)

151
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,860
- Hey, Dong Hoon.
- Seok Jin.

152
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,600
- What?
- Where are you going now?

153
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,700
- Now?
- Yes.

154
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,470
This is a little...

155
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,740
I asked the driver,
and he thinks it looks like a gat.

156
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,210
- What?
- A man wearing a gat.

157
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,540
I know, right?

158
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,380
So I think it's god.

159
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,680
So I think it's god.

160
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,450
Is there a place
that has something to do with god?

161
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,750
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

162
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,320
- Why...
- I'm busy.

163
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,290
(The eldest brother's reasoning
is on another level.)

164
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,390
(Laughing)

165
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,030
Okay. It helped a lot.

166
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
Your reaction helped me a lot.

167
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,300
(Laughing his head off)

168
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,310
We really need him on Running Man.

169
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,340
Guys. Hong Da, So Yeon,
come over here.

170
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,180
(Ji Hyo asks her staff for help.)

171
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,350
Look.

172
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,950
This is a location.

173
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,050
What do you think this is?

174
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,420
(This is a location.
What do you think this is?)

175
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,490
A location?

176
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,790
- It's a location.
- It looks like a bed.

177
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,920
- A bed?
- A location?

178
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,060
I think it looks like N Seoul Tower.

179
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,660
It looks like a candle.

180
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,190
- It looks like a candle, right?
- Yes.

181
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,530
Doesn't it look like
the N Seoul Tower?

182
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,730
- But what is this thing on top?
- Is this an antenna?

183
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,230
- Isn't it an antenna?
- Antenna.

184
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,840
- Maybe it's Antenna.
- Antenna.

185
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,740
- It must be Antenna.
- The agency.

186
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,870
- Ji Hyo, it's Antenna.
- Right. This thing on top.

187
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,510
- Right. It's Antenna.
- It's Antenna.

188
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,780
- Antenna.
- It's Antenna.

189
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,010
I'll go to Antenna.

190
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,080
- Bye.
- I'll go to Antenna. Thanks, guys.

191
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,250
Thank you.

192
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,580
I'm still grateful
even if it's wrong.

193
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,350
This is where we begin,

194
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,450
so my guess is that
this place is in Gangnam.

195
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,590
What do you think?

196
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,120
What?

197
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,930
- Is this the drawing?
- Yes.

198
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,390
I have to find the place
with this drawing.

199
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,930
- Don't you think it is Segok-dong?
- My goodness.

200
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,060
- Why? What is it?
- Hang on.

201
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,300
There's a big park.

202
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,070
It's called Yulhyeon Park.

203
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,470
- A park?
- Yes. And the place has...

204
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,440
- a wide open space in the front.
- Okay.

205
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
And there's a big building.

206
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,410
- In the middle of the open space.
- That must be it.

207
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,480
I think she's right.

208
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,650
- Are you going to the park?
- Yes.

209
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,950
- I should go.
- It looks the same.

210
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,220
- It's the park.
- What if I'm wrong?

211
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,350
I think I got it.

212
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,450
- I should go.
- Are you going there?

213
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,750
- Bye. Thank you.
- Good luck.

214
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,820
I got it right away, didn't I?

215
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,620
(I got it right away, didn't I?)

216
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,920
Is it not fun?

217
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,390
I'll do a search on the Internet.

218
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,330
This is it. Segok-dong.

219
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,130
(A ghost park on the top
of a 480m mountain)

220
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,900
- I guess this is it.
- Show it to me again.

221
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,300
(A ghost park in Segok-dong?)

222
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,640
Should we go and have some coffee?

223
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,270
Is there a ghost park in Segok-dong?

224
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,610
Yes.

225
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,740
Why?

226
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,150
Try finding the ghost park
on the map.

227
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,650
(Chuckling)

228
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,080
A park that no one visits...

229
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,580
(A park that no one visits...)

230
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,820
It's Yulhyeon Park.

231
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,320
(Laughing)

232
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,260
It's Yulhyeon Park,
not a ghost park.

233
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,290
(Even a ghost would be shocked.)

234
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,860
This is amazing. A ghost park?

235
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,030
I'm such a fool.

236
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,570
Can you please go...

237
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,040
- to Yulhyeon Park in Segok-dong?
- Yulhyeon Park?

238
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,800
What if I'm the first one
to get there?

239
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,040
For the first time in Running Man.

240
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,610
Ye Eun is going to Segok-dong.

241
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,980
Why is she going to Segok-dong?

242
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,880
My goodness. Ji Ye Eun.

243
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,810
If you got the drawing,
where would you go?

244
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,480
I can't go anywhere with this.

245
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,050
Where would I go after seeing this?

246
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,790
If any of them had entered
Bongeun Temple...

247
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,730
and seen the statue
of the Buddha before,

248
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,590
they might have recognized it.

249
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,460
Otherwise, there's no way
they can figure this out.

250
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,600
I guess that's why
we came to Bongeun Temple.

251
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,500
Our members...

252
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,440
can't even think of this place
for the opening.

253
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,580
(10 minutes have passed by,
so he gets a chance to draw more.)

254
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,110
I should give them
an additional hint.

255
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,150
I'll give you five seconds.

256
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,350
- Ready.
- Hang on.

257
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,050
Start.

258
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,090
One, two, three,

259
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,990
four, five.

260
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,490
- Time's up.
- Gosh, this is...

261
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,290
Oh, no.

262
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,030
(This is how it looks
after the additional drawing.)

263
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,360
They will think
this is a totem pole.

264
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,960
This is like...

265
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,770
They would probably think this was
a totem pole like Cheonhadaejanggun.

266
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,200
That's not it though.

267
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,840
But I drew the urna on the forehead.

268
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,510
That's the point.

269
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,780
You can tell by looking at the ears.

270
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,380
Buddha has big ears.

271
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,350
You should know Bongeun Temple
when you see this.

272
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,280
There should be members
to come this time.

273
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,820
This is... I see.

274
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,560
So it is a person's face. Hang on.

275
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,460
This is Cheonhadaejanggun.

276
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,760
Is this a totem pole?

277
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,400
Isn't this Jeju Island?

278
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,200
Isn't this dol hareubang?

279
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,940
This feels a little...

280
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,710
(Everyone has no idea what it is.)

281
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,870
Hang on. This is Gangnam, right?

282
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,640
It doesn't look like a park.

283
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,050
I don't think this is a park.

284
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,350
There's a temple in Gangnam...
Hang on.

285
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,380
(There's a temple in Gangnam!
Hang on.)

286
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,780
Bongeun Temple.

287
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,720
Bongeun Temple.

288
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,860
Nungin Sunwon.

289
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,060
Bulguk Temple.

290
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,830
Deokam Temple?

291
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,260
This is what comes to my mind.

292
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,030
A place with a statue of the Buddha.

293
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,770
Like a temple.

294
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,600
I should search for an image.

295
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,270
(Surprised)

296
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,210
(Surprised again)

297
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,480
This is it!

298
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,510
This is it!

299
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,380
This...

300
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,350
(Haha found Bongeun Temple
with the drawing.)

301
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,150
It's Bongeun Temple. Look.

302
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,190
Bongeun Temple has this.

303
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,490
Hey, I found it.

304
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,860
Right? This is it.

305
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,660
(Laughing)

306
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,560
Hey, this is it.

307
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,900
(Haha is sure that the photo
is the same as the drawing.)

308
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,000
Hey, Jae Seok draws well.

309
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,040
(Calling Se Chan)

310
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,840
- Hello, Haha.
- Where are you?

311
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,880
I just met Jong Kook
in front of Dosan Park.

312
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,480
I don't think I can go there.

313
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,550
- Why not?
- Why?

314
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,280
I can't go to Dosan Park.

315
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,390
Okay.

316
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,790
I don't know what will happen today.

317
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,690
I'll see you at the place
for the opening anyway.

318
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,530
- What's wrong with him?
- They wouldn't...

319
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,060
- let me talk to you on the phone.
- Haha.

320
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,330
This is a team game.
You know where you should go, right?

321
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,470
All right. Anyway...

322
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,340
- Bye. I don't think I can go there.
- Why are you being like this?

323
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,400
- What was that?
- I don't know.

324
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,840
- What's with him?
- What is he doing?

325
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,610
(He suddenly starts
an individual game alone.)

326
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,410
I won't tell them.

327
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,780
There must be something.

328
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,480
There's always a penalty.

329
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,750
I should keep it to myself.

330
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,520
(He arrives while shooting a race alone
without trusting anyone.)

331
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,650
(Laughing)

332
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,820
(He found the statue.)

333
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,920
This is hilarious.

334
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,060
I'm 100 percent sure this is it.

335
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,460
I can bet my entire fortune.

336
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,060
Jae Seok draws really well.

337
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,030
What? Is someone coming?

338
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,500
I should see which one is
quick-witted enough to be here.

339
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,040
- Jae Seok.
- Hey.

340
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,940
(Haha is the first to arrive.)

341
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,670
- My gosh.
- Hey, you quick-witted one.

342
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,640
- How did you think of this place?
- Jae Seok.

343
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,680
- Your drawing is great.
- I know.

344
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,380
(They are impressed by each other.)

345
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,650
Hey.

346
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,750
(He bursts into laughter
looking at the statue in person.)

347
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,350
See? He recognized it.

348
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,450
- I...
- Yes.

349
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,850
I laughed my head off...

350
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,290
- when I found this on the Internet.
- How did you find it?

351
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,260
- I thought it was a temple.
- I knew it.

352
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,860
- It can't be Jeju Island.
- Right.

353
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,130
- And we were in Gangnam.
- That's right. That's it.

354
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,560
That's how you should
approach the answer.

355
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,670
- Hey.
- By the way,

356
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,400
do I get something
for arriving early?

357
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,340
- No, it's a team game.
- This is an individual game.

358
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,500
- This is a team game.
- It's a team game.

359
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,770
Then why would there be a penalty?

360
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,440
This isn't a team game, is it?

361
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,740
- Tell me.
- Seriously...

362
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,880
This is a team game.

363
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,350
I told the others
to go to Dosan Park,

364
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,380
and I came here.

365
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,780
(A monster created
by 15 years of distrust)

366
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,020
This isn't a team game. Tell me.

367
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,150
- Why are you being so...
- Go ahead and give me a benefit.

368
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
What is this?

369
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,760
- Why are the ears so big?
- Listen, Jong Kook.

370
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,630
Let's take a look at this
from Jae Seok's perspective.

371
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,760
This can't be a person.

372
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,660
If this had been a person,

373
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,960
Jae Seok would've drawn it
only with some lines.

374
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,130
(This is how
Jae Seok draws a person.)

375
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,430
- I see. He'd draw the arms first.
- Yes.

376
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,570
- So...
- Arms and legs.

377
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,270
- So I guess this thing is tied up.
- I see.

378
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,910
- What is the mole in the middle?
- I know.

379
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,410
Is it with Jung Dong Nam?

380
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,240
The mole here...

381
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,610
- It looks like a totem pole.
- Hey.

382
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,050
Where is it?

383
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,480
- I got it.
- Where?

384
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
- You know the place.
- What?

385
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,820
- It's a temple.
- A temple?

386
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,220
Yes. I think it's a temple.

387
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,490
- Bongeun Temple.
- Bongeun Temple.

388
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,460
- It's in front of it.
- You're right.

389
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,660
- Look. This is it.
- What?

390
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,790
- I shouldn't be saying this.
- We got another tip?

391
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,360
- This is it.
- You're right.

392
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,860
- It's Bongeun Temple.
- Let's go.

393
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,030
- Let's just go.
- Jong Kook.

394
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,560
- This is it.
- Right. Let's just go.

395
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,770
- Jong Kook is amazing.
- Hey.

396
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,930
It's Bongeun Temple.

397
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,540
(Though it is a little late,
Jong Kook and Se Chan got it right.)

398
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,140
Please go to Bongeun Temple.

399
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,200
This is amazing.

400
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,970
The first three to arrive
will get to have lunch, right?

401
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,910
Come on.

402
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,210
- Why...
- You're so mean.

403
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,750
Why are you suddenly
making us work as a team?

404
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,780
- What's with you?
- Abandon those who can't keep up.

405
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,690
Hello.

406
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,090
(Daniel is the second to arrive.)

407
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,490
- Daniel!
- Hi.

408
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,630
- Jae Seok!
- You figured it out.

409
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,960
I sure did, Jae Seok.

410
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,990
Hello.

411
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,400
Someone's here. Who is it?

412
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,100
- Kook Jong.
- Your drawing has improved.

413
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,200
Of course.

414
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,830
- I mean...
- Of course.

415
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,170
- I knew it.
- Your drawing has improved.

416
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,170
(Astonished)

417
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,710
(Se Chan also arrives
at Bongeun Temple.)

418
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,010
He drew it well.

419
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,110
Good.

420
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,310
(7 minutes left,
and 3 more members to go)

421
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,980
- Let's go.
- This is doable.

422
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,980
Judging by the big ears,

423
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,950
it could refer to a person,
but we were told it was a location.

424
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,690
Could it be a location
that handles civil complaints?

425
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,790
- This is Song Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

426
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,560
I'm here to film Running Man.

427
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,430
- Yes?
- Is Jae Seok here?

428
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,230
I think I'm wrong.
I don't think it's Yulhyeon Park.

429
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,470
(Finally)

430
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,970
Darn.

431
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,410
This is frustrating.

432
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,810
Is it someone wearing a hat?

433
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,010
Only Se Chan would know
what this drawing is.

434
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,640
I'm useless on my own.

435
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,310
(Time drags on
thanks to the clueless 3.)

436
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,350
I'm exhausted.

437
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,680
Of course!

438
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,150
Seok Sam, you're here.

439
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,190
(Lastly, the empty head sisters
arrive together.)

440
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,490
- Okay!
- Goodness.

441
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,220
- Why were you at Antenna?
- Jae Seok...

442
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,730
- Why were you at Antenna?
- Why?

443
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,190
- Was she at Antenna?
- Wait.

444
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,900
- Because of the tall stick?
- She thought it was an antenna.

445
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,960
- She thought it was an antenna.
- An antenna...

446
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,270
Because of the stick?

447
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,730
- It doesn't just have an antenna.
- That was clever.

448
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,070
You went to Antenna?

449
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,570
Now that you're here,

450
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,070
we'll begin the opening scene.

451
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,610
There's something to mention.

452
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,840
- Really?
- That's right.

453
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,110
Yes, that's what we planned.

454
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,140
- He's hosting a show.
- Really?

455
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,450
My brother and I are hosting a show.

456
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,810
- When?
- That sounds like fun.

457
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,080
- Right.
- When?

458
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,180
On August 9 and 10.

459
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,050
Tickets will be available
starting June 13.

460
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,420
- June 13?
- Of course, I'd be there.

461
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,560
Tickets? Of course, we should go.

462
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,320
- Invite us.
- Absolutely.

463
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,830
You'll be singing
and doing comedy sketches, right?

464
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,330
Yes, and we'll also dance.

465
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,500
We'll be doing the Pumba Show too.

466
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,260
- This too, right?
- As in?

467
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,800
You'll do an impression
of Ryang Hyun Ryang Ha.

468
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,470
Ryang Hyun Ryang Ha?

469
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,800
(A two-brother act,
just like Ryang Hyun Ryang Ha)

470
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,470
- We'll be doing that.
- Of course.

471
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,810
- We'll have to.
- That you should.

472
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,910
We should do everything we can.

473
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,480
- What is this, exactly?
- Absolutely.

474
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,980
- Is it a solo act?
- A solo act?

475
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,210
- There are two of them.
- They're brothers.

476
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,080
- Oh, brothers.
- What's wrong with him?

477
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,880
- How can it be a solo act?
- What's his deal?

478
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,150
I'll be performing with my brother.

479
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,420
Will others be on the show?

480
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,120
- No, just them.
- I see.

481
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,890
- There will be guest performers.
- Right.

482
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,320
Good for you.
You should do such shows.

483
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,530
- We'll do our best.
- That sounds like fun.

484
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,590
- Right.
- Good.

485
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,900
Today's race was planned
for early summer weather,

486
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,760
- perfect for outings.
- Yes, we have great weather.

487
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,930
It's the Drawing Road Trip.

488
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,430
You will get off work...

489
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,400
if you enjoy
all three destinations...

490
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,310
- by 4 p.m.
- Is that so?

491
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,970
If you can't make it by 4 p.m.,

492
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,410
as a team,

493
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,610
you will ride
the thrilling Gyro Swing.

494
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,680
- No way. I can't.
- I can't get on that.

495
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,780
(They must enjoy all 3 locations
by 4 p.m.)

496
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,090
(If they fail, they will have
to ride the Gyro Swing.)

497
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,720
- I can't.
- I really can't.

498
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,090
- I can't ride that.
- Okay.

499
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,860
- I really can't.
- If I ride that,

500
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,660
- I'll barf.
- Same here.

501
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,030
- Please...
- Seok Jin and I...

502
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,560
- rode it once.
- You did?

503
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,660
We slept for two hours
after that, right?

504
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,800
- We slept for two hours in the car.
- It's true.

505
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,800
- We're not joking.
- I was still in my 20s.

506
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,000
- Why?
- Because they were dizzy.

507
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,470
- Because you were dizzy?
- We were so dizzy.

508
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,740
- The two of us...
- It was like a sleeping pill.

509
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,740
On a rainy day.

510
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,580
- They're adorable.
- What's this again?

511
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,880
Is it called the cricket tunnel?

512
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,510
- The cricket tunnel?
- You mean, the cochlea.

513
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,180
- The cochlea.
- A cricket tunnel?

514
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,720
(Seok Sam was looking
for a boiler in his ear.)

515
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,280
- A cricket?
- That's the name of a boiler.

516
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,090
Anyway, that helps us
maintain our balance.

517
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,890
- But you damaged it.
- It was damaged.

518
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,690
You'll be fine as long as
you don't go past the 4 p.m. deadline.

519
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,530
The outing locations...

520
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,000
will be guessed in the same way
you guessed Jae Seok's drawing.

521
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,170
After showing it to people,

522
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,640
you will ask them
what the drawing refers to.

523
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,940
- The people?
- You can only go...

524
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,210
to the location that is mentioned.

525
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,810
- That sounds tough.
- The people?

526
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,740
How could they know what we don't?

527
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,810
Exactly.

528
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,080
Let's say you drew
Gyeongbokgung Palace...

529
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,920
and asked someone
what this drawing was.

530
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,850
If they reply by saying
Bukchon Hanok Village,

531
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,220
you will have to go there,

532
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,790
- take a photo,
- And ask again?

533
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,020
and ask another person...

534
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,690
- Goodness.
- what the drawing is.

535
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,190
After you get the correct location,

536
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,000
you will go there
to enjoy an outing.

537
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,600
Then, you will draw the next one...

538
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,300
- Got it.
- and ask away.

539
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,870
If you had gathered...

540
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:56,170
at this location within 30 minutes,
we were going to give you...

541
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,710
- a benefit.
- I see.

542
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,310
But since you failed,

543
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,050
you will get drawing
without any benefits or advantages.

544
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,180
Jae Seok, I trust you.
You've improved a lot.

545
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,780
- Yes, you've improved.
- Just draw...

546
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,480
- the most prominent feature.
- You draw better than Se Chan.

547
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,090
- That's true.
- Exactly.

548
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,850
- Your drawing has improved.
- Really?

549
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,520
You know which characteristics
to focus on.

550
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,860
(His studio is being set up.)

551
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,930
- Jae Seok, take your seat.
- The first location?

552
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,300
The rest will take a step back.

553
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,130
Draw the prominent feature.

554
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,700
I think we'll get the N Seoul Tower.

555
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,340
- Or maybe the 63 Building.
- Right.

556
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,500
(Dongdaemun Design Plaza)

557
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,870
(The first location)

558
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,110
(The landmark in Seoul, DDP,
known for its unique exterior)

559
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,140
And go.

560
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,450
- Hold it.
- Seriously?

561
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,550
- One...
- Show us.

562
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,680
(He gets 5 seconds.)

563
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,880
- Two...
- Why did you look away?

564
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,650
- Three, four...
- How...

565
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,720
Time's up.

566
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,160
(Drawing complete)

567
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,030
- Seriously?
- Come on.

568
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,290
- Jae Seok.
- Isn't that a pound cake?

569
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,930
- Jae Seok!
- That's a thatched house.

570
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,430
Where is that in Dongdaemun?

571
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,400
- The former Dongdaemun Stadium.
- Migliore.

572
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,100
- Unbelievable.
- Across Migliore.

573
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,770
- The DDP.
- You should've drawn this up top.

574
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,570
The circle in the center.

575
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,610
The shape is like this.

576
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,980
No, like this.

577
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,440
You should've drawn Dongdaemun.

578
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,380
Now, ask the people
to guess what you drew.

579
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,550
- How?
- You'll do so by moving...

580
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,950
- to a bustling area.
- This is bad.

581
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,050
- Let's try again.
- No one will be able to guess that.

582
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,620
- The location.
- We'll be going to Hapcheon.

583
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,220
But it's a location.

584
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,720
- A location.
- Hold on. We...

585
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,890
- It's a famous location.
- Here's your question.

586
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,390
"What is this?"

587
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,660
- What is this?
- You can't say, "location."

588
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,500
What, rather than location?

589
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,470
That could actually be better
for us.

590
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,900
- Right.
- It's less random that way.

591
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,000
Let's go.

592
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,140
- Okay.
- Let's go.

593
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,470
- Gosh, it's hot.
- It's hot.

594
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,010
It's really hot.

595
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,940
- It's hot.
- It's so hot.

596
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,710
Seok Jin's been interested...

597
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,040
- in his looks lately.
- I know.

598
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,110
- He tries to look good.
- He's even been working out.

599
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,450
That's right! He posted it...

600
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,920
- on social media yesterday.
- He's working out?

601
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,420
He covered his face.

602
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,020
- What was that for?
- To look young.

603
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,650
Why did you upload a photo...

604
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,420
when you were in the gym...

605
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,220
for less than an hour?

606
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,590
- That was his goal.
- He was there for 20 minutes.

607
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,790
He went there to take the photo.

608
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,660
- He worked only one arm.
- I can't believe him.

609
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,260
People hit the gym
to take post-workout photos.

610
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,970
I worked out for 45 minutes,

611
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,500
- but fooled around for 25.
- Gym Guy, I can't believe you.

612
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,700
You always dread going to the gym,

613
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,770
but you feel proud afterward.

614
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,810
You only worked out for 20 minutes.

615
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,210
How is that important?

616
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,180
What matters is that I worked out.
What you said isn't important.

617
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,050
The fact I go to the gym
is important.

618
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,450
- Aren't I right, Jong Kook?
- Of course.

619
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,390
- Starting is half the battle.
- Absolutely.

620
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,450
Why did you upload a photo
that suggested a long workout?

621
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,620
I didn't write down
how long I worked out.

622
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,230
- You made it seem like you did.
- As if.

623
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,460
It was all a show.

624
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,860
- A show.
- Yes, a show.

625
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,700
Ssaebssaeb, you went to the US.

626
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,700
- Right, I did.
- Really?

627
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,970
- Yes.
- You went to the US?

628
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,370
- When?
- When?

629
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,640
- Two weeks ago...
- Why didn't you tell us?

630
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,510
Why didn't you tell Jong Kook?

631
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,070
- I knew about it.
- Right.

632
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,740
- But it's odd.
- How so?

633
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,110
Se Chan went to the US?

634
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,140
- Why did he go there?
- Hold on.

635
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,550
He went to Las Vegas.

636
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,910
- Why?
- I didn't know.

637
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,680
How could he go to Las Vegas
without telling me?

638
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,950
I told you...

639
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,220
- Listen.
- at the Chinese restaurant.

640
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,320
Normally, you remind people
right before you leave and such.

641
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,820
- Exactly.
- Because...

642
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,360
You'd expect to hear stories...

643
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,330
- or him reminding you.
- Ssaebssaeb.

644
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,460
- He didn't say a word.
- I...

645
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,460
Congratulations.

646
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,530
- Hear me out.
- Congratulations.

647
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,660
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

648
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,700
- Wait.
- Congratulations.

649
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,900
I went with Jae Jun and Se Hyeong.

650
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,070
Congratulations.

651
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,040
- Congratulations.
- On what?

652
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,810
- It's tough being with your girl...
- It's all right.

653
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,270
when there are other people.

654
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,440
- You travel in groups on purpose.
- Exactly.

655
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,680
I thought it was a secret,

656
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,580
so I didn't say anything
until Jae Seok brought it up.

657
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,250
- I see.
- It's not like that.

658
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,850
- That's not it.
- It's weird.

659
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,250
There was nothing to talk about.

660
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,590
Why would I brag
about going on a vacation?

661
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,050
Why didn't you tell me about it?

662
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,260
Jong Kook goes to LA to see his kid.

663
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,060
- What are you talking about?
- I always tell people...

664
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,790
- where I'm going.
- Okay, fine.

665
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,600
I didn't want Jong Kook...

666
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,030
- to be burdened by it.
- If he heard you were going?

667
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,270
I didn't want to bother him
since he's caring.

668
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,470
And because he might find out
about your girlfriend.

669
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,940
- Of course.
- Is she an idol singer?

670
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,400
- An idol singer?
- What are you talking about?

671
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,440
- Anyway, let us accompany you.
- Good for you.

672
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,640
(Mr. Ha creates a rumor again.)

673
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,810
- Congratulations.
- My brother's dating an idol!

674
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,750
- Lucky him.
- It was me, Jae Jun, and Se Hyeong.

675
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,950
Ssaebssaeb.

676
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,650
Don't you think you're spending
too much money...

677
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,280
just to go on vacation
with your girlfriend?

678
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,320
- I got the ticket with my miles..
- The plane tickets are pricey.

679
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,520
Tell me about it.
That's how much he loves her.

680
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,960
- What's this place?
- This is a trending area.

681
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,890
- So I've heard.
- Where are we?

682
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,260
- We're in Itaewon.
- Itaewon?

683
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,800
- Itaewon?
- Hannam-dong.

684
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,530
This drawing
of Dongdaemun Design Plaza...

685
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,470
- Someone will call it a cake.
- A pound cake.

686
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,000
I prefer cakes.

687
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,800
Get off the bus already!

688
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,140
(Food Fighter is already
low on sugar.)

689
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,210
I prefer cakes.

690
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,280
Over there.
I see a lot of youngsters.

691
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,240
- It's trendy.
- Goodness.

692
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,780
Something about this place
is stylish.

693
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,050
- It's trendy.
- This place is cool.

694
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,580
Is this a street in Itaewon?

695
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,920
- Yes.
- Goodness me.

696
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,850
Something about this place
is stylish.

697
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,820
Hi, youngsters.

698
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,790
- Ji Hyo...
- Hello.

699
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,220
- What's with you?
- What are you doing?

700
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,030
- Hi, youngsters.
- Ji Hyo, what is this?

701
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,690
- What is she doing?
- What was that for?

702
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,460
- What's her problem?
- What's wrong with you?

703
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,060
- Ji Hyo, don't.
- Stop it.

704
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,230
- Ji Hyo, come on.
- Look natural.

705
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,800
- They're young, aren't they?
- What's your problem?

706
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,340
- Ji Hyo.
- But calling them that...

707
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,640
- What's wrong with you?
- They're young.

708
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,040
I think she's flustered
by this place.

709
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,770
- This is a famous cafe.
- It's a Monday.

710
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,880
Why is it this packed on a Monday?

711
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,710
- I love it here.
- It's popular.

712
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,150
Exactly. This is a popular cafe.

713
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,480
- I know.
- It's a popular cafe.

714
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,280
It has three stories.

715
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,190
- Have you been here?
- Yes.

716
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,290
- Really?
- Yes.

717
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,890
- Is it popular?
- Is this the right place, then?

718
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,690
It definitely looks like
it needs to be redeveloped.

719
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,790
- Mister...
- Look at the building.

720
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,290
Why would you say that?

721
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,360
Is it even open?

722
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,030
Don't you think
the building is too old?

723
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,770
- It could be a soft opening.
- Don't you know this place?

724
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,600
What is this place?
This is new to me.

725
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,170
- But...
- It needs to be rebuilt.

726
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,000
We're here at a trending cafe.

727
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,940
- They called it hot. Jong Kook...
- It's a hotspot.

728
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,240
Jong Kook said,
"This place should be redeveloped."

729
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,280
It should be rebuilt.

730
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,550
- To that, Daniel said...
- What?

731
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,250
"Isn't it a soft opening?"

732
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,790
- That's insane.
- Each age group...

733
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,690
- A soft opening?
- A soft opening?

734
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,890
There are lots of buildings
like this in alleys in Anyang.

735
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,930
This place is becoming
more and more trendy.

736
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,490
It's been trendy for a while.

737
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,330
I had no idea
it had changed so much.

738
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,900
It has changed a great deal.

739
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,970
Gosh. It's so stylish.

740
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,170
This place is really trendy,
you know.

741
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,270
- Seriously.
- It's so stylish.

742
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,610
- Gosh, you're all so young!
- Who is?

743
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,870
- Looking good!
- Where?

744
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,380
- Oh, the bikers?
- Enjoy life!

745
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,610
Ride safely!

746
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,080
- You can't be rude to strangers.
- Honestly...

747
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,150
Why are you like this?

748
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,420
- Everyone is a younger sibling.
- They're not your siblings.

749
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,590
- Don't try to recruit customers.
- Enjoy it!

750
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,650
- Hey.
- Let's go!

751
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,390
- My goodness.
- Hey, you right now...

752
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,860
- Hi!
- Who should we ask?

753
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,790
(Laughing awkwardly)

754
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,530
He's trying to become popular
with the foreigners.

755
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,770
- Have a good day!
- Gosh.

756
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,440
You're all so hyper.

757
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,870
- Where are you from?
- He's on a high.

758
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,510
They're not usually out
at this time of day.

759
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,940
Indonesia?

760
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,010
I've never seen him this excited.

761
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,880
When Seok Jin's out
with no cameras present,

762
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,410
he pulls his mask up here.

763
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,420
And he hides.

764
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,920
He doesn't greet anyone.

765
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,790
- That's true.
- Seriously.

766
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,060
- So, hang on.
- We need to ask someone.

767
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,760
- What's important is,
- Yes.

768
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,790
- they must see this drawing...
- Yes.

769
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,360
and guess what it is.

770
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,630
Over at Dongdaemun Plaza...

771
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,500
- It's DDP, not Dongdaemun Plaza.
- Really?

772
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,770
- It's DDP.
- He said "Dongdaemun Plaza."

773
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,340
He said "Dongdaemun Plaza."

774
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,710
- It's DDP.
- That's what DDP stands for.

775
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,710
Oh, really?

776
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,010
(Awkward laughter)

777
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,440
- Dongdaemun Design Plaza.
- Design Plaza.

778
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,980
Oh, Dongdaemun Design...

779
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,080
First, we should ask
if they watch Running Man.

780
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,250
- Can they decipher our drawings?
- Do they know it?

781
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,850
- That's right.
- They must get your drawings.

782
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,420
We must tell them
it's not an ordinary drawing.

783
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,060
- Not many get my artistic view.
- No.

784
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,230
We must ask them that.

785
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,990
That's hip! You're hip!

786
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,100
Do you mean HOKA?

787
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,860
They're on a running crew.

788
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,700
- No, don't do...
- HOKA for trainers.

789
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,700
By the way, I must say this.

790
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,170
When I interview the public,
I'll ditch people who don't suit me.

791
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,010
People who go overboard?
You don't need the pullers-in?

792
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,510
He started his career
by interviewing the public.

793
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,510
Yes, but he's nothing
but excitement.

794
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,220
- There's no content.
- He goes overboard.

795
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,980
- Let's give it a go.
- Let's just...

796
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,150
Start with an ice-breaker.

797
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,790
Let's fail and eat something.

798
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,790
It looks like bread to me.

799
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,060
The people over there were younger.

800
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,520
How about that person who's alone?

801
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,060
- No, they might be too shy.
- Can we interview you?

802
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,360
- Who did you ask?
- The woman in gray?

803
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,330
- I see.
- Will you cross the road?

804
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,070
Can we interview you?

805
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,230
- Cross the road!
- Good.

806
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,270
- She said yes.
- She looks calm.

807
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,600
- She does.
- She looks...

808
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,370
- Let's get her...
- She wasn't flustered.

809
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,970
Come on over! She's coming.

810
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,210
- She's calm.
- She isn't rushing.

811
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,410
- Do you watch Running Man?
- Do you?

812
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,180
- Yes.
- You do, right?

813
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,320
Then... What's your name?

814
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,820
My name is Kwon Ye Ji.

815
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,880
- Ye Ji.
- Yes.

816
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,950
- I drew a picture.
- I see.

817
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,690
- Okay.
- You'll get a feel when you see it.

818
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,760
- Answer right away, Ye Ji.
- Okay.

819
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,700
Look at it carefully and calmly say
what comes to mind.

820
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,730
What is this?

821
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,300
- You can take your time.
- Yes.

822
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,440
- Whatever comes to mind.
- Anything is fine.

823
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,070
- What first came to mind?
- Yes.

824
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,910
I first thought it was a sofa.

825
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:54,910
It wouldn't be that.
It's never the first answer.

826
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,910
It looks like she just had a dream.

827
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,920
What first came to mind?
What is this?

828
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,350
(Glancing around)

829
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,320
(What is her second answer?)

830
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,360
Please.

831
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,160
- Whatever comes to mind.
- If you get it right...

832
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,530
- A cinema.
- What?

833
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,760
- A cinema?
- A cinema? Not too bad.

834
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,730
I wanted to watch
"Mission Impossible."

835
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,300
- Why did you mention a cinema?
- It looked like the seats.

836
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
Seats in a cinema.

837
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,140
- I see...
- It wouldn't be that.

838
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,170
Say something else.

839
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:24,610
We'll go to a cinema,
take a photo, and try again.

840
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,880
A sofa would've been easier.
There's pretty furniture everywhere.

841
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,010
- I'm sorry, Ye Ji.
- Was it a sofa?

842
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,880
- No.
- No.

843
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,720
- Your sofa answer...
- It's DDP.

844
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,150
Oh, DDP...

845
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,390
- It's nonsense.
- It makes no sense.

846
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,190
- You'd never have guessed.
- No.

847
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,420
- Thanks.
- Thanks for your time.

848
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,220
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

849
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,360
- Thank you.
- You'd never have gotten it.

850
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,500
- It's too hard to get the answer.
- Thank you.

851
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,200
- We can at least eat a cake.
- We could eat that.

852
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,900
- Now we must go to a cinema.
- Was this always...

853
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,900
Is there a cinema nearby?

854
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,340
- A sofa would've been easier.
- That was a better one.

855
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,240
- A sofa was better.
- Every coffee shop has a sofa.

856
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,810
- Yes.
- We could've taken a photo here.

857
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,880
There are lots of sofas.

858
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,110
Let's ask quickly and move on.

859
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,880
- Yes.
- I think that's better.

860
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,080
- Increase the number of tries.
- Let's go.

861
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,790
Ask quickly, try many times,

862
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,620
- and move faster.
- Speed things up.

863
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,620
- Yes.
- Okay.

864
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,360
This is really hard.

865
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,790
A sofa was an easier answer.

866
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,190
This isn't easy.

867
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,860
What's crucial is,

868
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,130
she said "sofa"
and that was easier for us,

869
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,900
- but Haha suddenly...
- He started over.

870
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,870
If we'd gone with the sofa,
we could've stayed here.

871
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,700
A sofa was a better answer.

872
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,210
- Sofa...
- Why did you come up to me?

873
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,140
- I said I wanted him out.
- I know.

874
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,410
- Yes.
- Seriously.

875
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,740
Why do you act like such a blowfly?

876
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,610
- You act like one.
- I'm a blowfly?

877
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,680
Oh, whatever. I don't care anymore.

878
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,890
Hey!

879
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,790
Sit down. It's just five minutes.

880
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,690
- It's for five minutes.
- It's for five minutes.

881
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,790
She was trying to answer.

882
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,230
Why did you go and...

883
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,030
I egged her on, yes.
This time I'll do the interview.

884
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,860
- Don't. Stay out of it.
- Don't.

885
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,200
You messed it up!

886
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,500
- Go home!
- "Go home?"

887
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,640
(Childish beyond belief)

888
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,370
Why did you butt in
during the interview?

889
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,340
What do you know
about interviewing the public?

890
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,510
That's his specialty.
He has a whole show about it.

891
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,440
- He's at the top.
- I'm an expert at that.

892
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,780
I could get a degree in it.

893
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,710
- Oh, really?
- It's his specialty.

894
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,180
Will you think, please?

895
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,350
- Jae Seok.
- Forget it.

896
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,620
I played music videos on the street
so many times.

897
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,890
- That's true.
- We know that.

898
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,420
- I know that.
- But that was the olden days.

899
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,190
We don't interview people
like this now.

900
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,300
- You're old-school.
- You're too well-mannered.

901
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,400
I hate this the most.

902
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,200
"Introduce yourself!"
I hate that so much.

903
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,830
- That's Hong Chul, not me.
- Not you?

904
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,570
"Wassup, yo!" That was me.

905
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,040
"Wassup, yo!" That was me.

906
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,780
"Wassup, yo? Wassup, dawg?"

907
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,410
- That was me.
- "Wassup, dawg?"

908
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,880
Goodness...

909
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,980
Jae Seok,
you have no right to complain.

910
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,880
- Your useless drawing...
- That's nonsense.

911
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,590
- Right now...
- How was I to draw DDP?

912
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,950
- Yes, it's hard.
- You should've drawn the roof.

913
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,320
Give me a shot and I'll really...

914
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,690
Isn't this impossible?

915
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,190
We'll never reach even one place.

916
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,130
- We can't.
- Not like this.

917
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,500
Let's choose carefully
the person to ask the question.

918
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,600
- The sofa...
- You stay out of it.

919
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,630
Listen.

920
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:06,070
It's rude to say that to someone
who interviewed the public.

921
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,440
- Trust me one last time.
- Okay.

922
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,810
- Is this Gyeongnidan-gil?
- Yes.

923
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,840
Hey, what's that?

924
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,210
- This is it?
- This is the cinema?

925
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,140
- "Cinema."
- It's a cinema.

926
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,250
Let's take a photo.

927
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,350
- We need a photo.
- Let's take one.

928
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,520
- I left my camera.
- There's a cinema.

929
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,150
The entrance is quite pretty.

930
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,490
Shall we take a photo?

931
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,290
- Cinema.
- Cinema.

932
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,390
Make sure the word "cinema"
is in the photo.

933
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,990
- Is it in?
- Is the "cinema" in the frame?

934
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,430
- It's in.
- Okay.

935
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,900
- What?
- A cinema?

936
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,430
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

937
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,600
Jae Seok, Haebangchon over there
has some young folk.

938
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,540
- Here...
- We must save time.

939
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,140
- Yes.
- We must do it here.

940
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,070
- Here...
- Someone working around here.

941
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,340
- Someone working around here or...
- Let's look around.

942
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,810
Let's give it a go.

943
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,640
Since we're here.
Why go somewhere else?

944
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,910
This looks tasty.

945
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,280
- What's this?
- Hello.

946
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,880
- Hello.
- It looks tasty.

947
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,280
- Meat noodles?
- It looks great.

948
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,520
- It looks nice.
- It sounds nice.

949
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,050
I really want some.

950
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,450
Ji Hyo is my ideal type.

951
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,120
- She's your ideal type?
- Hello.

952
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,790
- Ji Hyo?
- Are you flirting?

953
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,490
- Good for you, Ji Hyo.
- Are you married?

954
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,590
- You're not married?
- Great.

955
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,900
You like well-built men.

956
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,530
Are you single? Look at those arms!

957
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,070
Why did you suddenly say
Ji Hyo's your ideal type?

958
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,170
She was my type for over ten years.

959
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,610
- For real?
- Since Running Man episode one.

960
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,810
- For real?
- For real?

961
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,310
- What an opportunity!
- How come she's your ideal type?

962
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,540
What about her do you like?

963
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,410
- Just her whole being.
- Her whole being.

964
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,280
I'll come by one day.

965
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,880
Pose for a photo with him.

966
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,620
- Yes, let's.
- Sure.

967
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,350
- Hey, Ji Hyo...
- Gosh...

968
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,790
One, two, three.

969
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,790
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

970
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,330
- Later on...
- I'll come by one day.

971
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,930
- Thank you.
- Let's ask someone.

972
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,760
- What now?
- I'm hungry.

973
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,700
We're done for
if we fail to get to DDP.

974
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,000
We might be stuck on this until 4 p.m.

975
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,800
- This looks bad.
- We'll be doing this until 4 p.m.

976
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,870
We have to visit three places
and we're stuck on the first one.

977
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,280
This place...

978
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

979
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,110
- Hey, are you...
- Yes?

980
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,210
Are you going somewhere?

981
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:00,180
I work at the real estate agency
and I'm out to have lunch.

982
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,980
- Real estate agency?
- Hey.

983
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,120
You must go to lots of places.

984
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,690
- You work as a realtor?
- Yes.

985
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,160
- You must travel the area.
- I do.

986
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,590
- Since it's your job.
- Yes.

987
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,300
Do you go to other places a lot too?

988
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,600
Yes, Hannam-dong, for example.

989
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,300
- Hannam-dong.
- Hannam-dong, that area.

990
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,630
You broker deals in this area.
What's your name?

991
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,970
It's Min Chae Hong.

992
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,800
- Chae Hong.
- "Chae" for vegetable.

993
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,010
How is the property market
these days?

994
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,610
We scored
a pretty big deal last year.

995
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,240
- Did you?
- Yes. We scored...

996
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,910
a pretty big deal last year.

997
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,850
- Did you?
- Yes.

998
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,150
- You scored?
- Congratulations.

999
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,180
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1000
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,520
The economy's struggling
in many ways these days,

1001
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,420
so I wanted to ask
how your field was.

1002
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,890
We should ask.
People are interested.

1003
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,360
Have you seen Running Man?

1004
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,100
Yes. I like all of you.

1005
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,870
- Do you?
- I see.

1006
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,430
- I'm dreadful at drawing.
- Yes.

1007
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,900
The crew gave me a location...

1008
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,540
- and I had five seconds to draw it.
- I see.

1009
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,910
- The question is,
- Yes.

1010
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,310
what is this?

1011
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,810
You can take your time.

1012
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,150
Is it a place or...

1013
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,350
- Hey, you got it.
- Nice one.

1014
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,650
- We can't tell you directly.
- That's crazy.

1015
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,350
- We can't tell you directly.
- We...

1016
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,990
- You have a great touch.
- You sensed it.

1017
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,960
The feel... I had five seconds
so I couldn't go into detail.

1018
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,290
It's a miracle if she gets it.

1019
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,460
- It's a bit...
- It's a mess. He had five seconds.

1020
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,800
It's not here.

1021
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,760
He drew something he was told to.

1022
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,770
In five seconds.

1023
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,700
- It's...
- Jangchung Arena?

1024
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,040
- It's...
- Jangchung Arena? No?

1025
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,500
- Jangchung Arena?
- Yes.

1026
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,340
- It's...
- Jangchung Arena? No?

1027
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,810
(Disappointed)

1028
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,380
(It's too difficult
even for a building expert.)

1029
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,110
- Isn't it?
- Jangchung Arena?

1030
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,110
- Yes.
- Yes.

1031
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,310
- You're right. It looks like it.
- It does.

1032
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,980
- It's okay. We're getting closer.
- Chae Hong, it's...

1033
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,420
It looks like Jangchung Arena.

1034
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,020
- Chae Hong, it's DDP.
- We're getting closer.

1035
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,220
Oh, DDP.

1036
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,320
- Because there are two... Yes.
- Dongdaemun. Yes.

1037
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,760
- This doesn't make sense.
- It's okay.

1038
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,690
But Jangchung Arena is okay.
You did well.

1039
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,100
- It's on the way.
- Thank you.

1040
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,700
- Thank you, Chae Hong.
- You did well.

1041
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,230
- Thank you.
- We don't resent you.

1042
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,830
Let's get in the car first.

1043
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,700
- Jangchung Arena isn't that bad.
- We've gotten pretty far.

1044
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,770
- All right. Let's do it.
- Let's hurry.

1045
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,710
It'll take time for us
to get there too.

1046
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,210
Isn't there some other mission?

1047
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,480
They usually don't give us
such impossible missions.

1048
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,550
Will they give us a chance
to draw something more?

1049
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,550
Or change the person
who gets to draw.

1050
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,350
Jangchung Arena.
We actually came here.

1051
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,780
- All right.
- Here it is.

1052
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,690
- It's here.
- We can take a picture here.

1053
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,120
- Let's take a picture.
- Yes.

1054
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,560
My goodness.

1055
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,360
It's right over there.

1056
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,390
- DDP is right over there.
- Gosh, we're at Jangchung Arena.

1057
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,660
We came all the way here.

1058
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,930
First, let's take the picture.

1059
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,200
Come here. Let's take a selfie.

1060
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,630
- Excuse me, please take a photo.
- Can you take a photo of us?

1061
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,340
We don't have time. Hurry up!

1062
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,540
(We don't have time. Hurry up!)

1063
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,000
Also,

1064
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,470
- you're all so angry from hunger.
- No.

1065
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,980
- It's fine. I ate a bit.
- It's about time for us to eat.

1066
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,640
(Done taking a photo
at Jangchung Arena)

1067
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,910
Oh, wait.

1068
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,610
How do we direct people toward DDP?

1069
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,550
It might work if we ask,
"Where is this place?"

1070
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,620
Right, but if we ask,
"What is this?"

1071
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,820
We won't get the right answer.

1072
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,960
I had some hope,
but when I looked at this again...

1073
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,730
This won't work.

1074
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:58,330
Since people don't seem to
have the slightest clue,

1075
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,160
- Yes?
- we'll give you a mission.

1076
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,430
- Nice.
- That's good.

1077
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,970
- You will play jegi.
- Yes?

1078
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,840
If the seven members
except for Jae Seok...

1079
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,770
successfully kick the jegi
50 times total,

1080
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,940
Jae Seok will get ten extra seconds
to add to his drawing.

1081
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,310
- But on here...
- It would work if you add to this.

1082
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,610
- What will you draw?
- Just add to the roof.

1083
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,940
- If I get to add to this,
- Dongdaemun?

1084
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,410
what do I draw to make it look
like DDP?

1085
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,480
- Here, the roof.
- Dongdaemun.

1086
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,850
- Let's try it first.
- All right.

1087
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,680
- Let's say a cheer.
- Can we practice?

1088
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,620
Daniel. We know how good they are.

1089
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,890
- Daniel, it all depends on you.
- Seok Jin.

1090
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,590
I'm a total pro at jegi.

1091
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,890
- He says he's a pro.
- I'm a pro.

1092
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:26,960
- Hey, he says he's a pro.
- He's the key player.

1093
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,990
Let's go.

1094
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,090
- Let's go.
- Okay!

1095
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,130
- Come here. One...
- We can't go home today.

1096
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,830
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

1097
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,460
- All right.
- I'll go first.

1098
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,470
Ji Hyo, just hit two.

1099
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,670
- Just two.
- That's right.

1100
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:38,900
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

1101
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,200
- One, two.
- One, two.

1102
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,700
- Three...
- Two.

1103
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,770
- You could've done 3.
- You almost did 3.

1104
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,540
- Ye Eun, come here.
- Ye Eun.

1105
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,710
- Ye Eun, do 2.
- Just do 2.

1106
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,250
- One, two.
- One, two.

1107
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,410
- Three!
- Good!

1108
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,610
(The Ji Song Sisters
each kick the jegi twice.)

1109
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,680
That's good.

1110
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,920
- Seok Jin, go.
- Okay.

1111
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,150
- You have a good vibe.
- Seok Sam.

1112
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,990
- This is just practice.
- Let me rest a bit. My leg...

1113
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,920
- That was practice.
- What's wrong?

1114
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,190
- He kicked it with his ankle bone.
- His ankle bone.

1115
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,590
Your ankle bone?

1116
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,760
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1117
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,990
- Your bone isn't broken, is it?
- No. My ankle bone.

1118
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,060
Here I go.

1119
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,630
- Seok Jin.
- Darn it.

1120
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,900
- Seok Jin.
- Darn it.

1121
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,270
- Hey, why...
- Didn't he say, "Here I bow?"

1122
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,740
Didn't he say, "Here I bow?"

1123
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,240
- Bow. That's what he said.
- He said "bow."

1124
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,810
- Listen to it. He said "bow."
- That doesn't count.

1125
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,170
- He said "bow."
- Seriously.

1126
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,680
- I really said "Here I bow."
- I said "bow."

1127
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,510
Also, why did you call my name?

1128
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,780
- This doesn't count.
- Take that out.

1129
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,010
- You should do at least 30.
- Please.

1130
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,350
- Here I go.
- Here we go.

1131
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,580
- You should practice once.
- Okay.

1132
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,290
(Will we be able to trust
his confidence this time?)

1133
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,490
I'll just go for it now.

1134
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,160
- One, two,
- Oh, nice.

1135
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,730
- three, four,
- Three, four...

1136
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,060
- five, six,
- Nice!

1137
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,430
- Nice! Six.
- Slowly.

1138
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,460
(He really was good at something!)

1139
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,900
- Seven, eight,
- Seven.

1140
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,200
- nine, ten!
- Oh, my!

1141
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,670
Eleven, twelve,

1142
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,640
- thirteen,
- Nice!

1143
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,110
- fourteen, fifteen,
- Fourteen, fifteen,

1144
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,510
- sixteen, seventeen,
- sixteen, seventeen,

1145
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,570
- eighteen...
- eighteen...

1146
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,480
(If he kicks it 2 more times,
he'll be halfway to 50!)

1147
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,980
- Seventeen, eighteen...
- Seventeen, eighteen...

1148
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,010
- Eighteen.
- Awesome!

1149
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,920
- Nice!
- Eighteen!

1150
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,620
- Eighteen.
- That was insane!

1151
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,990
- Nice. Good job.
- How many is that total?

1152
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,190
- Good job.
- You've done 28 so far.

1153
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,290
- We did 28?
- My gosh.

1154
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,590
- Okay, here I go.
- We're all set.

1155
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,890
- One, two,
- One, two,

1156
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,290
- three, four...
- three, four...

1157
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,590
- Okay.
- Four.

1158
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,500
(Only 4?)

1159
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,630
- Hey.
- That's 32.

1160
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,730
- That's 32.
- Hey.

1161
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,570
- I'll go first.
- Okay, you go.

1162
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,640
Gosh, hearing him say that
he'll go first makes me anxious.

1163
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,900
- Take it easy.
- You can do it.

1164
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,340
- Just take it easy, Haha.
- Don't make a mistake.

1165
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,640
- Take it easy.
- Here I go.

1166
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,280
- You don't have many chances left.
- One, two,

1167
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,740
three, four,

1168
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,650
- five, six. Nice!
- Good.

1169
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,820
(Is he perhaps stopping at 6?)

1170
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,280
- Five, six. Nice!
- Good.

1171
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,450
- Go.
- Seven!

1172
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,850
- Seven.
- He did seven.

1173
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,220
- Nice.
- It was seven.

1174
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,490
- Let me practice.
- There you go.

1175
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,860
- This is practice.
- Practice.

1176
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,960
- Oh, I'm good.
- Nice!

1177
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:47,230
(He always makes a huge mistake
at crucial moments.)

1178
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,470
(Kim Muscles,
the weak link in turbulent times)

1179
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,000
- Oh, there you go.
- Go for it.

1180
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,640
- I have a good feeling about this.
- All right. Here I go.

1181
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,200
- All right. Here I go.
- Just relax.

1182
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,640
- One, two,
- One, two...

1183
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,170
- three, four,
- Is he doing it?

1184
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,780
- five, six,
- There you go.

1185
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,580
- seven, eight,
- Nice.

1186
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,150
- nine, ten.
- You've got this!

1187
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,450
No!

1188
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,750
(Will they fail just like this?)

1189
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,920
Please.

1190
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,720
- Nine, ten.
- You've got this!

1191
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,950
(Number 7, Jong Kook: 10,
Total: 44)

1192
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,420
- Eleven, twelve...
- Twelve...

1193
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,020
(Soccer Kim keeps this alive!)

1194
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,520
- Thirteen, fourteen,
- Thirteen, fourteen,

1195
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,260
- fifteen, sixteen,
- fifteen, sixteen,

1196
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,760
- seventeen! We did it!
- seventeen, eighteen!

1197
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,890
(They succeed in the mission
by kicking the jegi 50 times.)

1198
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,100
- We did it!
- Okay.

1199
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,230
You don't have to do it.

1200
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,260
- I did it.
- Okay, we can draw now.

1201
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,530
You got over 50.

1202
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,000
- Okay!
- You succeeded in the mission.

1203
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,570
- Okay.
- Good job!

1204
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,240
- Good job.
- We did it.

1205
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,440
- Okay.
- I have to consider what to draw.

1206
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
- Right.
- What a relief.

1207
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,010
- What should I draw?
- Hey, ten seconds is doable.

1208
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,710
Jae Seok, please come to the front.

1209
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,840
- What should I draw?
- Hey, ten seconds is doable.

1210
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,080
- Jae Seok.
- Dongdaemun.

1211
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,480
- I think Dongdaemun is the best.
- Well, so...

1212
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,880
- Dongdaemun?
- Heunginjimun. Yes.

1213
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,150
- All right. We'll start right away.
- One moment.

1214
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,650
- Dongdaemun and like...
- Ready.

1215
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,620
- Naksan Park that goes up...
- Jae Seok, on top,

1216
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,220
make this look like a roof.

1217
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,860
- Hang on. All right.
- Kind of like an oval.

1218
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,960
- You have ten seconds. It's enough.
- Ready.

1219
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,160
- Where will you draw it?
- Hang on. Ten seconds.

1220
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,600
Drawing Migliore and DOOTA Mall
on the side would be nice too.

1221
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,430
- Buildings on this side too.
- Ready, set, go.

1222
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,570
(The 10 seconds begin.)

1223
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,170
- Buildings on this side too.
- Ready, set, go.

1224
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,570
- One, two,
- Dongdaemun. Faster.

1225
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,610
- Nice.
- three,

1226
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,270
four, five...

1227
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,740
- What's wrong?
- Migliore and DOOTA Mall.

1228
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,410
- Seven, eight,
- The buildings.

1229
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,250
- nine, ten.
- No! Why?

1230
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,450
- One more...
- There.

1231
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,880
- Nine, ten.
- No! Why?

1232
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,150
- What? Why?
- Hey, come on.

1233
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,480
- Hang on.
- Why were you so nervous?

1234
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,620
- What is that?
- It was like...

1235
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,260
an eagle snatching up its prey.

1236
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,660
We were so surprised, Hyung In.

1237
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,130
Gosh, it got even harder.

1238
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,430
It became weirder.

1239
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,430
Hey, that looks like a fire
in a brazier.

1240
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,960
It looks like you're grilling
on a brazier.

1241
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,500
Yes, it looks like a fire
in a brazier.

1242
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,530
Now that you mention it,

1243
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,770
- it really looks like a brazier.
- I mean...

1244
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,800
- This is...
- It looks like a brazier.

1245
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,340
Why did you tell me to draw
those lines on the roof?

1246
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,140
- Who told you that?
- You should've done both.

1247
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,180
It's fine.

1248
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,840
- Good job.
- It really looks like a brazier.

1249
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,510
- I should've drawn one building.
- No, you have to...

1250
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,280
- He's so bad at drawing buildings.
- look at the whole picture.

1251
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,450
- These don't look like buildings.
- Right, why are you so bad?

1252
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:49,020
- These aren't buildings.
- They don't look like buildings.

1253
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,150
- It looks like...
- Hey, since you were so bad...

1254
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,620
You were so bad that the staff
made you draw it.

1255
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,820
They wouldn't have if you were good.

1256
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,030
- I mean...
- You can ask questions again.

1257
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,230
Hey, how about groups of 4 or 5?

1258
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,460
- In groups. Yes.
- Group knowledge.

1259
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,070
- Hey, that's...
- Make them discuss it.

1260
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,100
Hang on. They're coming up.

1261
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,140
- Didn't they go down earlier?
- Two or three people.

1262
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,540
- Hello, there.
- How about those two?

1263
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:08,940
Hello!

1264
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,040
We wanted to ask you something.

1265
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,640
Could we ask you something?

1266
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,310
- Can you do an interview?
- Do you...

1267
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,680
work nearby?

1268
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,740
No, we're students.

1269
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,550
- Do you go to Dongguk University?
- Are you students?

1270
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,750
Oh, students.

1271
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,720
- We're studying something else.
- Oh, something else.

1272
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,280
Do you go to Dongguk University?

1273
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,020
- No, they study something else.
- Oh, something else.

1274
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,290
Well, so...

1275
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,620
This must've taken you by surprise.

1276
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,820
Oh, yes.

1277
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,290
What's wrong with you?

1278
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,760
- Please stay calm. I will too.
- Okay.

1279
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,930
- There's no need to rush.
- I am...

1280
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,500
really bad at drawing.

1281
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,830
Okay.

1282
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,800
You know he's bad at drawing,
don't you?

1283
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,140
Do you know that?

1284
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,170
- Yes.
- Okay.

1285
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,040
- She's so calm.
- You're very composed.

1286
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,110
- She's calm.
- Very calm.

1287
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,410
All right. I...

1288
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,380
If you look at this...

1289
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,250
Well...

1290
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,820
(Looking into the distance)

1291
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,320
(They can't see it from here,
but that's where DDP is.)

1292
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,420
Oh, over there.

1293
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,750
- Nothing.
- Oh, what...

1294
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,020
- It's nothing.
- What...

1295
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,460
Anyway, you don't have to answer...

1296
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,890
- in a rush.
- Okay.

1297
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,390
Right.

1298
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,690
- What is...
- Let's go.

1299
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,000
- It's this, right here. What is it?
- What is it?

1300
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,760
(The fixed question: What is this?)

1301
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,830
All right.

1302
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,730
- You can discuss with each other.
- It kind of...

1303
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,200
Look at the entire vibe.

1304
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,170
- Look at the entire vibe.
- Where...

1305
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,910
- You can discuss with each other.
- It kind of...

1306
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,340
- Is it like a proverb or something?
- The entire... No!

1307
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,580
(Waving profusely)

1308
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,810
- That's not it at all.
- No.

1309
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,580
- I...
- My goodness.

1310
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,850
- Oh, I see.
- I saw it yesterday too.

1311
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,220
(Will they catch on
to their direction hint?)

1312
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,490
- Beyond there...
- So, this is...

1313
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,290
By the way, if you're studying here,

1314
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:35,590
Where do you go for team dinners
or to hang out?

1315
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,030
(Team dinners, all of a sudden?)

1316
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,590
- If you ask that...
- Well, a barbecue place?

1317
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,360
- No.
- Oh, no.

1318
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,730
- Come on, Haha!
- Seriously?

1319
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,630
- Hey, get out of here!
- Get out of here, Alley Man!

1320
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,870
- I'm sorry.
- Come on, Haha.

1321
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,600
I'm not Alley Man.
I used to be a street reporter.

1322
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,070
Oh, right. Street, come with me.

1323
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,410
- What on earth did he draw?
- All right.

1324
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,640
This is hard.

1325
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,140
- Over here...
- You can't give them hints.

1326
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,780
- We won't count it if you do that.
- No.

1327
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,880
Don't say stuff like that.

1328
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,050
- What is this?
- Okay.

1329
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,650
- One.
- Two, three!

1330
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,390
(Will they be able to
recognize DDP?)

1331
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,620
- Three!
- Three!

1332
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,420
A grill.

1333
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,560
A grill!

1334
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,120
- A grill!
- A brazier.

1335
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,290
A brazier.

1336
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,930
Gosh, that's good.
I was getting hungry.

1337
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,760
- That's great.
- It's DDP.

1338
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,930
Perhaps...

1339
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,670
- No.
- She says that's not it.

1340
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,800
Jae Seok.

1341
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,370
- I apologize.
- Guessing it would be a miracle.

1342
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,000
- I know.
- I actually feel guilty.

1343
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,470
- I shouldn't have drawn this.
- Who can guess that?

1344
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,270
- Why draw a grill?
- Why did you draw that?

1345
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,980
Someone told me at the end
to add stripes.

1346
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,880
And this looks like smoke.

1347
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,980
- This is Dongdaemun.
- Yes, this is Dongdaemun.

1348
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,080
How so?

1349
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,220
See?

1350
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,590
- It only confused them.
- Thank you anyway.

1351
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,050
- Why did he draw that above it?
- Thank you.

1352
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1353
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,920
(They abruptly part ways
after thanking each other.)

1354
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,260
This is bad.

1355
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,430
Jae Seok, hold on.

1356
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,060
This doesn't look
like Dongdaemun at all.

1357
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,760
- Who could guess that?
- How about this?

1358
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,330
We need to start over.

1359
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,730
Find a grill near Dongdaemun.

1360
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,440
We'll find a place nearby
with a grill...

1361
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,600
- and take a photo.
- And eat our meal.

1362
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,370
- We'll close the distance.
- Exactly.

1363
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:58,670
Being closer to it
will give us a better chance.

1364
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,940
- Sure, let's go.
- Let's go.

1365
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,980
- Come on.
- Let's go.

1366
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,050
I shouldn't have added this roof.

1367
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,080
I blame the stripes.

1368
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,550
The stripes are confusing people.

1369
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,020
Who told you to draw that?

1370
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,250
Haha, right?

1371
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,520
- He...
- You should keep your mouth shut.

1372
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,820
Exactly. Keep your mouth shut.

1373
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,690
You don't get me at all.

1374
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,760
Who told you to draw it like this?

1375
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,990
You should've added another stripe.

1376
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,430
It looked like a grill,
and that's how people saw it.

1377
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:20,930
- Tell me about it.
- Just get on the bus.

1378
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,130
I can't believe you.

1379
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,700
Come on.
You can't blame me for this.

1380
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,570
Who told you to draw the stripes?

1381
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,940
It was Haha!

1382
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,740
- I didn't say to draw this.
- I wasn't going to,

1383
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,040
so why did you tell me to draw this?

1384
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,980
- How dare you glare at me?
- Guys, look.

1385
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,580
Check this out.

1386
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,480
This looks like a grill,

1387
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,910
which makes this a drawing
of a Korean barbecue place.

1388
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,750
That's what I mean.
Why did you tell me to draw this?

1389
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,920
Why take my advice, then?

1390
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,560
Why did you take my advice?
You rarely do.

1391
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,560
Attention! Parade, rest.

1392
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,160
- But...
- Attention. Bow.

1393
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,160
- His English is good.
- We didn't need that.

1394
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,230
- Did you compliment my English?
- What a waste.

1395
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,800
We need to get this fast.

1396
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,330
- We'll quickly succeed and...
- We just have...

1397
00:44:58,330 --> 00:44:59,440
- to get near the DDP.
- Exactly.

1398
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,670
Let's go near it,

1399
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,840
- and ask the question...
- I got it.

1400
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,910
- while looking at it.
- Yes, ask while looking at it.

1401
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,110
Yes, while looking at it.

1402
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,670
We'll be nearby now.

1403
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,280
- Then...
- Let's take the photo.

1404
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,640
- I'll ask.
- Take a photo of the grill.

1405
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,750
- Yes, the grill.
- Where is it?

1406
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:10,850
- Hello.
- Goodness.

1407
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,110
- Hi.
- I'm sorry, but we're only...

1408
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,280
- going to take a photo.
- Just a photo.

1409
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,380
- Let's not make a fuss.
- Sure.

1410
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,680
- Right.
- One, two, three.

1411
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,020
(They take a photo with a grill.)

1412
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,290
The DDP is that way.

1413
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:21,460
Let's ask someone outside.

1414
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,760
We need to make it this time.

1415
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,090
Jae Seok shouldn't ask the question.

1416
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,960
- He's too nice.
- When asking the question?

1417
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,430
- Right. You should ask.
- He's not fit for the streets.

1418
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:29,900
He can be gentle, but...

1419
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:32,700
- You need to be wild.
- How would you ask it?

1420
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,070
I'll just ask.

1421
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,740
- How?
- How would you ask it?

1422
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:36,810
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

1423
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:37,810
(Mouthing: DDP)

1424
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:40,380
- Do you...
- I love it.

1425
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,710
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

1426
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:42,740
(Mouthing: DDP)

1427
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,250
So, this...

1428
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,580
Did you say Dongdaemun?

1429
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,050
- I can't say that?
- You can't.

1430
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,380
Then, this...

1431
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,190
Where do you think this is?

1432
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,450
- That's how it should be done.
- Right. You've got it.

1433
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,320
- This is the right way.
- That's the rule of the street.

1434
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,460
- That's how you should do it.
- Nice.

1435
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,560
- You know what needs to be done.
- See?

1436
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,290
"What do you think this is?"

1437
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,100
Hey, move.

1438
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,670
- We were strategizing.
- We were strategizing.

1439
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,700
Let's go where we can see it.

1440
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,200
- Right.
- Where the people can see it.

1441
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,700
- Let's go.
- Go to where it can be seen.

1442
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,110
- We'll fail miserably at this rate.
- Haha's onto something today.

1443
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,170
It's this or nothing.

1444
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,470
This is the spot.

1445
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,780
- Let's go there.
- I can see it from here. Come on.

1446
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,280
- Let me handle it.
- Here it is.

1447
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,980
- This is the place.
- It's perfect.

1448
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,350
- We'll get it for sure.
- There's no doubt about it.

1449
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,480
Jae Seok, look.

1450
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,550
- We'll look at it from here.
- Let's take it slow.

1451
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,990
- Sure.
- We're backed into a corner now.

1452
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,120
You probably know this,
but this is our last chance.

1453
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,260
- From here...
- Got it?

1454
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,090
We're backed into a corner now.

1455
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,630
It's over for us
if we don't get it right here.

1456
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:32,630
(Will they be able to succeed?)

1457
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:34,230
- Someone on the younger side.
- Hello.

1458
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,700
- Hello.
- Someone on the younger side.

1459
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,170
- Hello.
- Can we talk to you?

1460
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,600
- Could we...
- Could we talk?

1461
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,640
- This is great!
- Were you going somewhere?

1462
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,670
Over here.

1463
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:42,670
- I'm on my way back to the office.
- Please stand here.

1464
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,410
To the office? You must work nearby.

1465
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:45,770
- Please stand over here.
- Over here.

1466
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:47,110
- I...
- Here we go.

1467
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,550
- I drew something in seconds.
- Right.

1468
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,580
- Haha, take a step back.
- Exactly.

1469
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,080
- Like this?
- Right.

1470
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,280
- So that she can see it?
- He did the worst job...

1471
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,590
- of drawing this.
- I...

1472
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,190
only had five seconds,

1473
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,760
so I didn't have much time.

1474
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,060
Also, I'm quite bad at drawing.

1475
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,690
Anyway, let's...

1476
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,690
Please answer me
when I ask the question.

1477
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:05,760
- Right.
- That's right.

1478
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,430
You have to guess what this is.

1479
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,500
- What this is?
- Yes.

1480
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,370
- Well...
- Don't bother looking at these.

1481
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,940
Those are there to set the tone.

1482
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,100
I wonder why we're here.

1483
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,410
Look around the area like so.

1484
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:20,980
- Hold on.
- Don't answer too quickly.

1485
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,310
- Take your time.
- Take your time answering.

1486
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:25,580
- Take it slow.
- Give it some thought.

1487
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:26,980
This is what Jae Seok drew.

1488
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,280
- He's terrible at drawing.
- Take your time.

1489
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,550
He's terrible at drawing.

1490
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,450
Think that an elementary school kid
drew it.

1491
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,230
(To Gangnam and then Yongsan,
they failed time and time again.)

1492
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:43,000
(They wasted too much time
on the first location.)

1493
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:47,170
(They need to get it right
on the fourth attempt.)

1494
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,500
- All right.
- Think that...

1495
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,640
an elementary school kid drew it,

1496
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,140
- and use your imagination.
- I see.

1497
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,310
(I see...)

1498
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:55,110
(She's figured something out.)

1499
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,850
- Take your time.
- The drawing's terrible.

1500
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,280
- I see.
- He did a terrible job.

1501
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,780
- It's tough.
- It is, isn't it?

1502
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,320
- It's a tough one.
- It really is, right?

1503
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,750
- Let's ask the question.
- We're good.

1504
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,650
- We're looking good.
- All right.

1505
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:05,690
Ask her the question.

1506
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,720
- We've had it rough so far.
- Right.

1507
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,890
The question is, "What is this?"

1508
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:10,890
What is this?

1509
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,190
(The fixed question: What is this?)

1510
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,000
- Could this be...
- Yes?

1511
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,870
We're backed into a corner now.

1512
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,270
- The DDP.
- Yes!

1513
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,500
The DDP.

1514
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,070
(DDP is correct.)

1515
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,710
(They got the right answer
on their fourth attempt.)

1516
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,140
- Yes!
- Nice!

1517
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,310
- She read the room.
- You're amazing.

1518
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:31,280
- This got you the DDP?
- With this?

1519
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,680
- You're a genius.
- You drew it so well.

1520
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,920
- Thank you so much.
- The Nation's Beloved Host!

1521
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,420
- How did she know?
- She's a genius.

1522
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,450
- No way.
- She saved us.

1523
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,350
- Why does it feel this good?
- Haha, let's take a photo.

1524
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,690
- I'm over the moon.
- Here.

1525
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,290
One, two, three.

1526
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:44,390
Since you've managed to obtain
DDP as an answer,

1527
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:45,990
- you'll now enjoy your outing.
- Okay. No way.

1528
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,660
- Okay!
- Yes!

1529
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:49,460
- It worked. Let's eat.
- Let's go.

1530
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,030
How much time do we have left?

1531
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,100
- We have until 4 p.m.
- Three hours.

1532
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,140
- You have three hours left.
- It's doable.

1533
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,140
- That's not a lot of time.
- We took too long.

1534
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,680
- I can't get on that ride.
- We don't have a lot of time.

1535
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,240
- I can't get on it either.
- Me neither.

1536
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,440
It's a relief...

1537
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,750
that I was the first to arrive
at the first location.

1538
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,980
That means nothing.

1539
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,680
- That doesn't matter.
- That's irrelevant.

1540
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,650
- This is the DDP.
- We're at the DDP.

1541
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,420
We don't have a lot of time,
so hurry up.

1542
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,220
Actually, Jae Seok
did a good job drawing it.

1543
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,390
It was a great drawing.
He drew the exact shape.

1544
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:19,260
The DDP was designed
by a renowned architect.

1545
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,800
- Really?
- Yes.

1546
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,330
It's not easy to enjoy
an outing like this in the city.

1547
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:24,430
I haven't been here before.

1548
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:25,630
- It's pretty.
- The smell of grass!

1549
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,400
- It's pretty.
- It's really pretty here.

1550
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,700
- This is great.
- I can smell the grass.

1551
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,710
I love the smell of grass.

1552
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:32,010
The destination
for your first outing...

1553
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,340
is a sightseeing attraction chosen...

1554
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,180
- by the New York Times.
- Really?

1555
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,180
- It's the DDP.
- This is really pretty.

1556
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,180
It's so cool.

1557
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,050
Here, you will enjoy...

1558
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,480
the view of the city...

1559
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,050
by walking on the roof
of the building.

1560
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,290
We'll walk on the roof?

1561
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:47,890
- As in that?
- Up there.

1562
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,120
- We'll enjoy what?
- Up there?

1563
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,430
That's what we'll be walking on.

1564
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,630
(Should they smile or cry?
It's almost like a penalty.)

1565
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:53,760
No way.

1566
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,860
Four randomly selected members...

1567
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,570
- will get to enjoy the tour.
- What?

1568
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,870
While the four go up there
and take a photo,

1569
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,400
the rest will have fun...

1570
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,140
- down here on the grass.
- That's great. I love it.

1571
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,540
- This is better.
- It's better not to be chosen.

1572
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,410
- Go if you want to.
- Who wants to go?

1573
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,910
- Who wants to go?
- Who'd like to go on the tour?

1574
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:10,880
Can it be those
who arrived late today?

1575
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,210
I was first to arrive
at the opening location.

1576
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,780
- Why don't I...
- I'll draw names.

1577
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,080
Go up there if your name is drawn.

1578
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,690
- This...
- Please draw four names.

1579
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:17,990
Isn't it a good thing
to be chosen for things?

1580
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:19,890
- I grabbed one.
- Please...

1581
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,060
(The first name
that was drawn by Jae Seok)

1582
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,330
Road Man.

1583
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:26,330
- Seok Jin.
- Jee Seok Jin.

1584
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:28,300
(Jee Seok Jin)

1585
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,400
Why on earth...

1586
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:30,830
- I...
- Are you sure this was random?

1587
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,530
- I had no idea.
- Jee Seok Sam!

1588
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,470
- That was surprising.
- I should be happy, right?

1589
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,770
- You should be happy.
- Gosh, thank you.

1590
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:37,640
- New York...
- Selected by the New York Times.

1591
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,870
- Seok Jin.
- This is a good thing.

1592
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,840
- Not everyone gets this chance.
- Was I lucky?

1593
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,040
- You see...
- That was hilarious.

1594
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,680
- Who comes after Seok Sam?
- Ye Eun.

1595
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,780
- Yes, Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun.

1596
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,080
- Please!
- Seok Sam, then Ye Eun.

1597
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,280
(Keeping it in the J family?)

1598
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,520
(Who will be chosen next?)

1599
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,750
- Se Chan.
- Se Chan.

1600
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,650
- Please!
- Se Chan.

1601
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,220
(The cowardly Se Chan
also gets chosen.)

1602
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,660
Please!

1603
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,230
- Lucky you.
- You should be happy about this.

1604
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:58,590
- Lucky you.
- Show your enthusiasm.

1605
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,860
- Lucky you.
- I love it.

1606
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,900
- Please.
- Who's Se Chan's girlfriend?

1607
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,000
- Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun.

1608
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,700
Please.

1609
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,640
(Ye Eun is the target again.
Who will be chosen third?)

1610
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,870
Darn.

1611
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:10,440
(Yu Jae Seok)

1612
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,640
Darn.

1613
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,680
(He targeted Ye Eun,
but the curse hit him instead.)

1614
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,680
Jae Seok, why are you
only choosing the cowards?

1615
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,280
- Go on.
- I'll draw the last name.

1616
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,580
Why are you so bad at this?

1617
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,950
- This is the worst.
- Can I go ahead?

1618
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,280
- Ye Eun.
- I've never been this lucky before.

1619
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,490
- Please.
- Add Ye Eun into the mix.

1620
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:24,950
- Let it be her.
- Right.

1621
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,320
It should be Ye Eun.

1622
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,690
- Song Ji Hyo.
- Okay.

1623
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:29,760
- Unbelievable.
- Me?

1624
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,360
- All right!
- Why did you...

1625
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,690
(Ji Hyo took the hit
out of nowhere.)

1626
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,500
Why are you sitting this out?

1627
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,860
- Unbelievable.
- I can't be bothered.

1628
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:36,900
I'm lucky today.

1629
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,470
- Seriously?
- I'm jealous, guys.

1630
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:40,470
I'm jealous too.

1631
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:41,500
- I'd love to go up there,
- Lucky you.

1632
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,540
but nothing can be done about it.

1633
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,040
- I'm jealous.
- We won't get the chance.

1634
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,140
This is actually good.

1635
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,880
- When will we get this opportunity?
- I'm ecstatic.

1636
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,210
Enjoy taking photos up there.

1637
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,640
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1638
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,810
- Are there harnesses?
- Hold on.

1639
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,080
- What's going on?
- Harnesses?

1640
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,620
See? I told you
we had to wear a harness.

1641
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,590
It's not a simple walk up there.

1642
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,750
- I said there were harnesses.
- Really?

1643
00:51:58,750 --> 00:51:59,990
It's not a simple walk up there.

1644
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,760
I saw ropes up there.

1645
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,990
- It's not a simple walk.
- I'm terrified.

1646
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:04,990
(Seeing the harness
makes him weak at the knees.)

1647
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,330
This is already terrifying.

1648
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:07,730
What's going on today?

1649
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,730
I thought it'd be a simple walk
on the roof.

1650
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,070
That's what I thought as well.

1651
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,570
I thought it'd be a walk
on the balcony.

1652
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,370
- That's what I thought.
- But that's not the case.

1653
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:15,570
I had my suspicions, but...

1654
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:17,170
It never crossed my mind.

1655
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,940
(Terrified, they can't stop talking)

1656
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,440
- This...
- Are you kidding me?

1657
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:21,840
You can't have many people
up here anyway.

1658
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,250
There's a limit.

1659
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,750
It seems that way.

1660
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,480
Seok Jin, this is terrifying.

1661
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,520
(How is the DDP's rooftop garden?)

1662
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,180
This is insane.

1663
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,250
(No railings)

1664
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,560
(There are no railings
to block the view.)

1665
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,120
My goodness.

1666
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,530
Are we walking across here?

1667
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:38,730
I'm doomed.

1668
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:39,960
This is insane.

1669
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,160
This is bad.

1670
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,470
No way. I can see everything.

1671
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:45,100
(An unintentional view
of the Dongdaemun area)

1672
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,700
- I'm terrified.
- How can they let us...

1673
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,240
(Being hooked)

1674
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,800
- I mean...
- This is safe, right?

1675
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,270
- Of course.
- Did you ask if it was safe?

1676
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:54,340
This is what Tom Cruise does
in his movies.

1677
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:55,780
Are we filming "Mission Impossible?"

1678
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,910
- It's almost the same as that.
- Unbelievable.

1679
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,150
- Darn.
- Hey!

1680
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:03,290
(The spectators get
on their nerves.)

1681
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,390
- Where are they?
- Unbelievable.

1682
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,320
- They're drinking something.
- Where?

1683
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,590
What are you drinking?

1684
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,430
(We can't hear you!)

1685
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:14,130
The pink hats are cute.

1686
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:15,360
How adorable!

1687
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,600
- I can't believe them.
- They're drinking something!

1688
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,630
Hey!

1689
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:20,670
(Screaming)

1690
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,970
- Still, it's safe.
- Gosh, my legs are shaking.

1691
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:27,680
- Still, you can see the ground.
- Yes.

1692
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,980
- It's all right since it's wide.
- If we couldn't see the ground...

1693
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,610
If we couldn't see the ground,
it would've been...

1694
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,750
Gosh, right now, I'm... Hang on.

1695
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,920
- I feel tingly down here.
- I do too.

1696
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,550
- My back too.
- Over here.

1697
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:38,720
- Jae Seok feels it now.
- My back feels tingly.

1698
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,120
- I feel tingly down here.
- Jae Seok feels it now.

1699
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,020
- It's tingly now that we're here.
- Jae Seok.

1700
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,690
I'm glad we stopped at the restroom.

1701
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,960
- Gosh, but you can see...
- You can see everything.

1702
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,060
the whole area of Dongdaemun.

1703
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,370
Gosh, seriously.

1704
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,570
- Hey, it's beautiful.
- This is awesome.

1705
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,100
Gosh, you can really see
all of Dongdaemun.

1706
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,670
Hey, Migliore is there. Seriously...

1707
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,040
I can't believe I'm up here.

1708
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,570
Hey, but still, this is so nice.

1709
00:53:58,570 --> 00:53:59,770
Right, when else would we get to
come up here?

1710
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,310
When else would we get to see this?

1711
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:02,480
(They were scared,
but the outing was a success!)

1712
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,980
This place is really worth visiting.

1713
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:06,850
Now, it's time for the next drawing.

1714
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:09,250
- Your lunch depends on this.
- All right.

1715
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,250
Yes.

1716
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:14,390
As it is important,
we will do the next mission...

1717
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:17,460
for a chance card to continue
enjoying your outing.

1718
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,260
- What is it?
- It's Answer in Mirror Mode.

1719
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,030
- Mirror mode?
- Five members will come up...

1720
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,030
and listen to the question.

1721
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,500
Within the time limit
of five seconds,

1722
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,940
they must write the answer
on the clear board.

1723
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,240
- The answer?
- Yes.

1724
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,110
You must write the letter
in mirror mode...

1725
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:34,140
- so it looks correct to the staff.
- Oh, it has to look correct.

1726
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,650
If you write the correct answer
but it's the mirror image,

1727
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,880
- you will still fail.
- Got it.

1728
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,050
Our staff are a bunch of people
who are twisted up inside.

1729
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:44,190
If you get 2 questions correct
out of 5,

1730
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,250
you will get the chance card.

1731
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,490
- Twice?
- You only have to get...

1732
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:47,660
- two questions correct.
- Well, that sounds all right.

1733
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,960
I'm sorry
that Seok Jin spoke too harshly.

1734
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,260
- Why?
- He said that the staff...

1735
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,660
- were all twisted up inside.
- Thanks, Jae Seok.

1736
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,560
- I'm sure some of you are.
- I'm so embarrassed for him.

1737
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,230
- You should apologize.
- Why should I apologize?

1738
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:57,730
- I'll apologize on his behalf.
- But I'm right.

1739
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,470
- I'm so sorry.
- Even I think that sounds a bit...

1740
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,470
- I'm sorry.
- We have to write in mirror images?

1741
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:04,370
- It's all right.
- We apologize on his behalf.

1742
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,110
- They came up with the game for us.
- All right.

1743
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:08,480
You only have to get two
of the twisted questions right...

1744
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,680
- If you say it like that...
- Only two.

1745
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,850
- Just 2.
- Only 2.

1746
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,220
- Okay, let's go.
- Choose five members...

1747
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,650
- I'm not confident.
- I am.

1748
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:16,690
But even if she's confident,

1749
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,720
- she doesn't know the answer.
- That's right.

1750
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,390
No, but I'm sure I can do it.
Trust me this once.

1751
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:20,690
- Can you get it right?
- You don't know the answer.

1752
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,990
- The answer to the question.
- I do know it.

1753
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,490
- You know the answer?
- I'm not that bad.

1754
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,990
Who has been
the class president before?

1755
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,130
- Raise your hand.
- But that's not important.

1756
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,400
Let me go this once.

1757
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,500
Jae Seok, Seok Jin, and Jong Kook...

1758
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,570
- should go.
- But writing it will be hard.

1759
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:32,870
- These three...
- You will be permanent members.

1760
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,740
- These three went to good schools.
- Let's take turns...

1761
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,200
- I went to a good school too.
- What do you mean?

1762
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,040
- What are you talking about?
- Ye Eun went to a good school.

1763
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,180
My school is for geniuses only.

1764
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,880
- Fine, you can try.
- For your information,

1765
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,780
I received about 30 awards
when I was a kid.

1766
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:47,580
- Why did you get them?
- And 29 of them were all for art.

1767
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,820
- But you're good at English.
- This has...

1768
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,390
- nothing to do with art.
- This isn't about art.

1769
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,750
- What is this?
- A quiz.

1770
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,350
- Don't you have to draw the letter?
- Draw what?

1771
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,360
- What did you listen to?
- Oh, the letter has to be...

1772
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,660
- You have to write a mirror image.
- A mirror image.

1773
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,960
You're drawing it in a mirror image.

1774
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,330
- Yes, you're right.
- Okay.

1775
00:55:58,330 --> 00:55:59,360
- Okay.
- I'm sure I can write it,

1776
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,400
- Hey, but...
- but I might not know the answer.

1777
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,560
- He...
- I can't write in mirror image.

1778
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,000
Since he took off his glasses,
he lost his bright spark.

1779
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:07,470
- Right?
- Hey, put your glasses on.

1780
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:08,500
Put your glasses on.

1781
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,570
- Hey, you should draw them on.
- Just put them on.

1782
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,570
- He looks really goofy.
- Should I draw them for him?

1783
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,280
- He looks goofy.
- I have it.

1784
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,780
- Will he do it?
- He looks bad without them.

1785
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,680
- Seriously?
- That's right.

1786
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,250
Hey, wait.

1787
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,480
- Hey, you look so bright.
- Okay, that's way better.

1788
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,650
- That's nice.
- You look so smart.

1789
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,050
- There you go.
- Nice.

1790
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,760
- Your brightness is coming out now.
- There you go!

1791
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,090
- That's it!
- There!

1792
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:30,020
(Niel, you're here!)

1793
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,190
- That's it!
- There you go!

1794
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,830
- That's it!
- That's it, right there.

1795
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:35,460
- You look like yourself now.
- Yes, that's it.

1796
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,100
- That's exactly it.
- You look human now.

1797
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,570
- It finally came through.
- That looks way better.

1798
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,370
- What came through?
- That's you.

1799
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:42,670
- People will recognize you now.
- My gosh, you are...

1800
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,040
- such a handsome guy.
- You should go in.

1801
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,270
- Nice.
- He is handsome.

1802
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:47,680
Then, Ji Ye Eun, Daniel,
and these three should go in.

1803
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,340
- Right.
- Then, Jae Seok,

1804
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,380
Seok Jin, and Jong Kook
should go in.

1805
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,610
- Okay, let's go in.
- Ji Hyo.

1806
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:54,350
- I'm not going in.
- Yes, that's right. Come here.

1807
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:55,820
- Right.
- That's right. Come here.

1808
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,750
We know how passionate you are.

1809
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,250
We'll take a look first.

1810
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,660
Isn't Ji Hyo so funny?

1811
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,060
"I'm not going in."
"Yes, that's right."

1812
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,990
- I won't go in.
- She knows how to read the room.

1813
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:06,160
She knows.

1814
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,860
Hey, what should I write? Tell me.

1815
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,460
Jong Kook, write "Dongdaemun."

1816
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,670
- Hey.
- Write "Dongdaemun."

1817
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:12,730
Dongdaemun?

1818
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:14,270
- That's not it, Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook!

1819
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:16,000
- That's not it, Jong Kook.
- What are you doing?

1820
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,240
- That's not it! Change it.
- What are you doing?

1821
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,610
- Is that not it?
- The "Dong" is wrong.

1822
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,810
Hang on.

1823
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,280
Jong Kook, the D in "Dong."

1824
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,010
Oh, that's what the D looks like.

1825
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,480
(Ye Eun tries
writing "Dongdaemun" too.)

1826
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,820
See? I'm good at this, aren't I?

1827
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,020
(Ye Eun got it all wrong too.)

1828
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,150
I'm good at this, right?
I'm good at it.

1829
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,060
Here. "Dongdaemun."

1830
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,960
- Yes, that looks good.
- For your information,

1831
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,160
for the questions we'll ask you now,

1832
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,300
Jae Seok will write
the first syllable.

1833
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,670
If we tell you to write 1 syllable
out of the 5 syllable word,

1834
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,170
you will write them in this order.

1835
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,670
- One syllable each.
- Got it.

1836
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:51,870
- Hey, this is...
- Hey, this is how it's done.

1837
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,140
- There you go.
- Let's go!

1838
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,180
You can do it.

1839
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,150
I told you I was good at this.

1840
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:59,480
- So, here is the question.
- Okay.

1841
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,850
As the 19th king of Goguryeo,

1842
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:05,290
he conquered Baekje, Silla,
and even Manchuria.

1843
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:07,960
- Write one syllable each...
- Okay.

1844
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,460
of the name of this king
who led Goguryeo to its heyday.

1845
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:10,460
- Okay.
- All right.

1846
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,560
One...

1847
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:17,000
("Gwang" from Gwanggaeto the Great)

1848
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,030
Two.

1849
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:19,470
("Gae" from Gwanggaeto the Great)

1850
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:21,300
Two, three.

1851
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:27,310
("To" from Gwanggaeto the Great)

1852
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,310
(Four of them seem to know
the answer.)

1853
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:32,250
(They will get it right
if Ye Eun answers correctly.)

1854
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,310
("The" from Gwanggaeto the Great)

1855
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,350
Three!

1856
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,050
What is she doing?

1857
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:38,250
- She must think she's the second.
- Come on out.

1858
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:40,460
- What's up with Ye Eun?
- What is that?

1859
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,020
(Gae)

1860
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,390
(Gwanggaeto Gae Great?)

1861
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,900
Jong Kook, I thought you said
you were good at this!

1862
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,230
- Why, that fool...
- Oh, right!

1863
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:53,070
- Hey!
- Oh, I got confused.

1864
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:55,040
Gosh, seriously.
This is driving me crazy.

1865
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,070
Jong Kook!

1866
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,840
I did a mirror image
of the mirror image!

1867
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,170
- What were you doing?
- Gosh, why did you do that?

1868
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,380
I got mixed up.

1869
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,240
- You can't write it like that!
- I mean...

1870
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,550
Earlier, I told myself to write
the mirror image of the answer,

1871
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,580
- but I wrote it like this.
- My goodness.

1872
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,920
You can just memorize
what the letter looks like.

1873
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,020
What is wrong with you?

1874
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,250
- I know, right?
- You're bad at this!

1875
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,450
Do you want me to draw glasses
on you too?

1876
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:13,820
No, why did I...

1877
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:15,890
- That's weird.
- Hey, Goofball.

1878
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:17,490
- Explain yourself. Why is it "Gae?"
- Gosh, seriously.

1879
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:19,360
- I wrote "The." Look at this.
- Okay.

1880
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,660
I just got the direction wrong.

1881
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,360
- Hey, Ye Eun.
- You wrote "Gae."

1882
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,400
- That's "Gae."
- It's "Gae."

1883
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,570
Hey, anyone can tell
that it says "Gae."

1884
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:26,470
- It's obviously "Gae."
- I truly knew Gwanggaeto the Great.

1885
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:27,670
- I know.
- So, why did you write "Gae?"

1886
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:29,140
No, this says "The."

1887
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,140
- It says "Gae!"
- That's "Gae."

1888
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,780
I'm sorry!

1889
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,410
(Apologizing to the nation as
she sounds like "Crayon Shin-chan")

1890
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:37,250
All right. We can all make mistakes.

1891
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,380
- Let's do it again. Okay!
- Good grief.

1892
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,250
Hey, we just have to get
two questions correct...

1893
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,850
- out of five.
- Okay, let's go.

1894
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:46,090
"To." Why did I think this was
the mirror image?

1895
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:48,460
- What's wrong with you?
- Get your head on straight!

1896
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,060
- You have to write it like this.
- I know.

1897
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:53,030
- Like this. Right.
- It has to be the mirror image.

1898
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:54,760
- No, this isn't right!
- This is right.

1899
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,460
- It's the opposite way.
- This is correct.

1900
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,570
- This says "To."
- Come here. This is right.

1901
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,840
- Seok Jin.
- This is right. See? What?

1902
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,570
- It's the opposite.
- What?

1903
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:05,370
- It's confusing.
- Write it properly and flip it.

1904
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:06,980
- Like this.
- Hang on. It's confusing.

1905
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,680
- That's right.
- Hey, try writing "To."

1906
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,680
It was confusing, right?

1907
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,380
- I see.
- That's how it is.

1908
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,650
Oh, this has to look weird
from my point of view.

1909
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:14,650
- Yes. It has to look wrong.
- The syllable...

1910
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,150
- It has to look weird to me.
- That's right.

1911
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:18,020
All right.
I won't get it wrong anymore.

1912
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,650
- Don't worry.
- Okay, let's think clearly now.

1913
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,360
- It has to look weird to me.
- All right.

1914
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,020
- You have four tries left.
- Okay.

1915
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,390
Daniel, you look so clever now.

1916
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,460
Seriously. Doesn't he?

1917
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,100
- He has to wear glasses.
- Here is the question.

1918
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:32,370
Write one syllable each
of the proverb...

1919
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:34,640
that means that similar types
of people or creatures...

1920
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,770
- take each other's sides.
- Is that five syllables?

1921
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:37,570
Isn't it four syllables?

1922
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:40,540
- Is it five syllables?
- Is it five syllables?

1923
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,080
- Isn't it four syllables?
- Similar creatures?

1924
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,850
- Isn't it four syllables?
- Oh, I know it!

1925
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:46,250
- Hang on.
- Three,

1926
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,050
- I know it.
- two...

1927
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,750
(Crayfish side with their kind.)

1928
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,820
("With" from
Crayfish side with their kind.)

1929
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:53,860
Okay.

1930
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,220
(Everyone until Jong Kook
figured out the answer.)

1931
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:57,530
- One.
- My gosh.

1932
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:01,400
- What? Wait.
- You know this. It's a proverb.

1933
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,400
I don't know it.

1934
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,370
(He wrote "Seon" instead of "Kind"
from Crayfish side with their kind?)

1935
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:05,530
Actually, I don't know.

1936
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,100
- What is "Cho Jae is Sang Seon?"
- Hey.

1937
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,300
(Cho Jae is Sang Seon.)

1938
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,970
- I mean...
- Isn't it...

1939
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:12,170
- "Crayfish side with their kind?"
- What's that?

1940
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,370
- "Crayfish side with their kind!"
- "Birds of a feather!"

1941
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,840
- "Crayfish side with their kind!"
- "Crayfish side with their kind!"

1942
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,880
- "Crayfish side with their kind!"
- Isn't it "Birds of a feather?"

1943
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,110
- Darn it!
- Darn it!

1944
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:19,750
- But...
- "Crayfish side with their kind!"

1945
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,250
Hey, they're taking
each other's side...

1946
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,750
"Birds of a feather!"

1947
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,550
Gosh, what is that?

1948
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:25,550
"Birds of a father?"

1949
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:27,360
- That proverb is too hard.
- "Birds of a feather."

1950
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,120
- What does that mean?
- Similar birds flock together.

1951
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,360
I'm sorry, but they don't give us
questions that hard for our level.

1952
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,360
- That's right. Birds...
- But what about them?

1953
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,400
Where did "Sang" and "Seon"
come from?

1954
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,560
- "Similar people find each other."
- What did you think it was?

1955
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,130
- That's a 4-syllable Chinese idiom.
- That's only 4 syllables.

1956
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:40,200
- What about you, Daniel?
- I just wrote "Seon."

1957
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,470
- "Seon?"
- It means kind.

1958
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,270
(It's a problem
that he doesn't know much.)

1959
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,310
- This proverb was hard.
- Excuse me.

1960
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:48,510
Director,
if the three of us play this game,

1961
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:50,780
let's call it good
once we get one question right.

1962
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,110
- The three of us.
- So, me,

1963
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:53,780
- Ye Eun, Haha,
- Ye Eun.

1964
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:54,850
- and Ji Hyo. All of us.
- I think...

1965
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:55,850
- Ye Eun and...
- that should be good.

1966
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:57,290
- We'll all go in.
- Then...

1967
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:59,020
- Just getting 1 correct.
- Then, let's go with 1 question.

1968
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,760
- The three of us.
- Song Ji Hyo, Haha...

1969
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,090
- Ji Ye Eun.
- Ji Hyo, come on.

1970
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:03,290
- It's Team Avengers.
- Daniel. The Avengers. Join us.

1971
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,660
- Okay.
- Us?

1972
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,230
- Right.
- Haha, the first one is important.

1973
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:07,830
- Okay, you go first.
- I'll go first.

1974
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:09,360
- I'm pretty smart.
- I'll be the fourth.

1975
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,770
- You can be the 4th.
- Ji Hyo, the 4th is important.

1976
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:13,500
No, you should be the fifth.

1977
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,000
- Okay, I'll be fifth.
- The last person.

1978
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,500
- Where should I go?
- You should be the third.

1979
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,240
- The 3rd?
- Am I the 4th?

1980
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,940
- But the fourth is hard.
- It is hard.

1981
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,510
- You can do it.
- This means you're smart.

1982
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,340
The 3rd and 4th are hard.
They're kind of confusing.

1983
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,880
I just made a deal
with the director.

1984
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,980
- We're kind of like...
- Team Avengers...

1985
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,820
only have to get one question right.

1986
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:32,620
But let's have 1 more person join
and go with 6 syllables.

1987
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,650
- Six syllables?
- Yes.

1988
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,260
Then, Jae Seok.

1989
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:37,360
- All right. Jae Seok.
- Go in.

1990
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:40,560
- Then, I'll go to the end.
- He wrote "Birds of a feather."

1991
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,930
- He might write something hard.
- I think it's going to be hard.

1992
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:44,270
All right. Here is the question.

1993
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:46,100
(Will the Empty Head Avengers crush
the Common Knowledge Monster?)

1994
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:48,870
Which proverb means...

1995
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:52,410
even something small
can become a huge pile...

1996
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:55,780
- when you collect lots of it?
- What?

1997
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,280
- Write one syllable each.
- What does that mean?

1998
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,880
(Which proverb means
even something small...)

1999
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,480
(can become a huge pile
when you collect lots of it?)

2000
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,350
("Muckle" from
Many a mickle makes a muckle.)

2001
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:04,550
There's no other option.

2002
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:07,220
("Makes" from
Many a mickle makes a muckle.)

2003
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:10,990
(Empty Head Avengers
start using their brains!)

2004
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:12,060
"A."

2005
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:14,360
(He wrote it correctly.)

2006
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,830
(Only the 3 real Empty Heads
are left.)

2007
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,100
Three,

2008
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,540
- There's no other option.
- two,

2009
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,540
Just write it.

2010
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:22,600
- one!
- A.

2011
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,670
(Will Empty Head Avengers be able
to save the citizens?)

2012
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,080
Hold on. Hey.

2013
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,310
Isn't it
"Many a mickle makes a muckle?"

2014
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:31,380
(Isn't it
"Many a mickle makes a muckle?")

2015
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,510
(His word is "Mickle.")

2016
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:33,610
It's easy.

2017
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:34,750
It's so easy.

2018
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:39,850
(What?)

2019
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:41,120
(He writes "Big.")

2020
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,560
What's that?

2021
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,760
- "Small a big makes..."
- Hey.

2022
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,730
"Small a big makes a ro."

2023
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:47,830
- What's that?
- Well...

2024
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,270
(Their answer is completely wrong.)

2025
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,070
- What's that?
- Well...

2026
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,700
He wrote "Big" backward too.

2027
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,700
- What's this?
- It's "Many a mickle," right?

2028
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,270
- That's right.
- It's "Many a mickle."

2029
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:00,370
- "Many a mickle." Hold on.
- They're so stupid.

2030
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:01,740
- What was your answer?
- Hold on.

2031
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,440
- I couldn't think of the answer.
- It was "Small happiness," right?

2032
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,910
- I thought of "Small."
- What's "Ro?"

2033
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:07,250
- What's "Ro?" "Rodent?"
- What's "Ro?"

2034
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,450
- I could only think of "Rock."
- "Rock?"

2035
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,190
What's up with "Big?"

2036
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:13,150
- I don't know what I wrote.
- Rock.

2037
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,090
How could you not think of
"Many a mickle makes a muckle?"

2038
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:17,190
- But Haha muttered, "A."
- Hey.

2039
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,630
Haha, you should be quiet.
I got confused because of you.

2040
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:20,630
- Listen.
- Don't be ridiculous.

2041
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:22,130
- You should've known the answer.
- Hold on.

2042
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:24,100
- Se Chan, Ye Eun, and Daniel...
- This won't do.

2043
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,670
- Daniel, did you get it right?
- Yes.

2044
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:26,900
- Ji Hyo, sit out. Five should go.
- Sit out.

2045
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,740
- Let's go. This won't do.
- For goodness' sake.

2046
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,240
- You need to get both right.
- Two questions.

2047
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:33,670
- Really?
- Did we do three already?

2048
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:36,110
- Give us one more.
- Hold on.

2049
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,080
There are 7 of us,
so give us 7 chances.

2050
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:40,210
- There are eight of you.
- That's right.

2051
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,480
- Are there eight of us?
- The number of people...

2052
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:42,920
Since when?

2053
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:44,020
- There are eight of you.
- That's right.

2054
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,250
- Are there eight of us?
- The number of people...

2055
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:46,590
Since when?

2056
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,490
- Then give us eight chances.
- What?

2057
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,660
- Since when?
- Seok Jin, what are you doing?

2058
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:51,690
Give us eight chances.

2059
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,430
- There are 8 of us.
- Since when did we have 8 people?

2060
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:55,800
- Are there eight of us?
- Let's go.

2061
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,000
In that case,

2062
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,530
- we'll give you a chance...
- Let's go.

2063
01:04:58,530 --> 01:04:59,830
- if you get one question right.
- Please.

2064
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,500
- I hope I don't mess it up.
- Let's go.

2065
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:03,370
If you get this question right,

2066
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:05,370
- you'll get a chance card.
- Let's go.

2067
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:06,910
- Let's go.
- Let's get a chance card.

2068
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:11,510
Write the name of a vertical machine
for transportation...

2069
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:15,950
that's installed in buildings
and such to carry...

2070
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:19,050
people or things
through a fixed route.

2071
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:20,620
- An elevator.
- An elevator.

2072
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,130
Three, two, one.

2073
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:25,760
Put the marker down.

2074
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,900
(His syllable is "El.")

2075
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,670
(Everyone writes his syllable
with ease.)

2076
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:32,100
(Will they succeed in it this time?)

2077
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:33,900
- Put the marker down.
- It's correct, right?

2078
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:36,240
That little...

2079
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,010
That little punk from the street!

2080
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:39,740
(An elemidtor)

2081
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,440
(The man from the street
gets it wrong.)

2082
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,580
- Isn't it "An elevator?"
- That little punk from the street!

2083
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,250
- "An elemidtor."
- It's "An elevator."

2084
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,550
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2085
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:48,450
- You heard us say it, right?
- It's "An elevator."

2086
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:50,220
- It's "An elevator."
- All of us got it right.

2087
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,090
- What's "Mid?"
- What's "Mid?"

2088
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:53,250
- What's "Mid?"
- He wrote it strangely too.

2089
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,320
Hey, Road Man.

2090
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:57,190
- What's this?
- Did you think of "A crane?"

2091
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:58,330
- What's that?
- What's that?

2092
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,660
- What's "Mid?"
- I couldn't think of anything.

2093
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:01,230
Haha, a vertical machine is...

2094
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,630
- an elevator.
- An elevator.

2095
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:04,070
- An elevator.
- It just sounded complicated.

2096
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:06,200
- It was so easy.
- What's a machine...

2097
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,900
- that carries people?
- I couldn't hear "People."

2098
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,340
I really couldn't hear "People."

2099
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,870
- Street, this is too much.
- Haha.

2100
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:12,270
- Road Man.
- How could you get it wrong?

2101
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:13,470
One more question remains, right?

2102
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,940
This won't do. You should sit out.

2103
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:15,940
- But there's no one to add.
- Come on.

2104
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,180
- Choose Se Chan.
- If we exclude him...

2105
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,680
- But there's no one to add.
- Choose Se Chan.

2106
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:21,420
- "There's no one to add."
- "There's..."

2107
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,620
- Seok Jin, you hurt our feelings.
- Seok Jin.

2108
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:25,750
- You hurt our feelings.
- I mean...

2109
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,250
- It was too much.
- Seok Jin.

2110
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,260
If we exclude Haha...

2111
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,460
- I'm better.
- I feel so hurt.

2112
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,620
- Haha is better.
- How did you not know...

2113
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,630
- that it was "An elevator?"
- I really couldn't hear it.

2114
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,530
- Let's go. Let's do a cheer.
- Okay.

2115
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,800
- How could you get it wrong?
- Jae Seok, I'll take the first one.

2116
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,430
- The explanation was hard.
- The first one.

2117
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:40,170
- One, two, three. Let's go.
- Let's go.

2118
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:41,370
- In that case, the order...
- Hey.

2119
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:43,000
Being the first one doesn't matter.

2120
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,140
- It doesn't matter.
- That isn't true.

2121
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,740
- Seok Jin.
- If you know the answer...

2122
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,210
- Be the first one.
- Seok Jin.

2123
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:48,480
There's no member
to switch out, right?

2124
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,140
There's no such member. I'm sorry.

2125
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,410
I don't want to hurt
your feelings, but...

2126
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:52,610
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

2127
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:53,650
(They learn once again
that they're Empty Heads.)

2128
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:55,620
Here comes the last question.

2129
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,050
(The last question
for the chance card)

2130
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:58,450
- Good luck!
- Let's get that chance card.

2131
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:00,790
What's the name
of the chemical component...

2132
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,960
that's the main component of salt
and is used...

2133
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,990
- to melt ice on the road...
- You know it, right?

2134
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:08,130
during wintertime?
Write one syllable each.

2135
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:09,160
You know it, right?

2136
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,030
(Sodium chloride, His word is "Di.")

2137
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:13,600
- Write it in Korean.
- Hold on.

2138
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:17,070
(He writes "Chlo.")

2139
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,110
(He writes "Ride.")

2140
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:19,240
- Isn't this it?
- Three...

2141
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,740
(He writes "Ride.")

2142
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:22,540
Hold on.

2143
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,810
- Three,
- When it snows...

2144
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:27,210
- two,
- They spray it when it snows.

2145
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:31,820
(If Jong Kook gets it right,
their answer will be correct.)

2146
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:32,850
One.

2147
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:35,360
(Did Jong Kook remember
the correct answer?)

2148
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,790
- It's this one, right?
- Okay.

2149
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:38,660
- It's this one, right?
- Okay.

2150
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,060
- Okay. It's correct!
- I think it's correct.

2151
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,530
- We did it!
- Yes!

2152
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:42,860
Is it correct?

2153
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:44,170
- It's correct!
- Is it correct?

2154
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:46,300
(They came a long way
and finally answered correctly!)

2155
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,370
- Okay!
- We did it!

2156
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:49,200
- Yes!
- It's correct.

2157
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:50,700
- Seriously.
- It's correct.

2158
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:52,240
- Seriously.
- We did it.

2159
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,340
It's correct.

2160
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,080
- They spray it when it snows.
- Yes.

2161
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:56,440
We did it.

2162
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:58,750
Here is your chance card.

2163
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,010
Okay.

2164
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:02,580
"Draw more for five seconds."

2165
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:03,780
- It can be someone else, right?
- Yes.

2166
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,790
- We'll pick the person.
- That's good.

2167
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:06,990
- Nice.
- We're set.

2168
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:08,090
- It was hard.
- We did so well.

2169
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:09,820
For your information,
you can use a chance card...

2170
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:11,330
for this round...

2171
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:13,060
- or a future round.
- Okay. That's right.

2172
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:14,730
For the second location,
we'll show...

2173
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:17,130
- the name of the lunch menu.
- Okay.

2174
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:18,770
- Menu.
- People need to see the drawing...

2175
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:19,970
- and say...
- You can do well.

2176
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,540
- the exact name.
- Good. Okay.

2177
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:24,440
- Other members can't talk.
- Let's eat something tasty.

2178
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,670
Let's see.

2179
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:28,680
- Here. One, two, three.
- This one is a bit hard.

2180
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,080
- Jae Seok.
- This one is a bit hard.

2181
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,210
It's cold raw fish soup.

2182
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:35,020
- Cold raw fish soup sounds nice.
- I want cold raw fish soup too.

2183
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:36,750
(Will Jae Seok be able
to draw it well?)

2184
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,220
- One, two, three.
- This one is a bit hard.

2185
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,520
- One,
- Just draw it.

2186
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,650
- two,
- Just draw it.

2187
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:43,020
three, four,

2188
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:45,030
- five.
- Don't draw too much.

2189
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,260
- Don't draw too much.
- What's that?

2190
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:47,460
(5 seconds passed.)

2191
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,660
- It's enough, right?
- There's a fish.

2192
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,800
It isn't half bad.

2193
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,800
- It's enough, right?
- There's a fish.

2194
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,870
It isn't half bad.

2195
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:54,440
(It isn't very clear.)

2196
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,070
- We can draw for five seconds.
- Cold raw fish soup

2197
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:57,510
- That isn't it.
- Cold raw fish soup.

2198
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:58,910
We should add a motion.

2199
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,810
He should've drawn the fish
a bit better.

2200
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,710
- You know...
- Will that drawing be enough?

2201
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:04,710
- How's that a fish?
- Jae Seok,

2202
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:06,110
I think we should touch up
on the fish.

2203
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:07,280
- But...
- That fish is the problem.

2204
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,350
- I added chopsticks.
- Listen.

2205
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,150
- You did well.
- When you draw a fish...

2206
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,120
Make sure you memorize it, okay?

2207
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,090
When you draw a fish,

2208
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:15,820
- you should do this.
- Road Man is acting out again.

2209
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,730
You need to draw this part.

2210
01:09:17,730 --> 01:09:19,230
- What's that?
- Then it looks like a fish.

2211
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:20,590
Isn't that a blowfish?

2212
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:22,560
- You should make it...
- But...

2213
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,530
- look like a fish.
- Haha, while it looks like a fish,

2214
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:25,830
- it...
- It needs this part.

2215
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:26,830
- Does it look like a goldfish?
- It'll be cruel...

2216
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,000
- to eat it.
- It looks like a blowfish.

2217
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,200
I think I can eat this fish,

2218
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,740
- but not this fish. It's too cute.
- Look.

2219
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,310
People won't think that it's a fish.

2220
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:35,110
- It looks like a fish.
- It's a fish.

2221
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:36,840
- It's a fish.
- Since there are chopsticks,

2222
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,880
it looks like ramyeon.

2223
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,780
- Why did you draw them like this?
- Why did you draw chopsticks?

2224
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:40,980
- How was I supposed to draw them?
- The chopsticks...

2225
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:42,580
- should be here.
- It's cold raw fish soup.

2226
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:43,650
- It's cold raw fish soup.
- Here.

2227
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:44,720
Make sure you memorize it, okay?

2228
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,890
They look like noodles.

2229
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,790
- You drew a bowl, right?
- Yes.

2230
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:50,490
The chopsticks
shouldn't be over the bowl.

2231
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:52,960
- They should be here.
- That works.

2232
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,000
- Why?
- If you draw them over the bowl,

2233
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,760
it's unclear
if they're noodles or what.

2234
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,000
- No.
- I see.

2235
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:00,000
Why are you being stubborn?

2236
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:02,240
- You're wrong.
- Don't fight.

2237
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,800
- We won't get to eat anyway.
- All right.

2238
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,910
(Don't fight.
We won't get to eat anyway.)

2239
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:06,140
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2240
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,170
- Let's use a chance card.
- No, don't do it.

2241
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,140
- Don't use it for this one.
- This is... Hold on.

2242
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:12,650
What's a noodle dish
that contains fish?

2243
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:14,280
- It's cold raw fish soup.
- It's cold raw fish soup.

2244
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,320
- Let's give it a go.
- I'm certain of it.

2245
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,220
- This drawing will work.
- Let's use a chance card next time.

2246
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:19,020
- That's right.
- You drew it well.

2247
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,220
- We don't have time.
- Let's give it a go.

2248
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,220
- Let's give it a go.
- I think it'll work.
- Let's go.
- For your information,

2249
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:24,530
- if a citizen sees the drawing...
- Let's go.

2250
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:26,460
and gives a different dish,

2251
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:27,660
- Do we need to eat it?
- you'll need to go there.

2252
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:29,530
Four members
who get picked at random...

2253
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:31,000
- will need to finish eating...
- We'll need to eat.

2254
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,900
- before you get to ask again.
- This is...

2255
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,130
Gosh, this is hard.

2256
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:35,570
- Let's go. We don't have time.
- But...

2257
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,300
It'll be incredible
if we get cold raw fish soup.

2258
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,510
People will get it right. It's okay.
People will get it right.

2259
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:41,440
We need to do this quickly.

2260
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,910
- We don't have much time.
- Let's go.

2261
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,010
- Hurry up.
- We don't have much time.

2262
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:45,110
- We don't have much time.
- Cold raw fish soup.

2263
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:47,050
- Cold raw fish soup.
- I bet people will get it right.

2264
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:49,780
I think we'll succeed in it today.

2265
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,450
How will you ask? Let me check.

2266
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:52,720
- If there are too many hints...
- All right.

2267
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,120
Come on. How will you do it?

2268
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:56,120
- He doesn't have a plan.
- No.

2269
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,160
- You should do this.
- You can say, "Cool."

2270
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,160
- What?
- A cool dish.

2271
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:00,390
Gosh, the sea.

2272
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,030
- I want to go to the sea.
- Don't do that.

2273
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:03,360
No, don't do that.

2274
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,770
- We can get seafood ramyeon.
- It'll be confusing.

2275
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:06,130
It'll be confusing if you do that.

2276
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:07,330
- We can get seafood ramyeon.
- Go ahead.

2277
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:08,870
- It'll be confusing if you do that.
- Do it. How will you do it?

2278
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:10,170
- A cool dish.
- Say that it's hot.

2279
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:12,410
- A cool dish.
- A cool dish at the sea.

2280
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:15,010
- The weather turned hot, right?
- Yes.

2281
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,040
- Yes.
- Did you have lunch?

2282
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,180
- No.
- No.

2283
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:18,950
- We haven't had lunch either.
- Gosh.

2284
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,050
Take a look at this.

2285
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:22,020
- So, if you look here...
- A cool dish.

2286
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:25,690
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

2287
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:26,920
- How cool.
- All right.

2288
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,260
- What's that?
- It's cool.

2289
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,620
- Let's go.
- We're set.

2290
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:31,090
- Jae Seok.
- Let's meet it head-on.

2291
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:32,330
- After that...
- Let's meet it head-on.

2292
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:33,360
After that, it looks like...

2293
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,430
- cold raw fish soup.
- That's right.

2294
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:36,960
Shall we do it
in front of a fish tank?

2295
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:40,270
You can't make it too obvious.

2296
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:41,640
- No?
- All right.

2297
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,070
- I guess we can't do it.
- "Gosh, it's summer."

2298
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,210
- Let's begin that way.
- "The weather is hot."

2299
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,540
- Let's do that.
- Let's do that.

2300
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:47,840
This is a hard one.

2301
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,140
How do you even draw
cold raw fish soup?

2302
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,940
No. People can get it right.

2303
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:52,410
I think they'll get it right.

2304
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:53,910
Cold raw fish soup
is a representative fish dish.

2305
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:55,880
Haha, are you worried?

2306
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,220
They shouldn't ask a question
like that.

2307
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,320
- How should they do it?
- Go ahead.

2308
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:00,790
- Hello.
- Hello.

2309
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:02,020
- It's so hot today, right?
- Yes.

2310
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:03,660
Is it summer already?
Why is it so hot?

2311
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,930
I want to eat something cool.

2312
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:08,000
- Cold raw fish soup.
- Good.

2313
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,830
An insanely cool dish.
Cold raw fish soup.

2314
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:10,860
That sounds good.

2315
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,870
- What is Haha doing this time?
- What is he doing?

2316
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,640
- What?
- He's talking to the members.

2317
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,700
What is he scheming this time?

2318
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:16,940
- Isn't it great?
- How about this?

2319
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:18,470
- You're too cold right now.
- Give it a go.

2320
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:20,340
- Hey. You're too cold.
- You're too cold right now.

2321
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,010
Let's do this. Say something to me.

2322
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:23,540
Call me a lunatic.

2323
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:24,580
You're a lunatic.

2324
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:25,810
You're too cold.

2325
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:27,880
Okay. That's a good idea.

2326
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,980
(While they come up
with another trick)

2327
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,420
By any chance, are you available...

2328
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:33,320
for an interview?

2329
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,560
- Please come on over.
- Please come on over.

2330
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:37,520
(A young man
with the Y2K fashion enters.)

2331
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,230
- You're unique.
- You're quite sporty.

2332
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,030
- Welcome.
- He's a fashionista.

2333
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:43,330
- My goodness.
- Where are you going?

2334
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:45,970
I got out of my part-time job,
so I need to go and wash my car.

2335
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:47,800
I need to wash it
with a steel brush.

2336
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,000
Since I don't have one,
I'm on my way to buy one.

2337
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,140
- I see.
- A steel brush.

2338
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,840
- Did you work part-time?
- What's your part-time job?

2339
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,240
I work part-time
at a Thai restaurant.

2340
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,240
- I see.
- I see.

2341
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,410
You're very fashionable.

2342
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:58,180
- He reminds me of DEUX.
- That's right.

2343
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:59,610
- You're right.
- He reminds me of Kim Sung Jae.

2344
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:01,080
- Seriously.
- I see the resemblance.

2345
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,920
- What's your name?
- I'm Kim Hee Jae.

2346
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,150
- Kim Hee Jae.
- Hee Jae.

2347
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:06,190
- Hee Jae, you look very...
- He looks cool.

2348
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:07,760
- He looks very cool.
- I know.

2349
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,160
- He's very unique.
- He has a cool vibe.

2350
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,190
It's the Hongdae style.

2351
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:11,390
Why are you tanned?

2352
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:12,660
- Well,
- Did you get a tan?

2353
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,730
I lay on the beach for a few hours.

2354
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:18,570
- The beach!
- The beach!

2355
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,170
- The beach!
- The beach is the best!

2356
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:21,370
(He hugs the members
without knowing what's going on.)

2357
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:22,770
- I think it'll work today.
- The beach!

2358
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,340
- I think it'll work today.
- I think it'll work.

2359
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:25,710
- What do you mean?
- He'll get it right.

2360
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:26,970
- The beach!
- The beach!

2361
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,310
Beaches are nice.

2362
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:29,440
(Things are going well so far!)

2363
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:30,510
- It's so nice.
- After a part-time job...

2364
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:32,450
His fly is open.

2365
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,210
I wash cars too.

2366
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:35,980
- Is it another part-time job?
- He works diligently.

2367
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:37,620
- How nice.
- That's incredible.

2368
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,820
- He lives diligently.
- Your fly is open.

2369
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,420
- That's incredible.
- He lives diligently.

2370
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,490
- Your zipper.
- Your zipper is open. Close it.

2371
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:48,600
(Hee Jae's fly was open
toward the sky.)

2372
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:49,930
It's okay.

2373
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:51,700
It happens when you live diligently.

2374
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:52,730
That's right.

2375
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:54,270
- You're so cold.
- It's okay.

2376
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:55,870
- You're so cold.
- How could you be so cold?

2377
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,700
(Cold like cold raw fish soup?)

2378
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:58,940
- Cold?
- You're so cold.

2379
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:00,770
- Why did you point it out?
- Am I cold?

2380
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,080
- He's cold.
- You're cold.

2381
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,510
- We aren't cold.
- Please be understanding.

2382
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:05,280
- You're cold.
- It's okay.

2383
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:07,710
You live diligently.
What's this book?

2384
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:10,680
It's "Atomic Habits."
It's about making small habits.

2385
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,420
- That's what it's about.
- My goodness.

2386
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:13,620
It's nothing.

2387
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,690
- You really live diligently.
- Seriously.

2388
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:17,720
Will you use it as a trivet?

2389
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:18,990
- Hey.
- No.

2390
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:21,360
- Don't be cold.
- You're so cold.

2391
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,860
- You're cold.
- I don't get discouraged.

2392
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:26,000
- Beaches are nice.
- I have no drawing skills.

2393
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,070
- Okay.
- That's right.

2394
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:28,700
- Have you had lunch?
- I'm hungry.

2395
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:29,800
We're hungry too.

2396
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,640
- We need to go and eat.
- Okay.

2397
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,210
This is a drawing I made...

2398
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:35,210
- upon seeing a keyword.
- Okay.

2399
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:37,380
Since I only had five seconds...

2400
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,810
- He drew it hurriedly.
- I drew it hurriedly.

2401
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:39,980
I only drew the key components.

2402
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:41,110
- He drew it haphazardly.
- You drew it well.

2403
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:42,150
- That's right.
- Hold on.

2404
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:43,180
- You drew it well.
- The beach...

2405
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:44,990
There are key components.

2406
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:47,420
- Key components?
- You need to guess what it is.

2407
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,520
- What does it remind you of?
- What could it be?

2408
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,060
- What does it remind you of?
- Hee Jae, you're fun.

2409
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:53,090
- He drew it in five seconds.
- That's a nice facial expression.

2410
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:54,490
Is this dot intentional?

2411
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,430
- No.
- No.

2412
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,300
- It just happened.
- No? Okay.

2413
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,730
- Hee Jae, you're doing great.
- What could it be?

2414
01:14:59,730 --> 01:15:01,700
Hee Jae, what do you see?

2415
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,900
- Chopsticks, fish...
- That's right.

2416
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,910
(Chopsticks and fish)

2417
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:07,040
(He perfectly understood
the lousy drawing!)

2418
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,380
- You're nearly there.
- That's right.

2419
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,810
How should we say it?

2420
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:11,210
You don't eat rice with chopsticks.

2421
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,710
- That's right!
- That's right.

2422
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:13,880
- That's right.
- That's right.

2423
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:15,150
- We're set.
- Earlier,

2424
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:16,880
- you mentioned...
- There's a fish, right?

2425
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,620
- Why is there a fish?
- That's right.

2426
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,450
- Exactly. Why is there a fish?
- Why is there a fish?

2427
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:21,660
- By the way,
- It's summer.

2428
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:22,760
the weather is so hot.

2429
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,260
- It's so hot.
- Is it hot?

2430
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,060
- Ask the question.
- I'll ask the question.

2431
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:27,460
- Hee Jae.
- Yes?

2432
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,660
(If Hee Jae gives them
a different dish)

2433
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:29,660
What is...

2434
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:30,830
- The BGM is nice.
- This dish is...

2435
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:32,270
- The BGM.
- The BGM is nice.

2436
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:33,270
- What is...
- This dish is...

2437
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:35,040
(Will they succeed in it in one go?)

2438
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:38,310
- What is this dish?
- It has to be that dish.

2439
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:41,640
- What is this dish?
- It has to be that dish.

2440
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,040
Cold raw fish soup.

2441
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,250
(Cold raw fish soup is correct.)

2442
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:48,180
Cold raw fish soup. My goodness.

2443
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:49,480
(Screaming)

2444
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,250
(Hee Jae is the best.)

2445
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,490
- Hee Jae.
- It's correct.

2446
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:53,650
- It's correct.
- It's correct.

2447
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:54,920
All right.

2448
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,090
- Okay.
- You're cool.

2449
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:57,660
- Seriously.
- That was incredible.

2450
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:58,990
- He's quick-witted.
- He got it right.

2451
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:00,290
Seriously, he's smart.

2452
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:02,530
- Okay.
- Hee Jae, thank you.

2453
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:03,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Take care.

2454
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,530
Let's go to the cold raw fish soup
restaurant.

2455
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:08,300
- Good luck.
- We finally did it.

2456
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:09,900
We did it.

2457
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,670
Blue Hanyeo Restaurant.

2458
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:13,070
It looks like a good restaurant.

2459
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:14,640
- Gosh.
- Is this the place?

2460
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,710
Good.

2461
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:18,110
- I love cold raw fish soup so much.
- Let's enjoy it.

2462
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:19,210
Cold raw fish soup is amazing.

2463
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:20,680
I seriously love cold raw fish soup.

2464
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:21,780
Is that the dish?

2465
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:23,220
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2466
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:24,350
- This is insane.
- Gosh.

2467
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,220
(The dish contains makguksu,
not thin noodles.)

2468
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,090
(Cold raw fish makguksu
with a bunch of seafood)

2469
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:32,330
(Giant gimbap
that contains fried shrimp)

2470
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:33,490
It's hutomaki.

2471
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:35,460
- Gosh.
- What's this?

2472
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,100
- Ramyeon is the best.
- Is it jjamppong?

2473
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,430
- Jjamppong ramyeon?
- Gosh.

2474
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:40,030
I want seafood kalguksu.

2475
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:41,800
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2476
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,070
- Mix them.
- Mix them.

2477
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,340
I'm so happy.

2478
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:45,640
There's hijiki too.

2479
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:47,410
- Cold raw fish soup is so tasty.
- There's hijiki too.

2480
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:48,440
It's so tasty.

2481
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,080
(Slurping)

2482
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,580
- This is incredible.
- It's so tasty.

2483
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:54,110
- Gosh.
- That's how it is inside.

2484
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:56,420
It looks tasty.

2485
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,750
It's tasty.

2486
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:02,290
(The scent of the sea
fills their mouths.)

2487
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:07,190
(The taste cools them down
to the bones!)

2488
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:08,560
My goodness.

2489
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,730
- What?
- That's right. Earlier...

2490
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:12,170
It's insane.

2491
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:13,330
Is the taste really insane?

2492
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:14,740
Cold raw fish soup is the best
in summer.

2493
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,170
- It's the best in summer.
- Yes.

2494
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,500
My hands are shaking.

2495
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:19,110
It's so cool.

2496
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:21,680
(Food Fighter's blood sugar
is running low.)

2497
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,650
(She treats it with the sour soup.)

2498
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:26,210
It's so nice.

2499
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:28,120
This place is really nice.

2500
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,220
We were hungry.

2501
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,580
- I know.
- It's so cool.

2502
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:31,720
It's really tasty.

2503
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:33,750
- He lives diligently.
- It's insane.

2504
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:34,790
It's no joke.

2505
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:36,660
(They chase away the heat
with cold raw fish soup.)

2506
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:38,190
This place makes tasty dishes.

2507
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:39,760
(Hot seafood ramyeon)

2508
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:43,200
Ramyeon is...

2509
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,970
- My goodness.
- It's refreshing.

2510
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:47,500
- Gosh, Haha. Is ramyeon the best?
- Ramyeon is the best.

2511
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,740
Nothing beats ramyeon.

2512
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:51,340
(It can't go wrong
since they know the taste.)

2513
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:53,440
My goodness.

2514
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,980
(The noodle enthusiast, Jae Seok,
eats the seafood kalguksu.)

2515
01:17:57,810 --> 01:17:59,010
Aunt.

2516
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:00,210
- Be careful.
- He said, "Aunt."

2517
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:03,380
- Is it amazing?
- Look at the size.

2518
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,690
(He puts it in his mouth.)

2519
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,560
Oh, my.

2520
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:13,090
This dish is very tasty.
My goodness.

2521
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:15,000
- It's really tasty.
- What's this?

2522
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:18,170
(Jong Kook falls in love
with the giant gimbap.)

2523
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:19,830
You must be having it
for the first time.

2524
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:20,900
- Yes.
- This kind of food...

2525
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,500
- Is it your first time having it?
- Yes.

2526
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:23,640
What?

2527
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,670
- Really?
- It's my first time having it.

2528
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:26,010
- Is it your first time having it?
- Really?

2529
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:27,010
It isn't a common dish.

2530
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:28,440
Aren't you going to use your money?

2531
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,040
You should eat such dishes.

2532
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,610
This gimbap is tasty.

2533
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:33,010
- Hutomaki.
- It's really tasty.

2534
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:34,050
It's tasty.

2535
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:35,350
- It contains eggs and shrimp.
- It's hutomaki.

2536
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:36,720
- Hutomaki.
- It's tasty.

2537
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,290
- Eat it with your hands.
- Ye Eun, it's tasty.

2538
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:39,290
It's too big.

2539
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,490
I can't eat it in one bite.

2540
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,560
- It went in.
- Gosh.

2541
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:45,830
Food Fighter.

2542
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:47,360
Did you put the entire thing
in your mouth?

2543
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:49,300
- I can't eat it in one go.
- Did she put the whole thing in?

2544
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:50,500
She put the whole thing in.

2545
01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:53,000
(She picks up another piece.)

2546
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:56,740
Ye Eun is eating it
with her small mouth.

2547
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,770
She's a magician.

2548
01:18:58,840 --> 01:18:59,910
How does she do that?

2549
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:00,940
She's a magician when she eats.

2550
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:02,710
How did it go into her mouth?

2551
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:04,810
This should be eaten in one go.

2552
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:06,450
- You know, Jong Kook...
- I found it impossible.

2553
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,910
Jong Kook finds Ye Eun so cute.

2554
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:08,950
- She finds her so cute.
- That's right.

2555
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:10,450
- What's wrong with you?
- She could be his daughter.

2556
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:12,020
- I...
- She's cute.

2557
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:14,090
I get that but you're too...

2558
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:16,920
You should look at me that way once
after 15 years!

2559
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:20,590
That punk looks at me
as if I'm his enemy.

2560
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:21,730
(Chewing)

2561
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:23,300
Oh, my.

2562
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,360
- They're like mom and dad.
- "That punk."

2563
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,200
With us, it's different.

2564
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,600
- Sure. It's different.
- Hey.

2565
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:31,670
It'll be strange if he looks at you
like that after all these years.

2566
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:34,170
(A Sunday drama,
"What's Up with the Family?" ends.)

2567
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:35,740
- Right?
- That's right.

2568
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:38,550
We have a chance card.

2569
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:39,580
Yes.

2570
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,380
- That's right.
- After I draw,

2571
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,450
someone else can draw over it
for five seconds.

2572
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,520
(The matter is who will draw it.)

2573
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,950
- But...
- While I draw,

2574
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:46,990
you guys should think.

2575
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:48,720
We can't choose who'll draw.

2576
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,630
It'll be great if Jong Kook
or Haha can draw more.

2577
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:53,890
For your information,
the current time is 2:40 p.m.

2578
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:55,360
- Exactly.
- Let's hurry up.

2579
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,730
- Not much time remains.
- We need to end it quickly.

2580
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:58,900
We can use a chance card this time.

2581
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:00,500
(They finish eating hurriedly.)

2582
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,670
- How refreshing.
- Now, shall we go?

2583
01:20:02,770 --> 01:20:05,040
- Seriously.
- You'll draw the last location.

2584
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,270
This is... Seriously.

2585
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:08,410
- Look at the keyword...
- Okay.

2586
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:10,040
and draw for five seconds.

2587
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,080
- Five seconds?
- Yes.

2588
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,550
We need to focus as well.

2589
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:16,380
Show us the keyword and say,
"Get ready. Set, go."

2590
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,420
Then I'll show you the keyword
for three seconds...

2591
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,520
- and begin the countdown.
- Okay.

2592
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:21,990
All right.

2593
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:23,690
- One, two...
- That's a good one.

2594
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:25,130
- It's a hard one.
- It's a hard one.

2595
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:27,060
(He squeezes his eyes shut.)

2596
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:28,260
(Palgakjeong in Mount Nam)

2597
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:29,560
- One, two...
- That's a good one.

2598
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:30,900
- It's a hard one.
- It's a hard one.

2599
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:33,000
(The two artists show
different reactions.)

2600
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:35,200
- Three, four, five,
- Two, three,

2601
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,800
- six, seven, eight...
- four,

2602
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,770
- five. Time's up.
- I drew it wrong.

2603
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,040
- Four, five,
- Three,

2604
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,540
- six, seven, eight...
- four,

2605
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,540
- five. Time's up.
- I drew it wrong.

2606
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:45,050
- Oh, no.
- What?

2607
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:47,250
- What are you doing?
- What's that?

2608
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:48,750
Are those nostrils or what?

2609
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,420
Jae Seok, what's that?

2610
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:53,290
I was too focused on drawing
the octagonal roof.

2611
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:56,090
You should've drawn Mount Nam first.

2612
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:57,820
- It's okay. We can draw more.
- Hey.

2613
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:59,660
- We can change it to Mount Nam.
- We can do that.

2614
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:01,060
- We can change it. It's pointy.
- We can change it.

2615
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:02,400
- Jae Seok.
- Will you use a chance card?

2616
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,100
- We have to use it. Jae Seok.
- We have to use it.

2617
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,400
- We have to use it no matter what.
- We have to use it.

2618
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,930
- That's right.
- Then I'll pick a member.

2619
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,300
- This is driving me crazy.
- Hold on.

2620
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,600
To be honest,

2621
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:13,140
no one would be confident
except for Haha and Jong Kook.

2622
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:15,110
- If I get picked, we're ruined.
- Right?

2623
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:16,580
- I can't do it either.
- I think I can draw it.

2624
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,880
- Who is it?
- Who is it? Please.

2625
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:19,980
- I think I can do it.
- Please.

2626
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,310
- Please.
- I can definitely do it.

2627
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:22,750
(Who will draw after Jae Seok?)

2628
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,380
- Gosh!
- Oh, no.

2629
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:25,890
(Se Chan gets picked.)

2630
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:26,920
Oh, no.

2631
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,220
You have five seconds.

2632
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:30,260
How is this supposed to help us?

2633
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,590
- Se Chan.
- Wait. We can give him a lesson.

2634
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:32,760
- We can give him a lesson.
- Okay.

2635
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:35,960
Watch. If you draw a line,
people won't see it as a tower.

2636
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:37,860
- So draw two lines.
- That's right.

2637
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,770
- Okay.
- But behind it...

2638
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,670
- The answer is Palgakjeong.
- Two lines.

2639
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:43,000
- They'll see it as N Seoul Tower.
- Mountain.

2640
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,600
He'll need to draw
Palgakjeong as well.

2641
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,770
- Lines.
- Draw eight lines for Palgakjeong.

2642
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:47,340
- One, two, three, four, five...
- No, don't count them.

2643
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:48,340
Don't count eight lines.

2644
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:49,510
- Just go.
- You don't have time to do that.

2645
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:50,810
Draw the columns here.

2646
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:52,410
Draw lines...

2647
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:54,450
Draw the columns. Just do that.

2648
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:55,880
It'll take me 50 seconds.

2649
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,680
- I only have five seconds.
- You can do it.

2650
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,890
Hold on. I have an idea.

2651
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:00,050
After drawing Mount Nam...

2652
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:02,160
What I drew looks like
N Seoul Tower, right?

2653
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,690
It doesn't look like N Seoul Tower!

2654
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:06,390
- How is that N Seoul Tower?
- It isn't N Seoul Tower.

2655
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:08,830
Hey, it looks exactly like
N Seoul Tower.

2656
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:10,260
- Just...
- There has to be a mountain.

2657
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:11,400
There has to be a mountain.

2658
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,600
- Mountain.
- Mountain.

2659
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,830
- A mountain behind.
- Just draw it roughly...

2660
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:15,200
and draw an arrow.

2661
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,200
An arrow there?

2662
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,640
After drawing the Palgakjeong here,

2663
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,670
- draw an arrow.
- We don't have time.

2664
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:20,010
- We don't have time.
- We can't draw a Palgakjeong.

2665
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:21,810
- You can do it, right?
- Just don't draw an octagon.

2666
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:23,780
Just draw a tile house.

2667
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:25,510
- Just draw a tile house.
- Just...

2668
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:27,280
- think of drawing a tile house.
- A tile house?

2669
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,380
- A tile house.
- Like this.

2670
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,380
Just draw it like a thatched house.

2671
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,490
Just draw it simply like this.

2672
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:35,290
- You have to draw a mountain.
- Why did it have to be Se Chan?

2673
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:37,090
- Goodness.
- I should have been the one.

2674
01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:38,260
He has to draw a mountain.

2675
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:39,760
Having a chance...

2676
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,130
- makes so much difference.
- It's important.

2677
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:43,330
- Get ready.
- Hold on.

2678
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:45,300
- A mountain.
- Start.

2679
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,570
(He starts drawing over
for 5 seconds.)

2680
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:48,000
- A mountain.
- Start.

2681
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,200
- Go. A mountain, quickly. There!
- One, two...

2682
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,840
- Octagonal.
- Yes. That's it.

2683
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,570
(Would he have drawn
the Palgakjeong?)

2684
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:55,780
- Octagonal.
- Yes. That's it.

2685
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,840
- Right.
- It's done.

2686
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,310
- That's right!
- Five! Yes.

2687
01:22:58,310 --> 01:23:00,310
That's right! That looks fine.
It's not bad.

2688
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,320
- That's okay?
- It's done.

2689
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,550
- It's not bad.
- It's nice.

2690
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:05,320
- I don't know.
- It's not bad.

2691
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,520
- It's not bad.
- It's not bad.

2692
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,720
- But this...
- This looks like Mount Nam.

2693
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,090
It doesn't look like a mountain.

2694
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:11,830
- It looks like a grasshopper.
- It's a mountain.

2695
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:13,090
It's better than I had expected.

2696
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:14,190
- You drew better than I expected.
- Right.

2697
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:15,200
- Really?
- Yes.

2698
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,230
The lesson worked.

2699
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:18,570
- It was a relief that we did it.
- Right?

2700
01:23:18,570 --> 01:23:19,600
Yes.

2701
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,570
Se Chan draws better now.

2702
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:24,600
- It was thanks to the lesson.
- You've improved.

2703
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,140
- We don't have much time left.
- Yes.

2704
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:28,880
- Let's hurry.
- We need to be quick.

2705
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,240
- Okay.
- We really don't have much time.

2706
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,250
Jae Seok. But if we...

2707
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:33,880
end up in the wrong neighborhood,

2708
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:34,950
- That would be big trouble.
- it would be the end.

2709
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:36,850
Let's succeed in this.
Let's succeed...

2710
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,820
and not go on the Gyro Swing.

2711
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:40,350
I can't ride that.

2712
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:41,490
We have to do this well.

2713
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:43,460
I can see it there.

2714
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:44,590
(They can see the N Seoul Tower
far ahead.)

2715
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:45,830
It's the N Seoul Tower.

2716
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:49,600
- I can see it.
- I can see it.

2717
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,560
It could be the N Seoul Tower.

2718
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,930
We have to go to Mount Nam anyway.

2719
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:53,930
- We have to go.
- We have to. Yes.

2720
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:55,500
- That's right.
- That's what's important.

2721
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,670
That drawing isn't bad.

2722
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:57,840
- It's vague.
- It's not bad.

2723
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,540
- Jong Kook.
- You drew well. We're good.

2724
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:01,740
- Let's go.
- Let's go where it's visible.

2725
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:04,040
Let's go confidently this time
since we drew well.

2726
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,010
- Let's cross and see.
- Should we cross?

2727
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:07,580
Personally,

2728
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:10,650
- What is it?
- I don't think I would think of...

2729
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:12,350
- Mount Nam's Palgakjeong.
- Let's change it.

2730
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:14,920
You'd have to ask someone
who would go to Mount Nam.

2731
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,120
- Right.
- Even the neighborhood.

2732
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,930
- People come here only to work.
- Right.

2733
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:22,430
Or why don't we ask
a group of 3 to 4 people?

2734
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:24,100
- They would discuss.
- About four people.

2735
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,130
We can't ask one person.

2736
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:28,770
- They would discuss.
- The person wearing a backpack.

2737
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:30,440
(Some people were caught
on Jae Seok's radar.)

2738
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,370
- The person wearing a backpack.
- Rather than one person...

2739
01:24:32,370 --> 01:24:34,370
- No.
- Hello.

2740
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:35,410
- No.
- Hold on.

2741
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:38,480
- Could you...
- The two of you. Hold on.

2742
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:40,110
- Goodness.
- They won't know.

2743
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:41,480
- This...
- I don't think they'll know.

2744
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,380
- I got the feeling.
- We can't give any hints.

2745
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:44,580
- Come this way.
- Come.

2746
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:45,750
- Hello.
- Could we interview you?

2747
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:46,750
Hello.

2748
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:48,290
- Could we interview you?
- Do you work here?

2749
01:24:48,290 --> 01:24:49,290
They're wearing summer clothes.

2750
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:51,360
We came from the US.

2751
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,730
- From the US.
- No!

2752
01:24:52,730 --> 01:24:53,790
We came from the US.

2753
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:59,370
- No!
- No!

2754
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:01,230
(What is this about?)

2755
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:03,370
- No.
- You came from the US?

2756
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:05,610
- We can't do this.
- How would they know?

2757
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:07,110
- When did you come?
- When did you come?

2758
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:09,610
- On Friday.
- Yes.

2759
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:11,240
- You arrived on Friday?
- Yes.

2760
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,850
How long has it been
since you last came?

2761
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:15,920
- To Korea.
- For me,

2762
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,720
it's been a long time.

2763
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:20,120
It's been a long time?
Then he might know.

2764
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,920
- Then he might know.
- I don't think...

2765
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,390
(Would he know the Palgakjeong
that not even the locals know?)

2766
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:26,030
Did you live here for a long time
before leaving?

2767
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:27,660
I was born in the US.

2768
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:29,230
Born in USA?

2769
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:31,800
- Where are you from?
- This won't work.

2770
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:33,030
What's your name?

2771
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:34,870
My American name is Jonathan.

2772
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:36,570
- Jonathan.
- Jonathan.

2773
01:25:36,570 --> 01:25:37,840
- Ryan.
- Ryan.

2774
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,440
- Ryan.
- We're familiar with that name.

2775
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,740
It's Ryan and Jonathan?

2776
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,780
- Ryan and Jonathan?
- Ryan.

2777
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:44,610
Ryan and Jonathan. Nice to meet you.

2778
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:46,010
Yes.

2779
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:47,980
- Nice to meet you. And...
- This is funny.

2780
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:49,180
"And..."

2781
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:52,320
(He asks in Korean.)

2782
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,120
- Let me ask you a question.
- Hold on.

2783
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,120
- So suddenly?
- This won't work.

2784
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,230
- Okay.
- I'm not good at drawing.

2785
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:00,930
The production crew...

2786
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:01,960
(Laughing)

2787
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,630
told me a location, and I drew it.

2788
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:04,730
Look closely.

2789
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:06,230
Look closely and guess
where this place is.

2790
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:08,130
Should I say it now?

2791
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:10,340
- Okay.
- Should I...

2792
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:11,740
(Jonathan already has a guess?)

2793
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:13,140
- Hold on.
- No.

2794
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:17,210
- Do you have a guess?
- Do you know where it is?

2795
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,680
What is this place?

2796
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:20,710
What's the answer?

2797
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,520
Mount Nam?

2798
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,120
(He recognized Mount Nam!)

2799
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:26,220
(Will he get it correct
on the first attempt?)

2800
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:27,720
N Seoul Tower?

2801
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,820
- N Seoul Tower?
- N Seoul Tower.

2802
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:31,190
- Good.
- It's not bad.

2803
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:32,560
- It's not bad.
- Okay.

2804
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,190
(It's not the answer,
but they can go to N Seoul Tower!)

2805
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:36,230
- That's good.
- Okay.

2806
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:38,360
- Good. N Seoul Tower is good.
- It's good.

2807
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,030
- Good.
- Well done.

2808
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:41,470
- Nice!
- Nice.

2809
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:42,470
- Nice.
- Good.

2810
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:44,240
- N Seoul Tower is good.
- Not bad. It's fine.

2811
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,240
- Right.
- It's fine.

2812
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,840
- We can go nearby.
- Thank you.

2813
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,880
You guessed it correctly right away.

2814
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,240
It looks like N Seoul Tower, right?

2815
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:52,150
- Yes.
- Right.

2816
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:53,510
- Have a nice day.
- Have a happy trip.

2817
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:55,420
- Thank you. Enjoy your trip.
- Thank you.

2818
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:56,480
Have a nice day.

2819
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,550
- Still...
- Still...

2820
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:59,590
We can still go to Mount Nam.

2821
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:01,820
- We're going to Mount Nam.
- We can go to Mount Nam.

2822
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:03,420
- I had hopes.
- But...

2823
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:04,660
- N Seoul Tower...
- Mount Nam is fine.

2824
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:06,460
Anyway, it's a relief...

2825
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:08,860
- that we can go to Mount Nam.
- Right.

2826
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:10,760
It would be done.
It's right over there.

2827
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,830
But if we go there,

2828
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:14,700
- If they say something else...
- and they say something else...

2829
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:15,940
- But...
- That shouldn't happen.

2830
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:18,100
I don't think they'll say
something else there.

2831
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:19,110
- Right.
- I think so too.

2832
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:21,570
- You can point to this...
- The arrow.

2833
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,740
- and ask, "What is this place?"
- Right.

2834
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:25,610
"A house under Mount Nam."
Something like that.

2835
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:26,650
A house under Mount Nam?

2836
01:27:26,650 --> 01:27:29,750
Building a thatched house
on Mount Nam

2837
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:31,820
(Building a thatched house
on Mount Nam)

2838
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:34,450
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

2839
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:35,660
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

2840
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:36,760
- Why are you so energetic?
- Hey!

2841
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:37,860
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you doing?

2842
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,460
- How could you change so much?
- She has to eat.

2843
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,930
- Hey.
- She has to eat something.

2844
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:44,130
- She has to eat.
- She has to eat.

2845
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:45,300
She's totally different
after eating.

2846
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:46,730
Make sure you eat.

2847
01:27:46,730 --> 01:27:48,030
You're just singing live like that?

2848
01:27:48,030 --> 01:27:49,600
- After eating, she suddenly...
- She just...

2849
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,240
You're so different!

2850
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:53,940
- She wasn't humming. She sang.
- You're a different person.

2851
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:55,310
You seem to be in a good mood.

2852
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:56,310
- That's nice.
- She's normal if she eats.

2853
01:27:56,310 --> 01:27:57,940
- It was because of food.
- Why are you suddenly like this?

2854
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:58,950
- After eating...
- So...

2855
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:00,810
- Where are your glasses?
- Goodness.

2856
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,050
- He erased it.
- He erased it.

2857
01:28:02,050 --> 01:28:04,920
Why did you do that?
You can't erase that in the middle.

2858
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,620
- Why did you do that?
- Se Chan.

2859
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:07,950
- Quickly draw for him.
- Draw it well.

2860
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:08,960
After I eat, I'll...

2861
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,090
- What's wrong with you?
- No.

2862
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:11,420
- Make it round.
- Why are you doing this?

2863
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:12,630
- Wait...
- A round one.

2864
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:14,190
- You don't look like yourself.
- Draw it well.

2865
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:15,960
- Draw a round one this time.
- Seriously.

2866
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:17,400
- Right. Make it thick.
- Hey.

2867
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,400
- This ended earlier.
- I won't say...

2868
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,630
- you're an extra.
- No.

2869
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:21,830
- What's wrong with you?
- I won't say you're an extra.

2870
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:24,140
- He's right.
- Thicker. That's right.

2871
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,870
- Draw it well.
- Weren't we done with this?

2872
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:27,470
- No. It's not over.
- No.

2873
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,540
- Let me see.
- That's nice.

2874
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:32,550
(Niel is back!)

2875
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:34,780
- Niel.
- You now look like yourself.

2876
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:36,080
- You look cool.
- That's awesome.

2877
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,750
You're so cute.

2878
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:40,820
-You look cool.
- We're in trouble.

2879
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:42,590
- I'm sorry.
- The glasses don't look normal...

2880
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:43,920
This is a permanent marker!

2881
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,490
- Why did you use that?
- Really?

2882
01:28:46,630 --> 01:28:48,190
- I didn't know. I'm sorry.
- Hey.

2883
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:50,000
- Use a cleansing oil.
- I have to go to a preview later.

2884
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,400
- You have to go to a preview?
- Use a cleansing oil.

2885
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,400
- Go like that.
- Daniel.

2886
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,600
- You'd be awesome like that.
- I can't go like this.

2887
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:55,640
No one would notice.

2888
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,170
- How could they not know?
- They wouldn't.

2889
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:58,770
- You look good.
- You'll top the search charts...

2890
01:28:58,770 --> 01:28:59,970
if you go like that.

2891
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,040
- We're here.
- There are cable cars.

2892
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,640
We have to go up to N Seoul Tower.

2893
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:04,640
Cable car.

2894
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,250
We'll be in trouble
if we don't get it here.

2895
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:07,950
- We have to go there.
- We have to go quickly.

2896
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:08,980
Goodness.

2897
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:10,420
You have 30 minutes left.

2898
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:12,550
- Let's go.
- We can do it.

2899
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:14,020
- We have to hurry.
- But...

2900
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:15,560
it will be hard to get people
to say Palgakjeong.

2901
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,990
- We have to succeed.
- We don't have time.

2902
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:18,860
Let's go quickly.
We don't have time.

2903
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:19,860
Let's succeed.

2904
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:21,990
Let's succeed
and not ride the Gyro Swing.

2905
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:23,230
We can't ride it.

2906
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:24,430
I can't ride it.

2907
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:26,300
- We really don't have time.
- Seok Jin.

2908
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:27,930
- Let's take a picture.
- Here. Right.

2909
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:29,870
We should take a picture.

2910
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,500
One, two, three.

2911
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:32,940
- Okay.
- Okay.

2912
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:34,610
- Shall we ask people?
- We should.

2913
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:35,840
- We don't need to go up.
- Right.

2914
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,110
- Let's ask first.
- Ask them here.

2915
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:38,210
Inside...

2916
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:39,550
- The person inside.
- In the store.

2917
01:29:39,550 --> 01:29:41,380
In the store.

2918
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:43,150
- Hello.
- You have to explain well.

2919
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:44,950
Would he know?

2920
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:48,120
- Could I ask you something?
- Right. Let's go.

2921
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:49,860
- So...
- Yes?

2922
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:53,590
I drew this over a short time,

2923
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:56,960
so it's not accurate.
But do you see this arrow?

2924
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:59,570
I'm going to ask you a question now.

2925
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:02,240
- Take a look at the whole thing...
- Okay.

2926
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:05,040
- and tell us.
- What does it remind you of?

2927
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,670
- Over there.
- What comes to your mind?

2928
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:08,340
- The arrow.
- What...

2929
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:10,640
What is this?

2930
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:13,150
(Would he have recognized
the Palgakjeong?)

2931
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:15,680
A bathroom?

2932
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,720
- A bathroom...
- A bathroom?

2933
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,190
(Bathroom: wrong answer)

2934
01:30:19,190 --> 01:30:21,020
- We'll go...
- Thank you.

2935
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:22,520
- to a bathroom.
- Thank you.

2936
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,360
- Let's go.
- It's a relief.

2937
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,830
Thank you. It was fun.

2938
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:27,230
- It's a relief.
- It's a relief.

2939
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:28,930
- It would be nearby.
- It's a relief.

2940
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:30,500
- Here.
- It's here.

2941
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,500
- Here.
- This is the bathroom.

2942
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,700
- Why is this a bathroom?
- One, two, three.

2943
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,440
- Okay.
- This...

2944
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:38,240
- The lady.
- The owner we saw earlier.

2945
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:39,240
We only have 30 minutes.

2946
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,010
- We...
- They do know.

2947
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:42,610
Let's first go outside.

2948
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:44,140
- Let's go.
- We don't have time.

2949
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:47,010
- Hello.
- Hello.

2950
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:48,110
Could we interview you?

2951
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:50,050
Can I ask you one question?

2952
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,550
- So now...
- Yes.

2953
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:53,550
- We'll ask you one question.
- Okay.

2954
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:55,660
- I didn't have enough time,
- Okay.

2955
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:58,120
so I couldn't draw in detail.

2956
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,560
- Do you see this?
- Yes.

2957
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,230
- Look at the arrow.
- Okay.

2958
01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:04,200
Okay. Think carefully.

2959
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,430
What is this?

2960
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:09,600
(If the answer is far away
from Mount Nam,)

2961
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,310
(their chances of succeeding
will drop.)

2962
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:13,710
(What will she say?)

2963
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:17,140
- A trash bin.
- A trash bin?

2964
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:19,380
- It's right here.
- It's here.

2965
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:20,780
- Thank you.
- It's here.

2966
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:22,580
- Well done.
- Good job.

2967
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:23,750
- Bye.
- Bye.

2968
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:25,520
- Let's take a picture.
- Let's do that. It's right here.

2969
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:26,720
- It's right here.
- It's a relief.

2970
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,090
- It's here.
- The trash bin happened to be here.

2971
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:29,090
It was right here.

2972
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:30,390
- It's here.
- First, a bathroom,

2973
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:32,360
- and now, a trash bin.
- It's possible.

2974
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,130
One, two, three.

2975
01:31:34,130 --> 01:31:35,600
- Okay.
- Good.

2976
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,600
Okay.

2977
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,830
The guide.

2978
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:40,770
- The guide.
- The worker.

2979
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:42,540
(Daniel suggests asking the guide.)

2980
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:43,870
- The guide.
- The workers...

2981
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:45,500
- That's a good idea.
- The workers.

2982
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,570
- That's a good idea.
- Or...

2983
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:48,340
- No. The worker in there...
- A worker.

2984
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:49,680
- A worker?
- The guides show people around.

2985
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,340
- Hello.
- Hello.

2986
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:53,010
- Didn't we meet before?
- Do you have some time?

2987
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:55,050
Right? I remember you.

2988
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:58,250
Really? I met her
when I was recording before.

2989
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,550
- You worked here for a long time.
- Yes.

2990
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:02,720
- How long has it been?
- About seven years.

2991
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,660
- Seven years. She'd surely know.
- Seven years. That's...

2992
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:06,360
This...

2993
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,260
- She'd know everything.
- She'd know everything.

2994
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:09,630
- Does this...
- She'd know everything.

2995
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:11,030
Do you have any idea what this is?

2996
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:12,900
(Well...)

2997
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:14,630
- Yes.
- You know what it is.

2998
01:32:14,630 --> 01:32:16,100
- This is it.
- Let's just go with it.

2999
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:17,800
- She has a feeling.
- Jae Seok drew it.

3000
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,440
She knows what it is. Hang on.

3001
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:22,140
- We have about 15 minutes now.
- Please.

3002
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:23,710
He didn't depict it
accurately though.

3003
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:26,410
- Focus on the arrow.
- We are asking about the arrow.

3004
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:28,010
- All right.
- Focus on the arrow.

3005
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:29,750
- I'm nervous.
- Yes, I'm nervous.

3006
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,280
- All right.
- What do you think...

3007
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:33,720
this is?

3008
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,890
Please.

3009
01:32:35,190 --> 01:32:36,620
- We have to succeed.
- My goodness.

3010
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:39,590
- Palgakjeong.
- Yes!

3011
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:41,160
- Palgakjeong.
- Yes!

3012
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:44,360
(Palgakjeong is correct.)

3013
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:46,930
(The correct answer finally came out
after 4 attempts.)

3014
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:48,770
- She's insanely good.
- How...

3015
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:49,870
- How did you know?
- You're unbelievable.

3016
01:32:49,870 --> 01:32:51,240
- How did she know?
- How did you know?

3017
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,670
- How is that possible?
- I got goosebumps.

3018
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:54,170
How... How did you know?

3019
01:32:54,170 --> 01:32:55,880
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

3020
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:57,740
- I just noticed it when I saw it.
- My goodness.

3021
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:59,180
- How is she...
- This is insane.

3022
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:01,280
- I feel like crying.
- This is...

3023
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,950
- This is amazing.
- You're unbelievable.

3024
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:05,350
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you. I knew it.

3025
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:06,590
- What is your name?
- It's because she works here.

3026
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:07,820
- Ji Min.
- Ji Min.

3027
01:33:08,190 --> 01:33:10,290
- I knew it.
- Thank you, Ji Min.

3028
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:12,090
- Okay.
- It's over once we take a photo.

3029
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:13,630
- Thank you.
- That was great.

3030
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:15,700
- Palgakjeong.
- It was so close.

3031
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:16,930
I'm so glad.

3032
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:18,760
- We would've failed without Ji Min.
- Seriously, this is...

3033
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,470
- This is...
- She could've said something else.

3034
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:21,600
If we hadn't asked an employee here,

3035
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,000
we would've ended up
going somewhere else.

3036
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:27,070
- But this takes quite a long time.
- Why?

3037
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:29,510
Let's just go and take a picture.

3038
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,010
I thought we'd be going
to take Gyro Swing today.

3039
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:33,310
- I thought we'd be going.
- For sure.

3040
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:42,820
Let's go.

3041
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:45,660
- My gosh. This is...
- All right. It's been a while.

3042
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:47,690
- We did this thing before.
- Right.

3043
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:48,760
- It's been a long time.
- My gosh.

3044
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:51,130
I don't think we have enough time.

3045
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:52,230
Please.

3046
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,230
For your information,
it is 3:51 p.m. now.

3047
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:57,240
- It's so close.
- Please don't be like that.

3048
01:33:57,270 --> 01:33:58,770
This is nerve-racking.

3049
01:33:58,770 --> 01:34:00,510
- Palgakjeong is right up there.
- Is it?

3050
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:01,740
Let's hurry. We don't have time.

3051
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:03,910
- Let's go. Run.
- Let's go.

3052
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:05,440
- Where's Palgakjeong?
- Hurry up.

3053
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:06,950
- Move!
- Palgakjeong.

3054
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:09,250
- We have to hurry.
- Palgakjeong.

3055
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:10,850
- We don't have time.
- Move. We're pressed for time.

3056
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:11,980
To the right.

3057
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,390
- Good, Seok Jin.
- We have to take a picture.

3058
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:15,590
- I can't go.
- It's over there.

3059
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:16,690
- Hurry and go.
- This is too hard.

3060
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:18,320
- Ji Hyo, it's right there.
- Just take a picture.

3061
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:19,960
We have to take a picture.

3062
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,330
- It's done.
- Palgakjeong.

3063
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:22,330
We're here.

3064
01:34:22,330 --> 01:34:23,960
Hurry. We don't have much time left.

3065
01:34:24,330 --> 01:34:25,460
- It's done.
- Let's take a picture.

3066
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:26,970
- Take a picture, and it's done.
- Picture.

3067
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:28,800
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

3068
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,070
Palgakjeong should be
in the picture.

3069
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:31,440
- All right.
- Is it in the picture?

3070
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,570
- Okay.
- I'm sure it is.

3071
01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:33,840
One, two, three.

3072
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:35,540
Two, three.

3073
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:36,880
(They're done taking a picture
of Palgakjeong.)

3074
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:38,110
Gosh, I'm tired.

3075
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:40,350
- Is it done?
- This is so nerve-racking.

3076
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:41,450
We have to succeed.

3077
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:44,850
Now, it's 3:56pm.

3078
01:34:44,850 --> 01:34:45,890
- Gosh, we had four minutes left.
- Four minutes.

3079
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:47,690
(The current time is 3:56 p.m.)

3080
01:34:47,690 --> 01:34:49,120
- Gosh, we had four minutes left.
- Four minutes.

3081
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:51,320
I thought we'd fail. But we made it.

3082
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,530
- Success!
- Success!

3083
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:55,560
- We did it.
- Good job, guys.

3084
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:56,860
(They succeeded thanks to those
who recognized weird drawings.)

3085
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:59,270
- We did it!
- This is amazing.

3086
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:00,330
- We succeeded.
- Thank you.

3087
01:35:00,330 --> 01:35:01,430
- Success!
- How nice!

3088
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:02,540
We succeeded.

3089
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:04,840
- How did she recognize Palgakjeong?
- I know.

3090
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:07,910
(The 8 laughter hunters enter...)

3091
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:10,540
(the fancy game room.)

3092
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:12,510
(She is here for the 5th time
looking for love.)

3093
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:15,450
(Running Man's official Ok Soon,
romantic Kim Ah Young)

3094
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:17,020
I have two dates here today.

3095
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:18,680
(The lovely fox's temptation)

3096
01:35:19,150 --> 01:35:20,920
(The hearts of the lovers
are broken already.)

3097
01:35:20,950 --> 01:35:22,920
Daniel fell for her like 50 percent.

3098
01:35:22,990 --> 01:35:24,120
I'm sure he did.

3099
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,660
(The game of the gamblers begins.)

3100
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,390
(Among the numerous fake cards,)

3101
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:30,030
(find only the real cards!)

3102
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:31,300
There might be a real card here.

3103
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,900
My team members are
just blinded by love.

3104
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:35,430
- Blinded?
- It's okay. We have love.

3105
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,300
(Power Ji Hyo is back after a long time
to punish the romantics.)

3106
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:39,140
(Even when Running Man's
Ok Soon is drowning,)

3107
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:40,870
(Date No. 1 is just laughing
without a clue.)

3108
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:42,810
(Meanwhile, the laughter hunters'
love is getting more intense.)

3109
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,550
I forgot that
you were not wearing underpants.

3110
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:48,380
There's a parent meeting next week!

3111
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:50,350
(Gamblers in the City)
