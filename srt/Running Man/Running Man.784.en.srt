1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,140
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,910
(Running Man)

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,780
- What are we doing today? - What is this place?

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,650
(The day of the shoot for the last episode of 2025)

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,420
What are we doing here? Are we starting separately?

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,590
Do we have our own spots?

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,490
(They are starting separately?)

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,490
What are we doing today? Why are we starting separately?

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,290
Where is everyone?

10
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,530
Why am I alone here?

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,300
(Today's race will start with the members separated on each floor.)

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,260
- What are we doing today? - Why...

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,800
- Why are we separated? - are we in our own spots?

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,170
Why are we starting separately?

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,700
We will have a preliminary mission...

16
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,210
- with an advantage in today's race. - Okay.

17
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,610
(Today's preliminary mission will give them an important advantage.)

18
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,010
If you find your hidden box within the time limit,

19
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,210
(Rule: Find the box with your name on it.)

20
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,040
- you succeed. - I see.

21
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,550
We're doing this again after a long time.

22
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,820
(It's a simple mission where they will have to find their box.)

23
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,780
Are we supposed to find the box?

24
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,880
- I want to find it. - I'm feeling good today.

25
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,620
For your information,

26
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,390
you can't move someone else's box even if you find it.

27
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,620
I see. We should leave it there.

28
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,020
Let's go.

29
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,390
(While they all head off to find their box...)

30
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,590
Seok Jin, there's a hidden rule for you.

31
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,900
- Okay. - Seok Jin.

32
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,530
- There's a hidden rule for you. - Okay.

33
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,300
(A hidden mission given only to Seok Jin?)

34
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,500
Seok Jin, do you remember...

35
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
how you lost in the Name Tag Elimination in Tongyeong?

36
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
I remember.

37
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,410
For years, we were just in prison...

38
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,710
(The legendary scene created in Tongyeong)

39
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,770
- Niel, you... - I never once...

40
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,980
You think you can beat me if we do name tag ripping, right?

41
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,780
- You can't beat him. - You can't beat me.

42
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,280
(With his gemlike words, a moonlit war broke out.)

43
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,950
Do you want to try now?

44
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,650
(However...)

45
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,620
He lost.

46
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,220
- He lost. - He lost in a pitiful way.

47
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,020
(His name tag was torn off like the nape of an old chicken neck.)

48
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,760
(And his pride was torn even more severely.)

49
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,520
- It was so embarrassing. - Seok Jin.

50
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,630
(3 weeks later)

51
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,190
Looking back, I realize I was being too hasty.

52
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,190
Right.

53
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,830
To be honest, I would've won if Daniel had been about my size.

54
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,430
(He hasn't overcome the grudge from that day.)

55
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,330
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

56
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,530
Do you think you can beat me?

57
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,200
(Teasing)

58
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,010
(The shattered pride of a middle-aged man)

59
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,440
Stop it. You're not allowed to say that again.

60
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,580
- It will last a year. - There's an episode...

61
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,580
that I dream of, Haha.

62
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,710
You and I...

63
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,310
- go around ripping off name tags - Right.

64
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,710
- That would be cool. - I've asked for it...

65
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,550
(The day of victory he's only ever imagined)

66
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,250
- for about eight years, - Exactly.

67
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,720
- You kept talking about it. - but they wouldn't listen.

68
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,390
We will combine our power and speed to conquer everything.

69
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,290
(He's been waiting for a revenge match like that.)

70
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,160
- Someone fast and strong. - You mean, you two will do that?

71
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,590
Yes. We will conquer everything.

72
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,590
Today, we will give you a chance to regain your confidence.

73
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:03,430
(Today is the day for revenge.)

74
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,530
The members, unaware of the hidden rule,

75
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,300
(The members don't know that the hidden rule exists.)

76
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,370
are being told to find a box with their name on it...

77
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,800
- within the time limit. - My goodness.

78
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,400
Before all the members find their boxes,

79
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,970
you must tear off all the name tags.

80
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,170
- I must? - Yes.

81
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,610
- If you succeed, - Okay.

82
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,510
you'll receive a special benefit for today's race.

83
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,810
- This is... - If a member finds out about it...

84
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,610
and rips off your name tag, your mission fails...

85
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,950
and ends right away, so you should be careful.

86
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,720
(From the moment Running Man began)

87
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,420
Why do you...

88
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,190
get caught so easily every time?

89
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,630
Hey, let go of it.

90
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,100
(He can't escape his fate of being the race starter.)

91
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,830
I can't believe this.

92
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,400
It's been only two minutes.

93
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,970
(Since it started)

94
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,670
(Now it is time to avenge the humiliation of the past.)

95
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,210
Yes!

96
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,210
(It's time for Big Nose.)

97
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,010
Actually, I was being a bit hasty that day.

98
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,080
(The Tongyeong match)

99
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,850
I rushed in a bit.

100
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,350
(Analyzing the reason)

101
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,920
Today, I'll show you...

102
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,020
all the know-how I've accumulated so far.

103
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,720
I think I should tear off Jong Kook's name tag first.

104
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,930
Because Jong Kook...

105
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,100
(Jee-rasoni's plan is to eliminate the strongest Jong Kook first.)

106
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,260
is on another level.

107
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,930
Guys like Se Chan, Jae Seok, and Haha...

108
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,470
are easy to deal with.

109
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,680
(He will eliminate the easier ones 1 at a time.)

110
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,440
I see. This is a preliminary mission.

111
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,910
It hasn't begun yet, right?

112
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,010
Shall we begin?

113
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,510
Five, four, three,

114
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,180
two, one.

115
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,180
Race, start!

116
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,320
(Race start)

117
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,250
I will avenge the humiliation of that day.

118
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,620
I'm a little nervous.

119
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,260
(Excited)

120
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,030
(Jee-rasoni has begun his mission.)

121
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,660
This is off-limits.

122
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,430
(The box)

123
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,700
- Did you find your box? - Yes.

124
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,730
(Ye Eun approaches him as soon as it begins.)

125
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,800
- Did you find your box? - Hey.

126
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,900
I haven't found it.

127
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,970
(He just passes by?)

128
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,270
I'll leave her alone.

129
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,740
I can tear off her name tag any time I want.

130
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,440
I should check the fridge.

131
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,380
(The first prey is released.)

132
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,720
In a mission like this,

133
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,220
once I tear off one name tag, I should do the rest in one go.

134
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,420
Before words get out.

135
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,390
That's my know-how.

136
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,260
(Really excited)

137
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,590
(Will he be able to tear off even one name tag?)

138
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,660
I haven't felt such tension in a long time.

139
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,600
I feel so alive.

140
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,330
Gosh, this is...

141
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,170
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

142
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,140
(He spots his first target, Jong Kook.)

143
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,370
You haven't found it, have you?

144
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,440
- I think I should tear off... - There's nothing.

145
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,910
Jong Kook's name tag first.

146
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,110
(The room where Jong Kook is)

147
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,050
(But he goes to another room?)

148
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,910
It's Jong Kook.

149
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,080
But for some reason, I'm afraid.

150
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,150
(He's terrified to tear off the strongest tiger's name tag.)

151
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,260
It's not here, right?

152
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,760
There's nothing. I worked out too much yesterday.

153
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,190
(He scans the room where Jong Kook is and goes to the next room.)

154
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,960
My legs hurt so much.

155
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,030
(He worked out the lower body the day before.)

156
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,900
(Glancing)

157
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,740
(Is he finally coming to eliminate Jong Kook?)

158
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,680
Why is he sitting there?

159
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,180
(He's too scared to try, so he just mutters to himself.)

160
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,080
I should start by ripping off his name tag.

161
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,350
I should go to the other end.

162
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,850
(In the meantime, Jong Kook heads toward the stairs.)

163
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,220
Where is he going?

164
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,490
Did you find it?

165
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,720
(The box)

166
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,390
I haven't found mine, but I saw yours.

167
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,790
I haven't found mine, but I saw yours.

168
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,330
- Really? Where? - Yes.

169
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,930
(He approaches, pretending to know the location.)

170
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,530
You should tell me where it was.

171
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,330
You should do something for me in return.

172
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,700
- Do what? - You could help me find mine.

173
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,540
- I should help you? - Yes.

174
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,070
(Jong Kook is exposing his name tag off his guard.)

175
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,280
- Which floor was it? - What?

176
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,410
Which floor was it? What floor was mine on?

177
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,380
(The perfect opportunity to take down the tiger)

178
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,910
- Come on. - Tell me.

179
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,780
Just tell me where it was.

180
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,980
- What floor is this? - Here? I think...

181
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,720
(He only tags along behind Jong Kook.)

182
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,190
- we're on the third floor. - It wasn't here.

183
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,420
No? Then, where was it?

184
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,520
(At this moment, Jong Kook suddenly turns his back.)

185
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,860
Then, where was it?

186
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,290
- Where was it? - What floor are we on?

187
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
(Flustered)

188
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Where is it?

189
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,590
It's on the second floor.

190
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,330
(He just makes something up.)

191
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,230
On the second floor?

192
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,200
- I can't say it's the 2nd floor. - Where on the 2nd floor?

193
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,630
(He races to the 2nd floor, where his box was found.)

194
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,870
- The 2nd floor? Where? - It's on the 1st floor.

195
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,800
(Flustered)

196
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,100
- Where on the 2nd floor? - I can't say it's the 2nd floor.

197
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,500
- The 2nd floor? Where? - It's on the 1st floor.

198
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,600
The second floor? Where?

199
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,470
Okay. The second floor?

200
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,140
(Laughing in embarrassment)

201
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,610
- I mean... - Where was it?

202
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,750
(At this state, he will lose Jong Kook!)

203
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,910
- Tell me. - Just come here.

204
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,280
- Where on the second floor? - I'll tell you.

205
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,250
Where is it? Haha.

206
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,450
(Haha shows up.)

207
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,720
Hey.

208
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,620
- What? - Hey. Mine is on the second floor.

209
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,050
- What is? - My box.

210
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,720
What about mine?

211
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,690
Haha, I don't know where yours is.

212
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,690
(With Haha's appearance, he retreats for now.)

213
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,330
- I just... - He lied to me.

214
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,100
(Disappointed, Jong Kook goes back to find his box.)

215
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,300
There's no way he'd help me.

216
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,700
Darn it. That's a delivery box.

217
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,870
(The other members are busy looking for their boxes.)

218
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,170
This is real food.

219
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,340
It's not here.

220
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,510
How are you, Se Chan?

221
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,780
Hello, Seok Jin.

222
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,310
It's not here.

223
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,880
(He finds Ssaebssaeb alone.)

224
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,210
- The box isn't here. - No.

225
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,620
- Apparently, the box is... - Yes.

226
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,020
(He should take care of it quietly when no one is watching.)

227
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,020
quite small.

228
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,690
Did anyone find it?

229
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,560
(He targets Se Chan and trails behind him.)

230
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,920
- Ji Hyo found one. - She found it?

231
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,060
- Ji Hyo. - Whose box was it?

232
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,190
Whose box was it? Was it empty?

233
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,860
(But Ji Hyo is downstairs.)

234
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,130
I can't tell you that.

235
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,230
- I see. - I can't tell you that.

236
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,900
I found one, though.

237
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,900
- Se Chan. - Yes?

238
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,200
- Come here. - Why?

239
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,310
(He calls Se Chan out to separate him from Ji Hyo.)

240
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,680
- I saw your box. - Okay.

241
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,510
(Again, he lures Se Chan, talking about his box.)

242
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,410
- What will you do if I help you? - What?

243
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,520
What will you do for me if I help you?

244
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,250
(Naive)

245
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,920
- Do you know where mine is? - Yes.

246
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,090
- Then what? - Hang on.

247
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,390
What will you do for me?

248
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,360
Did you find mine?

249
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,960
- I found yours. - Where was it?

250
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,090
I was going to hide yours, but I wasn't allowed to do it.

251
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,200
(Sly)

252
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,090
Right.

253
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,360
It's right over there.

254
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,730
(Seok Jin says the box is in the room right in front of them.)

255
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,730
Really?

256
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,670
Really?

257
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,700
(He took the bait.)

258
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,340
Where?

259
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,010
Where?

260
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,240
(Ripping off)

261
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,040
What are you doing?

262
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,610
What are you doing?

263
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,750
(Se Chan is out.)

264
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,380
- What was that? - Today is my day.

265
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,980
- What was that? - Today is my day.

266
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,390
What is going on?

267
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,260
(Se Chan became Jee-rasoni's first sacrifice.)

268
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,850
What just happened?

269
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,660
- You don't know what this is? - No.

270
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,760
Did you film the great scene?

271
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,890
What is going on?

272
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,060
(Stunned)

273
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,400
Just stay quiet.

274
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,600
- Am I out? - You're out.

275
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,070
(Proud)

276
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,500
I got rid of one.

277
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
I'm reminded...

278
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,110
of the old days.

279
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,070
(Jee-rasoni heads off to look for his next target.)

280
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,140
Se Chan, you're out.

281
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,280
Really?

282
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,650
(Eliminated Member Status)

283
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,550
I got goosebumps.

284
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,350
Jong Kook and Jae Seok are the most...

285
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,990
(The next target)

286
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,520
(Right at the moment, Jae Seok is approaching.)

287
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,520
- I saw your box. - Where was it?

288
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,460
(Throwing the bait)

289
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,190
(Ddochi joins them after hearing about the box.)

290
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,130
- Where is it? - Where was it?

291
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,230
Where's mine?

292
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,600
I can't tell you unless you do something for me.

293
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,530
(His lies become bolder after eliminating one member.)

294
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,500
But mine... You can just tell me where it is.

295
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,630
- Tell you what? - Where's mine?

296
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,640
(Scratching)

297
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,070
You can tell me... By the way...

298
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,510
You can at least tell me what floor it is on.

299
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,710
It's on the upper floor.

300
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,310
(Fake)

301
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,970
- On the upper floor? - Yes.

302
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,980
What about mine?

303
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,480
(After hearing Seok Jin's words, he goes upstairs.)

304
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,250
What about mine?

305
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,680
Yours? Come here.

306
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,450
(Chuckling)

307
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,420
You didn't see it, did you? You don't know.

308
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,620
(He lures Ddochi as soon as Jae Seok leaves.)

309
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,890
I saw yours.

310
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,720
Did you see it?

311
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,090
You...

312
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,960
should remember this moment.

313
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,760
- What? - Chungju.

314
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,300
- Ji and Jee. Cross. - Cross.

315
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,900
(Seok Sam is completely absorbed in playing the main character.)

316
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,400
- Why? - You'll thank me.

317
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,140
- Because... - Why? Is it here? Or here?

318
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,010
You will be grateful to me. You should remember this moment.

319
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,170
- Okay. - Chungju.

320
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,440
- Ji and Jee. Cross. - Cross.

321
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,610
It's in this room, right?

322
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,480
(Is he giving his younger sister another chance?)

323
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,380
- Look carefully. - It's not here.

324
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,350
(He comes right back.)

325
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,350
(He changes his stance as soon as he turns around.)

326
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Hey, you should look for it here.

327
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,190
It's not here.

328
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,930
- What are you doing? Seok Jin! - I'm sorry.

329
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,760
(Ripping off)

330
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,760
- What are you doing? Seok Jin! - I'm sorry.

331
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,800
(Ye Eun is out.)

332
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,460
- What? - Quiet.

333
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,200
Stay quiet.

334
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,770
What just happened?

335
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,870
(The race newbie can't even grasp the situation.)

336
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,070
- Ye Eun is out. - Stay quiet.

337
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,600
Go and take care of her.

338
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,970
- Is he a spy? - That's two.

339
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,170
- That's number two. - What?

340
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:07,380
(Eliminated Member Status)

341
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,540
I got rid of two.

342
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,910
I should get rid of Jong Kook.

343
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,650
(Without knowing the elimination, Haha is busy looking for the box.)

344
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,550
What?

345
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,150
(He found a box hidden under the desk!)

346
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,990
What?

347
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,260
Why? Did you find it?

348
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,390
It's mine, right?

349
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,960
Why? Did you find it? It's mine, right?

350
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,660
(Jee-rasoni shows up at the moment.)

351
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,030
- I found two. - Let me see.

352
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,260
There are two.

353
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,530
This is crazy.

354
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,870
What? What are you doing?

355
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,370
(Attacking right away)

356
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,300
Why are you being like this?

357
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,070
What? What are you doing?

358
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,040
Why are you being like this?

359
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,040
(At this moment, Haha instinctively grabs Seok Jin's back.)

360
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,710
What?

361
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,210
(If Seok Jin's name tag is torn off, the mission fails.)

362
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,410
What?

363
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,850
(Seok Jin grabs Haha's name tag as well!)

364
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,550
What?

365
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,220
(Ripping off)

366
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,560
(Haha is out.)

367
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,890
What just happened?

368
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,520
- What is it? - Quiet.

369
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,130
(He ripped off Haha's name tag after a fierce struggle.)

370
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,260
Gosh, that was so close.

371
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,690
- Gosh, it hurts. - I'm sorry. Are you all right?

372
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,700
My wrist...

373
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,830
Is there a spy?

374
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,530
(Stay quiet.)

375
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,300
I thought you had my name tag.

376
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,600
- Why? - You're fast, indeed.

377
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,800
What is going on?

378
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,640
- Are you all right? - I'm okay.

379
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,740
What's going on?

380
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,940
Today is my day.

381
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,580
What is he talking about all of a sudden?

382
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,310
- Haha, please go to the prison. - Me?

383
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,550
- Yes. Please move. - Am I out?

384
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,720
My goodness.

385
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,090
(He's already eliminated half of the 6 members.)

386
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,950
Jong Kook.

387
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,860
(Full of confidence)

388
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,060
I have Jong Kook and Jae Seok left.

389
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,790
Why is he being a spy all of a sudden?

390
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,460
This is so unfair.

391
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,800
(The fast one suddenly bursts into laughter?)

392
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,100
Someone's here.

393
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,940
(Se Chan and Ye Eun are already in prison.)

394
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,970
- I... - How was it, Haha?

395
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,480
How miserably did you get your name tag ripped off?

396
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,540
It wasn't miserable.

397
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,010
- I went after hearing from you. - Yes.

398
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,780
- So, I found the box. - Okay.

399
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,820
I said, "It's here!"

400
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,980
And he went, "What is it?"

401
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,150
But his hands were up already.

402
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,990
(To take the name tag)

403
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,450
"What is it?"

404
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,860
When he grabbed me, I tried to fight back a little.

405
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,360
He's overwhelmed with thoughts that he's the protagonist today.

406
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,230
- He's really proud now. - Really?

407
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,030
(Did the members know Seok Jin would rip off their name tags?)

408
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,730
- Hello. - Hello.

409
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,370
(It was 1 hour before the Name Tag Elimination.)

410
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,800
- Today... - Hello.

411
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,170
- Okay. - Hi.

412
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,370
- This is nice. - Yes.

413
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,670
- Why isn't Seok Sam here? - Right.

414
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,140
Are we throwing his 60th birthday party today?

415
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,010
(The members, except Seok Sam, all gathered around.)

416
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,570
- What? - Is he the star of the party?

417
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,040
Do you remember the episode in Tongyeong...

418
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,840
where Jee Seok Jin got his name tag ripped off?

419
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,110
- Yes. - I remember.

420
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,780
We've prepared a hidden mission...

421
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,020
- to help Jee Seok Jin regain... - Today?

422
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,520
- his confidence. - No!

423
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,790
(The members were told about Seok Jin's hidden mission first.)

424
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,920
No!

425
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,420
"You think you can beat me?" That's what it is.

426
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,890
- I want to watch it. - I should've worn the cardigan.

427
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,860
I laughed so hard watching it.

428
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,860
So, we will give you a fake mission...

429
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,560
where you should find your box.

430
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,500
Then, Seok Jin will be given a hidden mission...

431
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,940
where he must rip off the name tags of all the members...

432
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,940
(It was a prank for Jee-rasoni, who was discouraged.)

433
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,100
- and eliminate them. - I see.

434
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,810
- We haven't done it in a while. - It's been a long time.

435
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,870
We should act well.

436
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,840
- It won't be easy. - If Seok Jin doesn't realize...

437
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,750
that this is a prank until the end,

438
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,850
the two members whose name tags are removed last...

439
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,180
will receive a benefit.

440
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,090
- We should try to last longer. - We need to hold out.

441
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,960
If Seok Jin notices this before everyone is eliminated...

442
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,460
and says something like,

443
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,860
"Is this a prank?"

444
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,160
Then, only Seok Jin will receive a benefit.

445
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,330
(If Seok Jin mentions "prank", then he will get the benefit.)

446
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,300
I don't think he will notice it.

447
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:19,240
(They will need to fool him, so that he doesn't get suspicious.)

448
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,430
- We should act well, then. - We should act well.

449
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,070
Some of us will have to make sacrifices.

450
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,140
We need sacrifices.

451
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,640
We should respond well.

452
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,010
To make it look real, after the tussle...

453
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,070
"Wait. It hurts."

454
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,940
(Pretending to be hurt)

455
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,340
We should do this.

456
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,010
- You know what I mean? - Exactly. We'd need that.

457
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,040
"What?"

458
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,910
(Terrible acting)

459
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,780
"Are you a spy?"

460
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,350
- Darn it! - What?

461
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,580
The word "spy" is...

462
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,820
That's really...

463
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,990
- Okay. I'll do this. - He always ruins things.

464
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,190
I'll say this.

465
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,390
This is crazy.

466
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,420
What? What are you doing?

467
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,230
(After fighting back a little to make things dramatic,)

468
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,120
Why are you being like this?

469
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,560
Gosh, that was so close.

470
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,930
(he pretends that his wrist hurts.)

471
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,830
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

472
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,600
My wrist... Is there a spy?

473
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,230
(He perfectly delivered his prepared lines.)

474
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,470
Se Chan, you're out.

475
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,670
Really?

476
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,770
Seok Jin looked so happy.

477
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,670
(He feels pity for him.)

478
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,710
(Ye Eun, who was about to be eliminated)

479
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,010
- Chungju. Cross. - Ji and Jee. Cross.

480
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,210
It's in this room, right?

481
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,450
(Giggling)

482
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,620
(She couldn't hold back her laughter.)

483
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,850
It's not here.

484
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,150
Gosh, his face...

485
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,120
(Seok Jin)

486
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,750
His face shows everything.

487
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:13,890
(They struggle to hold back laughter every time they face Seok Jin.)

488
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,920
Now, Seok Jin is...

489
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,830
On his way down, his face flushed with excitement.

490
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,990
(What do we do with him?)

491
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,130
As if he accomplished something.

492
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,070
(Spy Jee is still flushed with excitement.)

493
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,870
This isn't easy.

494
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,740
We have three survivors now.

495
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,800
- Really? - Really?

496
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,400
Once one more member loses their name tag,

497
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,510
(If they hold out like this, the final 2 will receive a benefit.)

498
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,440
the remaining two will receive a benefit.

499
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,610
Okay.

500
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,310
- I almost got mine ripped off. - And?

501
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,310
(But...)

502
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,780
He kept following me around.

503
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,720
- He did? - "Seok Jin, where was it?"

504
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,880
(He shares his story about his bad acting.)

505
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,420
He said he saw my box. So I asked, "Which floor?"

506
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,550
"The second floor!"

507
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:45,090
(The pranksters think that immersed Jee-rasoni is hilarious.)

508
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,990
And he kept following me around.

509
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,390
I was like, "Why is he following me?"

510
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,320
(Pattering)

511
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,230
Where is it?

512
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,630
He's coming.

513
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,200
Where is it?

514
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,870
(The two disperse quickly at the sound of Seok Jin's footsteps.)

515
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,300
- By the way... - Did you not find it?

516
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,240
Where on the upper floor is it?

517
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,270
- On the upper floor... - Where is mine?

518
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,140
(Pretending to have just arrived)

519
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,170
He lied mine was on the second floor.

520
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,970
I said yours was on the upper floor.

521
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,050
(Stifling a laugh)

522
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,080
What about mine?

523
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,710
Yours is on the lower floor.

524
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,750
Where on the lower floor? You said it was on the second floor.

525
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,780
(The two play along so that Seok Jin wouldn't get suspicious.)

526
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,620
Just tell me which floor it is.

527
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,750
- By the way... Hey. - Yes?

528
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,980
- The upper floor. - By the way,

529
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,220
I don't see...

530
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,550
the other members.

531
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,090
I know. Where's everyone?

532
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,290
I don't see the other members.

533
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,690
I know. Where's everyone?

534
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,030
(Avoiding)

535
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,130
- What? - Seok Jin.

536
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,760
- What? - Where's mine? You saw it.

537
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,630
(Intense acting)

538
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,430
It's on the lower floor. And yours is on the upper floor.

539
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,630
- But where's everyone? - I know.

540
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,970
Where are they?

541
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,870
(Chuckling)

542
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,170
(A laugh slips out due to the terrible acting.)

543
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,900
- Seok Jin, you... - What?

544
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,210
(They will fail instantly if Seok Jin notices.)

545
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,740
Why are you laughing?

546
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,010
It's just funny.

547
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,810
(The two fools can't control their expressions.)

548
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,780
- What's funny? - What's funny?

549
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,350
- What's funny? - What's funny?

550
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,680
- Your hair looks nice today. - Really?

551
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,950
(Saying something off-topic)

552
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,920
- Why is that? - What's with you?

553
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,720
(What is going on?)

554
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,920
- What do you mean? - I like your hairstyle.

555
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,990
Is it on the fifth floor?

556
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,160
Is mine on the second floor or not?

557
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
- Seriously... - I think he's lying.

558
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,030
To keep me on the second floor.

559
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,830
(They run away before they burst out laughing.)

560
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,390
Hang on. We should hurry.

561
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,530
Hang on. We should hurry.

562
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,760
Gosh, they are...

563
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,200
I think mine is on the fifth floor.

564
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,570
Something feels off.

565
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,000
(Feeling off)

566
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,300
My gosh.

567
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,440
He said mine was on the lower floor, right?

568
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,040
Why are they...

569
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,940
- Why are they smiling? - Where is everyone?

570
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,310
(Seok Jin starts to get suspicious?)

571
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,610
I have to rip their name tags off quickly.

572
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,750
Why are these two...

573
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,650
(If Seok Jin realizes it's a prank, he wins.)

574
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,620
Why are they sticking together?

575
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,490
I'm trying to separate them,

576
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,390
but they are not moving separately.

577
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,760
I should separate them...

578
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,130
to have the final showdown.

579
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,070
Anyway, I have to rip off their name tags...

580
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,800
(All Jee-rasoni can think about is the name tags.)

581
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,230
as soon as possible.

582
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,540
I'm facing...

583
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,070
a crisis now.

584
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,570
I can get rid of Ji Hyo easily.

585
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,240
(He doesn't seem to think this is a prank.)

586
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,910
Three members are remaining.

587
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,810
Gosh, I just can't find it.

588
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,250
Can I rip this off?

589
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,480
Can I rip this off?

590
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,680
(Yu Jae Seok)

591
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,990
(He talks nonsense under the excessive mental pressure.)

592
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,250
This isn't easy, everyone.

593
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,720
Please support me.

594
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,050
(Is he doing a live show?)

595
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,390
Please support me.

596
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,830
Hey, Ji Hyo's box...

597
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,560
(He heard Ji Hyo's voice.)

598
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,060
Is this Ji Hyo's box?

599
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,970
Seok Jin...

600
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,100
(Pretending to be surprised)

601
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,230
- Where's everyone? Where's Haha? - I know.

602
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,100
I think we're being eliminated 1 by 1.

603
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,240
(Actress Song gets to do her real job.)

604
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,370
- I think there's someone else. - Haha and...

605
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,070
- Haha. - I don't see Se Chan and Ye Eun.

606
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,470
(Actor Jee goes even further.)

607
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,770
Se Chan, Ye Eun.

608
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,640
What?

609
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,810
(Chuckling)

610
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,310
(She fails to hold back laughter.)

611
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,510
Your eyes say that you're lying.

612
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,710
Right?

613
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,390
(Even when she laughs openly, Seok Sam has no idea.)

614
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,620
- Was it you? - Yes. It was me.

615
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,250
(Proud)

616
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,120
(Breathing out)

617
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,290
Now, I have Jong Kook and Jae Seok left.

618
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,160
Wish me good luck.

619
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,230
(Overly immersed)

620
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,560
(Hiding her laughter with a cry)

621
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,600
Jee Seok Jin!

622
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,400
He's really...

623
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,070
(There are only two left.)

624
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,430
He kept following me around.

625
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,470
(If Seok Jin doesn't notice, Jae Seok and Jong Kook win.)

626
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,140
- He kept... - He's a terrible actor.

627
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,240
He can't act.

628
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,240
(Well...)

629
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,940
The thing is,

630
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,910
it seemed like...

631
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,050
Jong Kook was waiting for me.

632
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,080
I can tell by his expression.

633
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,350
And he was alone in the room.

634
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,390
He was staying alone.

635
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,620
My legs hurt so much.

636
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,690
(Like a predator waiting for its prey)

637
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,730
(Smiling)

638
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,160
Why is he sitting there?

639
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,900
(Frightened)

640
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,130
- Your hair looks nice today. - Really?

641
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,800
(He even complimented his hair, which doesn't happen a lot.)

642
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,170
I like your hairstyle.

643
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,610
(The herbivore's instinct senses a danger.)

644
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,010
It's a little...

645
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,480
It's strange.

646
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,980
(When doubts begin to sprout)

647
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,020
- Where is it? Seok Jin. - Hey.

648
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,280
- Jong Kook. - What's happening?

649
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,050
- I don't see the other members. - Hey.

650
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,250
- Jong Kook. - What's happening?

651
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,420
(Seok Jin confronts Jong Kook.)

652
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,960
- I don't see the other members. - Hey.

653
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,290
- Listen. - Yes.

654
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,290
(Adding a story)

655
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,490
- A masked guy is running around. - Really?

656
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,760
- Yes. - Did you see it?

657
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,500
- I saw him running around. - I knew it. It's strange.

658
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,460
The other members are gone.

659
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,400
- Maybe he's ripping off. - Why did Jae Seok leave it here?

660
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,370
(He plainly shows his back.)

661
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,870
What are you doing, Seok Jin?

662
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,070
Seok Jin!

663
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,440
(Ripping off)

664
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,740
(He pretends to panic at the surprise attack.)

665
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,380
I can't believe this...

666
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,680
(Feeling proud internally)

667
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,510
What?

668
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,680
Someone's here.

669
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,420
(Jee-rasoni successfully tore off Jong Kook's name tag.)

670
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,980
What?

671
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,250
That was natural, wasn't it?

672
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,520
(Proud)

673
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,590
It was no joke.

674
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,490
(If he rips off one more name tag, the race is over.)

675
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,790
Someone's here.

676
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,930
My goodness.

677
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,600
It feels like he kind of let me rip it off.

678
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,600
It feels like he kind of let me rip it off.

679
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,540
Why did Jae Seok leave it here?

680
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,270
What are you doing, Seok Jin?

681
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,500
Seok Jin!

682
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,340
(He gets more suspicious as Jong Kook lets him get his way.)

683
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,740
I can't believe this...

684
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,020
(Now, only Jae Seok is remaining.)

685
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,110
What is going on?

686
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,680
Jong Kook.

687
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,820
Hey.

688
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,890
(The two finally face each other.)

689
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,550
Someone is running around.

690
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,590
Someone is running around.

691
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,290
Is he here?

692
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,230
(If Seok Jin notices this is a prank, he wins.)

693
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,860
A masked guy is running around here.

694
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,130
That's what I thought.

695
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,360
(Jae Seok will win if he doesn't notice until the end.)

696
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,900
Something's going on.

697
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,770
Wait, has Jong Kook been eliminated?

698
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,070
I don't think so.

699
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,610
(He has to play it naturally so that Seok Jin doesn't get suspicious.)

700
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,640
I had a feeling something was up.

701
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
- I... - Yes?

702
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,510
I haven't seen the others in a while now.

703
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,510
I see.

704
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,910
Where exactly did you see my box?

705
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,210
(Eyeing carefully)

706
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,340
Where exactly did you see my box?

707
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,610
Do you know something?

708
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,680
Do you know something?

709
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,850
(Flustered)

710
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,250
Know what?

711
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,490
Why does your mouth keep twitching?

712
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,690
(Chuckling)

713
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,060
(Changing the subject)

714
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,760
Seok Jin, why have you been...

715
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,320
Is something going on that I don't know about?

716
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,860
Why are you giggling?

717
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,390
This is funny, that's why.

718
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,030
(His suspicion grows.)

719
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,160
Do you know why I find this odd?

720
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,300
I can't find my box anywhere.

721
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,970
Are you guys playing me?

722
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,170
- Playing you? - Yes.

723
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,610
How?

724
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,940
Well...

725
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,350
(Touching)

726
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,380
You could be playing me.

727
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,010
Well...

728
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,680
(Is he on to us?)

729
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,820
You could be playing me.

730
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,650
- What are you talking about? - I got here last today.

731
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,520
Did you meet up beforehand...

732
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,960
Did you meet up beforehand...

733
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,960
(Frozen)

734
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,360
for something else?

735
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,730
- For what? - What?

736
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,630
(Hesitant)

737
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,430
We were told to start in different locations today.

738
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,970
- That's all, right? - Of course.

739
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,440
(Victory for the prank is just moments away...)

740
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,470
What are you going on about?

741
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,310
Are you...

742
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,540
(Jee-rasoni is suddenly smarter.)

743
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,740
Something just doesn't feel right.

744
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,210
I haven't seen the others in a while.

745
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,910
(Just then)

746
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,950
What...

747
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,780
(Seok Jin lunges at Jae Seok!)

748
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,320
What on earth?

749
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,720
The race is over. Please gather.

750
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,490
- At first... - I...

751
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,590
(The members gathered to hear the results.)

752
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,260
- He's the first one I saw. - Seok Jin!

753
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,360
- This is so unfair. - Seok Jin!

754
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,030
- How could you do this? - This is insane.

755
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,130
- It happened so fast. - Come on!

756
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,460
(The result is announced.)

757
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,800
- Did he win? - The preliminary mission is over,

758
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,200
(Did Seok Sam catch on to the prank?)

759
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,160
- and here's the result. - Did you know?

760
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,630
- Did you know? - Here's the result.

761
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,070
(Or did he remove Jae Seok's name tag, completely unaware?)

762
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,900
- Seok Jin wins. - Yes!

763
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,870
I haven't seen the others in a while now.

764
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,940
(During the final stand-off)

765
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,010
I see.

766
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,510
Where exactly did you see my box?

767
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,380
- Do you know something? - Know what?

768
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,850
(He saw through Jae Seok's poor acting.)

769
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,080
Why does your mouth keep twitching?

770
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,980
(Busted)

771
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,520
(In the end...)

772
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,220
Is this some kind of prank?

773
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,860
Is this some kind of prank?

774
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,590
Is this some kind of prank?

775
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,700
(Seok Sam caught on and said it out loud.)

776
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,200
What prank?

777
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,670
(Their poor acting led to Seok Sam's victory.)

778
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,400
That was close.

779
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,630
I get it now. Did I have to say it out loud...

780
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,070
- to win? - Exactly.

781
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,270
Yes, that's it.

782
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,410
I still didn't suspect anything...

783
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,510
- after I took out Haha. - You didn't.

784
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,640
It started to seem weird when you two...

785
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,480
- came up to me together. - You didn't.

786
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,240
I needed to separate you, so I said...

787
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,310
(The moment he met Jong Kook and Jae Seok)

788
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,580
- Of course. - one was upstairs...

789
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,880
- and the other was downstairs. - Right.

790
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,720
That's what I was aiming for, but the corners of their mouths...

791
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,750
- kept lifting. - Come on, guys!

792
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,190
- Come on, guys! - Seriously?

793
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,820
(These two are the main culprits.)

794
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,390
- They kept trying not to smile. - Hear me out.

795
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,890
- Jae Seok... - I can't believe you two!

796
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,320
(The moment they couldn't hold in their laughter)

797
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,160
- Hold on. - It's Jae Seok's fault.

798
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,890
- They kept trying not to smile. - Seok Jin...

799
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,160
Seok Jin was like this.

800
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,660
(Panting)

801
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,900
- He was excited. - He was flushing.

802
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,470
(Embarrassed)

803
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,630
- I couldn't keep a straight face. - Come on!

804
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,930
I asked him what was going on,

805
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,140
and he said a masked man...

806
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,900
- was among us. - That's what he told me too.

807
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:50,940
(Exaggerated facial expressions and suddenly adding a character)

808
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,470
We stood no chance.

809
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,940
- We couldn't help it. - His reactions are too funny.

810
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,450
- He's hilarious. - He came up to us all flushed.

811
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,880
(An encore performance)

812
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,520
- He was playing the main character. - Seok Jin.

813
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,080
I bet it felt great to eliminate me.

814
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,480
(But...)

815
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
- What? - When you eliminated me.

816
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,520
- With you... - He said this.

817
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,220
I sighed in pain after he eliminated me,

818
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,690
and he said this with the tone of a victor.

819
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,690
"Is your hand okay?"

820
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,830
"Is your hand okay?"

821
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,760
- That was close. - My gosh.

822
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,300
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

823
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,760
- Then he turned around. - That's because...

824
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,170
- Haha... - His name tag was all crumpled.

825
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,170
- I played it well. - That's because Haha and I...

826
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,170
(Seok Sam was briefly the main character of a noir film.)

827
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,570
- wrestled for a bit. - Did you?

828
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,270
- We went at it. - But you overpowered him?

829
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
I thought...

830
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,280
- I was 0.1 seconds faster. - Of course.

831
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,480
Haha saw right through you.

832
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,350
- Haha... - I held on to yours and waited.

833
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,580
- He let you have some fun. - I waited.

834
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,280
(On purpose)

835
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,810
I tugged on it so that you'd hear the Velcro.

836
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,020
He played along.

837
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,020
- Since Seok Jin won... - That's hilarious.

838
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,590
(Anyway, since Seok Sam won the preliminary mission,)

839
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,090
the preliminary mission,

840
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,120
he'll soon receive a benefit...

841
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,320
(he is granted a benefit for today's main mission.)

842
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,260
- for today's main race. - He earned it.

843
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,590
- Lucky you. - Yes!

844
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,630
How about he goes up against Se Chan...

845
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,730
- as a bonus round? - Yes, go for it.

846
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,760
- Why don't we do it for real? - Do it for real.

847
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,160
- Yes, do it for real. - Give it your best.

848
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,430
- Go for it. - Sure.

849
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,670
I'm sure you practiced.

850
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,440
(A side match begins, with nothing but pride on the line.)

851
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,770
- That's not it. - Here.

852
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,600
- You probably think you'll beat me. - How hard should I go?

853
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,870
You probably think you'll beat me.

854
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,040
(It's Seok Sam's chance to show off his true skills.)

855
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,040
- Do it for real. - Should we give it a try?

856
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,140
At full force?

857
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,580
- Yes, at full force. - It's like this.

858
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,080
- Think of it like this. - Sure.

859
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,550
We're the final two.

860
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:05,420
(Situation setup: Only two of them are left, at the brink of victory.)

861
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,780
- You need to do well. - Go ahead.

862
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,080
We're the only ones left.

863
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,320
- I... - It's just between you and me.

864
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,150
Se Chan, you don't have a lot of experience with this game.

865
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,420
(Ripping off the name tag)

866
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,720
I don't. I haven't really done it that much.

867
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,860
Physically, you're pretty similar.

868
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,490
Our physiques are similar. We even weigh the same.

869
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,490
There's an age difference, but still.

870
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,730
(Welterweight match, Monkfish versus Jee-rasoni)

871
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,330
- Right. - Seok Jin could do more push-ups.

872
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,600
- Seok Jin's arms are pretty thick. - Hold on.

873
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,500
(Your sleeves)

874
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,530
Should I roll down my sleeves? I'll match whatever you're doing.

875
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,600
Should I roll it up or down?

876
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,630
Do whatever you want, you punk.

877
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,340
- He's showing confidence. - No way.

878
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,540
- Seok Jin, I'll go full force. - He's setting the tone.

879
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,070
Se Chan's clenching his teeth.

880
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,310
(It's a big match no one asked them to do.)

881
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,140
- Look at him. There. - Goodness.

882
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,810
- Are we allowed to use this wall? - Wait.

883
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,180
- I don't have to answer that. - Come over here.

884
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,350
Why? We used to do this a lot.

885
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,010
- Of course. - Come to where the camera is.

886
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,110
I can't...

887
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,450
(Se Chan pays tribute to Seok Jin's legendary line.)

888
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,150
- Come over here. - Why?

889
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,650
- I'm copying you. Come this way. - Nice.

890
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,790
- This is great. - We need to be on camera.

891
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,120
Things are getting intense today.

892
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,520
(Jumping)

893
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,360
- Look at him jump. - Seok Jin is...

894
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,560
- in much better shape these days. - Look out behind you.

895
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,100
(He even tosses his glasses.)

896
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,190
- Even his glasses. - He took off his glasses.

897
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,530
- No way. - This is so cool.

898
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,230
(Wiping)

899
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,760
Okay, good.

900
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,530
(He starts by wiping his eye gunk on him.)

901
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,270
Se Chan, let's do this. Se Chan...

902
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,700
(Just then)

903
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,200
My gosh.

904
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,010
(Jee-rasoni attacks first, grabbing Se Chan's collar.)

905
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,370
- Their arms are locked. - You need to push through.

906
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,810
(Se Chan fights back, forcing Seok Jin into a corner.)

907
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,380
Hold on.

908
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,040
- Look. - No way. It's a technique.

909
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,750
(Seok Sam removes his arm.)

910
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,910
Is this necessary?

911
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,780
- That's what you have to do. - Really?

912
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,320
(Fighting back by removing his arm from the sleeve)

913
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,450
- Careful. - Look at that technique.

914
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,580
It's a technique.

915
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,450
(Squashing)

916
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,150
A technique only we know.

917
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,950
(Hitting)

918
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,020
A technique only we know.

919
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,760
- I think it's already over. - Isn't it over?

920
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,820
- Oh, no. - A technique only we know.

921
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,460
(Se Chan shows no mercy,)

922
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,030
A technique only we know.

923
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,300
(and Seok Jin is helpless.)

924
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,970
- What on earth am I seeing? - What...

925
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,530
(Tearing off)

926
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,070
How could you...

927
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,370
What on earth am I seeing?

928
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,240
(Seok Jin loses.)

929
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
How could you take off his sweater?

930
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,880
You promised to go easy on him.

931
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,880
How could you take off his sweater?

932
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,610
(You jerk!)

933
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,450
You promised to go easy on him.

934
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,980
You promised to go easy on him!

935
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,680
(Se Chan wins mercilessly.)

936
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,420
- I couldn't help it. - You promised to go easy on him.

937
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,690
- You promised to go easy on him. - I couldn't just lose to him.

938
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,620
(Feeling around)

939
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,930
- I wasn't in a position to... - You promised to go easy on him.

940
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,860
- I couldn't help it. - I can't believe you.

941
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:59,000
(Standing alone)

942
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,800
How could I lose to him at that point?

943
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,900
You jerk, you promised to let him win!

944
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,470
(Unfreezing him)

945
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,970
- How could I at that point? - You...

946
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,630
- You. - You jerk.

947
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,640
(The ruthless world of competition)

948
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,770
- But... - Se Chan, come on.

949
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,440
- We were going to boost his energy. - How could you?

950
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,840
- That was part of the prank. - Hey!

951
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,670
(You should have lost.)

952
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,270
- I can't believe you. - You had to let him win.

953
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,040
- Se Chan, come on. - It was your sweater.

954
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,080
- My sweater... - It was your sweater.

955
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,080
- It's just that... - I couldn't help it.

956
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,110
- Seok Jin, ask... - It's not that.

957
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,410
Ask for a rematch some other time.

958
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,950
(Coach Yu pulls him back.)

959
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,280
A rematch?

960
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,780
- That's not it. - A rematch?

961
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,820
- Do you want a rematch? - Some other time.

962
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,820
- That's not it. - Seok Jin...

963
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,150
You shouldn't grab your opponent's hand like that.

964
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,960
(Pathetic)

965
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,890
- Why not? That's perfectly fine. - How about a rematch then?

966
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,960
Let's go again.

967
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,190
- A rematch. - That's allowed, Seok Jin.

968
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,260
You're not supposed to grab...

969
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,030
(A surge of rage)

970
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,360
- Seok Jin. - your opponent's hand like that.

971
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,230
- Ask for a rematch some other time. - That's allowed!

972
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,200
(He puts the name tag back on.)

973
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,260
- We've all been doing that. - Hold on.

974
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,470
- You jerk. - Why did you take his sweater off?

975
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,400
- That's what we all did. - Put on your satchel.

976
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,940
Show him that you're done for the day.

977
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,370
- Come on. - Show him you're done for today.

978
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,540
Stick my name tag back on.

979
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,140
- This is Jong Kook's. - Yours is already back on.

980
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,670
(The name tag)

981
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,040
- This is Jong Kook's. - Yours is already back on.

982
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,510
(Seok Sam is all over the place.)

983
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,310
Yours is already back on!

984
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,580
Stick it back on.

985
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,650
(Severe aftereffects of defeat)

986
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,080
- Why you little... - Oh, no.

987
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,250
- This breaks my heart. - Seok Jin, not today.

988
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,020
- No, hold on. - Take a rain check on the rematch.

989
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,520
- Not today. - I should've gone...

990
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,120
(Still going on)

991
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,450
straight at you. Seriously.

992
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,760
- That match wasn't the real deal. - I mean it.

993
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,560
(Defending him)

994
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,190
- Right? - It wasn't the real deal.

995
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,260
That match didn't count.

996
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,930
(The bonus round only left him wounded.)

997
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,260
- Anyway, Seok Jin won the mission. - Okay.

998
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:10,300
(The preliminary mission was clearly Seok Sam's victory.)

999
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,800
- Yes, Seok Jin is the winner... - Okay.

1000
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,130
- of the preliminary mission. - Yes.

1001
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,700
It's now time for the main race.

1002
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,970
(Before the main mission is revealed)

1003
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,370
- Here are the badges you'll need. - What?

1004
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,370
- What are they? - There are badges?

1005
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,270
- What are they? - The number of badges you get...

1006
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,480
will vary.

1007
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,710
- Thank you. - Nice.

1008
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,980
- Thanks. - Why does it vary?

1009
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,650
- These badges are cute. - They really are.

1010
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,520
(Inside boxes labeled with their names...)

1011
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,250
- I can't tell. - These badges are cute.

1012
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:31,020
(There are badges of different designs inside.)

1013
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,350
They really are.

1014
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,850
Can we see how many badges everyone has?

1015
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,920
Yes, inside the box,

1016
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,120
- you'll see badges... - I have nine.

1017
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,660
showing the prizes you won...

1018
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,760
throughout 2025.

1019
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,830
- Really? - Really?

1020
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,960
You'll see badges showing the prizes you won.

1021
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,960
(The prizes they won?)

1022
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,170
- Really? - Nice.

1023
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,500
These are cute.

1024
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,240
A Cheomseongdae Observatory toy...

1025
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,540
(What the race winners received)

1026
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,270
- and souvenirs from Gyeongju. - Lucky you.

1027
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,340
- That's nice. - This is nice.

1028
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,740
(From the Cheomseongdae Observatory toy...)

1029
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,880
Today's prize is an assortment of fruit.

1030
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,680
(to an assortment of fruits)

1031
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,810
The prize goes to Haha.

1032
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,180
- Yes! - I can't believe it!

1033
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:01,820
(The various prizes the members won throughout the year)

1034
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,420
- The prize is Se Chan's. - No way.

1035
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,920
Ye Eun wins them all.

1036
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,390
I wasn't expecting that.

1037
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:07,460
(They were turned into badges.)

1038
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,990
Onnuri gift certificates, a buffet voucher...

1039
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,130
(Jae Seok received 9 prizes this year.)

1040
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,890
- As for me... - One.

1041
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,590
- Two. - Is this a prize I got?

1042
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,830
(He got 9 badges.)

1043
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,230
- Yes. - I have nine.

1044
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,530
- Nice. - I have six.

1045
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,870
(Haha got 6 badges.)

1046
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,970
- These are adorable. - How many do you have?

1047
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,340
(Ye Eun got 8 badges.)

1048
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,170
I have six.

1049
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,240
Nine, ten...

1050
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,170
(Jong Kook got 11 badges.)

1051
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,470
- I have 11. - All right.

1052
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:27,280
(Se Chan got 11 badges.)

1053
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,110
Why do I have this many?

1054
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,910
- I have nine. - You must have won a lot.

1055
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,580
- No way. - I have 11.

1056
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,880
- All right. The members... - A camera?

1057
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,150
(Current Badge Count)

1058
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,010
- who received... - What's this?

1059
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,150
- the most prizes... - I have 11.

1060
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,780
(Se Chan and Jong Kook: 11, Ji Hyo and Jae Seok: 9)

1061
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,420
- are Jong Kook and Se Chan. - What?

1062
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,450
Really?

1063
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,290
(Ye Eun: 8, Seok Jin: 7)

1064
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,990
Haha received the fewest prizes.

1065
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,820
(Haha: 6)

1066
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,860
- This year, Haha... - I got a lot of penalties...

1067
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,790
- in 2025. - Especially in 2025.

1068
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,190
It was insane.

1069
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,630
- You just weren't good enough. - Exactly.

1070
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,060
- Haha... - How about a 1-on-1?

1071
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,670
- That's mine. - How about a bonus round?

1072
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,570
(They now habitually challenge each other.)

1073
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,840
- How about a 1-on-1? - What do you say?

1074
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,270
How about a 1-on-1?

1075
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,640
- Go ahead. - You think you'll win, don't you?

1076
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,670
(It's a catchphrase.)

1077
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,840
"You think you'll win, don't you?"

1078
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,540
- Yes, I do. - You can't possibly beat me.

1079
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,580
- Come here. - Before you know it,

1080
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,110
(Stifling a laugh)

1081
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,180
it's already the final race...

1082
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,510
- of the year. - Right.

1083
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,180
Today's race is...

1084
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,680
Year-end Tax Settlement by Getting Rid of Prizes.

1085
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,650
- I wonder what that is. - We need to get rid of them.

1086
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,390
Office workers in Korea...

1087
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,390
file their taxes at the end of the year.

1088
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,390
- Of course. - That's right.

1089
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,460
- You'll also have to pay taxes... - Taxes?

1090
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,760
on the prizes you won in 2025.

1091
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,030
- Come on. - What?

1092
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,800
- Why do we have to pay taxes? - The badges you received...

1093
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,570
- count as your taxes. - Are we getting rid of these?

1094
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,870
count as your taxes.

1095
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,300
- Are we getting rid of these? - So get rid of them all?

1096
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,240
- Is it better to have less? - We need to give these away!

1097
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,840
- I see. - In today's race,

1098
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,110
your goal is to get rid of as many badges as possible.

1099
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,380
- We need to get rid of them. - We need to get rid of them.

1100
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,650
Haha has the advantage!

1101
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,120
(He currently has the fewest badges.)

1102
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,950
- I get it. - The member with...

1103
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,650
the most remaining badges...

1104
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,820
will receive a penalty,

1105
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,420
(Penalty confirmed)

1106
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,020
the member with the fewest...

1107
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,720
- will be exempt, - Goodness.

1108
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,430
(Penalty exempted)

1109
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,260
and everyone else will receive penalty balls...

1110
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,830
equal to their remaining badges.

1111
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,060
(Pick 1 person from the penalty balls that are put in.)

1112
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,400
The person whose ball is picked will be penalized.

1113
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Oh, okay.

1114
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,130
- That's the rule. - I see.

1115
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,540
- Seok Jin, you won a benefit. - Yes.

1116
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,440
(The benefit for Seok Sam, the winner of the preliminary mission)

1117
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,810
Because Seok Jin won the preliminary mission,

1118
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,440
he is now allowed to give one person...

1119
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,780
- one of his badges. - I see.

1120
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,480
Give one person one of his badges.

1121
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,480
(Se Chan winces.)

1122
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,980
It has nothing to do with the item's price, right?

1123
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,750
No. It's just about the number of badges.

1124
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,150
(Hiding)

1125
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,220
- It's just about the number? - Yes.

1126
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,690
- Seok Jin... - I didn't think you'd do that.

1127
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,160
(Making it clear they're on different sides)

1128
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
No?

1129
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,090
- I see. - Okay. Who is it?

1130
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,030
(Who will Seok Sam give it to?)

1131
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,400
Okay. Who is it?

1132
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,830
- It's all about the average. - Here you go.

1133
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,930
(He chooses Se Chan without a second thought.)

1134
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,770
Are you sulking because of what I did?

1135
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,300
- I'm not. - It's just the rules, right?

1136
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,300
Yes, of course.

1137
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,900
- Hey, come on. - The more you have, the better.

1138
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,910
(The more badges you have, the better.)

1139
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,340
- Yes. - Seok Jin's not like that.

1140
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,310
- He's not. - He isn't.

1141
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,880
- Is that what you take me for? - No.

1142
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,040
(Upset)

1143
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
He seemed upset.

1144
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,980
(Seok Sam gave him the badge without any hard feelings.)

1145
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,180
- That makes no sense. - Thanks anyway.

1146
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,180
(The current badge count)

1147
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,810
Seok Jin gave a badge to Se Chan,

1148
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,520
so right now, Se Chan has the most and is in last place.

1149
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,920
(Se Chan is in last place alone.)

1150
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,590
I'm in first place.

1151
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:53,820
(Seok Jin and Haha are in 1st place.)

1152
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,620
Oh, it's joint first place.

1153
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,320
Now all of you get the chance...

1154
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,490
- to get rid of some of your badges. - Okay.

1155
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,390
(She reveals how to remove badges.)

1156
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,560
You'll take turns to visit the tax office.

1157
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,830
(They visit the tax office one by one.)

1158
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,800
- Visit the tax office. - Yes.

1159
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,570
You can pay between 1 to 5 badges,

1160
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,140
- however many you want. - That's great.

1161
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,710
- However, if you hand over... - Really?

1162
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,310
the same number of badges as someone else,

1163
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,410
- you lose the Game of Wits. - Oh, dear.

1164
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,350
You get back the badges you paid.

1165
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,450
- Oh, no. - What?

1166
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,120
You get back the badges you paid.

1167
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,550
(They hand over between 1 and 5 badges.)

1168
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,320
(The number must not overlap.)

1169
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,650
This is fun.

1170
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,920
I'll pay five.

1171
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,560
- Is five the maximum? - Yes.

1172
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,720
I'll hand over five.

1173
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,660
I'll pay five, whatever the cost.

1174
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,230
- This is the last day. - This is tough.

1175
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,930
- I'll give up five. - This is tough.

1176
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,500
It's a Game of Wits.

1177
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,970
I think many of us will overlap.

1178
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,300
(There are 7 people and 5 choices.)

1179
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,530
You and I have lots of badges, so five...

1180
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,540
It's a Game of Wits?

1181
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,040
(They must choose well between 1 and 5.)

1182
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,740
We should assume that at least 2 or 3 people will overlap.

1183
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,410
- I must lose five. I have the most. - I'll pay five too.

1184
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,040
(Se Chan will hand over 5 badges because he has a lot.)

1185
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,950
I'll pay the max each time.

1186
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,150
I have to hand over five.

1187
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,120
(Jae Seok also says he will hand over 5 badges.)

1188
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,350
Always the maximum.

1189
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,280
Me too. I'll hand over five.

1190
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,780
Let's both do that and break even.

1191
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,020
(The Tigher Moth Sisters will also hand over 5 badges.)

1192
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,550
- I've decided. - We're bound to overlap.

1193
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,890
- Go to the tax office one by one. - Okay.

1194
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:02,160
(Haha enters the tax office first.)

1195
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,960
What will you do?

1196
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,920
Don't go with 5. I'll pay 5.

1197
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,930
Me too. You know me.

1198
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,230
(Haha, Seok Jin: 6 badges)

1199
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,860
Hello.

1200
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:10,800
(At 6, Haha has the least number of badges.)

1201
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,030
I feel good, but I don't feel good.

1202
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,170
I had an extra huge number of penalties this year.

1203
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,570
My road manager always made sure...

1204
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,810
(Complaining)

1205
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,540
to bring five extra pairs of underwear for me.

1206
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,180
But not today because the ending is always important.

1207
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,420
(Mumbling)

1208
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,180
A number between 1 and 5 that doesn't overlap.

1209
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,220
(He can hand over between 1 and 5 badges.)

1210
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,950
(His count stays the same if the number overlaps.)

1211
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,890
I'm currently in first place.

1212
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,160
Just preventing others from reducing their number of badges...

1213
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,690
- works for me. - Right.

1214
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,060
I'll do what will be advantageous for me.

1215
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,500
(He submits 5.)

1216
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,640
(Haha's strategy: Sabotage all who submit 5.)

1217
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,540
Anyone who gives five will overlap.

1218
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,910
(He has the upper hand anyway.)

1219
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,410
If no one does, I get the benefit.

1220
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,540
(If they get cold feet, it's his win.)

1221
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,940
That was cool.

1222
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,710
(Smug)

1223
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,950
I've decided.

1224
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,920
(Badge-rich Se Chan enters.)

1225
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,920
I'll hand over five.

1226
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,450
Everyone's on a high and agitated.

1227
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:07,390
(The game explodes if he hands over 5.)

1228
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,260
Ji Hyo insisted she'd hand over five badges.

1229
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,260
I need to get rid of some.

1230
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,200
Four? Okay, I'll go with four.

1231
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,770
(He goes off-course and chooses 4!)

1232
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,700
I'll go with four.

1233
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,670
I have no choice. I need to reduce my badge count.

1234
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,640
(They didn't overlap!)

1235
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,100
Thank you.

1236
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:27,310
(Ye Eun, another fan of the number 5 enters.)

1237
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,610
Me too. I'll hand over five.

1238
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:32,320
I will hand over two.

1239
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:36,320
(She said 5 and went with 2.)

1240
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,190
I'll go with a lower number.

1241
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,990
(All three so far haven't overlapped.)

1242
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,730
(Jong Kook, another rich man, enters.)

1243
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,130
Okay.

1244
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,130
I'll hand in three.

1245
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,700
- You have a lot of badges. - I have lots.

1246
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,940
(He chose an empty slot.)

1247
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,110
(Jong Kook's strategy: He has many but he bets safe.)

1248
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,810
- Here you go. Three. - Three badges. Thank you.

1249
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,040
(There's only 1 option left.)

1250
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,980
I going the maximum. Always the maximum.

1251
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,150
(Tiger Moth Jae Seok)

1252
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,390
I have a feeling there's one of each.

1253
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,420
Someone must've handed over four already.

1254
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,060
I'll go with...

1255
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,830
(Jae Seok has decided.)

1256
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,260
Yes. That's me.

1257
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,130
Hello. I'm here to pay my tax.

1258
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,500
(Ji Hyo also said she'd submit 5.)

1259
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,200
I have nine badges right now.

1260
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,140
I'll pay...

1261
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,840
(Ji Hyo has chosen.)

1262
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,110
(Seok Sam doesn't have many badges.)

1263
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,310
I think Jong Kook will go with one.

1264
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,850
I'll go with... Then I have four.

1265
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,480
(Everyone has made a choice.)

1266
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,950
Thanks. It's all down to luck.

1267
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,150
I wonder how it went.

1268
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,820
(The first settlement is done.)

1269
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,320
- Let's find out. - Do you think...

1270
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,130
(Who overlapped, and how many?)

1271
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,760
any of us won the Game of Wits?

1272
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,190
- We overlapped. - I bet we all overlapped.

1273
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,130
- We would. We're bound to. - We'll overlap.

1274
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,230
(The result is announced.)

1275
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:56,100
- The first payment is done. - Yes.

1276
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,030
- The result of the first payment. - Yes.

1277
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,340
- The overlapping number. - How many?

1278
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,580
- There will be a lot. - How many?

1279
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,210
The unlucky number is five...

1280
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,650
(5 is the unlucky number.)

1281
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,210
- What? - Five.

1282
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,010
The unlucky number is five...

1283
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,680
- And two. - Okay.

1284
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,450
(2 as well.)

1285
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,750
Five...

1286
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,350
(2 and 5 are unlucky.)

1287
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,050
and two.

1288
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,650
- Okay. - Two numbers?

1289
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,260
(Who chose 5?)

1290
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,190
Five.

1291
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,700
(Tiger Moth Jae Seok!)

1292
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,030
- Okay. - Yes. I'm...

1293
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,400
I'm going with five.

1294
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Five.

1295
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:32,700
(Ji Hyo also chose 5 and lost big.)

1296
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,600
I'm done.

1297
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,940
Did anyone choose one?

1298
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,040
I think Jong Kook will go with one.

1299
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,110
(Seok Jin considered 1 but went with 2.)

1300
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,350
I'll go with two. Then I have four. Two.

1301
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,450
- Two. - Shoot.

1302
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,520
(The survivors are...)

1303
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,050
- Two? - No three or four?

1304
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:54,560
(Jong Kook's 3 and Se Chan's 4.)

1305
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:51,920
No?

1306
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,960
- Three and four. - One, three, four?

1307
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,960
- Only two numbers overlapped. - Gosh.

1308
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,360
(He managed to get rid of 3.)

1309
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,370
(He successfully got rid of 4.)

1310
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,500
How did 3 and 4 not overlap?

1311
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,400
Those who submitted 2 or 5 badges...

1312
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,770
(Meanwhile, those who chose the unlucky numbers...)

1313
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,330
- will get them back. - You submitted two?

1314
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,800
Oh, darn it.

1315
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:10,940
(They got their badges back.)

1316
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,340
- Honestly... - Take them back.

1317
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,710
This is chilling.

1318
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,410
- It would've exploded... - This is crazy.

1319
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,610
even if I chose 3 or 4.

1320
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,710
A lot of people went with five.

1321
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,580
Don't go with 5. I'll go 5 again.

1322
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:21,920
(Three Tiger Moths chose 5.)

1323
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,650
- Me too. - Let's go all the way.

1324
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,680
- Let's see how it ends. - Yes, go for it.

1325
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,920
The current standing has changed.

1326
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,290
(The updated rankings are revealed.)

1327
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,360
- I went up to 3rd place. - Joint 1st place.

1328
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,960
Ji Hyo and I are in sixth place.

1329
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,090
Jae Seok...

1330
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,190
(Jong Kook and Se Chan rose up the ranks.)

1331
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,300
- I went up to 3rd place. - Joint 1st place.

1332
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,030
- Ji Hyo and I are in sixth place. - Jae Seok.

1333
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,530
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo are in last place.)

1334
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,200
Jae Seok...

1335
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,330
We're stuck together again.

1336
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,400
The people here all bet five.

1337
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,210
(Rankings can shift dramatically based on the settlement results.)

1338
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,310
- That's right. - They bet five.

1339
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,170
The people up here are the timid ones.

1340
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,340
This is just the beginning.

1341
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,610
- It's the beginning. - We're getting started.

1342
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,550
(Before the upcoming battle to remove badges,)

1343
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,250
We'll wrap up this part and head over to eat.

1344
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,950
(they head off to have a meal first.)

1345
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,880
- Okay! - Yes!

1346
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,950
- Fried chicken. - Gosh.

1347
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,350
- Thank you. - Yes.

1348
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:57,990
(Today's lunch is fried chicken, which makes them go wild.)

1349
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,120
It's just what I like.

1350
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,320
- Just what I like. - Jong Kook's protein.

1351
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,790
- Fried chicken. - Gosh.

1352
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,890
(Drawn to the smell, they take their seats.)

1353
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,160
What should I do?

1354
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,490
- It's amazing. - It's that brand.

1355
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,260
- The smell... - It's insane.

1356
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
I want this.

1357
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,000
(Super excited)

1358
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,270
Chicken!

1359
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,070
- Fried chicken. - Chicken.

1360
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:16,670
(Savory cheese powder is sprinkled over the crispy chicken.)

1361
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,800
The cheesy smell... The aroma...

1362
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,710
- It's crazy. Gosh. - Chicken.

1363
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,210
Thanks for the food.

1364
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,980
- Yes, thank you. - Thank you.

1365
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,080
Thank you.

1366
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,080
What on earth?

1367
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,510
Because you model for competing brands...

1368
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:27,250
(The faces of other chicken brands can only sit back and watch.)

1369
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,350
Yes, we are models for other chicken brands.

1370
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,080
- Neither of you can eat. - Great.

1371
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,550
- Smell it. - The dip cuts through the grease.

1372
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,550
(They start eating in earnest.)

1373
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,250
- The cheese... - Oh, the cheese...

1374
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,420
(Food Fighter goes for the drumstick first.)

1375
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,090
The cheesy smell...

1376
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,090
The aroma. It's crazy.

1377
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,130
It's crunchy.

1378
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,260
Here goes.

1379
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,460
It's crunchy.

1380
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,530
(He opens his small eyes wide as he takes a big bite.)

1381
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,770
The cheese is amazing.

1382
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,170
(Making a fuss)

1383
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,100
- Hey. - Isn't it crunchy?

1384
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,480
(Breaking into a smile)

1385
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,610
It's flavorful, isn't it?

1386
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,580
It smells and tastes so rich.

1387
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,780
(Sniffing)

1388
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:02,350
(The chicken skin is coated in a blend of cheese.)

1389
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,280
I think it's a mix of multiple cheeses.

1390
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,020
- Four kinds. - Yes. It's deep and rich.

1391
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:08,020
(Dipping in the sweet and sour sauce)

1392
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,390
- It's so good. - Yes.

1393
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,960
- The sauce is amazing. - The sauce is the secret.

1394
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,800
The sauce is really good.

1395
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,600
Do you feel like spreading it?

1396
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,670
(Exclaiming)

1397
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,130
- Do you? - Yes.

1398
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,730
Happiness is spreading.

1399
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,370
It's so good.

1400
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,970
I love it.

1401
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,610
(He starts squeezing the sauce like a squeezable ice cream.)

1402
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,570
You're drinking the sauce?

1403
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,610
Yes. It's not that salty. You can drink it.

1404
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,180
(Carefree)

1405
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,050
The batter is pretty thin.

1406
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,950
(Lady Song who loves fried chicken and beer is also satisfied.)

1407
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,450
If I had to eat something late at night,

1408
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,280
- I love chicken. - I'd order this.

1409
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,480
I love this kind of taste.

1410
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,150
(She's practically brushing her teeth with it.)

1411
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,790
- The whole family does. - It's amazing.

1412
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,590
You must share this with family.

1413
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,060
It's not over the top.

1414
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,060
(Excited)

1415
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,920
- It tastes... - The batter is pretty thin.

1416
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,330
I can't stand her. Look at Ye Eun's face.

1417
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,800
She's so ugly.

1418
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,130
- It's the food fighter's lucky day. - It's her birthday.

1419
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,300
(Food Fighter is twisting her body and making a fuss.)

1420
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,200
- Now... - What?

1421
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,300
- Did you have enough? - Yes.

1422
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,670
(Acting cute)

1423
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,300
No.

1424
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,340
(They'll remove the table due to limited time.)

1425
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,970
We'll remove the tables and continue the game.

1426
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,210
- Can't I eat a little more? - That's good.

1427
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,780
- Just a moment. - Just a second.

1428
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:06,280
(Food Fighter stuffs her face even as the table's being moved.)

1429
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,250
It's tasty.

1430
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,920
It's good.

1431
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,090
(Can I have a sip of your drink?)

1432
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,380
Can I have a sip?

1433
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,750
That was really good.

1434
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,550
(Glancing around)

1435
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,860
Just a sip. I need a sip.

1436
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,860
(Glancing again)

1437
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,890
(Moaning)

1438
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,800
(Groaning)

1439
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,230
- That was delicious. - It was really good.

1440
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,900
(The lunch that brought joy to only a few of them has ended.)

1441
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,700
- Forget the promotion. It was good. - I liked that a lot.

1442
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,640
Do you think I didn't mean it?

1443
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,310
When I said I didn't do my best.

1444
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,740
- Yes. - I was serious.

1445
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,740
(Serious)

1446
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,410
Why would you bring that up again?

1447
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,980
Can you show us right now?

1448
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,010
I sure can.

1449
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,850
Show us how strong you are.

1450
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,050
I can. Do you want me to show you?

1451
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,790
- You know how. - Not without the cameras.

1452
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,460
- Are we being filmed? - "This is how strong I am."

1453
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,290
(We quickly began recording using the crew's phone.)

1454
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,160
Let me have a feel.

1455
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,460
(A crew member's camera)

1456
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,960
- Use me to test... - Not today, Seok Jin.

1457
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:51,990
(Another revenge match for Seok Sam who still hasn't given up)

1458
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,530
Not today.

1459
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,360
Don't do it. You're just...

1460
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,730
(Just grabbing his collar)

1461
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,770
You're...

1462
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,330
- How is it? He's using strength... - Seok Jin.

1463
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,100
- This isn't right. - I didn't use any strength earlier.

1464
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,700
- Are you using your strength now? - Yes.

1465
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,070
"Are you using your strength?" You punk.

1466
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,970
Are you using your strength, Seok Jin?

1467
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,010
(Grabbing)

1468
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,250
(Jee-rasoni is really using all of his strength.)

1469
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,150
Seok Jin.

1470
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,850
(It just looks like they're flapping around.)

1471
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
He can't do it.

1472
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,490
- Hey, man. Read the room. - Seok Jin.

1473
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,790
- Hang on. - If you go like this...

1474
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,890
- Wait, time out! - Honestly...

1475
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,620
- Don't do this today. - Why not?

1476
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,060
- Do it. - Not now.

1477
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,960
(Stopping him before his belly button shows)

1478
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,890
- You know, don't you? - Hey, come on.

1479
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,560
- Seok Jin, give it a rest! - Why?

1480
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,100
- Don't do this today. - But why?

1481
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,830
(Calm down.)

1482
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,170
- Don't do this today. - He's really going to fight.

1483
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,670
- Why? I was in the middle of it. - Don't do it today.

1484
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,100
- Just stop now, Seok Jin. - Why should I?

1485
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,470
(Player Jee is all worked up.)

1486
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,840
- Don't get excited. - Why? I was doing it.

1487
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,740
You're becoming too obsessed.

1488
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,310
(He barely calms him down and steps away.)

1489
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,070
Don't do it today.

1490
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:40,380
- I'm not becoming obsessed. - But you know...

1491
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,080
(He stands up again.)

1492
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,210
- It's not an obsession. - You lost.

1493
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,080
- Stop it now, Seok Jin. - Come here.

1494
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,110
(The name tag zombie comes back to life.)

1495
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,450
I didn't lose.

1496
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,380
(The safety crew is back in action.)

1497
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,250
I didn't lose, okay?

1498
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,590
- Don't do this today. - Why not?

1499
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,550
- Not today. - Right, Seok Jin. Calm down.

1500
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,320
(Sighing)

1501
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,360
Gosh, it is pretty funny.

1502
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,390
(Pretending to be strong)

1503
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,520
Seok Jin, did you fight again?

1504
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,960
No, he wanted to see my strength,

1505
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,060
- so I showed him. - He showed me his strength.

1506
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,500
(Grabbing)

1507
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,460
- Let's go. - Seok Jin, stop it!

1508
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,930
Seok Jin, stop it!

1509
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,070
(He picks a fight with Ddochi who was passing by.)

1510
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,770
Don't do that to Ye Eun!

1511
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,800
Seok Jin, you're a coward.

1512
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,570
(Disappointed)

1513
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,470
You're a coward.

1514
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,570
No, I was just showing you how I'd shake you up.

1515
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,410
(Embarrassed)

1516
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,770
He's pretty strong, though.

1517
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,870
- Grab him. He's strong. - Why, you...

1518
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:15,280
(Right then, Jee Zombie's surprise attack)

1519
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,550
If I really do this...

1520
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:22,020
If I really do this...

1521
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,780
(Seok Sam squeezed out his last bit of strength.)

1522
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,590
(He's making the same face again.)

1523
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,650
Really...

1524
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,020
Seriously, don't do it, Se Chan.

1525
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,190
(Pulling out)

1526
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,920
- He pulled his hand out again. - He did it again.

1527
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,930
Seok Jin, you did it again.

1528
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,730
(He pulled out and escaped again.)

1529
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,660
Well, I already showed you everything.

1530
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,400
- See? You felt that, didn't you? - I did.

1531
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,830
(Hesitantly)

1532
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,930
- I could feel your strength. - I wasn't using my strength before.

1533
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:39,340
(Jee-rasoni, who became more resentful about name tags...)

1534
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,070
Oh, you were filming. I didn't use my strength earlier.

1535
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,970
- Grab this part. - Hey.

1536
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,610
(lost to Short Kid as well.)

1537
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,670
- Grab right here. - Of course.

1538
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,270
- See? I can do it. - Like this,

1539
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,080
and rip it off in one go.

1540
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,710
(He lost to Kim Muscles badly.)

1541
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,580
- Poor guy. - Seok Jin.

1542
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,180
- It became red, right? - Yes.

1543
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,010
If I resisted longer, it would've gotten scratched more.

1544
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,820
So, I just slipped out.

1545
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,850
I stopped resisting and slipped out.

1546
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,450
I can see how passionate you are.

1547
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,750
(Jee-rasoni got his second scratch of glory like that.)

1548
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,520
- I still see you as a young man. - A young man?

1549
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:02,290
(They move on to the next mission before he causes more trouble.)

1550
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,460
- What? Come on. - Darn it.

1551
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,630
What is this now?

1552
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,930
(There are tables in the hall.)

1553
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,630
- This is... - What could it be?

1554
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,160
Gosh, one person is over here.

1555
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,830
- Is it about secrets? - Secrets again?

1556
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:11,100
(Everyone walks in happily.)

1557
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,070
- It looks like fun. - How fun.

1558
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,130
- Do we sit here? - All right.

1559
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:15,100
(One of them looks especially tired.)

1560
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,240
- Okay. - Hey, what is it this time?

1561
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,270
I bet it's...

1562
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,710
- Did someone get hurt? - He did.

1563
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,640
(Band-aid and ointment)

1564
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,740
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin.

1565
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,080
- No, I wasn't hurt. - Seok Jin.

1566
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,780
No, I didn't get hurt.

1567
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,780
Seok Jin kept going at it.

1568
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,220
He's training himself.

1569
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,550
- Gosh, Mr. Jee is driving us crazy. - What, that's not...

1570
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:31,220
(Everyone in the neighborhood heard about his injury.)

1571
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,890
- I didn't get hurt that badly. - I mean,

1572
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,690
I have no idea why Mr. Jee is acting like this.

1573
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,960
Well, it's not like that.

1574
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,920
The whole name tag thing is...

1575
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,460
Did the name tags...

1576
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,360
Did we switch manufacturers for our name tags?

1577
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,730
He can't even talk that well.

1578
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,300
- Oh, no. - I think it's been switched.

1579
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
Here's some ointment.

1580
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,770
(Ye Eun, the devoted daughter, brought the ointment.)

1581
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,970
- Put it on for him. - Put it on.

1582
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,300
Seok Jin.

1583
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,700
I should compete against some idols.

1584
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,340
- Seok Jin. - What? Why?

1585
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,710
I said I was fine!

1586
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,070
- Gosh, don't do that. - It's not fine for us.

1587
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,540
- No, but it's all red! - Seok Jin.

1588
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,080
- Don't do that! It stings... - It's fine.

1589
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,510
- Stop it. It stings! - He says it stings.

1590
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,750
He just charges forward whenever he sees a name tag.

1591
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:58,110
(Upset)

1592
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,950
- This is like... - It's driving me crazy.

1593
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,220
- He's practically a zombie! - No.

1594
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,320
He's so excited.

1595
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,390
(The first aid for Zombie Jee has been completed.)

1596
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,850
That's not true.

1597
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,120
It's not like that.

1598
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,220
Okay, so this mission...

1599
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,320
(The first mission)

1600
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,090
- is the Running Year-End Hearing. - A hearing?

1601
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,990
(Mission 1: Running Year-End Hearing)

1602
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,960
- What's that? Okay. - We'll choose one representative.

1603
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,830
You will predict five things...

1604
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,530
that this person might say or do...

1605
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,500
and fill out a checklist.

1606
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,710
So, if you check off the whole list, you get three points.

1607
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,400
(Scratching their head, greeting, Happy New Year)

1608
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,710
(Touching their nose, raising their hand)

1609
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:23,810
Three points?

1610
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,710
The next person who checks off the most will get two points.

1611
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,250
Then, the representative can't make predictions, right?

1612
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,480
- That person will just get a point. - Okay.

1613
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,290
So, the top three people with the highest total points...

1614
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,390
will get a chance for a badge transfer.

1615
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,760
We can't write onomatopoeias, right?

1616
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,920
- Like simple sounds. - No.

1617
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,930
You have to be clear. You can't just write "laughing."

1618
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:47,400
(They need to write specific words or actions.)

1619
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,030
Something like, "Does that make any sense?"

1620
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,460
- Something that person says. - Something that person says?

1621
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,370
Like, "Hey, don't talk about such nonsense?"

1622
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,570
- That's right. - How would we...

1623
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,940
- Right. - People say things out of habit.

1624
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,170
- Stuff you say without thinking. - There are...

1625
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,670
- things you say often. - Especially for Seok Sam.

1626
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:57,770
- Right. - Come on.

1627
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,780
No way. I wouldn't do what you expect me to.

1628
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:03,580
(Can the friends of 16 years predict what each other will do?)

1629
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,740
- You won't do what we expect? - I'd calculate that in my head.

1630
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:05,180
So, we'll now choose one representative.

1631
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,180
(Who will be summoned to the hearing as the representative?)

1632
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,720
- The representative can't tell us. - We know a lot about Jong Kook too.

1633
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,920
- I have lots of habits. - Yes.

1634
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,090
(Jee Seok Jin)

1635
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,390
The representative is...

1636
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,060
(Jee Seok Jin is chosen.)

1637
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,490
Jee Seok Jin.

1638
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,290
Gosh, this is...

1639
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,260
- Jee Seok Jin. - Gosh, this is...

1640
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,190
(Nice!)

1641
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,430
- Oh, this is way too obvious. - Gosh, this is...

1642
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:22,060
Gosh, this is... Okay. Let's go.

1643
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,100
(He's practically unnoticed. Predict what he'll say and do.)

1644
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,930
But if Seok Sam minds the way...

1645
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,840
(Who will get the most correct answers?)

1646
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,500
- he behaves... - Right.

1647
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:28,240
But I also...

1648
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,610
- I'd stop myself from saying it. - What should I say?

1649
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,640
That's what I mean.

1650
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,410
I just won't say what you expect me to.

1651
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,780
That's why we have to predict a twist.

1652
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,710
I wouldn't fall for that.

1653
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,580
But don't be too unpredictable.

1654
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,750
(Suddenly nervous)

1655
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,880
- If you answer strangely... - No, I'm just going to...

1656
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,050
It's not like I can just give you guys points.

1657
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:45,120
(He says he'll easily avoid what they expect.)

1658
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,350
This is a competition.

1659
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:45,790
But that is...

1660
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:48,090
You can't avoid habits just because you try to control it.

1661
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,490
Of course. You blurt it out without meaning to.

1662
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,460
There are things that I say without I realize it.

1663
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,800
(Shaking)

1664
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,030
Gosh, wait a minute.

1665
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,030
(Tapping)

1666
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:57,900
Wait, what else does he say?

1667
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,740
(Laughing)

1668
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,570
- I'm just looking at you. - Can I say this?

1669
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,540
(Observing)

1670
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,670
- Are you looking at me? - Yes.

1671
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,070
- Go ahead. That's fine. - Well,

1672
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,370
(Shaking legs, tapping thet able with fingers)

1673
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,310
it doesn't matter, but I don't think he'll do it.

1674
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,440
(Already giving spoilers for the correct answers)

1675
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,110
- Right. - Will he not do it?

1676
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,280
I think he'll do it.

1677
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,210
(Tapping his finger on the table, Shaking his leg)

1678
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,110
If we guess a swear word correctly,

1679
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,980
- can't you give us two points? - I wouldn't swear.

1680
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,150
How can I swear on TV?

1681
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,520
- You sometimes do. - Sure, you do.

1682
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,590
Well, still...

1683
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:18,650
I didn't write that either.

1684
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,390
(Following the guidelines)

1685
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,060
I should have, though.

1686
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,520
Well, that kind of thing is...

1687
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,990
(Touching)

1688
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,460
It's hard to guess what he might say, actually.

1689
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,760
(Tucking hair behind the ear and touching it)

1690
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,830
Are you done filling it out?

1691
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,100
(Giving spoilers again)

1692
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,930
- No, you can't. - You can't do that.

1693
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,670
(Touching hair when flustered)

1694
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,100
You have to be clearer.

1695
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,570
Gosh, that punk...

1696
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,530
Gosh, that punk...

1697
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,840
("That punk" and "Hey, you punk")

1698
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,800
He's such a fool.

1699
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,640
(They wrote it down easily thanks to him.)

1700
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,300
We get to ask him, right?

1701
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:37,210
Okay, we're done.

1702
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,610
(Everyone has finished writing.)

1703
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,470
- Then, shall we ask questions? - Okay.

1704
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:41,040
- You can freely ask and answer now. - Yes, sounds good.

1705
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,180
("Running News Flash, Fake Life Jee Seok Jin's Hearing Begins")

1706
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,640
- Do we check off whatever he does? - Yes.

1707
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,950
- I'll ask a question first. - Sure.

1708
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:46,980
(Congressman Yu asks the first question.)

1709
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,020
I'm pretty sure you're my junior, although you're older than me.

1710
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,390
I'd like to know why...

1711
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:54,220
you're always so rude to me,

1712
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,620
("That punk...")

1713
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,090
- That's right. - and I'd like to ask you...

1714
00:45:55,620 --> 00:46:00,230
(A sharp question that leads him to say the word and criticizes him)

1715
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,060
if you've ever thought about...

1716
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,700
- being good to your senior. - Right.

1717
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,130
Well, I...

1718
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:08,070
(Jee Seok Sam, Yu Jae Seok's junior comedian)

1719
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:04,200
It's been way too long since I've thought about...

1720
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,040
- being your junior. - What?

1721
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,170
- What? - What?

1722
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,200
I mean,

1723
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,870
I don't think of myself as your junior.

1724
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:11,970
- But... - How can you...

1725
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,110
(His remark disrupts the order among the comedians.)

1726
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,110
- you are a junior. - I mean,

1727
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,280
- I may have debuted later, - But...

1728
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,580
it's true that you're my junior.

1729
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,010
- That's right. - How can you not think so?

1730
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,280
- But you are my junior! - That was over 20, 30 years ago.

1731
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,850
- I am younger than you, but... - If you say that...

1732
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,450
Of course. You must respect that...

1733
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:23,920
- at the workplace. - That's right.

1734
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,160
- Sure, at the workplace, okay. - Yes.

1735
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,360
- But... - You have to respect it at work.

1736
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,660
it has all been torn down now.

1737
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,690
- What? - Says who?

1738
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,530
- It's not about feeling bad. - Hey, then,

1739
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:33,830
- can I tear it down too? - That's right.

1740
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,700
- Can I tear it down too? - Tear what down?

1741
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,970
(Flustered)

1742
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:36,870
- Well, the hierarchy... - The senior and junior...

1743
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,030
Hey, punk! You're my junior.

1744
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,230
"Hey, punk."

1745
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,640
("You punk" isn't on his list.)

1746
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,400
Oh, I didn't write that.

1747
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,740
Gosh, what a shame!

1748
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:47,180
("That punk" and "Hey, you punk")

1749
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:44,110
- Hey, punk! You're my junior. - "Hey, punk."

1750
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,540
Oh, I didn't write that.

1751
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,880
- Gosh, what a shame! - Oh, this one...

1752
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,480
- Seriously. - What a shame.

1753
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:51,010
(He fell into the trap of his senior's question.)

1754
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,280
- What a shame! - Such a shame.

1755
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,510
Gosh, that was so close.

1756
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,980
(Shutting his eyes)

1757
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:54,850
We got it.

1758
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:57,620
(Tapping)

1759
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,390
We got it.

1760
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:01,360
(Jae Seok and Haha checked off consecutively.)

1761
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,790
Did you write that down?

1762
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,120
Do I usually say that?

1763
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:03,360
(Tapping the table with fingers, tapping his fingers on the table)

1764
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,960
- We got it. - Oh, look.

1765
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,960
- He really does it. - I have that.

1766
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,160
(Many of them got it right.)

1767
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,130
I thought he'd try not to.

1768
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,930
- Yes, he did it. - He doesn't realize it.

1769
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:09,570
(Busy)

1770
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:09,870
- Can I check off a similar one? - I mean...

1771
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,830
(What's going on?)

1772
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,370
- I didn't shake my legs. - Please ask a question.

1773
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,400
- I didn't shake my legs. What? - No.

1774
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,640
(Congressman Yang asks a question.)

1775
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,240
- May I ask a question? - Yes.

1776
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,140
You call yourself the Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong,

1777
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,940
- with the image of a romantic guy. - That's right.

1778
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,440
Do you love your wife?

1779
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:26,180
(Do you call that a question?)

1780
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,550
- Of course I do. - Pardon?

1781
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,780
- Do you love her? - Of course.

1782
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,220
- How much do you love her? - How much?

1783
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,180
(Do you call that a question?)

1784
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,980
- Please tell us. - Why and how do you love her?

1785
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,590
- Tell us how much you love her. - What do you mean, why?

1786
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,050
(Congressman Yu is helping.)

1787
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:31,990
- Tell us about it. - Tell us.

1788
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,760
Why do I love her? What do you mean?

1789
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:34,960
Isn't that obvious?

1790
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,730
Then, why did you always say...

1791
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,590
that you'd graduate from marriage when you turned 60?

1792
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,300
Well, that was...

1793
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,730
when graduating from marriage was a trend.

1794
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:42,860
- You'll just follow the trend? - The trend?

1795
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,700
- Do you follow trends for marriage? - Marriage shouldn't follow trends.

1796
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,170
No, graduating from marriage was...

1797
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,240
("Jee Seok Jin Sparks Stir by Announcing...")

1798
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,340
- a hot topic in society for a bit. - Yes? But...

1799
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,170
("He'll Follow the Trend and Graduate from Marriage")

1800
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,170
But you clearly said this back then.

1801
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,570
(Jae Seok spots a prey.)

1802
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,180
- "When I turn 60," - If he doesn't love her?

1803
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,610
(That's what he said before.)

1804
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,780
"I will seriously consider graduating from marriage..."

1805
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,980
(Do you call that a question?)

1806
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,380
Hey, it's not like I said that...

1807
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,880
in an official interview or anything!

1808
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,620
(Feeling wronged)

1809
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,820
(No)

1810
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,750
- Still. - Hey, at age 60...

1811
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,420
(Jong Kook grabs the chance.)

1812
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,350
I was in my late 40s back then.

1813
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,560
You told us seriously when the cameras weren't there.

1814
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,560
What? You...

1815
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,060
What? You...

1816
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,090
(Seok Sam is wavering.)

1817
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,260
- Did you just get angry? - Pardon?

1818
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:15,100
(Congressman Kim is cornering him.)

1819
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:14,760
- What did you say? - I mean...

1820
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,670
- You're not making any sense. - What do you mean?

1821
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:19,230
- I am making sense. - You're not making...

1822
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,270
When did I ever...

1823
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,000
(Does that make any sense?)

1824
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,200
You're not making... When did I ever...

1825
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,970
(Jae Seok already checked off three things on the list.)

1826
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,470
- What? Why? - What?

1827
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:25,340
- Oh, also... - Seriously.

1828
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,580
- When did I say that? - Pardon?

1829
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,680
(Hugh Grant truly feels wronged.)

1830
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,810
- You did too. - When the cameras...

1831
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,050
- When did I say that? - Honestly, you did.

1832
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,010
- You said so, Seok Jin. - I heard it too.

1833
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,250
- I heard it too. - Hey, then, Seok Jin...

1834
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,950
- My gosh. - I heard it too.

1835
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,620
(Touching his hair)

1836
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,720
You two... Why?

1837
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,020
(Touching and smoothing his bangs, Touching his hair)

1838
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,220
You two...

1839
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,790
Why?

1840
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,890
(Touching his hair when he's flustered)

1841
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:41,060
- You two. - Pardon?

1842
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,260
- I'll see you after. - Did he do it?

1843
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,390
Please give us an acrostic poem with Ryu Su Jung.

1844
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:46,460
(Ryu Su Jung is his wife.)

1845
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:45,790
Why should I suddenly come up with an acrostic poem?

1846
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,530
(For the first time in a hearing, he requested an acrostic poem.)

1847
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,600
This is a hearing, and we're allowed to make requests.

1848
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,800
All right, then.

1849
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,670
- I'll write a poem with love. - Please do.

1850
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,040
- Go ahead. - Ryu.

1851
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,200
- Ms. Ryu Su Jung. - All right.

1852
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:57,840
- Su. - It's been a while...

1853
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,370
since I called you by your name.

1854
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:02,010
- Jung. - So to call you by your name...

1855
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,550
- You should... - It's too long.

1856
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,610
(He's not done with "Ryu" yet.)

1857
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,010
- listen to the cues. - It's giving me...

1858
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,420
a warm, fuzzy feeling.

1859
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,350
- Su. - Despite the hardships...

1860
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:13,460
and obstacles in life, because I have you...

1861
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,920
Can't you make this entertaining?

1862
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,790
- I can keep going. - This is a variety show.

1863
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:17,930
- Why... - Come on.

1864
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,660
This isn't supposed to be a long love letter.

1865
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,360
- You're the worst. - Boo!

1866
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,370
- Just get lost. - I mean...

1867
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:25,730
How is that an acrostic poem?

1868
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,470
- Forget the Grand Award! - That's the worst!

1869
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,200
(The congress members are angry.)

1870
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:29,270
- People are changing channels! - What was that?

1871
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,470
Why would you suddenly write her a long letter?

1872
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,610
- Scratch that. - Seok Jin, come on.

1873
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,210
- Forget the acrostic poem. - It's over.

1874
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,980
Resign!

1875
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:39,680
(Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong must step down!)

1876
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,610
- Resign! - Resign!

1877
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,920
You're so annoying.

1878
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,750
That was absolutely boring.

1879
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:44,950
- I'll ask the next question. - You're so annoying.

1880
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:46,220
(Jae Seok asks a question again.)

1881
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,960
- Here's my question. - Sure. Go ahead.

1882
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,020
Which member annoys you the most?

1883
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,990
(Shaking)

1884
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,590
It's you, you punk.

1885
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:54,730
See that? He's shaking his legs.

1886
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:54,560
(As soon as he asks the question, he does what's listed.)

1887
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,000
(Shaking his legs)

1888
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:55,900
He shook his legs.

1889
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,970
- He shook his legs. - Seok Jin.

1890
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:58,030
- Right? - He shook his legs.

1891
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,270
It's you!

1892
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,900
(Jae Seok is toying with Seok Sam.)

1893
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,100
You're the most annoying!

1894
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,570
Seok Jin, Seok Jin!

1895
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:05,970
- Your juniors... - Only call me once.

1896
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,540
(Tired)

1897
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,280
- Can you believe his questions? - Call me only once.

1898
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,940
- Go ahead. - Why don't I...

1899
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,250
(Congressman Yu is especially passionate.)

1900
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,550
- Mr. Jee. - What?

1901
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,610
Mr. Jee,

1902
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:14,580
are there moments when you feel respected...

1903
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,120
(How can I say that?)

1904
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,390
by the other members?

1905
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:21,320
(Jae Seok only needs to check off one thing on the list to succeed.)

1906
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,420
What a question.

1907
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,690
- That's cool. - I like that one.

1908
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:20,760
- It's a heavy one. - I agree.

1909
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,960
- It's heavy. - What a heartwarming question.

1910
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,360
When I feel respected?

1911
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,930
I don't feel the need to be respected by others.

1912
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:28,800
- Really? So we don't have to? - Of course you do.

1913
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,630
Are you saying I don't have to respect you?

1914
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,730
- Hold on. I mean... - Have they lost their minds?

1915
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,670
- Who are you calling crazy? - Watch your words!

1916
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,700
- I didn't mean it like that. - Wait.

1917
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,510
(He saw how it's done.)

1918
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,740
- Answer yes or no! - Hold on.

1919
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,570
- Jong Kook, look. - Apologize!

1920
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,240
- Apologize! - Apologize!

1921
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,910
Why should I apologize, you jerk? I'm just saying how I feel.

1922
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:43,210
- Apologize! - Hey.

1923
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,950
- I'm just saying how I feel. - I got one.

1924
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,380
(Ye Eun: "You punk")

1925
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:47,550
(He just said "You punk," and Ye Eun got lucky.)

1926
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,520
- Right? - Apologize!

1927
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,750
Do you see the world only in black and white?

1928
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:51,750
- What else is there? - No.

1929
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,160
Just because I don't ask for respect...

1930
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,720
doesn't mean you can treat me badly.

1931
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,860
- You dummy. - What are you talking about?

1932
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:57,960
- Apologize! - What are you saying?

1933
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,190
(Dummy?)

1934
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,230
- Apologize! - What are you going on about?

1935
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,900
- Apologize! - No one wrote "dummy," right?

1936
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,400
- I bet you weren't happy... - Dummy?

1937
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:02,760
(Ye Eun: You dummy)

1938
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:03,630
when I won the Grand Award.

1939
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,900
(Ye Eun checked off 4 things on the list in an instant!)

1940
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,500
- No way. - I'm almost done.

1941
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,200
I'm so good at this. Seok Jin!

1942
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,870
Since this is a hearing, please give an honest answer.

1943
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:10,510
(The questioning continues.)

1944
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:10,870
Sure.

1945
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,140
The Grand Award for the 2025 SBS Entertainment Awards.

1946
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:16,980
You were nominated, right?

1947
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,450
- Was I nominated? - Are you a nominee or not?

1948
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:20,680
I wasn't nominated.

1949
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,180
- Wasn't he? - Wasn't he?

1950
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,020
- What? Why? - For real?

1951
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,120
- Why you... - Wasn't he nominated?

1952
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,920
(A chill runs through the auditorium.)

1953
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,790
- Why? - Hold on.

1954
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:29,220
Were you teasing me when I wasn't even nominated?

1955
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,960
- Have they been announced? - Not yet.

1956
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:31,690
(At the time of filming, they haven't been announced.)

1957
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,590
- Not yet? - They haven't been announced.

1958
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:34,900
(Fortunately, he was nominated for the Grand Award.)

1959
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,060
- Not yet. - Still, I don't care. You know...

1960
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,500
The nominees are still unannounced.

1961
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,330
I'm not the type to be greedy about those things.

1962
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,470
- As if that matters. - How about this, then?

1963
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:42,570
("Jee Seok Jin Says He Has 'No Desire for the Grand Award'")

1964
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:41,900
- Really? You don't want it? - Be honest with us.

1965
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,100
Don't you want it?

1966
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,370
- Would you refuse to accept it? - I have no desire for it.

1967
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:45,470
- Are you sure? - Hold on.

1968
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,740
If I won, of course I'd accept it.

1969
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,040
Yes or no?

1970
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,380
("Jee Seok Jin Says 'I'll Take the Grand Award If Given'")

1971
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,340
If I'm being honest...

1972
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,850
Since this is a hearing...

1973
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:52,250
- At this hearing... - Yes or no?

1974
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:56,250
(They pressure him after he changes his stance.)

1975
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,650
Be honest!

1976
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:54,780
- Stop ganging up on me. - Tell us.

1977
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,180
Can you speak one at a time?

1978
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,220
Is that a no?

1979
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,790
It's not that. Why is that even important?

1980
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,220
(Jong Kook: It's not that.)

1981
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:03,020
It's not that. Why is that even important?

1982
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,790
(Jong Kook gets his 3rd one.)

1983
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,100
(In tatters)

1984
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,830
Unbelievable.

1985
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,560
I'm furious right now.

1986
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,300
I bet you weren't happy when I won the Grand Award.

1987
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:16,670
(Jong Kook: Of course not.)

1988
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,900
- That's... - Yes or no!

1989
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,040
- Yes or no? - Of course not!

1990
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,640
- No? - Of course not.

1991
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,740
- No? - No.

1992
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,110
(Jong Kook secures his 4th after grilling him with questions.)

1993
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,940
- Really? - Of course not.

1994
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,410
- No? - No.

1995
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:23,750
(4 of them checked off 4 items.)

1996
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,140
Why would I be upset that you won the Grand Award?

1997
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,350
- Really? - Is that so?

1998
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:24,680
Are you sure about that?

1999
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:27,480
(The Grand Award nominee clarifies his position.)

2000
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,710
It seems like...

2001
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,520
- you don't know me very well. - Yes?

2002
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,650
But I'm not the type to get greedy or tempted.

2003
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:31,890
- Then why are you... - I'm not obsessed...

2004
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:32,920
with winning the Grand Award.

2005
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,520
What good would that do for me anyway?

2006
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,560
- Really? - I see.

2007
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,560
Then why are you so greedy when it comes to stocks?

2008
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,200
What the heck?

2009
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,430
(Ye Eun: What the heck?)

2010
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:43,930
What the heck?

2011
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:46,500
(Ye Eun predicted he'd say that!)

2012
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,970
- I'm done. I got all 5. - She got all 5.

2013
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,340
(She checked off everything.)

2014
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:49,270
- Did you get all five? - Yes.

2015
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,370
- What? - Did you?

2016
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,640
(When?)

2017
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,440
- I only got 4. - I only had 1.

2018
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:55,840
(As expected, Chungju Ji knows him well.)

2019
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,640
- She got all five. - I'm not surprised!

2020
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,480
- What now? - Since Ye Eun got all five,

2021
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,550
she wins three points for winning this round.

2022
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:00,820
Who got four?

2023
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,020
- I have 4. - I have 4.

2024
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:04,120
(3 of them got 4 right.)

2025
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,720
Those who got four...

2026
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,420
will get two points each.

2027
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:07,960
(Jae Seok, Jong Kook, Haha earn 2 points.)

2028
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,690
- Got it. - Sounds good.

2029
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,320
Really?

2030
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:11,790
(4 people earned points because he was easy to predict.)

2031
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,260
Only those who got 5 or 4 earned points this round.

2032
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,260
Sure.

2033
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:15,260
(Seok Sam receives 1 base point.)

2034
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,700
- What did you have? - Seok Jin is very easy...

2035
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,930
- to read. - "How could I possible say that?"

2036
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,070
Next up is...

2037
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,100
(The next person to be questioned)

2038
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:19,700
Kim Jong Kook.

2039
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:22,300
- Jong Kook. - He gets angry easily.

2040
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,140
Jong Kook gets angry easily.

2041
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,940
Jong Kook thinks you're cute.

2042
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,910
(Provoking)

2043
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:30,180
- What's going on with you guys? - Hold on a second.

2044
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,110
(At Jae Seok's provocation,)

2045
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:32,450
(he immediately blows up.)

2046
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,680
Are you kidding me?

2047
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,950
You jerk!

2048
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,220
(Prankster Yu knows how to push Jong Kook's buttons.)

2049
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,180
Are you kidding me?

2050
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:39,890
(What will happen at the hearing?)

2051
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,250
- We spoke in English. - You're driving me insane.

2052
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,390
How can this be done?

2053
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:41,660
I'll try to restrain myself.

2054
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,890
That's easier said than done.

2055
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,490
Restrain. Control yourself.

2056
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,260
(Making a weird entrance)

2057
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:48,400
Restrain. Control yourself.

2058
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:51,600
(Confident)

2059
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,570
I know a few ways to push his buttons.

2060
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:54,670
I won't lose my cool.

2061
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,970
(Showing confidence)

2062
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,610
(Hesitant)

2063
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:01,140
You wouldn't be able to shake them even if you wanted to.

2064
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:03,140
Can I write swear words? He's bound to say one.

2065
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,850
Is that allowed? Can I write swear words?

2066
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,880
(The writer confirms.)

2067
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:05,910
Just write "vulgar language" for that.

2068
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,250
- Got it. - We'll accept that as an answer.

2069
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,120
- "Why you..." and vulgar language. - I won't swear.

2070
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,450
- "Why you..." and vulgar language. - No way. I won't swear.

2071
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,960
(The swear word he would normally say)

2072
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,520
I don't think he'll say this.

2073
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,820
Which one? Oh, sure.

2074
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,230
You have to get him to say it.

2075
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,430
(Being extra)

2076
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,340
I'm getting everything out of my system.

2077
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:36,380
That might work, but I still ended up shaking my legs.

2078
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:39,350
- Do you know how to prevent it? - How?

2079
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:41,550
- Spread them forward like so. - I see.

2080
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,150
You wouldn't be able to shake them even if you wanted to.

2081
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:46,550
(Making a huge fuss even before the game begins.)

2082
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:44,720
This is the best you can do.

2083
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,690
Is that allowed? Can I write swear words?

2084
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:49,260
(It'll be easier to predict his actions.)

2085
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,090
It'll be easier to predict his actions.

2086
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:49,220
That won't be easy.

2087
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,090
(Tsk-tsk)

2088
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,330
You're really getting everything out of your system.

2089
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,530
(You're doing everything in advance.)

2090
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:55,800
This won't be easy.

2091
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,670
I become a different person when I restrain myself.

2092
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,570
- Be a different person then. - Right.

2093
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,170
Why do you always brag?

2094
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:05,770
- What gives you the right? - What gives you the right?

2095
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,780
- Hey, there. Mr. Kim. - Yes?

2096
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,440
You're the subject of a hearing right now.

2097
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,780
- The round hasn't started yet. - This isn't a commendation.

2098
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,150
- The round hasn't started yet. - Got it?

2099
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:17,120
(The hearing on Jong Kook officially begins.)

2100
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,820
Answer us, bearing in mind that you are the subject of a hearing.

2101
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,120
- Got it. - All right.

2102
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:20,760
(How accurate are their predictions about him?)

2103
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,790
Ask away, then.

2104
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:20,890
Sure.

2105
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,520
Do you really pack a punch?

2106
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,430
- Wait, what's that? - What?

2107
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:25,830
Do you really pack a punch?

2108
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,960
- Wait, what's that? - Hello?

2109
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:34,170
Jong Kook, don't switch things up like that!

2110
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,400
- That... - What is that?

2111
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:38,370
- This attitude is inappropriate! - What is this?

2112
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:39,540
Put your shoe back on.

2113
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,180
- I thought he might throw it. - Yes?

2114
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,310
You should answer us.

2115
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:43,710
- One at a time. - You're supposed to answer us.

2116
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,550
(Brazen)

2117
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,750
- One at a time. - Answer his question!

2118
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,720
What's with that attitude? Why are you doing that?

2119
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,080
I'm changing my usual routine.

2120
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,120
Jee Seok Jin?

2121
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:53,320
(More ridiculous by the second)

2122
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,490
- Seok Jin, hello? - What...

2123
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:55,660
- Does he have to pick up? - Did you call me?

2124
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,860
- Hello? - What is he doing?

2125
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,860
Now that you're married,

2126
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,460
what are three things you love about being married?

2127
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,260
(Seok Jin: Don't want to!)

2128
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,960
Like I could stop at just three things.

2129
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,700
(He avoids the first trap with ease.)

2130
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,430
Can you name one thing you don't like about marriage?

2131
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:06,870
- What I don't like? - Yes.

2132
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,870
Just a second.

2133
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,470
- Unbelievable. - What the...

2134
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:12,670
What I don't like?

2135
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,540
Yes, be honest with us.

2136
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:16,750
(He's avoiding the traps without falling for them.)

2137
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,580
I love everything about it.

2138
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,910
- There's nothing you don't like? - No.

2139
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:17,950
- Jong Kook, - Yes?

2140
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:18,980
I bet you aren't married.

2141
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:19,980
(Jae Seok: Vulgar language, I'm perfectly sane.)

2142
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,180
- Yes? - I bet you aren't married.

2143
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,820
(A question meant to provoke him)

2144
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:24,920
Wait, is this marriage not real?

2145
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,390
- Is it fake? - I'd like to point out...

2146
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,490
that we haven't seen her since.

2147
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,620
(He's baiting Jong Kook to lose his temper.)

2148
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:29,560
- Exactly. - That's right.

2149
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:34,500
(How will he react?)

2150
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,630
We haven't seen her since.

2151
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:32,660
- Exactly. - That's right.

2152
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,500
We haven't even seen you call her.

2153
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,500
The marriage is real.

2154
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,530
- It's real. - Yes.

2155
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,100
(Jae Seok's attack failed.)

2156
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,200
- Did you really get married? - I did.

2157
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,070
- We haven't seen her since. - Exactly.

2158
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,100
(Bending his leg)

2159
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:41,900
We haven't even seen you call her.

2160
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,070
(Bending his straight leg)

2161
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,200
The marriage is real.

2162
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:43,710
(Grabbing the table)

2163
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,610
- It's real. - Yes.

2164
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,540
(Touching the table)

2165
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,670
- Did you really get married? - I did.

2166
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:49,710
(He lost his cool for a while while answering the questions.)

2167
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,880
- It's real. - Yes.

2168
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,810
Do you love your wife?

2169
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,410
(Se Chan: Of course, I love her.)

2170
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,350
- I love her deeply. - I see.

2171
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:54,750
I love her deeply.

2172
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,520
(Se Chan and Haha get 2.)

2173
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,480
- I see. - That's right.

2174
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,590
This won't be easy. When I restrain myself...

2175
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,450
(So much for Mr. Self Control saying it wouldn't be easy)

2176
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:03,960
What's the best age to work out?

2177
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,060
(Blatant)

2178
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:09,500
(Se Chan: With workouts...)

2179
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,260
- To workout? - Yes.

2180
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,130
With workouts...

2181
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,370
With workouts...

2182
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:14,340
(He gets baited by Ssaebssaeb every single time.)

2183
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,570
- I'm still at zero. - Me too.

2184
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,740
"With workouts..."

2185
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:17,440
(Embarrassed)

2186
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:18,110
"With workouts..."

2187
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:21,610
(Meanwhile, Mr. Jee and Ms. Ji haven't gotten anything yet.)

2188
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,470
I'm still at zero.

2189
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,540
- Me too. - "With workouts..."

2190
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,580
- Hold on. - "With workouts..."

2191
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,210
Can't you give me a straight answer?

2192
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,250
- Exactly. - About what?

2193
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,310
Could I possibly...

2194
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,350
borrow 10,000 dollars?

2195
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:33,620
(Seok Jin: Don't want to!)

2196
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,120
Of course.

2197
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,590
Of course.

2198
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,520
How about 30,000 dollars?

2199
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,690
- What? - How about 30,000 dollars?

2200
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,630
(He's going to beg until he says no.)

2201
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:39,960
Did you say 30,000 dollars?

2202
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:42,530
- Hold on. Jong Kook... - You're being too obvious.

2203
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:44,130
- Normally, you say things like... - Hang on.

2204
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:45,430
(Jae Seok: I'm perfectly sane.)

2205
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,570
"Are you out of your mind?"

2206
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:46,800
(He tries to make him say the phrase in the meantime.)

2207
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:48,700
If someone younger had asked, you'd have just sworn at him.

2208
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,440
(Jae Seok: Vulgar language)

2209
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,610
- I wouldn't. - "Why would I lend you money?"

2210
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:57,650
(Seok Jin: Don't want to!)

2211
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:52,170
- How about 30,000 dollars? - Gladly.

2212
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,880
- How about 50,000 dollars? - It's yours.

2213
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,740
Don't you find yourself looking up at the sky often...

2214
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,780
now that you're married?

2215
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,550
(Out of nowhere)

2216
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,910
Okay!

2217
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:02,080
(Clearly baiting him)

2218
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:03,920
- He wouldn't fall for that. - That was too obvious.

2219
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,550
(Seok Jin: Okay!)

2220
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:07,590
Could you perhaps check...

2221
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:09,360
what the table is made of?

2222
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:10,430
(Seok Jin: Tapping the table)

2223
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:13,860
(He's basically giving him the answer and asking him to do it.)

2224
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:11,860
- The material? - Yes.

2225
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,460
Seok Jin, come on.

2226
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,800
- You're being too obvious. - You can't be too obvious.

2227
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:19,100
You must've written that I was going to lift it.

2228
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,670
- No, nothing like that. - Should I throw it?

2229
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:22,240
Of course not. Could you just check...

2230
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,470
what it's made of?

2231
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:24,740
You want to know what this is made of?

2232
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,140
- Yes. - He's baiting you into tapping it.

2233
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:26,980
(Don't do that.)

2234
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,180
It's in your best interest not to tap it.

2235
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,110
(He ended up getting nothing from his question.)

2236
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,210
- As if I'd fall for that. - I see.

2237
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:30,850
Why don't I loosen up a bit for you?

2238
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,410
(I'll make it easy.)

2239
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,050
I'll act like I normally do.

2240
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:32,880
(Side to side)

2241
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,150
(Shaking his head)

2242
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:34,980
Be your usual self.

2243
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:37,050
(The moment he lets his guard down, Haha succeeds.)

2244
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,020
I'll act like I normally do.

2245
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,420
I'll relax and take it easy now.

2246
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,920
Can you rank us in the order of our looks?

2247
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:45,830
(Se Chan: From my perspective)

2248
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,920
- In terms of looks? - Tell us what you think.

2249
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:44,960
From your perspective.

2250
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:46,860
Oh, your appearance?

2251
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,660
(Will he fall for his bait...)

2252
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,500
- All right. - Then, just the four men.

2253
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:50,630
(again this time?)

2254
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,600
- From your perspective. - Include yourself too.

2255
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,830
- From your perspective. - Compare the five of us.

2256
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:53,070
(Baiting)

2257
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,770
Okay, in last place...

2258
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,640
- Jae Seok. - What?

2259
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,710
(Just "Jae Seok")

2260
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,810
- Jae Seok. - That's right.

2261
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,140
- Gosh, seriously? - That's true.

2262
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:02,780
(Jong Kook chose him as the ugliest man.)

2263
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:02,840
- That's right. - I can't believe this.

2264
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,480
The last place. That's true.

2265
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,210
(He avoided being the ugliest,)

2266
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,520
(but his leading question failed.)

2267
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,780
Next, it's Haha.

2268
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,820
- Hey, don't be like that. - Yes, that's right.

2269
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,390
- I guess you care about height. - I see.

2270
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:14,960
(At this point, he's just evaluating their looks.)

2271
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:14,790
- Don't be like that. - Don't be like what?

2272
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:18,590
Personally, I used to like Haha's appearance and fashion,

2273
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,960
but since he has aged a bit,

2274
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,160
- I don't think it suits him. - Look who's talking.

2275
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,500
(Haha: Getting up from his seat)

2276
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:27,600
(He attacks him as he's annoyed.)

2277
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,700
- Look who's talking? - That's right!

2278
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:25,830
Are you talking about me?

2279
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:27,570
- Yes, you! - Me?

2280
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:29,100
- What about you? - I don't know.

2281
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,100
(Get mad.)

2282
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,210
(Stand up.)

2283
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,200
What about you, punk?

2284
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,040
Anyway, I... Did you call me punk?

2285
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,680
Do you think you won't lose your hair, punk?

2286
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,840
Anyway, I...

2287
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:38,380
Don't make me laugh! Look who's talking!

2288
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,810
(Springing)

2289
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,280
Anyway, I don't really care that much.

2290
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,080
(Not moving at all)

2291
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,420
(Haha: Getting up from his seat)

2292
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,850
- Why don't you care? - What?

2293
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:43,990
- I don't care either! - Why don't you care?

2294
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:45,720
- I don't. But why are you so mad? - You...

2295
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,360
Because I'm mad! Then, you should be mad too!

2296
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:50,020
- I should be mad? - Why aren't you mad?

2297
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,090
I'm not mad.

2298
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:56,830
(Mr. Self Control didn't fall for the obvious provocation.)

2299
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:52,290
Do you usually not get mad?

2300
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:53,660
- I don't. - You don't get mad?

2301
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,200
I've lost my anger.

2302
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,560
- Oh, is that right? - Yes.

2303
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,130
- I see. - Don't you get angry?

2304
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,200
- I don't. - Why?

2305
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,100
- Oh, he's provoking him. - What's this?

2306
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,470
Is this all right?

2307
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:03,810
(Tapping)

2308
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,770
- Why are you so scared, Seok Jin? - Seok Jin.

2309
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:09,080
(Tapping with his life on the line)

2310
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:08,240
- Why are you so scared, Seok Jin? - Seok Jin.

2311
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:10,010
- That's too weak. - Seok Sam.

2312
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,210
- He's scared. - Seok Sam.

2313
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:14,020
When you were walking out, you looked like...

2314
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,820
(Striding forward confidently...)

2315
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:19,390
(and just returning after retouching his makeup)

2316
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,350
- I mean, what is that? - You were patting me.

2317
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:20,690
He practically hit you with two hands.

2318
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:23,190
- Well, I was scared. - You were patting me.

2319
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:25,190
- What was that? - I was scared. Yes.

2320
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:27,300
(The meaningless provocation is over.)

2321
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,390
Gosh, seriously.

2322
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,460
Okay!

2323
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:30,800
Oh, he says "Okay" a lot too. That's right.

2324
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:35,270
(Okay)

2325
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,800
- "Okay?" - "Okay."

2326
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,840
- "Okay" works. - Does "Okay" work?

2327
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,400
- Yes, "Okay." - Got it.

2328
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,670
All right. From your perspective...

2329
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:40,980
(Se Chan: From my perspective)

2330
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:40,210
There are many celebrities who are good fighters, right?

2331
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:44,480
(He starts baiting him again.)

2332
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:43,480
- You mean like this? - Yes, boxing.

2333
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:46,910
Is there someone you wouldn't consider an easy opponent?

2334
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:50,050
(Who do you think is a good fighter?)

2335
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,280
Is there someone who's a good fighter?

2336
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,880
Oh, like ranking fighters?

2337
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:55,820
Actually, we don't really get into fights.

2338
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,630
- Among celebrities, I mean. - Sure, we shouldn't fight.

2339
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,860
(He was lucky to get a different answer.)

2340
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:00,290
Of course not. One of the most meaningless rankings is fighting.

2341
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,500
(Just one more phrase to check off)

2342
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:03,800
Still, someone who you think is impressive and exercises a lot.

2343
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,930
Recently, from what I've seen...

2344
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,970
Recently, from what I've seen...

2345
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:10,100
Well, if we were to get into a real fight?

2346
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,910
I'd say Yuk Jun Seo.

2347
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,010
(Disappointed)

2348
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:13,980
He's so cool.

2349
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,940
- He has good instincts. - Who'd win? You or Yuk Jun Seo?

2350
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,010
- Who? Against me? - Yes.

2351
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:18,710
- I think I'd lose. - What about against me?

2352
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:24,550
(Haha: Getting up from his seat)

2353
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:21,480
- What? - What about against me?

2354
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,750
Against you, I'd win with my eyes closed.

2355
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:24,890
Speed and power.

2356
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:27,260
(Standing up)

2357
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:26,490
Get out here.

2358
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,560
Get out here, man.

2359
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:32,190
(Little Ha stands up to attack.)

2360
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:35,100
(Will Jong Kook get up this time?)

2361
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,800
Get out here, man.

2362
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,760
- What? You want me to come up? - No, I'm just kidding.

2363
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:36,760
(Standing up)

2364
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,200
You know, I think Jong Kook would beat everyone.

2365
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,200
(Haha successfully gets him to act.)

2366
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:42,370
(Haha also needs 1 more to complete his list.)

2367
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,070
- I think he would beat everyone. - Did you say he'd stand up?

2368
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:44,110
(Haha: Laughing while looking at the ceiling)

2369
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:45,910
Oh, you said I would stand up, didn't you?

2370
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,680
(Currently, 4 checks: Se Chan, Haha)

2371
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:49,410
- You think I'd beat everyone? - Yes, I think you'd win.

2372
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,510
Can you play Cham, Cham, Cham with me?

2373
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:53,280
Cham, Cham, Cham? Yes, I can.

2374
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,280
(Haha's final attempt)

2375
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,780
(Haha: Laughing while looking at the ceiling)

2376
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,090
You can go in all four directions. Cham, cham, cham.

2377
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,420
(Down)

2378
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:59,120
Cham, cham, cham.

2379
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:59,950
(Right)

2380
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:01,890
Cham, cham, cham.

2381
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,020
(Left)

2382
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:03,160
(He won't look up.)

2383
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,890
- Cham, cham, cham. - What...

2384
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:05,890
- What are you doing? - Sorry, but can you look up once?

2385
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:09,800
(Laughing)

2386
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,100
I don't think this will end.

2387
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,400
- Oh, really? - Yes.

2388
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,830
(Jae Seok checks off 1 more thing.)

2389
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,700
- Are you all done? - Yes.

2390
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,900
- One second. - Yes?

2391
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,600
When you look at Haha's behavior, does anything come to mind?

2392
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,140
- From your perspective. - Yes.

2393
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:20,210
(Se Chan: From my perspective)

2394
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,410
- From your own perspective. - Right.

2395
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:19,610
- What comes to mind? - Yes.

2396
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,740
- It feels unnatural. - Unnatural.

2397
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,740
Yes, it's unnatural.

2398
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:23,780
(Oh, I didn't write it.)

2399
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,480
- It isn't natural. - Oh, that's right.

2400
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,510
- I wrote that. - Why didn't you write "Unnatural?"

2401
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,380
(Disappointed)

2402
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,120
- But also, - He says that the most often.

2403
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,650
(Not that)

2404
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,590
you say this to Haha whenever he does that.

2405
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:34,760
- Can I use vulgar language? - Yes, that's fine.

2406
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:36,260
(Jae Seok: Vulgar language)

2407
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,020
Right.

2408
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:37,460
Well, I'd say...

2409
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,330
(A refreshing expression of love)

2410
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:44,970
(Answering him with a fierce response)

2411
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,700
What was that?

2412
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:50,340
(Jae Seok joyfully checks off his 3rd item.)

2413
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,140
- Could you follow my hand once? - Sure.

2414
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:55,610
(Haha: Laughing while looking at the ceiling)

2415
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,510
All right. Follow me. One.

2416
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,280
Two.

2417
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,950
(He won't look up again.)

2418
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:59,150
Three.

2419
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,980
- Look at the tip of my finger. - Okay.

2420
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:03,180
I'm sorry, but could you look up at the ceiling one last time?

2421
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,590
No. Is anyone else almost there?

2422
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:06,750
(I'll do it for you.)

2423
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:06,790
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

2424
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:09,190
Jong Kook, how do you laugh when you're happy?

2425
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,690
(Laughing)

2426
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:12,560
- What is that? - You can't do that.

2427
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,090
(He checked off 4 items because Jong Kook went easy on him.)

2428
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:18,830
(Jae Seok: Laughing)

2429
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,860
- What is that? - You can't do that.

2430
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:22,970
If you say something similar, I'll try to go along with it.

2431
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:25,170
- Jong Kook. - Yes, if you want something...

2432
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:27,680
From your perspective, do you think...

2433
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,080
Seok Jin will receive an award this year or not? From your perspective.

2434
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:33,380
Right. From Jong Kook's perspective.

2435
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,950
(Jong Kook said he'd answer easily.)

2436
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,750
Right. From Jong Kook's perspective.

2437
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:38,090
(What about this time?)

2438
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:40,220
(They should give him one now.)

2439
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,790
They should give him one now.

2440
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,190
(Disappointed)

2441
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:42,290
- Yes, they should. - Seok Jin...

2442
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:43,460
So, that's from your perspective?

2443
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:45,460
- He won the Top Excellence Award. - From who's perspective?

2444
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:50,500
(The answer is clear. Se Chan will win 1st place if Jong Kook says it.)

2445
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,730
Is it from your own perspective? From whose perspective?

2446
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:53,230
Gosh, you really don't have to. It's so much pressure.

2447
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,470
(He's the only one who is serious.)

2448
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:58,070
(Should I say it or not?)

2449
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:04,210
- From my perspective. - I'm finished!

2450
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,980
(Se Chan: From my perspective)

2451
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:05,210
Nice.

2452
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:09,150
(Se Chan wins 1st place thanks to the kind Jong Kook.)

2453
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,510
- It's true. I say that a lot. - Was that 5? I got 4.

2454
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,480
- He says that so often. - Yes, "From my perspective."

2455
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,120
Then, Se Chan, who has checked off all five,

2456
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,190
gets three points.

2457
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:16,620
With 4 items each, Jae Seok and Haha will get 2 points.

2458
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,130
- Gosh, how funny. - Okay.

2459
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:20,030
(This is the final hearing.)

2460
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,130
- We'll do one last round. - All right.

2461
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:21,960
It's over if Haha is chosen.

2462
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,300
- We can all get it right for Haha. - We all know.

2463
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,500
Then, I'll go.

2464
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:29,840
(Haha volunteers.)

2465
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,630
- Go for it, Haha. - Let's go with Haha.

2466
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:28,140
- Nice. - I won't let you get a single one.

2467
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,570
- All right, Haha. - You punks from Antenna.

2468
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,640
(They're the ones he's keeping in check.)

2469
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:33,310
- Try it. - The two of you. Especially you.

2470
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:34,480
- That's funny. - You good-for-nothing punk.

2471
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,540
"Good-for-nothing punk?"

2472
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:38,450
Fake. A knock-off.

2473
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,180
Fake punk.

2474
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,390
You may think you know me well, but you might not.

2475
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:45,850
- What a load of bull. - What?

2476
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:49,060
Gosh, no.

2477
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,890
I didn't say that to you, Haha.

2478
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:53,160
- You didn't say it to me, right? - I was thinking about whether...

2479
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:54,930
I should write that or not.

2480
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,670
- No, I shouldn't write that. - It wasn't meant for me, right?

2481
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:02,240
I bet I'm harder than you think. It won't be very easy.

2482
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:04,570
(Haha is confident. Will he be able to defy their predictions?)

2483
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,170
- I think you'll be very easy. - Yes.

2484
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:07,710
(The hearing on Haha begins.)

2485
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:05,940
All right. Here we go.

2486
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:07,810
- Okay. - Like that.

2487
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:09,410
All right. Between Running Man and "Hangout with Yoo,"

2488
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:10,580
which one would you choose?

2489
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:14,480
(Se Chan: Running Man versus "Hangout with Yoo," Running Man)

2490
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,780
What about you?

2491
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:14,780
- I choose Running Man. - I also choose Running Man.

2492
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,020
(Ssaebssaeb immediately gets 1.)

2493
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,420
- Oh, thank you. - Is that right?

2494
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,050
You want to seem youthful, but you're falling behind now.

2495
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:20,250
(Mr. Bucktooth attacks to annoy him.)

2496
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,320
(Getting worked up)

2497
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,290
Who is?

2498
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,430
(Jae Seok: What did you say? What a load of bull.)

2499
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,960
- Yourself. - Who is?

2500
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,630
- You, Haha. - Who says so?

2501
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,890
- Yourself. - Well, who says?

2502
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:30,600
(He's already annoyed.)

2503
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,030
Have you given up now?

2504
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:30,700
Isn't that just your personal opinion?

2505
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,800
- Sure, it is, but I'm just asking. - No, we agree.

2506
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:35,040
(Cheeky)

2507
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,900
- People post about it online. - I don't think so.

2508
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,200
I'm just asking you.

2509
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:37,740
- Don't act up over there. - What? I didn't act up.

2510
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,340
(Getting mad)

2511
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,010
One second. Don't say anything...

2512
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:42,240
(Jae Seok: Antenna)

2513
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:40,040
- to Se Chan! - Why are you only mad at me?

2514
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,510
Why? Because he's in Antenna?

2515
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,210
Because he's in Antenna?

2516
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:45,350
(In the end, he can't hold back and "Stands up" to shout "Antenna.")

2517
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:45,410
Oh, I almost wrote this down!

2518
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:47,420
- I was going to write it! - I almost wrote this down!

2519
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,550
- I got it. - Goodness, gracious.

2520
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,380
(Jae Seok got 2 at once.)

2521
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:51,620
(Jae Seok: Getting up from his seat, Antenna)

2522
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,950
- I got it. - Hey, good job.

2523
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,290
Okay, do you know that your fashion stinks these days?

2524
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,730
(Se Chan: Stinks)

2525
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:00,060
- Do you know that or not? - Who?

2526
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:02,060
(He's blatantly baiting him again.)

2527
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,060
- These days. Your fashion... Yes. - Do I know?

2528
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,200
My fashion sense is better than yours.

2529
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,470
- Oh, do you think you're okay? - No.

2530
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:06,770
- I'm more than okay. - Lately, Se Chan dresses better.

2531
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:07,540
(Helping)

2532
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:08,670
No... Why?

2533
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,240
Because he's in Antenna?

2534
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,070
(The irritating brothers from the same agency)

2535
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:12,310
Is that it?

2536
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:15,310
Then, what is the reason for acting like you're young?

2537
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:16,310
- What was that? - The reason for acting young.

2538
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:16,640
(What did you say?)

2539
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,950
- The reason for acting young. - I'm not acting like I'm young.

2540
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,480
(Clenching his teeth)

2541
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:19,210
I'm living a youthful life.

2542
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,180
I'm curious about something. The sunglasses on your head.

2543
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,750
Do you do that to seem young? Do you think it suits you or what?

2544
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,380
(Se Chan: Putting on sunglasses, Taking his cap off, Cursing)

2545
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:27,960
(Ssaebssaeb tries a minor provocation.)

2546
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,820
- Why wear your cap backwards... - I know. With your cap too.

2547
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:27,890
Why wear your cap backwards?

2548
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:29,820
Then, why do you wear a cap with your bangs down?

2549
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,290
- What about me? - It suits him.

2550
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:33,490
- This is just my own style. - Do you think that suits you?

2551
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,460
- Yes, I think so. - How does that suit you?

2552
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,800
Starting with copying G-DRAGON...

2553
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:42,970
(Jae Seok: What a load of bull, Throwing his cap down)

2554
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,130
Copying G-DRAGON would be a good thing.

2555
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:40,030
- He can't copy G-DRAGON. - G-DRAGON seems offended by it.

2556
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,200
I've never copied G-DRAGON.

2557
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,410
- Even now, your hairstyle... - Well, you said...

2558
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:47,310
That perm. You copied his old hairstyle.

2559
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,170
(Se Chan: Taking off his cap)

2560
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,540
(Getting worked up)

2561
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:48,310
I copied...

2562
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:49,740
- Shin Gi Ru! - Got it!

2563
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:50,910
- Got it! - Got it!

2564
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,250
(Jae Seok: Throwing his cap down, Se Chan: Taking his cap off)

2565
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:53,580
- Got it! - Got it!

2566
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:55,850
(He already got 4.)

2567
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,280
- All right. We got you. - Got you!

2568
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:58,950
(The Bucktooth Guys' plaything is really mad.)

2569
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,550
- All right. We got you. - Got you!

2570
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:00,760
You stink the most!

2571
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:05,560
(Se Chan: Stinks)

2572
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:06,130
- You stink the most, punk! - Oh, nice!

2573
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:08,500
(Se Chan: Cursing, Stinks)

2574
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,900
I got 2 in 1.

2575
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,300
- What was that? - I got 2 in 1.

2576
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,300
(Se Chan also checked off 4 in no time.)

2577
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:15,070
(Jae Seok and Se Chan only have 1 left now.)

2578
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,100
- Let me just say one thing. Haha. - My perm may stink because...

2579
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:17,100
Let me just say one thing. Haha.

2580
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,210
My perm may stink because... What?

2581
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:20,670
What a load of bull.

2582
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,680
(Jae Seok: What a load of bull.)

2583
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:24,250
What are you doing over there? Did you ask him to do something?

2584
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,880
(Haha repeated...)

2585
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,710
- What is it? - What did he say?

2586
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,980
(what he whispered.)

2587
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:27,050
He told me, "What a load of bull."

2588
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:29,680
Got it. I got all five.

2589
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:32,590
(Jae Seok successfully checks off 5.)

2590
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,350
- Come on! - All five.

2591
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:33,590
- What was that? - All five.

2592
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:36,190
- Jae Seok, please read your items. - I was so close.

2593
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,360
(He got 4.)

2594
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:39,530
I had, "What did you say" and "What a load of bull."

2595
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:40,590
Then, "Throwing his cap down," "Getting up from his seat,"

2596
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,100
and "You punks from Antenna."

2597
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,960
- He said, "You punks from Antenna?" - He did.

2598
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:47,270
(He even said it twice.)

2599
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,270
- When did he say that? - He said it early on.

2600
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,840
- Who checked off 4? - I had 4.

2601
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,100
"Taking off his cap and making exaggerated expressions," "Cursing,"

2602
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,370
"Stinks," and "Running Man," no matter what.

2603
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:54,440
- Gosh, that was so funny, Haha. - My goodness.

2604
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:57,580
(The results of the hearings)

2605
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:56,380
People who get mad are the most fun, indeed.

2606
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:59,650
Right now, Jae Seok has seven points.

2607
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:01,480
- How annoying. - He has the highest score.

2608
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,180
- Next, it's Haha and Se Chan. - I was close.

2609
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:06,150
- Oh, really? - The three of you can transfer.

2610
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,020
You may transfer one badge...

2611
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:09,220
(Jae Seok, Haha, and Se Chan can give away 1 badge each.)

2612
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:09,660
- to someone else. Yes. - Transfer one badge to someone?

2613
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:11,090
(But they can't give it to one another.)

2614
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,460
You can't transfer among the three of you.

2615
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,490
Could we see the ranking?

2616
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:13,730
Well, from first place...

2617
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:16,460
- First of all... - Not anyone here. Someone here.

2618
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,930
(Current Badge Count)

2619
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:19,730
(Seok Jin is in last place?)

2620
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:20,170
I'm in last place. Gosh, this is so...

2621
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:22,340
You did well on the product placement,

2622
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:25,340
(They had a chance to give away their badges after lunch.)

2623
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:24,470
so you'll get a chance to transfer a badge.

2624
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,840
The second badge transfer chance...

2625
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:30,410
(3 people were chosen at random.)

2626
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,580
goes to those who drew their own names on the cue cards.

2627
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:34,250
They are Ye Eun, Ji Hyo, and Se Chan.

2628
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:35,880
Seok Jin.

2629
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:36,980
Why are you giving it to me?

2630
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,690
(Ye Eun gave Seok Sam a badge.)

2631
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,750
I want you to eat some fruit.

2632
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:43,520
(Ji Hyo also gave him a badge.)

2633
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:41,620
- What's your reason? Let's hear it. - Well, Seok Jin,

2634
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,520
- you feel good today. - You're in a good mood today.

2635
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,430
(Everyone including Se Chan gave the badge to Seok Jin.)

2636
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,730
It's Korean beef.

2637
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:46,490
It's Korean beef.

2638
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:50,260
(As a result, he went from 1st place to the very bottom.)

2639
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:47,500
- Take it. - Hey.

2640
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,230
Why are you giving it to me only? How about Haha?

2641
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:51,730
(Current Badge Count)

2642
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:51,630
I'm in last place.

2643
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:53,330
Ye Eun has done pretty well.

2644
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:53,200
(Haha: 1, Se Chan: 2, Jong Kook: 4, Jae Seok: 6)

2645
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:56,570
(I'll give it to Ye Eun this time.)

2646
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:54,500
Ye Eun is an option.

2647
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,600
- Ye Eun? - What?

2648
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,770
Ye Eun is an option.

2649
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:58,370
- I'll give 1 to Jong Kook. - Will you give 1 to Jong Kook?

2650
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,510
I'll give one to Jong Kook.

2651
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:05,180
(Protruded Brothers give the badges to Jong Kook and Ye Eun.)

2652
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,670
- Okay. - I'll give it to Ye Eun.

2653
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,040
Yes.

2654
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,380
- Ye Eun. - All right.

2655
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:04,950
- Ye Eun? - Ye Eun.

2656
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:06,250
Haha, I didn't give you a badge.

2657
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,210
(Disappointed)

2658
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,520
(Contemplating)

2659
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:08,380
As for me...

2660
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:10,220
You guys are steering him. It should be 1 of the 2.

2661
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:14,090
(Who will Haha, the last person to transfer the badge, choose?)

2662
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:12,020
- You guys are steering him. - It can't be Se Chan or Jae Seok.

2663
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,220
I'm in last place, so he'll choose Jong Kook or Ye Eun.

2664
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,920
Give it to the one in last place.

2665
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:18,430
- I'll choose Ye Eun. - How could you say that?

2666
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:19,830
I'm upset.

2667
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:22,530
No, hand this over to Seok Jin.

2668
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,230
- Why me? - My goodness.

2669
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,840
The member at the bottom shouldn't move up.

2670
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:29,200
That's right.

2671
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,010
(Seok Jin takes last place for real.)

2672
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:31,210
- I don't know. - It should come from him.

2673
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,240
I don't know.

2674
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,470
Are you really giving it to me?

2675
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:35,010
Why are you giving it to me?

2676
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,310
- It's because I like you. - That's right.

2677
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:39,850
- I'm at the very bottom. - It's okay so far.

2678
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,280
For goodness' sake.

2679
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,220
Let's give the badges to the same person. Well done.

2680
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:43,120
(Thanks to the members' love,)

2681
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,090
(Seok Jin becomes rich in badges.)

2682
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,590
Are you really giving it to me? Why are you giving it to me?

2683
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:49,020
We'll proceed with the next badge payment.

2684
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:49,760
(The second round of badge settlement)

2685
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,390
- Okay. - Like last time, you'll pay...

2686
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:53,830
- between 1 and 5 badges. - Okay.

2687
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:55,130
If anyone chooses the same number,

2688
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:56,230
- you'll get them back. - Okay.

2689
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:57,800
Please go one at a time.

2690
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,330
Some people will submit one to avoid the overlap.

2691
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:01,470
Some people will submit one.

2692
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:03,600
(The key is to get rid of the badges without overlapping.)

2693
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:03,470
- Between 1 and 5. - What should I do this time?

2694
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:05,110
I'll submit five no matter what.

2695
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:07,370
(This time again, I'll submit 5 no matter what.)

2696
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,570
You know me.

2697
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:08,580
- I'll charge forward. - I'll submit three.

2698
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,710
I'll submit five.

2699
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:12,080
Ji Hyo, let's avoid getting hurt.

2700
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:13,580
- Haha. - I'll go first.

2701
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:16,420
(Haha wants to lock in 1st place, and Ji Hyo wants to climb up.)

2702
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:14,880
I have more badges.

2703
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:16,850
It can't be helped.

2704
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,420
(The 2 of them meet again at the decision of submitting 5.)

2705
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,020
All right then.

2706
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,790
- Ji Hyo, will you submit five? - Yes.

2707
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:21,820
- Submit five no matter what. - Okay.

2708
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,220
- How about you? - I'll submit five.

2709
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,790
- That's scary. - That's scary.

2710
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:30,060
(The 3 of them have a game of wits about submitting 5 again.)

2711
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:26,560
- I'll submit five. - Ji Hyo,

2712
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,960
then you'll choose the same number as me.

2713
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,030
Earlier...

2714
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,500
I'm serious, Ji Hyo.

2715
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,870
- I'll submit two. - Same here. I'm serious too.

2716
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:34,030
I won't change my mind.

2717
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,100
- I warned you. - Okay.

2718
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,600
- I'll submit four. - How many will you submit?

2719
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:39,340
(A cutthroat game of chicken to submit 5)

2720
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,210
- Se Chan, come on. - I'll submit five.

2721
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:40,370
I don't know. I'll just submit five.

2722
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,580
(Haha enters the tax office first.)

2723
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,440
I'll submit five no matter what.

2724
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:45,280
Ji Hyo will submit five again.

2725
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:46,050
(Ji Hyo will submit 5 again.)

2726
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:48,880
What's wrong with her?

2727
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,550
Why do I need to be intimidated?

2728
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:57,060
Should I submit 1? Should I get rid of 1?

2729
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:58,260
(Intimidated)

2730
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:00,330
I hate that I'm intimidated!

2731
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,800
I'll do it for real!

2732
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:04,570
Five.

2733
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:06,730
(Haha hands over 5.)

2734
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,770
I won't get intimidated. I did it for real.

2735
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:10,240
(The brave Haha really went for 5.)

2736
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:08,570
Whatever!

2737
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:09,870
I did it for real.

2738
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:11,410
He needs to be stopped.

2739
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:13,640
(Another member who promised to submit 5)

2740
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:13,610
He needs to be stopped.

2741
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:16,980
(If Jae Seok submits 5, he'll fail right away.)

2742
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:19,110
(He submits 4.)

2743
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:21,380
Should I submit one more?

2744
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:29,360
(Fiddling)

2745
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:31,560
I bet no one will submit one.

2746
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:33,190
(He's intimidated as well.)

2747
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:34,430
That's so funny.

2748
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:35,530
(Torn)

2749
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:37,670
My pride won't allow it.

2750
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:39,600
My pride...

2751
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:43,940
(It seems Tiger Moth Jae Seok made a decision.)

2752
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:41,900
I bet no one will submit one.

2753
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:43,500
But my pride won't allow it.

2754
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:48,010
(Will he submit 5?)

2755
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:51,010
(Picking up)

2756
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:52,750
I'll submit one!

2757
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,820
(Coward Yu discards his pride in the end.)

2758
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:59,650
Guess what I did?

2759
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:01,590
How many did you submit?

2760
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:04,630
(The one who submitted 1 is talking big for no reason.)

2761
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:02,690
I submitted five.

2762
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:03,790
- Really? - I always go with five.

2763
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:05,060
- No way. - I doubt it.

2764
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:06,630
I always go with five.

2765
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:07,900
- Then our numbers overlap. - I doubt he submitted five.

2766
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:11,470
(What consequences will his choice bring?)

2767
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:09,130
Then Haha will continue to place first.

2768
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:11,570
I always go with five.

2769
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:14,100
(Ye Eun is next.)

2770
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:14,900
I'll submit two.

2771
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,970
I always submit two.

2772
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,740
(She plays it safe and submits 2.)

2773
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:21,310
It's a bad idea to get greedy.

2774
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,080
All right.

2775
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,410
(What will Jong Kook choose?)

2776
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:26,180
I'll submit three this time as well.

2777
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:28,020
Three.

2778
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:29,650
(Fiddling)

2779
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:31,620
I want to keep the cute one.

2780
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:33,020
Which one is cute?

2781
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:35,090
This one is cute.

2782
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,190
These ones aren't cute.

2783
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,230
I want to drop these badges.

2784
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,460
(I want to drop these ordinary badges.)

2785
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:40,960
I'll keep only the cute one.

2786
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:43,700
(Jong Kook submits 3 just like he did last time.)

2787
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,830
Three. Okay.

2788
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:48,040
(Every number has been chosen except for 4.)

2789
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:46,530
I'll submit...

2790
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:48,170
I don't know what will happen.

2791
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:51,610
(They need to submit 4 to avoid the overlap.)

2792
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:50,170
I'll submit... Yes.

2793
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:52,740
I'll submit...

2794
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,010
That's the situation.

2795
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:57,980
(Which number did the remaining 3 choose?)

2796
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,510
- I'll give you the results. - Okay.

2797
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,180
(The settlement results are announced.)

2798
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,750
Here comes the result of the second payment.

2799
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:05,790
- The overlapped number... - Which number is it?

2800
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:07,760
- or the unlucky number is... - Okay.

2801
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,560
five.

2802
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,190
(5 became an unlucky number again.)

2803
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:12,890
- It's the unlucky number? - Did I succeed in it?

2804
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,930
(The member who submitted 5)

2805
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:16,960
Three, four, five.

2806
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:19,330
(It was Ji Hyo!)

2807
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,200
I'll submit five.

2808
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,500
Yes.

2809
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,700
It's the year of 2025,

2810
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:24,540
(Ji Hyo submitted 5 without any hesitation.)

2811
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,100
so I'll go with five.

2812
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,470
- Did I succeed in it? - It became the unlucky number.

2813
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:27,880
(The Mapo Siblings failed again by submitting 5.)

2814
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:28,280
It became the unlucky number.

2815
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:30,010
- Five. - Did two people survive?

2816
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,580
(Another number that overlapped...)

2817
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:31,450
And four.

2818
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,750
(is 4.)

2819
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:32,810
- It became the unlucky number. - Did I survive?

2820
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:33,850
It's an unlucky number.

2821
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:35,880
Okay.

2822
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:40,090
(Se Chan and Seok Sam who chose 4 can't submit their badges.)

2823
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:37,350
I'll submit four.

2824
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:38,450
Even if I fail, it can't be helped.

2825
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:39,890
I don't know what will happen.

2826
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:42,190
Did 1, 2, and 3 survive?

2827
01:13:42,190 --> 01:13:43,260
The remaining numbers survived.

2828
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,890
(1, 2, and 3 survived.)

2829
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:48,400
(Jae Seok switched to 1 and survived.)

2830
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:48,500
- The remaining numbers survived. - You submitted 2.

2831
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,800
One, two, and three survived.

2832
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:52,770
(Ye Eun and Jong Kook played it safe and submitted the badges.)

2833
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,960
- Thank goodness. - Okay.

2834
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,730
- You're in first place. - I survived.

2835
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:54,030
The members who chose...

2836
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,640
- the unlucky numbers... - Okay.

2837
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:58,840
(Seok Jin, Haha, Ji Hyo, and Se Chan can't submit their badges.)

2838
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,840
failed to make the payment.

2839
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,670
- They need to take the badges back. - Okay.

2840
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:00,070
Ji Hyo, I'll take it to the end.

2841
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:01,680
- Haha. - Then you'll place last.

2842
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:02,940
- Okay. - You'll take the penalty.

2843
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:06,950
(The Mapo Siblings couldn't submit anything because they chose 5.)

2844
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,310
I warned you.

2845
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:05,950
See? I'll submit five no matter what.

2846
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:07,080
Same here.

2847
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,120
I'll show you the current status.

2848
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:10,980
(The updated rankings are revealed.)

2849
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,420
- I like how things are now. - We need to stop Jong Kook.

2850
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:13,550
We need to stop Ye Eun and Jong Kook.

2851
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:15,890
(Jong Kook got rid of his badges steadily and rose to 2nd place.)

2852
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:14,860
Okay.

2853
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,090
- Good. I'm in second place. - Really?

2854
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:18,390
Jong Kook keeps submitting three and succeeding in it.

2855
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:20,060
I'll need to submit three. This won't do.

2856
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:22,460
(Jong Kook's comeback after starting in 6th place)

2857
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,500
- We need to stop him. - Okay.

2858
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,560
- Good. - I'll submit five.

2859
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,960
I'm in last place.

2860
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:26,700
(Seok Sam started in 1st place but is now in last place.)

2861
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,730
This is unbelievable.

2862
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,700
(Current Badge Count)

2863
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:29,640
How is Haha still in first place despite failing?

2864
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:32,310
(Haha: 1, Jong Kook: 2, Jae Seok: 5, Ji Hyo: 6, Seok Jin: 7)

2865
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:30,970
We'll need to give him the badges.

2866
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:32,440
That's right. Seriously.

2867
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,270
- It's so refreshing outside. - What's this?

2868
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:35,110
(They come outside for the last mission.)

2869
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,610
- I see it. - It's so refreshing.

2870
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,310
- What is it? - I can see the penalty.

2871
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:39,750
What is it? What? Water?

2872
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,450
- On this cold day... - I see it.

2873
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:43,780
(Can they see today's penalty outside?)

2874
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:44,590
- What is it? What? Water? - On this cold day...

2875
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:47,890
(Water splash)

2876
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,720
- Okay. - The water splash is no joke.

2877
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:48,020
No way!

2878
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:53,860
(The nerve-racking water bomb that drops wihtout a warning)

2879
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,190
Oh, no.

2880
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:53,090
It's getting emptied.

2881
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:59,100
(Last place will get a penalty no matter what.)

2882
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,500
It's okay. The weather...

2883
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,230
- The weather isn't too bad. - You're out of danger.

2884
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:59,230
You don't have many badges.

2885
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:00,600
You feel relaxed.

2886
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,640
- You feel fine. - No.

2887
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,400
- Jong Kook. - Is there a way to turn the tables?

2888
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,670
(The last mission to lose the badges)

2889
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,240
Yes. The last mission...

2890
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,940
- to lose the badges is... - I need to lose them.

2891
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:09,810
the Wintertime Water Bomb.

2892
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:11,180
(Mission 2: Wintertime Water Bomb)

2893
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:10,880
- What is it? - Water Bomb?

2894
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,780
One representative will hold the water bowls...

2895
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:15,050
and the rest will hold empty cups.

2896
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:17,720
- Okay. - For 30 seconds, you'll dance...

2897
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,620
- inside the boundaries. - Okay.

2898
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:21,150
When I blow the whistle,

2899
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:23,960
the representative will throw out the water...

2900
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,530
inside the bowls.

2901
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:27,960
You'll need to catch that water.

2902
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:32,400
(The one who gets the most water into an empty cup is the winner.)

2903
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,530
- We'll need to catch it. - We'll need to catch it.

2904
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:31,330
- No matter how he or she throws it? - Yes.

2905
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:32,730
I'll get wet.

2906
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:35,070
You'll be divided into two groups for the mission.

2907
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:36,340
Each group's first place...

2908
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,370
will be allowed...

2909
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:38,970
- to give one badge away. - Okay.

2910
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:41,480
Since Seok Jin is in last place, he'll be able...

2911
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:44,040
- to participate in both rounds... - Thank you.

2912
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,350
- as the weak link. - Thank you.

2913
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:47,280
- That means you'll get soaked. - It's okay.

2914
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,180
Se Chan and Jae Seok,

2915
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,320
- you'll throw water. - Okay.

2916
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:54,050
Thus, the two of you won't be in the same group.

2917
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:55,860
(Team assignment results)

2918
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,260
- Three per group. - Three per group.

2919
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,920
- Those will be the groups, - Jae Seok.

2920
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:57,890
(1: Jong Kook, Seok Jin, Se Chan, Ye Eun, Representative: Jae Seok)

2921
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,560
- Let's do this. - And I'll be in both groups.

2922
01:15:57,890 --> 01:15:59,860
(2: Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Haha, Ji Hyo, Representative: Se Chan)

2923
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,660
Yes.

2924
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:01,800
- All right. - Okay.

2925
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:03,460
(Group 1 and Jae Seok are ready.)

2926
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,360
- Are they heavier than they look? - They're heavy.

2927
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,430
- All right. - We need to dance.

2928
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:06,600
(The 4 of them will get the water.)

2929
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:05,770
- We need to dance. - Let's dance.

2930
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:06,900
You know,

2931
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,400
we should enjoy ourselves.

2932
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,700
Do one at a time.

2933
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,640
(Jae Seok will splash water.)

2934
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:10,970
Shall I do that?

2935
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:12,840
- That's a good idea. - Will you do one at a time?

2936
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:14,210
- We'll play the music. - Let's go.

2937
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:16,110
- One, two... - I'll stay far.

2938
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:17,280
(Play the music.)

2939
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,080
- What's this song? "Soda Pop?" - "Soda Pop."

2940
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:22,320
("Soda Pop" by Saja Boys)

2941
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,150
Doesn't it go, "Soda pop?"

2942
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:27,620
("Soda pop" reaches its climax.)

2943
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:25,850
- "Soda Pop." - Like this?

2944
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:29,360
My little soda pop

2945
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,360
My little soda pop

2946
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:33,630
You're all I can think of

2947
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:36,400
(From the cute "Soda Pop...")

2948
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,660
Every drop I drink up

2949
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,930
You're my soda pop My little soda pop

2950
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:40,070
(to a middle-aged man's "Makgeolli Pop")

2951
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:41,770
(Although they dance cheerfully,)

2952
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:44,240
(their eyes are fixed on the bowl.)

2953
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,640
My little soda pop

2954
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,970
(Whistling)

2955
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:47,440
My little soda pop

2956
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,810
(The mission begins in earnest.)

2957
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:51,480
- Don't touch it. - Jae Seok, no.

2958
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,750
Don't touch it.

2959
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,210
(They stay close to Jae Seok.)

2960
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:01,760
(They hold their breath and stay still.)

2961
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,060
Come on!

2962
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:09,560
(He throws the water upward.)

2963
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:08,200
- Come on! - Okay.

2964
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,570
(Se Chan gets a lot.)

2965
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:11,060
- You got a lot. - Give me more.

2966
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,230
- Jae Seok, give me more. - You got a lot.

2967
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:14,370
It's nerve-racking.

2968
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,470
Don't grab my arm.

2969
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:22,680
(Moving back and forth)

2970
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:26,480
(It's impossible to predict his next step.)

2971
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:25,910
Here it comes.

2972
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:27,850
It's fierce.

2973
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:29,020
There are two bowls.

2974
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:30,580
(Following)

2975
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:32,920
(Following)

2976
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:35,590
(Prankster Yu is having so much fun.)

2977
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:37,390
- Okay. - Oh, my.

2978
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:37,890
(This time, they fake it by going up and down.)

2979
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:40,730
- Oh, my. - Okay.

2980
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:40,230
(Up?)

2981
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,860
- Oh, my. - Okay.

2982
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,800
(Down?)

2983
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:46,900
- Okay. - Oh, my gosh.

2984
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:47,270
(He throws it up!)

2985
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:49,140
- Seriously, I... - Okay.

2986
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:50,600
(The members barely manage to get the water.)

2987
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:51,770
Oh, my gosh.

2988
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:55,380
(Se Chan is leading.)

2989
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:57,010
- My cup broke! - Se Chan.

2990
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,180
- No! - Okay.

2991
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:01,450
(Se Chan's cup is leaking.)

2992
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:00,950
- It's leaking. - Hey, you...

2993
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,850
Get water from me. It's leaking.

2994
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:04,020
Hurry up.

2995
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:05,790
(Dripping)

2996
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:06,520
It's leaking. This is insane.

2997
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:09,390
- It can't be helped. - It can't be helped.

2998
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:13,460
- Gosh. - One, two...

2999
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,090
(Se Chan plummets to last place!)

3000
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,370
(The prankster is at it again.)

3001
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:18,330
In the air...

3002
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:21,500
- I held my cup close. - Just once.

3003
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,600
(Laughing)

3004
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,800
Hold on.

3005
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:26,270
Okay.

3006
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:28,240
(What is he doing with his hat?)

3007
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:28,310
What are you doing?

3008
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:37,980
- Gosh. - I poured it.

3009
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:35,120
(He gives himself a shower.)

3010
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:40,520
Why did you do that?

3011
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,590
What's wrong with him?

3012
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,720
- What's wrong with him? - He did that so suddenly.

3013
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,230
- Why did you do that? - You're such a prankster.

3014
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:47,830
(The prankster has met his element.)

3015
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:47,790
- Catch it. - There's one more bowl.

3016
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,130
- All right. - Gosh, this is...

3017
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:52,300
(There's one more thing, a water bowl.)

3018
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:50,960
- Hey, there's 1 more bowl. - There's 1 more bowl.

3019
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:53,100
- Hold on. There's more water. - I still have...

3020
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,570
(I must catch that this time, no matter what.)

3021
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,970
- one more bowl. - I didn't think of that.

3022
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:56,800
- All right. - Throw it in the air.

3023
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,270
- In the air? - Yes.

3024
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:00,210
- Throw it in the air. Do it. - Yes.

3025
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:01,580
(Will he throw it in the air once more?)

3026
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,250
- My goodness. - My goodness.

3027
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:09,880
(He pours it on the ground...)

3028
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:12,490
(and Jong Kook catches it.)

3029
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:13,920
Do it once more.

3030
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,020
Throw it in the air.

3031
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,820
- Give it to me, Jae Seok. - Hold on. Why am I here?

3032
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,160
(Everyone, move.)

3033
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:18,020
Hold on.

3034
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:19,560
(Since Seok Jin is in last place, he really needs to get the water.)

3035
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:22,200
(He pours it then.)

3036
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,660
Oh, no.

3037
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:27,200
(Ye Eun takes everything.)

3038
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,430
- Oh, no. - Hey. Why did you give it to her?

3039
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,970
(Seok Jin comes too late.)

3040
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:29,200
- Oh, no. - Hey.

3041
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,340
Why did you give it to her?

3042
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,410
- Watch carefully. - Watch carefully.

3043
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:33,770
- I practically pour it into cups. - Okay.

3044
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:36,740
(Giving Seok Jin a look)

3045
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:36,410
All right.

3046
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:37,410
Hold on.

3047
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:40,710
(He dodges it...)

3048
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:43,850
(and spills his water.)

3049
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:43,980
It was too...

3050
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,350
- Don't dodge it. - Why did you dodge it?

3051
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:47,490
(He gave water to Seok Sam, but Seok Sam failed to take it.)

3052
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:46,390
- Don't dodge it. - Okay.

3053
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:49,320
- I keep losing water. - Don't dodge it.

3054
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,460
- Come on. Throw it. - I keep losing water.

3055
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:53,130
- He'll throw it to himself. - Gosh.

3056
01:19:53,130 --> 01:19:54,560
He'll throw it to himself.

3057
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:57,100
(Jae Seok's eyes go wild again.)

3058
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,930
- He'll throw it to himself. - Gosh.

3059
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:00,630
- I'll lose if I miss this. - I keep losing water.

3060
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:01,570
(You don't know where it'll go.)

3061
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:02,140
- Same here. - Let's get everything.

3062
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:04,600
- Come on. - For goodness' sake.

3063
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:08,740
- For goodness' sake. - He's too much.

3064
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,910
(He sprays a mist.)

3065
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:11,950
- I mean... - What's this?

3066
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:16,820
(He applies dirty moisturizer to their chapped skin.)

3067
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,110
What's this?

3068
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:15,320
- Come on. - For goodness' sake.

3069
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,550
- What's this? - What's this?

3070
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:20,390
(He plays with water in various ways.)

3071
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:19,120
What's this?

3072
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:20,990
It's dirty.

3073
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:22,620
- Okay. - My cup broke.

3074
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,690
- Okay. - All right.

3075
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:25,390
- All right. - Ye Eun is in first place.

3076
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:27,590
(Currently, Ye Eun is in 1st place.)

3077
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:26,930
- My water is leaking. - In the air.

3078
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:28,460
- It's the last shot. - It's the last shot.

3079
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:31,060
(The only amount that remains is a cup.)

3080
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:31,930
- You'll win if you get this. - You'll win if you get this.

3081
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:33,130
Throw it in the air.

3082
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:36,800
(Who'll take this water and turn the tables?)

3083
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:35,870
- Throw it in the air. - Gosh.

3084
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:36,900
Gosh.

3085
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:39,110
Why didn't you catch it?

3086
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:41,270
Why didn't you catch it?

3087
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:44,010
(My goodness)

3088
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:43,740
Why didn't you catch it?

3089
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:44,810
How was I supposed to do that?

3090
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:45,980
- You would've missed it too. - You should've caught it.

3091
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:47,350
- You should've thrown it better. - Ye Eun is in first place.

3092
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:49,220
(Even the last chance is gone.)

3093
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:49,280
Ye Eun is in first place.

3094
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,180
- Ye Eun is in 1st place. - Ye Eun is in 1st place.

3095
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:53,290
- Ye Eun is in 1st place. - I'm in 1st place.

3096
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:55,420
(The final result of Group 1)

3097
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:55,390
- I'm in second place. - My cup broke.

3098
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:58,560
Ye Eun is in first place.

3099
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:59,760
(Ye Eun in 1st place is confirmed to get the transfer card.)

3100
01:20:58,930 --> 01:20:59,930
- This is incredible. - This is useless.

3101
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:01,900
You shouldn't have dodged it.

3102
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,600
(The one with a lot of badges lost his chance.)

3103
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,800
- I couldn't catch it... - This is incredible.

3104
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,830
since it came straight to my head.

3105
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:06,100
I can't believe I placed first.

3106
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,100
- The next round will begin. - Let's go.

3107
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:11,040
(This time, Group 2 and Se Chan get ready.)

3108
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,540
I'll go near.

3109
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,370
- Haha. - Will you pour it or throw it?

3110
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,910
(The 2nd try of Seok Sam, the weak link)

3111
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:14,310
I can't throw it. I'll move.

3112
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:15,380
(Se Chan is in charge of water this time.)

3113
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:15,680
- Follow me. - That's right.

3114
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,110
I'll pour it like this.

3115
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:18,140
You need to catch it.

3116
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:20,980
- Give it to me. - What?

3117
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:22,680
- Hey. - Se Chan, give it to me.

3118
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,780
- He keeps... - What?

3119
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,550
He keeps nodding to Se Chan.

3120
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:28,920
(Lobbying even before he starts)

3121
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:27,790
Seriously. Why do you do that?

3122
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:29,420
- No lobbying! - What's wrong with you?

3123
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:31,690
- Don't do that. - Don't play dirty.

3124
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:32,890
Se Chan.

3125
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,830
(Lady Song picks up a bad strategy.)

3126
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,730
- You know what to do. - Okay.

3127
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:39,030
Let's go.

3128
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:41,130
We'll play the music. Play the music.

3129
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,600
(Play the music.)

3130
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,510
("JUMP" by BLACKPINK)

3131
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,600
Jump!

3132
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:47,210
- Jump! - Jump!

3133
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:50,680
(Grasshopper specializes in jumping)

3134
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:50,610
- Not yet. - Not yet.

3135
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:51,810
- Jump! - Jump!

3136
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:55,750
(Ha Ssaeb plays sneakily right away.)

3137
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:53,710
Not yet.

3138
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:55,380
- Not yet. - Not yet.

3139
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:56,820
- The song needs to stop. - The song needs to stop.

3140
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:58,220
(No)

3141
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:58,290
- Not yet. - Jump!

3142
01:21:58,290 --> 01:21:59,350
Not yet.

3143
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:00,450
Not yet. Don't come near me.

3144
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:03,260
(Group 2's hand-to-hand combat is even fiercer.)

3145
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:02,460
- Jump! - Not yet.

3146
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,820
- Not yet. Don't come near me. - Not yet.

3147
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:05,860
- Jump! - Jump!

3148
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:09,130
Jump!

3149
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,100
(He spills water in his attempt to chase them away.)

3150
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:14,130
(Haha catches it.)

3151
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:13,670
- Now isn't the time. - Jump!

3152
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:15,440
They aren't dancing.

3153
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,200
- Se Chan. - They need to dance.

3154
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,740
We need to dance.

3155
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,510
(Whistle blowing)

3156
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:21,310
All right.

3157
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:21,540
(The mission begins in earnest.)

3158
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,710
(The cling-ons begin sticking to him.)

3159
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:26,480
What's this?

3160
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,650
Oh, no.

3161
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,120
- Dancing... - Hey.

3162
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:30,650
(Turning suddenly)

3163
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:31,450
Se Chan.

3164
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:34,490
(Seok Jin has a hard time keeping up.)

3165
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:32,620
- Dancing... - Hey.

3166
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:35,260
Se Chan.

3167
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:36,620
(Whispering)

3168
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:38,560
- Se Chan. - Se Chan.

3169
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,530
(Se Chan tries to talk to him secretly.)

3170
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,660
- There you go. That's it. - Se Chan.

3171
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:44,460
(He tries to get rid of Haha with a water slap.)

3172
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,330
- There you go. That's it. - Se Chan.

3173
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:45,930
- Yes. That's how you do it. - What's this?

3174
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,030
(Haha catches it.)

3175
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:48,940
Se Chan.

3176
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:49,070
(Again)

3177
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:52,610
(Haha becomes desperate again.)

3178
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:55,510
(Seok Jin stays in the outskirts.)

3179
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:58,110
(Where will the water head?)

3180
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,080
Se Chan.

3181
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:05,750
(It goes straight to Haha's face.)

3182
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:03,520
- For goodness' sake. - That's it.

3183
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:04,950
You threw it to me on purpose.

3184
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,090
You threw it to me on purpose.

3185
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,260
(Ji Hyo even drops her cup.)

3186
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,090
Hold on.

3187
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,000
(The weak link finally gets a chance!)

3188
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:13,960
Hey!

3189
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,600
It's over.

3190
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:20,570
- It's over. - Gosh.

3191
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,600
(The mission is over.)

3192
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:24,970
Seok Jin, I dropped my cup because you held me.

3193
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:26,610
(The result of Seok Sam stomping)

3194
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:26,470
- That's how you play this game. - I held her.

3195
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:28,380
- I told you not to do it. - I won.

3196
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:31,710
(Haha of Group 2 wins 1st place..)

3197
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,640
- That's how you play this game. - Okay. I'm in first place.

3198
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,240
- Does only the 1st place survive? - Haha is in 1st place.

3199
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:32,810
- Okay. - For goodness' sake.

3200
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:37,920
(By sticking like a leech, he won the right to give away a badge.)

3201
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:35,010
- Good. - You know...

3202
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,150
Good.

3203
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:37,880
He needs to get slapped with a bowl of water.

3204
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,450
- Hey. - You played dirty.

3205
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:41,490
I didn't play dirty.

3206
01:23:41,690 --> 01:23:43,120
- Why did you put... - Seriously.

3207
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,520
your cup under the bowl from the start?

3208
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,330
- Why do you care? - Why did you do that?

3209
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:47,330
You did the same thing!

3210
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:50,130
(The water slap ending)

3211
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,360
Why did you do that?
Why do you care?

3212
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,970
Thus, Haha and Ye Eun...

3213
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:57,640
(Haha and Ye Eun win the right to give away a badge.)

3214
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:55,240
can give away a badge each.

3215
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:57,740
- Who gave it to me? - Yes.

3216
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:00,310
I'll check the status first.

3217
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:01,940
- The status. - Yes.

3218
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:03,580
I'll check the status and decide.

3219
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,180
When did Haha rise to first place?

3220
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:05,150
(Current Badge Count, 1st place: Haha)

3221
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:06,780
(2nd place: Jong Kook, Se Chan, Ye Eun)

3222
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:07,010
- I know. - He gave away one badge.

3223
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:08,450
(5th place: Jae Seok, 6th place: Ji Hyo, 7th place: Seok Jin)

3224
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:08,110
Oh, my.

3225
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:09,650
I have over ten badges.

3226
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:12,790
(Seok Jin is in last place currently.)

3227
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:11,920
- As for me... - I have about the same.

3228
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:12,990
To whom will you give it?

3229
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:15,590
(Haha is in 1st place currently.)

3230
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:14,150
As for me...

3231
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:15,860
First place.

3232
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:20,090
I'll give it to Jae Seok.

3233
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:21,800
- Jae Seok. - It can't be helped.

3234
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,930
(Giving 1 to Jae Seok, whose place is iffy)

3235
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,030
- For goodness' sake. - That's...

3236
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:24,130
Here.

3237
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,670
I was going to give it to Se Chan.

3238
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:26,970
- Se Chan. - I'll give it to Se Chan.

3239
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:31,570
(Ye Eun returns the badge that she got from Se Chan.)

3240
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:28,300
- Okay. That's fine. - Really?

3241
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,370
- Okay. - After all, he gave me one.

3242
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:31,170
- Okay. - Then I'll take third place.

3243
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:32,310
You're right. You'll take third place.

3244
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:33,370
- You're right. - My ranking will change.

3245
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:36,410
(The mid-rankings change due to the transfers.)

3246
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:34,410
You're right.

3247
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:37,180
The tax office is open for the last time.

3248
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,210
(The last thing that remains is tax settlement.)

3249
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:40,350
Like last time, you'll pay...

3250
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,680
(Tax Office Rule: Submit between 1 and 5 badges.)

3251
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:42,280
- between 1 and 5 badges. - It's time for the decision.

3252
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,580
(They pass if there aren't any overlapping ones.)

3253
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:44,750
- I'll submit five no matter what. - What should I do?

3254
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,520
Hey, I'll submit five.

3255
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,490
- I'll submit five for real. - Jong Kook needs to be stopped.

3256
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:50,120
(The Tiger Moths are at against each other again.)

3257
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:49,890
- Think it over. - I'm serious.

3258
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:50,960
- Will you do the same? - Yes.

3259
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:51,960
I'll submit five too.

3260
01:24:51,690 --> 01:24:55,460
(The number 5 lovers are at each other again.)

3261
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,130
- Really? - I'll submit three.

3262
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:55,400
- Then you won't win. - I...

3263
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:57,160
- I'll submit four. - Four? How many will you submit?

3264
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,630
(Se Chan will submit 4.)

3265
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,170
- Four? You don't have four badges. - Four.

3266
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:01,330
I'll submit three.

3267
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:04,800
(Since it's the last payment, the game of wits becomes fiercer.)

3268
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:02,340
Seriously.

3269
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:03,400
I'll submit one.

3270
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,940
I'll submit five no matter what.

3271
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:06,910
Ji Hyo has been like a tiger moth.

3272
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:09,940
(Who will succeed in tax payments without being overlapped?)

3273
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:08,580
I'll lose five badges.

3274
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:09,810
Then you'll fail.

3275
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:14,550
I'll play it safe this time.

3276
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,810
(Haha said he'd submit 5.)

3277
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:16,320
I've entered the safe zone.

3278
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:17,780
(He's currently in 1st place.)

3279
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,920
So I'll make a safe choice.

3280
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:20,750
(A safe choice)

3281
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:19,990
Okay.

3282
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:22,520
Pork belly.

3283
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:22,890
(Number 1, Haha, Number 2, Ye Eun, Number 3, Jong Kook)

3284
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,390
(Haha plays it safe and submits 1.)

3285
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:26,260
I'll submit one. Thank you.

3286
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:32,400
(Jong Kook wanted to submit 1.)

3287
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:33,770
It might be safer...

3288
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:37,470
(If he submits 1, he'll overlap with Haha.)

3289
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,300
to submit 1 and get 1 back.

3290
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,070
If I submit two,

3291
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:41,410
I'll get two back.

3292
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:43,240
What do you think, Myung Jae?

3293
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,910
Jong Kook, you always make...

3294
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:47,850
(Running Tax Office)

3295
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:47,750
a small-minded decision.

3296
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:52,250
(What did you say?)

3297
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:51,650
I'm talking about your style.

3298
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,560
- Small-minded? - It's your style to play it safe.

3299
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,290
(Calm down.)

3300
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,890
That's right. That's my style.

3301
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,730
(Admitting)

3302
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:00,060
I won't place last anyway.

3303
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,430
Shall I go big since I won't place last anyway?

3304
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:06,130
(After much deliberation)

3305
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:08,430
I'll submit two!

3306
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:12,040
Is that your idea of going big?

3307
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,070
Yes.

3308
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:15,810
Playing it safe in life is my philosophy.

3309
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:19,080
(Coach Kook increased it up to 2 while mentioning life.)

3310
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:18,180
This is a huge gamble for me.

3311
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:19,710
- I'll get going. - Okay.

3312
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:22,150
Okay.

3313
01:26:23,650 --> 01:26:26,790
(Jae Seok said that he'd submit 5.)

3314
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,550
No matter what...

3315
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:32,090
I'll submit three.

3316
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,190
I think Seok Jin will submit three.

3317
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:37,060
(Even Jae Seok decided to submit 3.)

3318
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,030
Yes.

3319
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:40,300
Then I'll submit five as I did from the very start.

3320
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,100
(Ji Hyo sticks to her promise and submits 5.)

3321
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:42,170
I'll lose them.

3322
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:45,810
(So far, there's no overlap in the numbers.)

3323
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:46,110
Gosh, this is... They aren't...

3324
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,080
(The man who has called dibs on 3, Seok Jin appears.)

3325
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:49,580
very reasonable.

3326
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:54,480
(If he submits 3, he'll get the penalty.)

3327
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:52,450
I'll just submit... I don't know.

3328
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:54,480
I'll do that.

3329
01:26:54,650 --> 01:26:58,350
(Their decisions will change the rankings.)

3330
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:57,650
I'll do that.

3331
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:59,220
I'm done.

3332
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:02,090
(Will there be a great upheaval?)

3333
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:00,250
Everyone has gone.

3334
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:01,960
- There's no escape. - It can't be helped.

3335
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:04,890
- The last payment has ended. - Okay.

3336
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,730
(The settlement is done.)

3337
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:06,930
Here are the results of the payment.

3338
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,460
- Please. - I hope I survived.

3339
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,960
I'll give you the numbers that didn't overlap.

3340
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,500
- The numbers that didn't overlap? - The numbers that didn't overlap.

3341
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,730
- Are there such numbers? - What are they?

3342
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,370
What are they?

3343
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:16,600
(The lucky members who were able to lose the badges)

3344
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:18,810
One.

3345
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:20,610
(Haha, 1)

3346
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:20,770
That's it?

3347
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:21,810
That's it, right?

3348
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:22,940
And...

3349
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:25,550
(And there's more?)

3350
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:26,350
- That's it. - The numbers that didn't overlap.

3351
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:27,680
- Three. - Three?

3352
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:30,480
(3 didn't overlap?)

3353
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:31,050
- Didn't three overlap? - Three!

3354
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:33,050
- And... - There's more?

3355
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:34,350
- No way. - And...

3356
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,060
- There's more? - No way.

3357
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:38,560
(There's one more!)

3358
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:37,320
Is there more?

3359
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,520
There's more?

3360
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,300
Five.

3361
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:43,000
(5 Ji Hyo)

3362
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,360
This is amazing.

3363
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:47,300
(5 survived!)

3364
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,830
- You escaped. - I escaped.

3365
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:45,870
You escaped.

3366
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,500
Five.

3367
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:51,700
(What did Seok Sam choose?)

3368
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:52,140
Did you all submit four?

3369
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,840
I don't think 5 will work. I'll go with 4.

3370
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:59,150
(He used his brain and settled with 4.)

3371
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:59,180
This is meaningless.

3372
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:00,980
I'll submit four.

3373
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:03,580
(Se Chan sabotaged it.)

3374
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:03,550
It's not about winning. I have to make it overlap.

3375
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:08,450
(Ye Eun and Jong Kook submitted the same number.)

3376
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:07,090
I'll submit two.

3377
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:08,490
I think that's going to sabotage it. I'll say that I submitted four.

3378
01:28:08,590 --> 01:28:09,720
Five didn't get overlapped?

3379
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:14,130
(They sabotaged each other only to make 5 survive.)

3380
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:11,920
- You should have submitted five. - It didn't overlap because of you.

3381
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,890
You should have submitted five.

3382
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:15,560
- The person... - Yes.

3383
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:18,130
(The final results of the badges)

3384
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:19,370
with the fewest badges wins, right?

3385
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:20,430
(1st place: Penalty exempted)

3386
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:20,630
- That's right. - Right now,

3387
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:22,400
(Middle: Drawing 1 more for penalty)

3388
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:23,540
- Haha and Ji Hyo... - Yes.

3389
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,900
(Last place: Confirmed for the penalty)

3390
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:24,800
tied...

3391
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:25,940
- for first place. - Me?

3392
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:29,980
(Ji Hyo who got rid of 5 and Haha are both in 1st place.)

3393
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:27,070
- You submitted five badges. - Amazing.

3394
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:28,440
So they're exempt from getting the penalty.

3395
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,310
- She got rid of five. - Ji Hyo, all of a sudden?

3396
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:32,280
Ji Hyo did well on the final payment.

3397
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:33,880
- That's amazing. - Seriously, Ji Hyo...

3398
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,150
This is so strange.

3399
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:38,150
(Ji Hyo, who was in the lower rank, turned the tables.)

3400
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:36,920
She's really lucky.

3401
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:38,220
That's really amazing.

3402
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:39,520
She kept submitting five.

3403
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:39,790
(Ji Hyo)

3404
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:42,860
Five. I'll go with five. I'll submit five until the end.

3405
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:46,060
(The result of a rookie tiger moth who stuck to submitting 5 badges)

3406
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:43,890
That's really amazing.

3407
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:45,530
- Now, the person... - This is so funny.

3408
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:46,690
with the most badges.

3409
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:47,930
- You don't need to say it. - We know. It's Seok Jin.

3410
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,830
(And the person in the last place as they expected)

3411
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:50,260
The person who will get the penalty is Seok Jin.

3412
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:52,970
(Seok Jin will get the penalty.)

3413
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:51,730
- How many do I have? - Ten.

3414
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:52,970
That's right.

3415
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:56,100
For the rest, we'll exchange your badges...

3416
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:56,500
(The result of converting the remaining 4 people's badges...)

3417
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,040
- for penalty balls. - Yes.

3418
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,040
(into penalty balls)

3419
01:28:58,070 --> 01:29:05,140
(Final penalty balls)

3420
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:00,070
Jae Seok and Ye Eun get five,

3421
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:03,240
Jong Kook 6, and Se Chan 7.

3422
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,810
- The penalty balls will be added. - You never know with this.

3423
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:07,710
- Okay. - Please pick the name...

3424
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:10,150
(One more person will receive the last penalty of 2025.)

3425
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:09,280
- of the extra penalty receiver. - Should I pick?

3426
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:10,720
Will you pick?

3427
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,190
- Should I pick? - Seok Jin can pick.

3428
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:14,420
(The one receiving the penalty will pick one himself.)

3429
01:29:12,190 --> 01:29:13,820
- I'll pick. - Okay.

3430
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:14,920
Who will come with me...

3431
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,090
- Let's go! - into the fire?

3432
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:20,490
- Yu Jae Seok. - Yu Jae Seok.

3433
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:22,930
(Who will be splashed with the water bomb in winter?)

3434
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:22,860
- Grasshopper! - Please!

3435
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,460
- Grasshopper! - Yu Jae Seok!

3436
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,330
- Let's do it together. Who is it? - Please. Who is it?

3437
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:28,700
- Yang Se Chan. - It's Yang Se Chan.

3438
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:30,300
(Yang Se Chan)

3439
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,970
- No! - It's Yang Se Chan.

3440
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:33,870
- We're doing it together. - No!

3441
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:36,540
(The penalty taker that Seok Jin picked himself)

3442
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:36,010
- I didn't get picked. - The last penalty of this year...

3443
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:37,940
is getting splashed with the water bomb.

3444
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:39,380
Yes. Let's go.

3445
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:41,380
- Remove it completely. - It's just us...

3446
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:43,620
(Se Chan sprinkled salt on the wound of the middle-aged man.)

3447
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:48,590
(They will both get the penalty because Seok Sam picked him.)

3448
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:47,050
You can't take off his sweater.

3449
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:48,490
This is horrible.

3450
01:29:48,490 --> 01:29:52,090
- This is this year's last episode. - That's right.

3451
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:55,190
We sincerely thank the viewers...

3452
01:29:54,760 --> 01:30:00,300
(Thank you for supporting Running Man in 2025.)

3453
01:29:55,190 --> 01:29:56,260
who loved Running Man this year.

3454
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:58,460
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3455
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:02,340
- We'll also do our best next year. - Of course.

3456
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:06,340
(We'll work hard to give more laugh next year.)

3457
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:05,810
We'll try to provide more entertainment for you.

3458
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:07,170
- To wrap up this year, - Yes.

3459
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:08,710
Seok Sam and Se Chan...

3460
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:09,840
- Yes. - will refreshingly...

3461
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,940
They'll be splashed with water.

3462
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,950
wash away all the bad things of this year.

3463
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:14,580
- Everyone. - We'll wash it away.

3464
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:16,420
- We'll carry your wrongdoings. - Give it...

3465
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:17,880
- We'll wash them away. - Give it to them.

3466
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:21,650
(They solemnly accept the final water bomb of the year.)

3467
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:18,920
Give it to them.

3468
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,720
- We'll load it with water. - Hold on.

3469
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:24,460
- What is that? - They're filling it now?

3470
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:25,660
(Start)

3471
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,290
It's tilting.

3472
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:28,130
- Goodness. - It's tilting.

3473
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:31,360
(The water bomb drops randomly.)

3474
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:29,630
It's warm water.

3475
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:31,630
- It's nice. - It's nice.

3476
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:33,830
The water is warm.

3477
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:36,770
(The water tank gets filled above their heads.)

3478
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:35,270
I think it's going to fly away.

3479
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,100
They're filling it more?

3480
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:38,340
It's coming.

3481
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:39,940
- It's a water park. - It's coming.

3482
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:42,180
It's a water park.

3483
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:45,040
(Pouring)

3484
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:45,140
- Goodness. - It was a water park.

3485
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:47,010
It's so powerful.

3486
01:30:47,410 --> 01:30:49,420
- But... - Let's go!

3487
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:50,880
- But... - Well done.

3488
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,190
- Hold on. - Well done.

3489
01:30:52,190 --> 01:30:53,390
- But... - Thank you!

3490
01:30:53,890 --> 01:30:55,960
- Seok Sam only got hit on his back. - Oh, really?

3491
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,890
What? My head got hit too!

3492
01:30:57,390 --> 01:31:01,590
(He said he would wash away their wrongdoings, but his hair is dry.)

3493
01:30:57,890 --> 01:30:59,790
He pulled me when the water poured.

3494
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:04,000
(A retry)

3495
01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:03,860
- Give it to us. - You can do it.

3496
01:31:04,230 --> 01:31:07,300
(Professional entertainers who want to get splashed properly)

3497
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:07,330
Look at it and place your face where the water falls.

3498
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:08,430
Place your face under it.

3499
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:10,940
(They get splashed again in the end.)

3500
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:11,300
Right. Place your face where the water falls, like a shower.

3501
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:12,540
It's tilting.

3502
01:31:13,570 --> 01:31:14,570
It's coming.

3503
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:18,540
(Misfortunes, worries, anxieties, troubles)

3504
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:24,680
(The old worries are washed away after the 2nd try.)

3505
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,780
That's right.

3506
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,780
- Nice. - Okay!

3507
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:26,350
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3508
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:27,920
- Well done. - Nice.

3509
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:29,720
- Nice. - Well done.

3510
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,320
- You're young. - Seok Jin.

3511
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:32,060
(Thank you for supporting our show throughout the year.)

3512
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,660
- You're young. - Well done, Seok Jin.

3513
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:33,790
(We'll work even harder in the Year of the Red Horse.)

3514
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,360
- What is this? - It's the Year of the Horse.

3515
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:36,360
(The Year of the Red Horse, 2026, has dawned.)

3516
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:39,300
- Is it the Year of the Horse? - The Year of the Red Horse.

3517
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:39,100
(A legend passed down in this place.)

3518
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:43,300
With the Year of the Horse, we've got some good news.

3519
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:42,300
(Awaiting the Unlucky Hands...)

3520
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,370
(The legendary bingo board is open.)

3521
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:45,300
- This... - This is hard.

3522
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,970
- We'll try this. - It's Exit Three.

3523
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:48,770
(When they follow the secrets of the bingo board one by one,)

3524
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:49,010
- It think it's on the right. - Here?

3525
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,610
(Soo Young, carrying the lucky energy...)

3526
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:50,740
- You're here! - Soo Young!

3527
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:53,550
(of the Year of the Horse, appears.)

3528
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:52,380
- It's Soo Young. - It's been so long.

3529
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:53,550
Soo Young!

3530
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:55,410
I was born in the Year of the Horse.

3531
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:56,450
The Year of the White Horse.

3532
01:31:57,850 --> 01:31:59,550
(Starting with a sorry dance...)

3533
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:01,390
(to welcome the precious guest born in the Year of the White Horse)

3534
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:03,420
You're doing well! You're good!

3535
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:03,260
(Pampering her)

3536
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:05,990
(The struggle of a 60-year-old born in the Year of the Horse)

3537
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:04,590
Walnut, walnut, hand hoe, hippopotamus,

3538
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:06,530
hippopotamus, hippopotamus, walnut, dragon!

3539
01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:08,530
- Goodness. - I think his hippocampus...

3540
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:09,360
(Suspected hippocampal damage)

3541
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:09,530
was injured.

3542
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:11,200
(Take the Sadang IC.)

3543
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:11,330
Take a right road at Sadang IC.

3544
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:12,370
- I see. - It can see.

3545
01:32:12,370 --> 01:32:13,530
- It can see us. - It's the exit.

3546
01:32:13,230 --> 01:32:15,670
(To ward off bad luck for the Empty Heads)

3547
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:15,740
- The IC is where we exit! - IC...

3548
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,740
He's here.

3549
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,300
(They're headed to find another mysterious person.)

3550
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:18,440
- Here. - Where?

3551
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,470
- Run! - Over there!

3552
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:21,870
(What fate awaits them as they run like horses in 2026?)

3553
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:22,010
Throw! It's done!

3554
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:23,440
It got cut!

3555
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:24,140
(Follow the Horse, Complete the Bingo)

3556
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:28,450
(Running Man)
