1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,410
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,880
It's been a while
since we came here.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,440
I haven't been
to a mudflat in a long time.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,180
We will get caught right away.

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,680
Okay!

6
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,350
What kind of thieves are we?

7
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,350
(The 7 thieves are showing up
early in the morning.)

8
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,550
Seok Jin,
what kind of thieves are we?

9
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,220
- I think we all have...
- We're wearing suits.

10
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,160
- got the reference wrong.
- It's wrong.

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,760
We will get caught right away.

12
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,960
- If we look like this,
- Okay!

13
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,760
- we get caught right away.
- Seriously...

14
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,860
- Okay.
- The reference was...

15
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,660
- the movie, "The Thieves."
- There was only one.

16
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,870
- You know the movie.
- Yes.

17
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,670
- "The Thieves."
- We were told to refer to it.

18
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,970
We don't look like thieves.

19
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,040
- I...
- I'm Kim Yun Seok.

20
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,670
- What?
- I'm Kim Yun Seok too.

21
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,410
- Hey, you brat...
- Macao Park.

22
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,910
(Macao Yang with a mustache,
Macao Jee with a perfect costume)

23
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,080
I'm dressed like Kim Yun Seok.

24
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,410
I'm Kim Yun Seok too.

25
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,750
I'm Macao Yang.

26
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,180
Hey, do you think I'm a fool?

27
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,620
- A fool?
- That's from "Tazza."

28
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,790
- It's "Tazza."
- "Tazza."

29
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,750
- You can't just quote any line.
- Is it "Tazza?"

30
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,160
(Andrew Ha: Not Cha Bum Kun)

31
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,320
- All right.
- Why is your face so puffy?

32
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,630
- Do I look puffy?
- Yes.

33
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,090
- I'm not puffy.
- She doesn't look puffy.

34
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,490
(Song Pepsi: Keeping her composure
even when attacked)

35
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,500
I'm sorry.

36
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,160
Jong Kook,
which gang do you belong to?

37
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,530
- Incheon.
- Who is he supposed to be?

38
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,700
- Incheon.
- Whatever I do, I look like a thug.

39
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,640
- Why is Jong Kook...
- I don't understand.

40
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,240
- That's true.
- Why is he dressed like a thug?

41
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,570
(Kim Thug: He stopped wearing black
after a happy occasion)

42
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,980
If you were dressed like this,
you wouldn't look like a thug.

43
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,040
I'd totally look like a thug.

44
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,140
- You'd look more like a thug?
- Yes.

45
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,780
- Hey, Daniel. You got it all wrong.
- "The Wild Days."

46
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,710
This is too much.
Why did you draw a mole?

47
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,420
(Son-in-law Choi:
Too deceptive, too greedy)

48
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,550
- We don't do this these days.
- Right. Why did you do that?

49
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,890
- That's so lame.
- He got too enthusiastic.

50
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,260
It's too much.

51
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,120
- It's too much.
- Se Chan did this to me.

52
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,360
I only drew the sideburns,
but he added the mole.

53
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,060
- What a novice.
- I have 30 years of experience,

54
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,900
but I only drew these two.

55
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,170
Actually, we have an issue
about Seok Jin.

56
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,140
Did any of you receive
apples from Seok Jin?

57
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,570
- Apples? I heard he sent apples.
- I mean...

58
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,370
Before the fall lineup revision,
he sent apples...

59
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,770
- to the production crew.
- Really?

60
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,180
- Really?
- Yes.

61
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,480
And he didn't send us anything?

62
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,710
- He sent apples?
- No...

63
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,680
- He sent apples. My goodness.
- Hey.

64
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,980
- This is just wrong.
- Why? It's okay.

65
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,590
I thought you'd leave
with no regrets, but this is no joke.

66
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,690
- It's not like that.
- He flatters them to survive.

67
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,260
- He really does.
- He tries really hard.

68
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,860
You should learn.
That's the secret to a long run.

69
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,890
This is the know-how
from 30 years of experience.

70
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,860
So it's not about his ability?

71
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,560
It's all about bribes.

72
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,900
- This is what he told me in person.
- After seven years...

73
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,130
What did he say?

74
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,440
"Don't get hung up on the directors
and production crew."

75
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,610
- Directors...
- "You should be ready..."

76
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,140
- "to leave at any time."
- "Don't rely on the crew."

77
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,010
- Liar.
- What was all that?

78
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,040
He bribed the production crew.

79
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,710
- He's Jee Bribe.
- Anyway,

80
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,980
they told me the apples tasted good
this morning.

81
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,720
- It made me feel really good.
- Right.

82
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,620
- Seok Sam did that for us.
- Yes. I was glad to hear that.

83
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,220
- As a representative.
- It's no big deal.

84
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,220
- As a representative. Thank you.
- It wasn't from me.

85
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,320
- He is...
- Actually, we chipped in.

86
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,860
It was from the members
of Running Man.

87
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,390
Actually, we chipped in.

88
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,730
- We all chipped in.
- As a representative.

89
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,800
This is a beach in Incheon...

90
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,270
where gold is hidden.

91
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,570
(Gold hungers are coming
after hearing about the gold.)

92
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,170
- After hearing the news,
- Let's do this.

93
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,170
- gold hunters are coming.
- Let's do this.

94
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,480
- We should do this.
- We're getting gold today.

95
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,250
Gold prices are rising a lot.

96
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,510
Besides you guys,

97
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,920
we have more hunters
who have come here.

98
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,490
- We're not alone.
- Please bring in the guests.

99
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,750
- One of them is a kid from Jongno.
- Really?

100
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,560
A kid from Jongno?
It must be your brother.

101
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,530
You'll see.
There is a kid from Jongno.

102
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,260
(Vroom)

103
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,670
(Today's guests are making a fuss
as they show up.)

104
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,170
- What...
- What's that?

105
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,270
- Be careful.
- What's that?

106
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,300
(The oldest of the Yangse Brothers,
Yang Se Hyeong)

107
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,340
(The returning Jeonsobari,
Jeon So Min)

108
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,370
- Jeonsobari is driving?
- Be careful.

109
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,110
The mother is
driving her kid around?

110
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,780
- Jeonsobari is driving.
- Hey.

111
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,110
There are my colleagues.

112
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,550
(They show up as if
they're going grocery shopping.)

113
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,380
- Be careful. You should stop there.
- Where are you headed?

114
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,650
- There are my colleagues.
- Be careful.

115
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,880
- Stop there.
- Hey.

116
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,490
- Nice to meet you.
- Jeonsobari.

117
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,020
- Hello.
- Hey.

118
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,260
What is this?

119
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,590
- That's cool.
- Turn off the engine.

120
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,660
Did you turn off the engine?

121
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,590
- Jeonsobari.
- I don't know how to turn it off.

122
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,490
- I don't know how to drive it.
- Hey.

123
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,500
(Jeon So Bal: Familiar
as if she were here yesterday)

124
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,900
You're like a member
who's back after a long time.

125
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,630
- Hello.
- You're here.

126
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,870
- So Bal.
- Hi.

127
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,440
- Hello.
- Hey. You're here.

128
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Hey, you kid from Jongno.

129
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,870
- How do I turn this off?
- I'll do it.

130
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,140
- Nice to see you, my colleague.
- Hey.

131
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,880
- A kid from Jongno?
- It's been a while, Mr. Jee.

132
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,510
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

133
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,910
- It's good to see you.
- Have you been doing well?

134
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,880
- It's good to see you.
- Hey.

135
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,090
(He makes a fuss and greets
the members except for his brother.)

136
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,650
Hey, he's obviously a small fry.

137
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,590
(Kid from Jongno:
A small fry from Dongducheon)

138
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,630
Compared to you guys,
I'm not a bigwig.

139
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,760
He's not powerful.
He's a small fry, obviously.

140
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,230
You're a kid from Jongno.

141
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,430
- Hey, you...
- Nice to meet you.

142
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,700
How does he look even younger now?

143
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,130
- A kid from Jongno.
- Compared to you guys,

144
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,800
I'm just a small-time thief.

145
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,140
Jeonsobari.

146
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,440
- Come here.
- Come here.

147
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,870
- Hello.
- She's wearing a skirt.

148
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,240
- By the way...
- Why did you lose weight?

149
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,540
(Looking away)

150
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,680
- You've lost a lot of weight.
- So Min.

151
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,380
- What's with you?
- Why are you being so defiant?

152
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,650
Are you playing your character?

153
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,850
(Yes.)

154
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,950
(Her character is Chewed Gum.)

155
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,790
- She practiced it a lot earlier.
- Practice what?

156
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,120
She was practicing her character.

157
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,420
- Really?
- Are you chewing gum?

158
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,860
She rehearsed it
on the stage over there.

159
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,190
Are you playing your character?

160
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,460
- Her character... She's so funny.
- So Bal.

161
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,500
- What? You're wearing a skirt.
- Of course.

162
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,370
- What's that?
- That makes us uncomfortable.

163
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,340
I was told to dress up.
I haven't done this in a while.

164
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,440
- Seok Jin, you see her every week.
- It's been a while...

165
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,540
Why are you acting
as if it's been a while?

166
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,240
- I know, right? He's acting.
- Is that right?

167
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,810
- You're right.
- We meet often.

168
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,410
Seok Jin. I bet you sent apples
to So Min, didn't you?

169
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,910
- I didn't.
- No. Did he send apples?

170
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,250
- No.
- He sent apples to people.

171
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,550
- I just...
- To whom?

172
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,280
Not the artists.
He sent them to the production crew.

173
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,750
He's serious about bribes.

174
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,950
Did you hide some cash in the box?

175
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,120
Maybe.

176
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,490
Seriously, he's my role model.

177
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,390
Today, we are having...

178
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,660
the Finders Keepers,
Gold Hungers Race.

179
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,170
You will use a metal detector
to find 50 gold coins...

180
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,440
that are scattered and hidden
here and there.

181
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,140
- Are they real gold?
- To find 50 gold coins...

182
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,870
(A whopping 50 gold coins)

183
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,070
- Are they real gold?
- For real?

184
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,540
- They're real gold.
- Real gold?

185
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,980
- They're real gold.
- For real.

186
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,510
The members who find the gold
get to take...

187
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,480
all of it as a prize.

188
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,750
- Come on!
- Really?

189
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,780
- Really?
- That's amazing.

190
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,450
(That means,
they will get what they find.)

191
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,620
- That's amazing.
- Unbelievable.

192
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,060
Gold is really expensive these days.

193
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,120
- That's amazing.
- I want to find it.

194
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,320
- What? How does it look?
- That's the gold.

195
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,430
This is real gold.

196
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,760
- My goodness.
- Do you have 50 of these?

197
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,660
- My gosh.
- Yes. We have 50 coins.

198
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,760
(A coin weighs 0.1g, so 50 coins
are worth 1,110 dollars.)

199
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,170
- That's crazy.
- Seok Jin, this is...

200
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,970
You'll receive benefits
to help you search for gold...

201
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,770
through missions.

202
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,970
After the first mission,

203
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,710
you'll be given different tools.

204
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,180
- The tools will be important.
- The tools? Right.

205
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,550
It would be great
to get a metal detector.

206
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,080
The metal detector
will be very useful.

207
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,150
It beeps, right?

208
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,550
- I've always wanted to try it.
- Can you find gold...

209
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,850
- It detects gold.
- with a metal detector?

210
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,020
- You can find it.
- Right.

211
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,260
- I will show you...
- Let's see.

212
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,960
- how you use it.
- So Min is back after a long time.

213
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,660
- Seok Jin.
- Place this part on the ground.

214
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,330
- Gosh, this is...
- Hey.

215
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,660
- Hang on.
- You will have to...

216
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,060
- search separately.
- What is this?

217
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,600
- It's gum.
- Hey.

218
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,800
Why did you give me your gum?

219
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,370
My gosh. The gum...

220
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,800
- This is why you're Chewed Gum.
- Right.

221
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,440
- Your nickname is Chewed Gum.
- Yes.

222
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,640
How do we use it?

223
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,710
Let's see.

224
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,810
What is this?

225
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,810
You should hold it up to the ground.

226
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,010
So, does each detector
work differently?

227
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,850
(With the advanced detector,
you can search for gold while standing.)

228
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,890
- Does it beep?
- How does this work?

229
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,950
It's turned on.

230
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,850
- Oh, dear.
- It's beeping.

231
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,320
- It makes the sound.
- This is my first time.

232
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,660
I have screws...

233
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,390
- in my ankle.
- Let me see.

234
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,690
- I have screws here.
- Where?

235
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,000
- His ankle.
- In my ankle.

236
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,360
- Oh, dear.
- Hey.

237
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,230
It's beeping.

238
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,370
I had surgery,
so I have screws in my ankle.

239
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,800
This is amazing.

240
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,600
Ji Hyo, try it here.

241
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,870
(He has screws in his knee.)

242
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,010
- This is a good one.
- It's beeping.

243
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,010
- Unbelievable.
- It's beeping.

244
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,810
- What's with your knee?
- I had knee surgery.

245
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,010
This is good.

246
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,450
I almost misunderstood you.

247
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,090
(Beeping)

248
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,620
- It's beeping.
- Even his face?

249
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,360
It's the glasses.

250
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,560
(Beeping)

251
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,560
- It's beeping.
- He has something in his nose.

252
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,660
(He has something in his nose.)

253
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,730
- Is that true?
- Sure.

254
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,760
I got my nose done.

255
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,800
- There's metal in there?
- This is...

256
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,170
- Did you get your nose done?
- It's my glasses.

257
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,500
- It's the glasses.
- That's why it beeped.

258
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,940
Each team will get the tools
after the mission.

259
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,740
- Okay.
- The tools will be commensurate...

260
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,040
- with the results.
- I see.

261
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,670
- We should win.
- By team.

262
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,410
We've already divided you
into teams.

263
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,450
- It's already decided.
- Jae Seok, Seok Jin,

264
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,880
Se Chan, and So Min
are on the same team.

265
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,580
Jong Kook, Haha, Ji Hyo,

266
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,120
Daniel, and Se Hyeong
are on the same team.

267
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,750
I don't have to be with Seok Jin.

268
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,820
"Seok Sam Play."

269
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,120
- I see him a lot outside the show.
- We're going to win.

270
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,260
- I see him often.
- We'll win.

271
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,490
They did that for you.

272
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,800
Switch him with someone young.

273
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,200
- My gosh.
- Please.

274
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,700
The members of
"The Manager" are there.

275
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,900
They're "The Manager."

276
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,030
- "The Manager."
- Okay.

277
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,240
(Meanwhile, Team Jong Kook
is in a good mood.)

278
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,000
- Good.
- Okay.

279
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,910
It can't be helped,
even if you lose it.

280
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,370
- It can't be helped.
- Right.

281
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,710
If you can lose it,
that means you can steal it as well.

282
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,010
- That's right.
- I see.

283
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,110
You know me, right?

284
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,180
(Chuckling)

285
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,310
- Look at him.
- That brat.

286
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,880
He's a little dangerous.

287
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,550
- There's madness in his eye.
- No.

288
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,650
(Ssaebssaeb's brother already shows
madness in his eye.)

289
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,060
Jong Kook. He can steal
a bicycle in three seconds.

290
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,290
(He can steal
a bicycle in 3 seconds.)

291
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,490
- Jong Kook.
- Go, and it's done.

292
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,930
- Go, and it's done.
- A bicycle in three seconds.

293
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,000
(It takes him only 2 seconds.)

294
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,130
Done.

295
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,970
A scooter? Done.

296
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,700
(The skill that raised Ssaebssaeb)

297
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,740
Good.

298
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,410
- Nice.
- That's good.

299
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,340
I like this family's jokes.

300
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,750
We will meet up again
after getting changed.

301
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,480
- Okay!
- All right.

302
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
- Get changed? Is this it?
- Is it over already?

303
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,550
I'm all dressed up,

304
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,350
but I get changed right away?
It's too soon.

305
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,220
Am I dressed like this
just for the opening?

306
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,260
- Hey.
- Yes. It's too soon.

307
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,590
You'll get changed anyway.

308
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,620
- Let's get changed.
- All right.

309
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,630
I'll clap.

310
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,260
Okay. This is nice.

311
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,500
(They get changed
so that they can chat comfortably.)

312
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,560
(They arrive at the 2nd floor of
the tidal flat experience center.)

313
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,170
- So, this is the view.
- My goodness.

314
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,400
What is this place?

315
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,700
- It has a nice view.
- What a nice view.

316
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,970
This is amazing.

317
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,510
It's pretty.

318
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,640
- Daniel, in the sea...
- My goodness.

319
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,210
- What?
- Why are you kicking me?

320
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,610
- Why did you kick him?
- What?

321
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,450
- What's going on?
- We look close.

322
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,820
Does kicking his buttocks
make you look friendly?

323
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,050
You should kick me once.

324
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,420
Can I kick you too?

325
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,120
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

326
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,120
Darn it.

327
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,590
(Sweating with his eyes)

328
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,160
You told me to kick you.

329
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,890
You kicked me really hard.

330
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,560
I gave you a gentle kick.

331
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,660
(The mean old man sowed the wind
and reaped the whirlwind.)

332
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,470
Haha, I want to become
close with you too.

333
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,800
- I'll become close with you first.
- No.

334
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,470
- I want to become close with you.
- No, I'll do it first.

335
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,500
I really want us
to be close friends. Seriously.

336
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,440
They're doing that.

337
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,110
(She trips her over right away.)

338
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,540
They've finally become close.

339
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,580
We're close now.

340
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,940
We're close.

341
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,480
- This is what I saw in winter.
- They've become close.

342
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,580
On my first day on Running Man.

343
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,850
- I won.
- She really likes it.

344
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,950
(At that moment,
So Bal counterattacks.)

345
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,890
So Bal really likes it.

346
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,620
(Replay)

347
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,960
So Min likes it.

348
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,090
So Min looks so happy.

349
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,130
I'm so upset.

350
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,230
What is this?

351
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,630
(What is this?)

352
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,060
Four people here.

353
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,600
Okay. What is this?

354
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,330
Here's the first mission,
which is for the tools.

355
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,740
- It's called Admit It or Not.
- Admit It or Not.

356
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,140
- Admit it or not.
- Admit it or not.

357
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,310
I like the name.

358
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,070
We should do well here
to get good tools.

359
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,540
- We should admit everything.
- Okay.

360
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,940
Each team takes turns...

361
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,080
asking a question
that the opposing team will find...

362
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,780
- difficult to admit.
- I see.

363
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,790
If three or more members
of the team admit the question,

364
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,690
- they can put down the team panel.
- Okay.

365
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,460
- If we admit?
- Yes. Those who admit it...

366
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,760
must provide the right reasons.

367
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,000
The production crew will decide...

368
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,870
whether to admit it or not,
depending on the situation.

369
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,170
- The whole team?
- The first team...

370
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,670
to put down four
of their team's panels wins.

371
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,900
The winning team will receive...

372
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,540
two high-performance
metal detectors,

373
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,410
while the losing team
will receive only one.

374
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,140
- We have to admit it.
- Anyway,

375
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,150
if the production crew agrees...

376
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,280
- that what you admit is true,
- All right.

377
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,580
we will post it on social media.

378
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,780
- On websites?
- Only when...

379
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,290
Yes. Only when you can accept it,
should you admit it.

380
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,460
We should be careful with our words.

381
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,390
- Of course.
- We all should be careful.

382
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,790
- All right.
- Let's be careful.

383
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,930
We need to find a balance
between the show and our private lives.

384
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,660
- We should do well.
- Okay.

385
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,960
- We should be careful.
- Right, So Min.

386
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,700
- Don't ask any weird questions.
- Don't say anything strange.

387
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,900
So Bal is... You know, right?

388
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,140
- She's like a time bomb.
- Right.

389
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,500
You know
why we should try hard today, right?

390
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,410
- This is about gold.
- Gold.

391
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,910
- This is about gold.
- So Bal is crazy...

392
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,610
- about gold.
- You know what?

393
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,440
- Gold is expensive now.
- I'm here to make money today.

394
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,910
(I'm here to make money today.)

395
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,310
- For her,
- Yes.

396
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,920
- this is all about business.
- Right.

397
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,120
- I have to win some gold today.
- You should.

398
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,590
Team Jong Kook will attack first.

399
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,750
We attack first?

400
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,020
- Okay.
- All right. Let's begin.

401
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,990
- We need to admit what they say.
- Right.

402
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,460
- We can just admit it.
- It's not difficult.

403
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,560
I want to crush them...

404
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,630
- from the beginning.
- Haha.

405
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,530
We need to warm up a little
at the beginning.

406
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,900
- Take it easy.
- We need to warm up.

407
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,470
- We should go back and forth.
- Right.

408
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,300
- Like a practice game.
- Hey, listen.

409
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,370
- We can't be too harsh?
- Look.

410
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,600
- We can crush them with this.
- We should start.

411
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,910
- Seriously, this is something...
- I see.

412
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,370
that will make them fight fiercely.

413
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,140
- Seok Jin and Jae Seok won't admit?
- No.

414
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,610
- Right.
- Okay.

415
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,650
- Let's do that.
- Here's why.

416
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,910
Jae Seok didn't do it.

417
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,950
You're right.

418
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,280
- What is it?
- Do what?

419
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,380
- This one?
- Go, Se Hyeong.

420
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,490
- All right. It's an easy question.
- Okay.

421
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,490
All right.

422
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,090
Have you...

423
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,960
kissed someone in the past week?

424
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,430
- In the past week.
- That's it?

425
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,960
- In the past week?
- You shouldn't lie.

426
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,130
- This is a simple question.
- It's not a peck on the lips.

427
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,930
- I did it this morning.
- Haha. So,

428
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,470
it should go back and forth, right?

429
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,640
- Exactly.
- Right.

430
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,110
It's not a peck on the lips.

431
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,770
It should go like this.

432
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,340
- You can't do it on your own.
- Kiss.

433
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,540
- Not a peck on the lips.
- An intense one.

434
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,780
- Intensely.
- Not a peck.

435
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,850
Right. It should be intense.

436
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,180
- It should go back and forth.
- Yes.

437
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,250
(But his face doesn't seem to know
the meaning of a kiss.)

438
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,850
- Not on my own?
- Not a peck.

439
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,150
- This is...
- You can't do it on your own.

440
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,350
- Seriously...
- An intense one.

441
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,520
(Tapping)

442
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,620
Did you do it?

443
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,120
- What?
- Are you doing it now?

444
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,460
(Come on out.)

445
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,390
(Hey, come with me.)

446
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,560
What's with her?

447
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,560
What?

448
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,130
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

449
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,970
(Love Frog just wants
to get it over with.)

450
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,700
Then I'll join you.

451
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,900
Hey.

452
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,570
Why are you being like this?

453
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,570
(Coming to get the scoop)

454
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,640
Hey.

455
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,580
(After a scuffle)

456
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,880
What's with her?

457
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,950
(They come back
while wiping their lips.)

458
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,250
This is hilarious.

459
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,220
(You should come out too.)

460
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,450
- You two?
- Forget it.

461
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,390
- What are you doing?
- Is it too much?

462
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,790
- It's too much.
- Is it?

463
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,220
- It's too much.
- Is it too much?

464
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,490
If you lie to us,
you'll end up in the inferno.

465
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,690
- Right.
- Of course.

466
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,400
- We will tell the truth.
- Is it that serious?

467
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,800
Even the inferno?

468
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,770
Does a half kiss count?

469
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,870
Does a half kiss count?

470
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,800
No.

471
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,000
It's not a half clutch.

472
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,540
- Jae Seok.
- It's not a half clutch.

473
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,510
- A half kiss.
- That doesn't count.

474
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,780
- No.
- Isn't a half kiss okay?

475
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,980
- No.
- Jae Seok.

476
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,080
- Listen.
- Well...

477
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,410
So, what is a half kiss like?

478
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,520
If it's half,
you tried to kiss your wife,

479
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,580
and she wouldn't open her lips.

480
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,890
(His wife refused to open her lips.)

481
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,220
Hey, you can't say that.

482
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,390
You went to her,

483
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,020
but you failed and came back?
Is that a half kiss?

484
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,130
- I mean...
- "Gosh, I'm sorry."

485
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,000
(It's like a courtship
of a reptile.)

486
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,930
- Hey.
- Hey, that's not it.

487
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,230
- The door was closed?
- You were refused entry?

488
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,600
He approached her,
but he was refused entry and withdrew.

489
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,700
Don't go that far.

490
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,710
- A half kiss?
- Don't go that far.

491
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,970
- A half kiss.
- A half kiss doesn't count.

492
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,310
- It totally counts.
- No.

493
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,310
- No.
- A half kiss.

494
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,180
- Knock, knock.
- You know, we live...

495
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,050
- with our children, so...
- Right.

496
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,120
- The circumstances didn't allow.
- You tried,

497
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,720
but you had to stop
because of your children.

498
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,120
There can be circumstances.

499
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,150
So, a half kiss should count.

500
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,150
It doesn't count.

501
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,260
Our question is about a kiss,
so a half one doesn't count.

502
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,790
Our question is
about a complete kiss.

503
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,760
- I see.
- We have only four panels.

504
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,030
- How much...
- It has to be a full kiss?

505
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,130
- A full kiss.
- It should be a complete kiss.

506
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,930
- This question is quite easy.
- Right.

507
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,630
- This isn't easy.
- Seok Jin.

508
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,300
What about you?

509
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,100
- I...
- During the remind wedding?

510
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,440
He's no joke.

511
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,610
- Seok Jin is a kiss fanatic.
- He's a fanatic.

512
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,310
- He always kisses.
- He's addicted to it.

513
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,740
- Why?
- He made Hyun Woo only with kisses.

514
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,580
- What?
- Only with kisses.

515
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,180
- Only with kisses?
- Is that possible?

516
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,650
It's possible. You can do it.

517
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,580
- Tell them how good you are.
- Listen.

518
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,090
I'm telling you.

519
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,790
It's about my couple,
so this is a little embarrassing,

520
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,360
but we do it like five times a week.

521
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,490
- Come on.
- Kiss?

522
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,660
We're on the same team,
but that's too much.

523
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,760
Five times a week?

524
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,900
I mean...
I know it is hard to believe, but...

525
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,530
Seok Jin, be honest.
I know you don't do that.

526
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,800
- I know you don't do that.
- But to be honest...

527
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,870
- You don't kiss your wife?
- I kissed her last night.

528
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,040
- I did too.
- You're lying.

529
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,240
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Call her now.

530
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,680
- Call her and ask her yourself.
- Go ahead and call her.

531
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,740
Call her.

532
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,640
- Seriously...
- This is driving me crazy.

533
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,850
- But...
- He's being ridiculous.

534
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,510
- I'm calling her now.
- Go ahead.

535
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,550
I did kiss her last night.

536
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,250
- It was really crazy.
- I think Haha will...

537
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,350
- The person is not answering.
- She's...

538
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,760
(Rejected)

539
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,790
- I'm serious.
- Come on.

540
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,430
- I'm serious.
- You are on bad terms now.

541
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,800
- Yesterday...
- It was crazy yesterday.

542
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,370
- Don't be absurd.
- She must've hated it.

543
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,700
Your wife must've hated it so much.

544
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,670
She hated you so much
that she turned her phone off.

545
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,800
Forget it.

546
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,710
- Se Chan didn't do it, right?
- He didn't.

547
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,970
In the past week.

548
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,610
- Se Chan, where did it happen?
- Come on.

549
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,080
- That's...
- What is it, Se Chan?

550
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,580
We have Yang Se Hyeong here.

551
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,750
- I don't think he has a girlfriend.
- Really?

552
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,280
- Is that what you know?
- Even if he doesn't,

553
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,320
he can still kiss.

554
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,780
- He doesn't have a girlfriend.
- I mean...

555
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,450
- He's seeing someone.
- I'm seeing someone.

556
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,820
- Then you can kiss.
- But I could've kissed...

557
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,720
someone in the past week...

558
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,120
while playing some games
or something.

559
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,330
- What game?
- While playing games?

560
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,130
- Did you play the King Game?
- Do you play the King Game?

561
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,660
Do people still play
the King Game these days?

562
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,570
(His kissing story doesn't add up.)

563
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,070
Do people still play
the King Game these days?

564
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,370
- The King Game?
- The King Game?

565
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,340
I just played some games.

566
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,470
- You're lying.
- I kissed while playing games.

567
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,640
- In the past week?
- Are you serious?

568
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,680
- Yes.
- That doesn't sound right.

569
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,410
- With whom?
- Who was that?

570
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,010
- Who?
- He can't tell you who it is.

571
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,710
How did you meet her?
Who else was there?

572
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,850
How can I tell you that?

573
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,450
- Can it count when it was a game?
- How many seconds?

574
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,350
About ten seconds as part of a game.

575
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,490
- Ten seconds?
- You kissed her for ten seconds?

576
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,990
- For ten seconds?
- That's plausible.

577
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,090
- For ten seconds?
- Is this for real?

578
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,960
They could've been told
to kiss for ten seconds.

579
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,160
- Exactly.
- That's plausible.

580
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,600
It was at a Japanese pub.

581
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,160
- I don't believe it.
- Which pub was it?

582
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,300
- Was it in a room?
- Wait.

583
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,670
I'm going to call the pub owner.

584
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,000
Get the other person on the phone.

585
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,840
Call her. Then we'll believe you.

586
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,370
- Call her.
- Did other people see you?

587
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,540
- Was anyone with you?
- Produce a witness.

588
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,280
Would you believe me if I said
we played the game alone?

589
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,340
- Seriously?
- Come on.

590
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,210
Would you believe me if I said
we played the game alone?

591
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,280
(He ends up getting caught
telling a lie.)

592
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,650
- As if that made sense.
- It was just us two!

593
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,920
We got bored and played a game.

594
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,390
- Was that the penalty?
- Then you'd be kissing...

595
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,320
no matter who loses.

596
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,960
- Hey!
- We need proof.

597
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,860
How could you tell them?

598
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,060
Are you kidding me?

599
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,730
- So Min, stop that.
- So Min...

600
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,230
Stop being my mystery woman.

601
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,470
"How could you tell them?"

602
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,830
I guess you missed us a lot.

603
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,040
- You should come by often...
- So Min.

604
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,910
to share ideas with us.

605
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,240
I heard you might be joining
as one of the writers.

606
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,740
- Se Chan, would you be okay...
- Hold on.

607
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,250
with a news article
stating that you recently...

608
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,780
kissed a woman in a bar in Hongdae?

609
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,590
("Running News,
Exclusive, Yang Se Chan,")

610
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,520
("Kissed a Woman in Hongdae
While Engaged in a Game")

611
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,160
- I'm 40 now, you know.
- So Min.

612
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,930
I'm 40 now!

613
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,190
You'll have them write
an article about this?

614
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,660
How can we prove
that we kissed someone?

615
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,630
We can't accept your answers.

616
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,400
- Sure.
- It's now your turn...

617
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,630
to ask the question.

618
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,970
- Got it.
- I feel wronged.

619
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,070
You take this.

620
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,540
Guys, let's tell the truth.

621
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,040
- Absolutely.
- Of course.

622
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,510
We'll be able to support our claims.

623
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,980
- We'll be able to back them up.
- Of course.

624
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,350
- They can't admit to it.
- They're business owners,

625
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,620
and Se Hyeong owns a building.

626
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,350
We should ask them a question
that involves their work.

627
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,650
We'll go with that one.

628
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,090
We have our question.
You'll answer it truthfully.

629
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,430
- Exactly.
- We were truthful earlier.

630
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,990
- Okay.
- We'll be truthful.

631
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,260
- It's an easy one.
- Se Chan, go for it.

632
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,260
Here's your question.

633
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,730
- We have nothing to lose.
- My...

634
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,270
IQ is below 100.

635
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,070
(Q: My IQ is below 100.)

636
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,100
- That's me.
- Hey!

637
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,810
- I'm as dumb as an anteater.
- There.

638
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,770
I think that's true.

639
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,140
- I think that was my test score.
- Hold on.

640
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,080
(What they asked
doesn't hurt their ego.)

641
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,150
- To be honest,
- I think that was my test score.

642
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,250
back in ninth grade,

643
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,950
when I was going through puberty,

644
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,520
- I got my IQ tested.
- I see.

645
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,560
- The score was 97.
- Really?

646
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,690
- Really?
- Was it below 100?

647
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,200
- Yes.
- I swear I'm telling the truth.

648
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,860
I was never told
what I scored on my IQ test.

649
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,200
- Why not?
- Probably to spare me...

650
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
the heartache.

651
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,330
They keep the scores from geniuses.

652
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,900
- No one told me.
- There's a club for geniuses.

653
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,910
Why didn't my teacher
tell me my test score?

654
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,670
- Not to get punched.
- Do they always tell you?

655
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,710
(Were they hiding his IQ score
to protect the teacher?)

656
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,280
- His teacher?
- Yes.

657
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,280
Jong Kook, your IQ is 87.

658
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,310
- What?
- Seriously. No one told me.

659
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,950
That's why I don't know
what I scored.

660
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,080
- From what I recall...
- Then you scored below 100.

661
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,250
- Yours is below 100.
- Right.

662
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,820
Ji Hyo, is your IQ below 100?

663
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,220
Yes, it's below 100.

664
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,360
- Do you admit it?
- We all know this.

665
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,060
- What did you score?
- She has the eyes of someone...

666
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,160
with an IQ below 100.

667
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,660
Do the times tables with me.

668
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,330
What's 4 times 7?

669
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,430
- What did he say?
- Answer me.

670
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,600
See how she is.
She even forgot what you asked.

671
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,270
I have trouble focusing,
and my IQ is low.

672
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,710
- Ji Hyo.
- Look at her being honest.

673
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,340
- Let's be honest.
- Really?

674
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,510
Anyone who has worked
with Ji Hyo long enough...

675
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,840
should admit that.

676
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,680
Right?

677
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,250
Hold on.

678
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,950
What can we say to that?

679
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,620
- Then...
- Protect her dignity, will you?

680
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,650
- It's true.
- Protect her dignity.

681
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,460
- Let's admit that.
- Hang in there a while longer.

682
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,690
Let's admit that.

683
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,090
Fine, we'll say it's true
about Ji Hyo.

684
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,460
- We'll accept Ji Hyo's answer.
- We'll admit that.

685
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,660
Daniel, what about you?

686
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,860
- My IQ is higher than you think.
- He has a high IQ.

687
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,330
I'm sorry to ask this,
but take off your glasses.

688
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,470
- I have an IQ of 135.
- Take off your glasses.

689
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,540
- He looks so dumb.
- Isn't he...

690
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,810
You're helping us by saying that.

691
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,510
- You're helping us out.
- See how he doesn't get the game.

692
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,080
I know.
He doesn't understand the game.

693
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,380
- He keeps asking us.
- He keeps asking about the rules.

694
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,510
Daniel's the only one
who doesn't understand the game.

695
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,750
Se Hyeong, don't you...

696
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,120
- have an IQ below 100?
- You know me.

697
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,420
You'll be officially admitting this.

698
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,320
I did my best on the CSAT,

699
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,420
but I only scored an 88.

700
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,020
- That's because you didn't study.
- Also,

701
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,960
there's more.

702
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,630
I had my IQ tested sometime...

703
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,160
in middle school or high school.

704
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,760
Even though I did my best
on that test,

705
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,470
I still ended up with a score
of 92 or 93.

706
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,330
- Is that true?
- Se Hyeong.

707
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,240
Se Chan and I...

708
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,740
No way. You're the genius
in our family!

709
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,910
You're the only one in our family
to have an IQ over 100.

710
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,310
- I...
- Tell the truth!

711
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,780
There's a reason
I'm telling you this.

712
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,350
- Dad graduated from a top school.
- They're hilarious.

713
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,950
You might think we could...

714
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,480
- take after our dad.
- Sure.

715
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,720
I couldn't get good grades
no matter how hard I tried.

716
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,190
I saw a post on social media...

717
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,020
saying you inherit...

718
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,860
- your intelligence from your mom.
- I see.

719
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,730
Our mom?

720
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,760
Jong Kook!

721
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,860
What was that? Jong Kook!

722
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,930
(A slip of the tongue)

723
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,000
- Grab him.
- Hey!

724
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
- Grab him.
- Unbelievable.

725
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,070
You insulted both me and my brother.

726
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,840
I wasn't insulting anyone,
only repeating what I read.

727
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,640
- I resented my mom as well.
- It's true.

728
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,910
That's a known fact.

729
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,110
- It was published in a thesis.
- You take after your mom.

730
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,810
It was funny to see him catch on
to what Jong Kook meant.

731
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,320
- "What?"
- Unbelievable.

732
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,120
I reacted that way
since it felt true.

733
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,920
- That was hilarious.
- Are the four of you...

734
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,290
officially admitting to having...

735
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,720
- an IQ below 100?
- Yes, mine is below 100.

736
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,860
- It's true.
- You're not lying about this.

737
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,730
- Whose IQ is below 100?
- I think my score was under 100.

738
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,760
- Raise your hand.
- Raise your hand if it's you.

739
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,330
- Under 100.
- Here.

740
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,530
Then...

741
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,930
Will they score a point?

742
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,900
- In return,
- Of course, we will.

743
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,270
we'll post about this
on social media.

744
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,840
- Say our IQ is 70.
- Did you say 70?

745
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,440
- Yes, let's make it 70.
- Give people a laugh.

746
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,810
Everyone will believe it's true.

747
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,650
What will Dream and So Wool think?

748
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,110
It's the truth.

749
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,310
Nice.

750
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,750
- Ji Hyo's is low for sure.
- Like that?

751
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,090
Hit us with your question.

752
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,320
I recommend this one.

753
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,660
- Go for it.
- Can I ask this?

754
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,720
Go ahead.

755
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,860
- "Yu Jae Seok..."
- Yu Jae Seok?

756
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,130
"is the best-looking member
on your team,"

757
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,900
"and you can list
three reasons why."

758
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,430
This is easy!

759
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,730
- Of course.
- I mean...

760
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,770
Can you list three reasons?

761
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,600
How easy is that? Let's go.

762
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,440
I've always thought that.

763
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,540
- Is that so?
- We have material to counter that.

764
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,180
- If you can tell them why...
- We have video to prove it.

765
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,880
- Take off your glasses.
- Yes, take them off.

766
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,050
The others will list the reasons.

767
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,410
Tell them why you agree.

768
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,650
- Take them off.
- Can he also agree?

769
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,350
(Showing them his true face)

770
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,820
Seriously!

771
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,160
(His beauty leaves them speechless.)

772
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,460
Can you please put them back on?

773
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,190
- It's like I said.
- Take them off!

774
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,330
(He quickly hides
behind the mask again.)

775
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,870
Take them off!

776
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,200
Jong Kook, nice.

777
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,170
(They've always pointed out
Jae Seok's looks.)

778
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,540
(His teeth are like this!)

779
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,180
(No one would buy his face
even at a garage sale.)

780
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,910
(He can't spit straight.)

781
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,450
(When he spits, it goes sideways.)

782
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,220
(They always made fun
of Jae Seok's looks.)

783
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,120
- Go ahead, Seok Jin.
- I...

784
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,850
You have such nice skin.

785
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,320
- Good. You'll each say one thing.
- Your skin...

786
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,760
- I...
- is milky fair.

787
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,860
You'll each say one thing.

788
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,490
- Jae Seok.
- We have video evidence.

789
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,530
- You have long limbs.
- Right.

790
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,030
You also look great in suits.

791
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,630
- That's it.
- So Min. Then how about this?

792
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,070
I'll believe you
if you can look at him...

793
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,370
without his glasses on
for five seconds.

794
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,100
- You can't laugh.
- Without laughing.

795
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,640
Why would she laugh
when he's good-looking?

796
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,740
Why would she giggle?

797
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,640
- Look like you're falling in love.
- So Min.

798
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,280
- I can do this.
- She's a fine actress.

799
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,910
- Okay. Jae Seok, stand up.
- I'm counting on you.

800
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,080
- Both of you, stand up.
- Come up to the front.

801
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
- Then...
- So Min, there's no reason...
for you to laugh.

802
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
Take off your glasses.

803
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,250
- Here.
- Got it.

804
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,220
- I'll take them off.
- Jae Seok...

805
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,990
- is handsome.
- That's right.

806
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,590
- Jae Seok is like Cha Eun Woo.
- Okay.

807
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,130
Jae Seok is like Gong Myoung.

808
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,690
(Jae Seok is like Cha Eun Woo.
Jae Seok is like Gong Myoung.)

809
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,500
- You can't laugh.
- It's for five seconds.

810
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,100
With the sea behind him,

811
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,430
he'll look like a fish.

812
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,770
(Can So Min hold in her laughter
for 5 seconds?)

813
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,900
So Min, hold it in for five seconds.

814
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,170
- Jae Seok is handsome.
- She's good.

815
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,570
(Getting immersed)

816
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
Go!

817
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,350
And go!

818
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,550
A spipefish.

819
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,980
(A spipefish)

820
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,220
- Why are you laughing?
- Why did you laugh?

821
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,160
- Why did you burst out laughing?
- Are you kidding me?

822
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,630
Rather than just looking at me,
she went like this.

823
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,100
(Putting on her acting face)

824
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,700
She looked heartbroken.

825
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,770
- Why did you laugh?
- Why did you look at me like that?

826
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,570
- Why did you laugh?
- Her face was hilarious.

827
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,370
- I was a woman in love.
- Try that again.

828
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,940
- Couldn't she just look at me?
- Try that again.

829
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,540
- And go.
- Ready, go.

830
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,140
An Atka mackerel.

831
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,510
(Despite the interference, So Min
still gives him a loving gaze.)

832
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,580
- Don't get into character!
- Hey!

833
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,680
Go.

834
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,750
An Atka mackerel.

835
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,920
(A corny gaze)

836
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,860
- Don't get emotional.
- She lasted five seconds.

837
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,260
You were staring between his eyes.

838
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,660
You should've looked into his eyes.

839
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,560
- There. She did it.
- She succeeded.

840
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,870
- That smile showed my love for him.
- She was smiling.

841
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,000
- I was just smiling.
- It was only a smile.

842
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,940
- She succeeded.
- She was acting just now.

843
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,770
He's so cool.

844
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,410
- You should all look at him.
- Seriously.

845
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,240
- He's so cool.
- She sold her soul.

846
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,540
Check out his skin.

847
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,810
- Let me remind you...
- Yes.

848
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,110
- that he's over 50.
- Exactly.

849
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,280
So to have that skin?

850
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,320
- Look how clean his skin is.
- Right?

851
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,220
Also, check out his nose. Look.

852
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,390
- What about his nose?
- Exactly.

853
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,590
Only actors have noses
that good-looking.

854
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,460
- He didn't get any work done.
- This is all a lie.

855
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,190
- Did you get plastic surgery?
- I didn't.

856
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,600
You didn't?

857
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,930
- Seriously?
- Are you kidding me?

858
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,000
For real?

859
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,200
- That gave me the chills.
- How brazen are you?

860
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:07,340
(His natural face)

861
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,110
(Not even a little)

862
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,810
- That gave me the chills.
- How brazen are you?

863
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,410
"Did you get plastic surgery?"
"I didn't."

864
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,140
No one has ever accused him
of getting plastic surgery.

865
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,310
- Didn't you get braces?
- I didn't.

866
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,110
- I couldn't tell.
- I didn't get any work done.

867
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,820
- Really?
- I'm in my natural state.

868
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,950
I'm not lying.

869
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,250
- He's good-looking.
- He's handsome.

870
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,250
Seok Jin, you're uglier
than he is now.

871
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,790
- You want to be like him.
- Of course.

872
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,220
- For a month.
- That'll be posted on social media.

873
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,360
- That'll be posted.
- Go ahead.

874
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,060
- The three of them admitted it.
- All right.

875
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,630
- Okay.
- Okay!

876
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,830
- You can drop one of the signs.
- Okay.

877
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,970
- Okay.
- Okay.

878
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,630
From now on,
Jae Seok is the best-looking one...

879
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,970
- out of all of you.
- That's right.

880
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,370
- Among us four.
- Sure thing.

881
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,270
You can get to my level
by trying hard.

882
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,640
- You know...
- What a relief.

883
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
- It's about winning the game.
- I'm glad we scored.

884
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,680
- Sure.
- Moving on.

885
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,250
What can we ask?

886
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,480
(The teams are tied,
and Team Jae Seok aims to strike back.)

887
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,420
How about this?

888
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,820
"Even now,
I dream of dating someone."

889
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,950
- How's that?
- Three people on that team...

890
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,020
- Say love.
- are unwed.

891
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,460
- If three of them say yes...
- You're right.

892
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,760
That's not good for us.

893
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,060
Look at him trying to eavesdrop.

894
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,860
- Don't listen.
- I have a question.

895
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,930
- "The Manager."
- Yes, what?

896
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,270
I have a question. Why whisper
when we can still hear you?

897
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,740
- That's our rule.
- You can hear us?

898
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,110
We're sitting too close.

899
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,710
We're the weirdos.
We pretend they're inaudible.

900
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,840
- Right?
- I'll think of something else.

901
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,410
- Yes, that. Okay.
- That's a good one.

902
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,950
Go with that. So Min, you say it.

903
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,420
- So Min will be mean for once.
- Go for it.

904
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,250
- This is a good one.
- Brace yourselves.

905
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,390
Have a go.

906
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,960
- You must be honest.
- Yes.

907
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,090
- It'll be in the news.
- I know this about some of you.

908
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,460
- Okay, go.
- Currently, right now,

909
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,590
I'm dating passionately.

910
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,600
- Oh, dear.
- Dating passionately.

911
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,800
(I'm currently
dating someone passionately.)

912
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,540
- You're dating.
- Dating passionately.

913
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,540
Not with your wife.

914
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,610
- That's right.
- Not with your wife.

915
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,540
I always think that I'm dating.

916
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,750
- No, Haha. Not with your wife.
- Not with your wife.

917
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,310
We have two married men.

918
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,680
- That's their problem.
- You never know.

919
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,050
- Then don't admit to it.
- They could be dating too.

920
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,550
(A cheating husband
or a singleton's scandal)

921
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,860
(3 people must admit to it.)

922
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,860
- Me?
- There's just one.

923
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,560
Can we name someone else?

924
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,330
- Yes. If you witnessed it.
- Me.

925
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,860
I saw Haha with another woman.
I swear.

926
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,070
I saw Haha with another woman.

927
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,640
(The Dongducheon Bike Thief
gives up his teammate.)

928
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,040
No way.

929
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,340
Admit to it,
and it'll be in the news.

930
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,440
It's up to you.

931
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,310
- Do you admit to it?
- Hand-in-hand...

932
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,010
There's a quiet alleyway
in Hapjeong-dong.

933
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,750
I saw him with her hand-in-hand.

934
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,550
I called him. I thought
it was his wife, but it wasn't.

935
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,920
I asked who she was, and he said,
"Se Hyeong, it's a secret."

936
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,820
Okay, so you two.

937
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,460
- Just don't admit to it.
- Say no.

938
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,390
- Don't admit to it.
- It's true.

939
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,600
Don't admit to it.

940
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,760
Do you admit to it, Haha?

941
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,960
- Yes or no?
- You don't have to.

942
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,700
- This story.
- We need three yeses.

943
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,000
- Yes.
- These three can say yes.

944
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,240
Her name was Jeong Yeon, right?
You were with Jeong Yeon.

945
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,740
We don't have to say yes.

946
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,540
What a story. Help me out, guys.

947
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

948
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,340
- I have...
- You have someone.

949
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,850
- I'm dating.
- Who is it?

950
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,380
- We need details.
- You have a girlfriend?

951
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,880
- Your date will be in the news.
- You must name her.

952
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,050
- Write about it. It's fine.
- Wait.

953
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,120
What does she do? Tell us.

954
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,460
So, she's in the US.

955
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,490
- Okay. Are you dating right now?
- Where is she?

956
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,190
- Yes.
- Where in the US?

957
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,290
- It's...
- Where?

958
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,630
San Francisco.

959
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,300
San Francisco.

960
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,730
- How old is she? Her name.
- She's in her mid-thirties.

961
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,400
(Speaking without hesitation)

962
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
(The most important detail)

963
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,670
Why do you need a name?

964
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,370
We can bleep it out
so it doesn't air.

965
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,640
Yes, we'll bleep it out.

966
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,350
- Carolena?
- What?

967
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,750
- Carolena?
- Is she American?

968
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,910
- Carolena.
- Darn it.

969
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,680
- Carolena.
- Carolina?

970
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,280
- Carolina.
- Carolina?

971
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,590
- Carolina.
- You made it up.

972
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,750
It's too obviously a lie.

973
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,360
(Ms. Carolina from San Francisco)

974
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,530
- Lies don't count.
- I saw her.

975
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,330
- You saw her?
- Carolina and...

976
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,830
You two. Draw her face.

977
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,430
Yes, do it.

978
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,030
Why not? Let's do it.

979
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,470
- I'll draw her face.
- If you're seeing her.

980
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,130
- Draw her for me.
- You must stay apart.

981
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,500
If the drawings are the same,
we'll give you a point.

982
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,310
- Hey.
- Her hairstyle's important.

983
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,240
- Size of her eyes.
- Stay apart as you draw.

984
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,440
Not another word, and just draw.

985
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,740
I have an ideal type.

986
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,380
- Go over there and draw.
- Okay.

987
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,410
You sit right there.

988
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,550
- Be detailed.
- Draw her.

989
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,120
- Get the hair right too.
- Keep talking.

990
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,020
Don't lie for the program's sake.

991
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,550
- Be detailed.
- I saw her.

992
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,150
I really saw them.

993
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,160
- The two of them?
- Yes.

994
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,560
What about Ji Hyo and Se Hyeong?

995
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,430
- Se Hyeong.
- Well, me...

996
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,330
I feel bad for Se Chan.

997
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,960
- Why?
- Because...

998
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,670
I didn't share all the details.

999
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,870
I feel bad
to share this on TV first.

1000
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,300
- It's fine. Say it.
- Oh, dear.

1001
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:37,570
- I've been dating for two years.
- For real?

1002
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,140
(He just found out
his brother has been dating.)

1003
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,410
Stop with the nonsense.

1004
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,650
Why would you lie?

1005
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,810
- It sounds very sincere.
- Is it true?

1006
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,720
I love to dance,
and she's a choreographer.

1007
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,190
- She's a dancer.
- Yes.

1008
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,150
- Is this actually true?
- Is she part of a team?

1009
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,260
She is part of a team,
and you might know her by name.

1010
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,960
- That team...
- I can't say.

1011
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,060
Give us the name of her team.

1012
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,760
- Wait. I think...
- The team's name.

1013
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
I think there's a spy in our midst.

1014
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,030
- Can you whisper it to me?
- Okay.

1015
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,930
- I'll give you the first letter.
- Okay.

1016
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,170
Y.

1017
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,700
What team? YG?

1018
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,210
I can't tell.

1019
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,510
- There's only YG.
- Really?

1020
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,180
(Pondering)

1021
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,980
He said YG because he can see
the YG headquarters from his place.

1022
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,120
And his regular jogging route
takes him by the building.

1023
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,050
He jogs around the YG building.

1024
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,360
They need three votes,
and Se Hyeong...

1025
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,920
- and Ji Hyo...
- There's no way.

1026
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,030
- If the drawings don't match...
- It's over.

1027
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:32,060
It's game over.
They don't get a point.

1028
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,770
Are you drawing
the comedian Choi Yang Rak?

1029
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,170
(What on earth did he draw?)

1030
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,840
- It looks like a guy.
- Right now...

1031
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,740
- It won't work.
- He'd be better off without her.

1032
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,840
- Haha said he saw her.
- Yes.

1033
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,410
- They must look similar.
- They should.

1034
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,610
Let's see the likeness.

1035
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,240
- Okay.
- This is hilarious.

1036
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,250
- Let's see their drawings.
- Let's see.

1037
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,850
(Revealing Haha's drawing first)

1038
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:56,350
Is this your girlfriend?

1039
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,060
- Hey.
- She's cute.

1040
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,260
(Niel's girlfriend has a bob-cut.)

1041
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,960
- She's cute.
- They're totally different.

1042
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,030
- They're similar!
- That's it!

1043
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,560
- She's cute.
- She was cute.

1044
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,430
- This is...
- They're totally different.

1045
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,060
(They both drew her with a bob?)

1046
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,270
- This was before her haircut.
- They're similar!

1047
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,630
The hair's the same length.

1048
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,100
- How is this the same person?
- They're similar.

1049
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,170
- No.
- No way.

1050
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,310
The eyes...

1051
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,170
Why are there so many spots?

1052
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,410
- Acne.
- They're...

1053
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,440
What's this, then?

1054
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,050
The Adam's apple.

1055
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,180
- What?
- No, it's a skin tag.

1056
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,080
- A skin tag.
- She can't have an Adam's apple.

1057
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,820
- She had an Adam's apple?
- Next to her ears.

1058
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,750
- I drew Choi Yang Rak.
- They're out, right?

1059
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,050
(Haha's unbiased comment
brought it to an end.)

1060
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,420
- I drew Choi Yang Rak.
- Hey.

1061
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,660
- They're out, right?
- They don't get a point.

1062
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,030
- It's nonsense.
- Now switch turns.

1063
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,030
- Okay.
- Nice attack.

1064
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,760
- Nice attack.
- It's okay.

1065
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,960
I honestly thought...

1066
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,430
This is dragging on a bit.

1067
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,800
- It is.
- We'll switch to two yeses.

1068
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,940
- I think we should do that.
- That's quite right.

1069
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,110
- Give them something that hurts.
- Please do.

1070
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,740
- This is hard to agree to.
- Yes, this one.

1071
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,580
- This is a tough one.
- Let's go with that.

1072
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,280
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1073
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,420
"I'm quick-witted and can adlib
at a second's notice."

1074
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,750
(I'm quick-witted and can adlib
at a second's notice.)

1075
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,490
- At a second's notice?
- Well, of course.

1076
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,160
- You know...
- Just a nudge will do.

1077
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,460
Say endless acrostic poems.

1078
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,590
Yes or no?

1079
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,960
You can't make us do that endlessly.

1080
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,600
You can do it if you're quick-witted
and can improvise.

1081
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,970
- Role playing.
- Yes, role playing.

1082
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,740
- Improvising...
- Make us laugh with whatever prop.

1083
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,800
- Yes.
- Do all that.

1084
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,740
- That's easy.
- Adlib jokes got me this far.

1085
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,040
- What did you say?
- Did we ever have a script?

1086
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,140
Whether it's funny or not...

1087
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,480
- doesn't matter.
- Yes.

1088
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,950
No, it should be funny.

1089
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,110
- The crew and the cameramen.
- You bet.

1090
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,750
- They must all laugh.
- Of course.

1091
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,950
If they don't laugh,
it was just a monologue.

1092
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,920
- You bet. Give me anything.
- Of course.

1093
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,520
- Like what?
- Okay. Se Chan.

1094
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,260
Make us laugh with this.

1095
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,490
(Tossing a pen)

1096
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,490
(His brother challenged him
with a pen.)

1097
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,560
Just like that?

1098
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,660
- Isn't that easy?
- That's easy.

1099
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,300
- This is easy.
- It's easy.

1100
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,200
- Isn't it easy?
- It's easy.

1101
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,940
- It's easy.
- What's that?

1102
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,910
- It's too easy.
- It's so easy.

1103
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,470
So Min, come here. It's easy.

1104
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,580
- It's easy.
- Look.

1105
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,810
(The mustache trio
formed in no time.)

1106
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,180
- It's easy.
- Come on.

1107
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,380
- You gave him an easy task.
- Calm down.

1108
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,820
The Yang brothers planned this.

1109
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,160
- This one...
- It was too easy.

1110
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,120
- It's too easy.
- He got help.

1111
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,030
- It's too easy.
- I did it.

1112
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,330
- Yes.
- It's done, right?

1113
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,430
- What else is there?
- One of us nailed it.

1114
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,130
- So Min.
- Se Chan passed.

1115
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,700
So Min. Give her a task.

1116
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,000
- An acrostic poem's easy.
- You think so?

1117
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,840
- Give her an acrostic poem.
- An acrostic poem?

1118
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,010
(The word for the initials)

1119
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,910
- Yeongjong Island.
- Y.

1120
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,580
- You know...
- A good start.

1121
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,380
I promised to love only you.

1122
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,010
- Good.
- J.

1123
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,550
(The Love Frog is still at it.)

1124
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,690
Jenuinely, really,
I promised to love...

1125
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,390
- only you.
- That's it.

1126
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,490
I.

1127
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,130
I can't...

1128
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,460
I can't...

1129
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,660
(They can't bear to listen.)

1130
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,130
- I can't...
- This is fantastic stuff.

1131
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,270
- I can't help it, Jong Kook.
- It's funny.

1132
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,840
- I promised not to love you.
- It's funny.

1133
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,240
It's funny.

1134
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,570
What's funny?

1135
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,740
- It's so funny.
- You win if you pull it off.

1136
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,740
- Okay.
- Jae Seok. Y.

1137
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,780
Young Sik.

1138
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,550
- J.
- You're done for. Just go for it.

1139
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,550
- Just say whatever.
- Go for it.

1140
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,350
I would like to hear more
about Young Sik.

1141
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,050
- Young Sik.
- J.

1142
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:21,360
Jongno, was it?
Isn't that where we met?

1143
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,560
(The Nation's Beloved Host
pushes on.)

1144
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,860
- What?
- He's forcing his luck.

1145
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,060
He's using a dialect too.

1146
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,430
- Jongno...
- He has nothing but confidence.

1147
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,970
- I.
- We met in Jongno.

1148
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,940
- That's what I like. Now I.
- I.

1149
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,170
- I.
- I.

1150
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,040
Isn't you a weirdo?

1151
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,810
(A powerful finale!)

1152
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,310
- Well done!
- Well done!

1153
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,050
Are you insane?

1154
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:46,320
I suddenly feel at ease
because Jae Seok...

1155
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,820
Even he cusses when he can't
think of anything else.

1156
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,550
- "Isn't you a weirdo?"
- "Isn't you a weirdo?"

1157
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,750
- Keep going!
- He gives...

1158
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,690
He gives others hope, right?

1159
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,290
You give people hope and dreams.

1160
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,660
- Don't give up.
- He earned that.

1161
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,860
- That was good enough.
- Right?

1162
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,400
- It's all about confidence.
- That was good.

1163
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,200
- "Conference room."
- "Conference room."

1164
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,200
- C.
- C.

1165
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,170
Can you not point your finger at me?

1166
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,740
- F.
- No, I'm not done yet.

1167
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,640
Keep doing that,
and I'll beat you up.

1168
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,370
- That's it.
- F.

1169
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,540
For goodness' sake, you're ignorant.
How about a fight?

1170
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,640
Come at me.

1171
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,010
Why did he cuss us out?

1172
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,680
(He ran out of ideas already.)

1173
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,550
- He's trying to think.
- Stand up, Jong Kook.

1174
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,380
- He needs to think.
- Stand up.

1175
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,950
- He's out of ideas.
- Stand up.

1176
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,920
- Stand up, fool.
- R.

1177
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,690
You ignorant fool. Stand up!

1178
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,690
R.

1179
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,860
Regrets are coming your way.

1180
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,560
Well done!

1181
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,030
- That was actually funny.
- You could lose an eardrum.

1182
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,030
He's just picking a fight.

1183
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,400
He's starting a fight.

1184
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,570
(Poking gently)

1185
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,410
(He started off yelling
and ended with a gentle poke.)

1186
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,210
- He's just picking a fight.
- It wasn't even funny.

1187
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,740
- Wasn't that good?
- What part was the wit?

1188
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,050
- Please tell me.
- The wit...

1189
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,110
- Where was it?
- Well...

1190
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,780
- Wasn't that amazing?
- The wit was...

1191
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,080
when he went up to Jong Kook,

1192
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,650
having lost all sense of fear,

1193
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,050
- and picked a fight with him.
- You guys stopped me, though.

1194
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,520
I almost threw a punch.

1195
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,260
I was actually going to hit him
a little later.

1196
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,430
- You know, I thought...
- Yes?

1197
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,530
When you went like this to me,

1198
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,290
I honestly thought
you'd go like this.

1199
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,830
"Oh, I made a mistake."

1200
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,660
- I thought you'd say that.
- No.

1201
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,130
- That's too predictable.
- No, this is...

1202
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,570
Honestly,
Seok Jin isn't really quick-witted.

1203
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,900
Okay, first of all,

1204
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,310
you said earlier that the cameramen
will be your standard.

1205
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,340
- Let's ask cameraman Kang Chan Hee,
- Okay.

1206
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,880
- and we'll hear his answer.
- No, but honestly,

1207
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,040
- Mr. Kang likes...
- Seriously, though.

1208
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,580
- everything Jae Seok says.
- You have to be objective.

1209
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,510
- He's not objective.
- You have to be fair.

1210
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,520
(I'm quick-witted and can adlib
at a second's notice.)

1211
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,680
I say it's true.

1212
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,850
(True)

1213
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,920
That was funny.

1214
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,120
I say it's true.

1215
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,490
(Team Jae Seok succeeds once again.)

1216
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,190
- That's because...
- For 40 years...

1217
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,330
he goes to Jongno often.

1218
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,460
Since he works in variety shows...

1219
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,930
Yeongjong Island was okay too,
wasn't it?

1220
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,200
- Yes, Young Sik was good.
- Come on!

1221
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,600
- Gosh, conference room was great.
- See that?

1222
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,770
- I'm not good at drawing, though.
- Okay, then.

1223
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,430
- Please put down a panel.
- Okay.

1224
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,540
(Current score:
Team Jae Seok: 2, Team Jong Kook: 1)

1225
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,640
- Nice.
- If they just put one more down,

1226
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,670
- they'll win.
- Okay.

1227
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,840
We're on offense this time.

1228
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,210
We can get one more.

1229
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,410
- Something uncomfortable.
- What about this one?

1230
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,780
(What is the question
that might be the last one?)

1231
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,350
- Nice.
- I like it.

1232
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,450
- Okay.
- This is just...

1233
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,550
- This is a strong one.
- This is...

1234
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,620
- It's huge.
- Or it could be...

1235
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,190
This might only leave each other
feeling hurt.

1236
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,320
- Earlier, I...
- We can't help it.

1237
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,590
Then, Seok Jin,
you should ask the question.

1238
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,490
- Okay.
- "Before the end of the year..."

1239
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,130
"Before the end of the year,
I will quit..."

1240
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,390
"Running Man."

1241
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,700
Did you say, "I want to quit?"

1242
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,860
- That has nothing to do with me.
- "I will quit."

1243
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,070
- I said, "I will quit."
- Right.

1244
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,230
- "Before the end of the year?"
- Do you admit it's true?

1245
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,400
(Before the end of the year,
I will quit Running Man.)

1246
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,540
(His eyes keep looking this way
and that.)

1247
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,540
- I said, "I will quit."
- Right.

1248
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,570
- "Before the end of the year?"
- Do you admit it's true?

1249
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,340
- "Before the end of the year?"
- Yes.

1250
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,470
- There's only three months left.
- How much is left? That's right.

1251
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,940
Right. We said, "I will quit."

1252
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,940
(Who will betray their memories
of 15 years over a mission?)

1253
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,750
- There's only three months left.
- How much is left?

1254
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,650
- That's right.
- Right. We said, "I will quit."

1255
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,780
- I just...
- Are you going to quit?

1256
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,820
No.

1257
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,950
(Admitting that he won't quit
in lightning speed)

1258
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,320
(He declares that he will keep
his job without even a smile.)

1259
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,350
- Goodness, he is...
- I would never.

1260
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,660
- This guy...
- Indeed.

1261
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,390
Ever since he got married,
this guy has...

1262
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,330
Back in the day,
he would've gone like, "Yes, sure."

1263
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,030
- "I could just deny it."
- "It's just a game."

1264
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,730
- I have a family now. No means no.
- Jong Kook.

1265
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,760
- No, I would never.
- Right.

1266
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,930
But this is a game.

1267
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,300
- Why have you gotten so careful?
- I have...

1268
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,800
- I have a family now. No.
- He has gotten so careful.

1269
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,900
- Why have you gotten so careful?
- I have.

1270
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,900
He has changed.

1271
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,300
- Haha, are you going to quit?
- Will you quit?

1272
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,070
- Over a mere thing like this...
- Haha.

1273
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,970
- I think you can say it now, Haha.
- Well...

1274
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,640
Tell us why you have to quit.

1275
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,340
- Honestly. You told us over drinks.
- Right, tell us.

1276
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,350
It's just a game.

1277
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,180
You told us that time
while you were crying.

1278
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,480
When?

1279
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,680
- Come on. Just say it.
- All of a sudden?

1280
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,720
What did I say?

1281
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,720
- You said you were burnt out.
- I don't remember. What did I say?

1282
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,960
Well...

1283
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,260
So, among the members...

1284
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,260
You must spend
a lot of time with him.

1285
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,260
- He's the spokesperson.
- Together...

1286
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,500
- His spokesperson.
- We go running together,

1287
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,760
- Oh, right.
- so like...

1288
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,830
It must be hard for him
to say this himself, but...

1289
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,900
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1290
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,330
- I'm about to cry. Hey.
- He must've said something.

1291
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,040
- Hang on. This is insane.
- Okay.

1292
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,240
- Keep talking.
- All right.

1293
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,610
(The man directly concerned leaves
from feeling too distraught.)

1294
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,170
- He must've said something before.
- Well, so...

1295
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,510
He doesn't like
how much he's being paid.

1296
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:35,410
(He doesn't like
how much he's being paid.)

1297
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,580
(Holding back his emotions)

1298
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,650
- That's true. It is.
- Hey, that's for real.

1299
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,450
- Really.
- It's so true. I'll give you that.

1300
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,820
- You know?
- That's true.

1301
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,990
Also,

1302
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,390
can I mention...

1303
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,520
the bad relationship
among the members?

1304
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,620
You spoke about the members
you didn't like that much.

1305
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,260
(My close friend is
getting started again.)

1306
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,630
- He said to go ahead. He nodded.
- All right.

1307
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,360
Since a while ago,

1308
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,530
Haha has said
that he wanted Seok Jin...

1309
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,170
- to leave Running Man.
- That's right.

1310
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,700
- This is for real.
- Hey, it really is.

1311
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,340
- That is really true.
- It's a fact.

1312
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,100
- It's true, right? It is.
- Fact-checked.

1313
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,170
- Hey, but how did you know?
- How do you know this?

1314
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,610
- He really must've said so.
- My gosh.

1315
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,010
Hey, did you tell him?

1316
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,610
- No, Jong Kook. I never said so.
- You must've said it yourself.

1317
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,810
- He really must've said it.
- Se Chan must've said something.

1318
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:10,880
- I never talk about Running Man.
- I can't believe this.

1319
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,150
- It must be upsetting.
- But this is...

1320
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,950
Weren't we talking about you guys
quitting Running Man,

1321
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,480
- you jerks?
- Look at him.

1322
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,190
Why are you getting so mad?

1323
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,250
(Jee-rasoni was being beaten up
when Team Jae Seok was attacking.)

1324
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,490
Just tell us, Seok Jin.

1325
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,290
- That wasn't cool of you, Seok Jin.
- No.

1326
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,690
- That wasn't cool of you.
- I guess I wasn't being cool.

1327
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,060
- Seok Jin is sweating right now.
- Also, I thought...

1328
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,260
you had just taken a punch.

1329
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,760
- I asked, "Hey, are you okay?"
- But then...

1330
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,970
(In a daze)

1331
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,030
(The eldest was almost in
a groggy state from their punches.)

1332
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,670
That's what you call being groggy.

1333
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,470
- No, I'm cool.
- No.

1334
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,910
So, on the count of three,

1335
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,480
raise your hand if you will quit
Running Man before the year ends.

1336
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,440
(It's time for their final answers.)

1337
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
(If at least three of them
don't admit to it...)

1338
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,450
Okay. One, two, three.

1339
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,320
(Team Jae Seok will win
just like that.)

1340
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,450
Okay. One, two, three.

1341
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,690
(Only Se Hyeong admitted it.)

1342
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:53,790
Why would you admit that?

1343
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,290
- All right. Game over.
- Nice.

1344
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,030
- Okay.
- Game over.

1345
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,030
(None of the others admitted it!)

1346
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,760
- So, you've failed the mission.
- Okay.

1347
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,960
- With a score of 2 to 1,
- Yes.

1348
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,900
- Team Jae Seok gets the nicer...
- All right.

1349
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,230
- Okay!
- Yes.

1350
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,040
- You'll get two advanced detectors.
- That's right.

1351
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,370
- You guys will get one.
- Sounds good.

1352
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,440
Please bring them in.

1353
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,910
Gosh,
the metal detectors are actually...

1354
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,310
These make the beeping noises.

1355
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,080
Jong Kook,
this is actually more impressive.

1356
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,280
This is just...

1357
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,550
Hey, it might be better
to use the rake.

1358
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,250
- Yes. That's better.
- Right?

1359
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,380
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- This is it, right?

1360
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,950
(Playing rock-paper-scissors
for the advanced detectors)

1361
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,490
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1362
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,720
Why do you always lose?

1363
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,560
Why are you so unlucky?

1364
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,560
- Do you want to choose first?
- My gosh.

1365
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,830
- I like this one. I'll take this.
- Seriously, you're so bad at games.

1366
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,900
This is lighter, So Min.

1367
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,430
- But this one worked better.
- They're the same.

1368
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,600
- I'll go with this.
- This one...

1369
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,530
- That one is heavy.
- Do you want this one?

1370
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,900
- Okay, I like this.
- Can I take this?

1371
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,370
(It's been a while since So Bal was
last here. How good will she be?)

1372
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,540
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1373
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,140
(Daniel takes Team Jong Kook's
only advanced detector.)

1374
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,240
This is the bigger one.

1375
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,540
Oh, this vibrates too.

1376
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,210
I think we might find
all kinds of odd metals.

1377
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,380
Okay!

1378
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,980
So, where do we go searching?

1379
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,320
- What? What do we do?
- Do we just find stuff?

1380
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
What are we supposed to do now?

1381
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,790
- You'll search for 15 minutes now.
- Have we started?

1382
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,520
- Oh, have we started?
- Is it in the sand?

1383
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,620
Are we starting right away?

1384
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,220
- Let's go.
- Did you hide 50 of them?

1385
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,160
If I find a lot of gold,
I'll give you one today.

1386
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,360
(So Min has
an advanced metal detector.)

1387
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,470
(Buzzing)

1388
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,540
(The advanced detector works hard
even as she glides by.)

1389
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,870
This won't be
a strong enough signal.

1390
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,170
(The advanced detector works hard
even as she glides by.)

1391
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,080
This signal isn't strong enough,
is it?

1392
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,210
That's just a normal sound.

1393
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,980
I think it has to beep incessantly.

1394
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,880
Why does this thing keep crying?

1395
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,780
(Daniel also searches in comfort
as if he's on a stroll.)

1396
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,220
It's hard to squat down.

1397
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,560
I know, Jae Seok.
It's so hard to have to squat.

1398
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,690
(Meanwhile, the basic detector
makes them use up their energy.)

1399
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,060
They could've hidden them in front,
unlike what we think.

1400
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,600
Gosh, but 50 of these...

1401
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,430
There's a camera in a weird spot
over there.

1402
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,500
(Moving to the front of the building
instead of the crowded beach)

1403
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,740
(Searching in front
of the camera first)

1404
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,040
(Beep)

1405
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,070
Hang on.

1406
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,310
(The detector detected
something metallic.)

1407
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,780
(Beep)

1408
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,610
Wait, something here...

1409
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:00,180
(He digs in the spot
where the sound came from.)

1410
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,320
Gosh, look at this.

1411
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,920
This thing was in here.

1412
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,120
(Did he detect gold right away
using his 15-year-old gut feeling?)

1413
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,090
Gosh, look at this.

1414
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,520
This thing was in here.

1415
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,490
This machine is pretty sharp.

1416
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:13,430
I dug this up
because it made this sound.

1417
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,400
I found this thing.

1418
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,230
(Is he taking it with him?)

1419
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,630
The trash on the beach...

1420
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,340
Oh, there's something here.

1421
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:24,670
(Beep)

1422
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,040
What is this?

1423
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,780
(Pulling it out)

1424
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,310
What is this?

1425
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,220
(The metal detector even finds
a silver-colored picnic mat.)

1426
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,280
Gosh, this won't do.

1427
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,350
This is going to be like
"plogging" today.

1428
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,290
(As he loves the Earth
instead of finding gold...)

1429
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:42,060
Seok Jin, you look so happy.

1430
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,730
Where could it be? Is it here?

1431
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,400
(Beep)

1432
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,000
(Bending his aching back)

1433
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,100
Hey. Oh, boy.

1434
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,300
(He successfully detects
his first item.)

1435
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,600
It's in here.

1436
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,600
I'm sure it made a sound here.

1437
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,700
(He digs through the sand
right away.)

1438
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,740
Oh, what?

1439
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,540
It's making a sound.

1440
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,740
I mean, it's making a sound.

1441
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,580
(Beep)

1442
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,010
I mean, where... What?

1443
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,280
It's making a sound here too?

1444
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,620
(The sound is coming from
the spot next to it too?)

1445
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,650
Oh, is this what's making the sound?

1446
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,020
Even the packet of ramyeon soup base
makes a sound.

1447
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,390
Gosh, I should throw this out.

1448
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,930
(Ji Hyo's detector
is working hard too.)

1449
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,030
Is it here?

1450
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,730
Oh, no way.

1451
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:22,000
Gosh, people shouldn't litter.

1452
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,030
Gosh, I can't believe this.

1453
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,970
The ground is way too flat here.

1454
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,200
No, this is...

1455
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:28,970
It can't be this flat.

1456
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,440
You can't put it
somewhere this flat.

1457
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,170
You'd be able to tell
if you bury something here.

1458
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,340
If you dig up the sand from beneath,
the color...

1459
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,440
would be different.

1460
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,650
Right? You'd be able to tell
if it's that flat.

1461
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,080
The water has been in here before.

1462
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,520
The ground is so neat.

1463
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,450
Over here, it looks like...

1464
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,050
(Detective Kook's deduction:
They wouldn't have buried the gold...)

1465
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,450
(where the water has swept over
the ground since it's easy to tell.)

1466
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,290
I think this section would be...

1467
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:48,990
a good place to hide stuff.

1468
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:52,530
(Beep)

1469
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,660
No way.

1470
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,860
(The detector starts to beep
just as Detective Kook guessed.)

1471
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,330
See? There's something in here.

1472
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:00,900
Darn it.

1473
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,700
Isn't this gold?

1474
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,840
Hey, this... Isn't this gold?

1475
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,210
(Hey, isn't this gold?)

1476
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:09,210
I think that should count as gold.

1477
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,380
Gosh, this is...

1478
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:11,580
Seriously.

1479
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,650
I saw something gold-colored.
I was so surprised.

1480
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:16,190
I've only found
random bits of metal.

1481
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,690
I guess this is what it feels like
to find a needle in a haystack.

1482
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,560
(Beep)

1483
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,660
There's something there.

1484
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,230
- Dig there.
- Oh, what?

1485
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,730
Is it in there?

1486
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:25,790
(Se Chan found something metallic.)

1487
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:28,900
- Gosh, Jong Kook.
- What?

1488
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,230
I found a 50-cent coin.

1489
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,600
(I found a 50-cent coin.)

1490
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:34,240
- Hey, that's nice.
- I found a 50-cent coin!

1491
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,270
Oh, really?

1492
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,840
Hey, it's making a sound.
Why won't it work?

1493
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,640
What's in here?

1494
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,810
Someone failed here.

1495
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,450
(The spot where Seok Sam found
the ramyeon soup packet)

1496
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:52,020
(Beeping)

1497
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,720
There must be a lot
buried under here.

1498
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,960
Seriously?

1499
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,300
(A purple pouch appears
out of nowhere?)

1500
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,300
Did you find something?

1501
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,930
Who was that?

1502
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:04,470
Se Chan, did you find something?

1503
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,870
(He checks what's in the pouch.)

1504
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,010
No way.

1505
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,110
(He found a real gold coin.)

1506
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:13,410
So that's how they buried
the gold coins.

1507
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,210
I found one!

1508
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,510
What did you find?

1509
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,110
A gold coin.

1510
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,480
- Really?
- Yes.

1511
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,120
Find something that looks like this.

1512
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,420
- Did you find one?
- Yes!

1513
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:28,160
(The first gold coin Seok Jin
let slip from under his nose)

1514
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,260
Beep, beep.

1515
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,730
(He has no idea.)

1516
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,730
I got it.

1517
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,000
I should check out those areas
to look for coins.

1518
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,370
I'm amazed by Se Chan.

1519
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,070
All I have to do is steal his.

1520
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:44,740
We're thieves, after all.

1521
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,110
There aren't any pouches buried.

1522
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:49,750
This is tough to do.

1523
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,150
(Wailing)

1524
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,390
What does that mean?
Is there something here?

1525
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,990
Is this the place?

1526
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:01,790
(So Bal's trying to talk
to the detector.)

1527
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,030
Sure thing. Where is it?

1528
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,700
(Not here. Check somewhere else.)

1529
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,760
Right.

1530
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,500
Is there something here?

1531
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:12,700
Okay, tell me where the gold is.

1532
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,940
Talk to me. From now on,

1533
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,670
I'll call you Golden.

1534
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,770
(She even named her gold detector.)

1535
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:19,910
Golden.

1536
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,680
Talk to me.

1537
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,210
(Whining...)

1538
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,780
(Woof!)

1539
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,220
(Golden suddenly started to bark.)

1540
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,280
It's here.

1541
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,790
Golden didn't find it. I did.

1542
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,790
(Picking it up)

1543
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:37,330
(Beeping)

1544
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:38,630
(So Min's camera)

1545
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:41,300
(A gold coin!)

1546
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,070
(Did So Bal score after returning
to the show after so long?)

1547
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,100
Just a second.

1548
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,470
These aren't easy to find.

1549
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,040
(However...)

1550
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,310
(They look different.)

1551
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,640
(What So Min found was a B Coin,
which is worthless.)

1552
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,910
I found one.

1553
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,410
(The fake coins are scattered
and not in purple pouches.)

1554
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:58,650
Did you find something?

1555
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,250
- Yes, I found one.
- Where?

1556
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,380
Between the rocks. I found only one.

1557
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,950
Good job, Golden.

1558
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,790
Wait, it'll be over there.

1559
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,660
They made us waste our energy here.

1560
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,860
The coins are all hidden over there.

1561
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,430
Okay.

1562
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:15,460
As Ssaebssaeb's older brother,

1563
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,630
I know these games well.

1564
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,300
In the beginning,

1565
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,700
it's best to show
that I'm struggling a bit.

1566
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,540
I'll then find a heap of coins
over there.

1567
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,010
I get how this works now.

1568
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,910
(The kid detective looks through
the rocks after So Min leaves.)

1569
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,850
(Se Hyeong's camera)

1570
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:33,880
What's this?

1571
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,380
What...

1572
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:37,490
Hold on,
I found an actual accessory.

1573
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,020
Someone must've lost this.

1574
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:42,760
I found a real accessory. No way.

1575
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,890
(The little guy found
a rare-looking brass compass.)

1576
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:45,160
How amusing is that?

1577
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:46,960
This is the place.

1578
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,700
(With that momentum,
he continues to dig.)

1579
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,970
Okay.

1580
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,510
(This time, he finds a fake coin!)

1581
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,080
(Screaming)

1582
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,940
I'm sure they decided on a place
to hide the coins.

1583
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,180
(The kid miner finds everything
except for gold.)

1584
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,110
Of course. I knew it.

1585
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,780
They wouldn't have buried
two coins here.

1586
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,580
That means I should go
somewhere else.

1587
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,790
- Haha.
- Okay.

1588
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:13,690
Put the trash in here.
Are you kidding me?

1589
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,390
Are you serious?

1590
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,390
Seriously.

1591
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,490
(Entertainer Yu is filming...)

1592
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,560
(an environmental protection
documentary.)

1593
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,330
Hold on a second.
This is more than just finding gold.

1594
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,070
- Just now?
- I found it among the rocks.

1595
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:27,570
(Meanwhile, Se Hyeong misreads
the kind intention.)

1596
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:29,440
- It's here.
- Hold on.

1597
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,410
(Quickly)

1598
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:32,410
This?

1599
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,440
(Stealing)

1600
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,380
Seriously, mister?

1601
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,550
(Dongducheon Small Fry's
sleight of hand)

1602
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,010
- That was mean.
- You should keep yours with you.

1603
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,250
He's Se Chan but sneakier.

1604
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,750
I hear beeping. It's here.

1605
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,420
Mister, come on!

1606
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,990
- Stop that, will you?
- It's here.

1607
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:49,190
You should carry your sieve around.

1608
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:50,430
It's here.

1609
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,630
There isn't anything here.

1610
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,960
They haven't hidden
a lot around here.

1611
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,430
(He moves to get away
from Yabssaeb.)

1612
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,570
This is crazy.

1613
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,670
(Just then, the detector
starts beeping loudly!)

1614
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,000
(Beeping)

1615
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:04,040
(The detector is reacting
to something!)

1616
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,140
(Spying, yet again)

1617
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:08,680
I got a few of these.

1618
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,550
(He digs where
the beeping was coming from.)

1619
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:12,210
That's most important.

1620
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,020
(It's a purple pouch!)

1621
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,720
I scored!

1622
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,150
He found one.
There are coins buried here.

1623
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,460
- No way.
- I scored!

1624
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,490
What's that?

1625
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:24,830
- No way.
- I scored!

1626
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:25,830
What's that?

1627
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,330
(When Jae Seok found the pouch)

1628
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:30,130
(A coin dropped.)

1629
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,600
- There are coins buried here.
- It seems that way.

1630
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,540
- There are coins buried here.
- No way.

1631
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,100
(Yabssaeb was lurking around
and managed to scoop it up.)

1632
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,710
There are coins buried here.

1633
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:38,310
What's that?

1634
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,640
Were there two in there?

1635
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,980
- No way.
- There were two coins in there.

1636
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,840
Hold on. That's mine.

1637
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,480
- How so? I picked it up.
- That's mine.

1638
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,150
- It was in this pouch.
- I scooped it up.

1639
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,350
It dropped from my pouch.

1640
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:49,750
- I picked it up.
- That's yours, Se Hyeong.

1641
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,120
- I'm the one who picked it up.
- You dropped it.

1642
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,150
- Exactly.
- Yabssaeb.

1643
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,460
I had it, but I dropped it.

1644
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,760
I scooped it up.

1645
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,460
- Good job.
- I scooped it up.

1646
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,190
Why you...

1647
00:50:58,630 --> 00:50:59,730
Who was that?

1648
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,130
(He got smacked
for getting on Jae Seok's nerves.)

1649
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,600
What was that?

1650
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,130
- Who hit me?
- Over here!

1651
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:05,130
Did someone hit me?

1652
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,870
- An eagle bit you.
- You weren't hit.

1653
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,640
- An eagle bit me?
- I apologize.

1654
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,510
Why were you giving him a high five?

1655
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,210
Because we're teammates.

1656
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,680
(While Hassaeb and Yabssaeb
were having a blast)

1657
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,450
The search is over!

1658
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:18,650
Already?

1659
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,650
- I'm starving.
- I'm starving too.

1660
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:21,920
We must be having grilled clams.

1661
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,450
I'm starving.
Please give us something to eat.

1662
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,290
- Let's eat!
- All right.

1663
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:27,760
How can this not be good?

1664
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,260
I'm starving.

1665
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,260
Grilled clams.

1666
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,690
This is incredible!

1667
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:33,090
(The sea view they couldn't see
during the search)

1668
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,730
- How tasty is that?
- What a view.

1669
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,130
It's so nice to see the ocean
and the mudflat after so long.

1670
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,500
Tell me about it.

1671
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,970
I thought we could sit anywhere.

1672
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,170
I'd rather sit here.

1673
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,810
Take your seat.

1674
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,410
- So Min.
- This is where I'm sitting.

1675
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:46,910
So Bal's sitting in the best seat.

1676
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,610
- So Min...
- She's between Bucktooth 1 and 2.

1677
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,710
Why are you always
trying to be with Se Chan?

1678
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,280
- This is where I can...
- You'll look the prettiest.

1679
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,780
- stand out the most.
- It's the best seat in the house.

1680
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,250
Since you're by the sea,

1681
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,190
you should eat some grilled clams.

1682
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:01,660
All right!

1683
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,590
- I love grilled clams.
- For lunch, you'll have...

1684
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,330
grilled clams and seafood kalguksu.

1685
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,270
- They're my favorite.
- The kalguksu looks delicious.

1686
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,930
They're my favorite.

1687
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:13,540
- Grilled clams are the best.
- It's been about 15 years.

1688
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,070
- No way.
- It was wrong to sit here.

1689
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:19,340
- I finally get it now.
- It was wrong to sit here.

1690
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,880
I know why So Min sat here
but moved.

1691
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,580
- What is it?
- It was wrong to sit here.

1692
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,210
If she had sat here,
she would've had to grill the clams.

1693
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,620
This was the worst seat to sit in.

1694
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,780
(Instead of sitting next to Seok Jin,
whom she had to serve,)

1695
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,920
(she chose to sit next to Se Chan,
who'd grill the clams for her.)

1696
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,050
Unbelievable.

1697
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:34,160
Se Chan loves grilling
and serving food for you.

1698
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,890
He's the one you should sit next to.

1699
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:37,830
- Can we grill these?
- There's a lot.

1700
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,290
(So Min wasn't wrong.
He immediately gets to work.)

1701
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:40,860
Se Chan, goodness.

1702
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,870
Se Chan, goodness. This is great.

1703
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,300
Se Hyeong's good at this too.

1704
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,570
Se Hyeong, aren't you
good at his too?

1705
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,700
- I am.
- Who's better between you two?

1706
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,370
- Se Hyeong does it better.
- Really?

1707
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,010
- Is Se Hyeong good at this?
- He loves doing this.

1708
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,010
Really?
(Even Se Chan is a level behind
his own older brother.)

1709
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,080
Se Hyeong, do a good job.

1710
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,210
- Sure.
- Make them tasty.

1711
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,880
(While Se Hyeong places the clams
on the grill)

1712
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,250
Should we place these
on the grill too?

1713
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,720
- Yes.
- Please them all on the grill.

1714
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,020
Forget it. I'm fine.

1715
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,290
- This shouldn't go here.
- It's fine.

1716
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:07,590
Shouldn't it? Why not?

1717
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,020
Is that not allowed?

1718
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,390
(Fumbling)

1719
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,860
- Place it here.
- This should go on the side.

1720
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,100
- Hold on.
- Should this go in the center?

1721
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,700
No, that should go to the side.

1722
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,600
- Should it go here?
- Yes.

1723
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,630
(They don't eat these things
because it's too much trouble.)

1724
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:20,670
Like this?

1725
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:22,040
So Min, these are ready to eat.

1726
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,170
(Se Chan's clams
are already cooked.)

1727
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:24,670
- Already?
- Yes.

1728
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:25,740
Are they cooked through?

1729
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,980
Careful, it's hot.

1730
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,010
Are they grilled?

1731
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,280
Careful, it's hot.

1732
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:30,350
I was with Yong Man...

1733
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:31,480
No way.

1734
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,620
(Slurping)

1735
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,450
(It's been a while since
she enjoyed Chef Yang's cooking.)

1736
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:36,620
- My gosh.
- The cholesterol.

1737
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,620
- The cholesterol!
- Isn't it tasty?

1738
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:41,460
- Have it once the cheese melts.
- It's okay to eat clams rare.

1739
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,720
- No way.
- My gosh.

1740
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:45,490
- Goodness.
- It's so good.

1741
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:47,860
- It's really good.
- This is what I'm getting.

1742
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:51,330
I can tell that you're happy
to be here with us.

1743
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,500
You're thrilled to spend time
with Se Chan.

1744
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,710
- It's so good to see him.
- Dig in, So Min.

1745
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:57,840
It's a joy to see everyone.

1746
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,410
- Is it good?
- This is delicious.

1747
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,040
(Thanks to Se Chan,
she gets to eat without any fuss.)

1748
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,610
- This is delicious.
- What?

1749
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:04,950
This is spectacular.

1750
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,850
(After serving So Min,
Se Chan tries some too.)

1751
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,050
- No way!
- Is it good?

1752
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,790
I'm so happy right now.

1753
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,560
My gosh.

1754
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,320
It's really good.

1755
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:18,090
(A satisfied nod)

1756
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,230
Have it once the cheese melts.

1757
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,770
(Trainer Kook tries the cheese too.)

1758
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,330
- Goodness.
- It's so good.

1759
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,940
It melts in my mouth.

1760
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,740
- How is it? Is it good?
- It's delicious.

1761
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,340
(They’re too busy eating
to remember the search for gold.)

1762
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:34,710
- Isn't it good?
- It's okay to eat clams rare.

1763
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:35,810
No way.

1764
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,710
My gosh.

1765
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,250
I'm curious, though.

1766
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,780
- This is a lot.
- Why are they being generous?

1767
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,690
Is it okay to eat all of this?

1768
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,290
- You've already had a lot.
- Is it okay to eat this?

1769
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:49,860
I've watched every episode
of Running Man...

1770
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,560
- except yesterday's.
- Don't you lie.

1771
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,660
- It's true.
- It's true.

1772
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,960
- Is it true?
- It is.

1773
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,560
He grew up watching Running Man.

1774
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,570
- Did you grow up watching this?
- I watch every episode.

1775
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,100
- Did you?
- Isn't he still just a kid?

1776
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,440
- But...
- He's a huge fan of the show.

1777
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,670
It feels weird
that they're letting us eat...

1778
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,140
- with no strings attached.
- Right?

1779
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:07,480
- I...
- I'm sure there's a price to pay.

1780
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,710
Could there be something
on the clams?

1781
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:10,980
(Doubtful)

1782
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,010
Could there be gold?

1783
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,520
This is strange, if you ask me.

1784
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,620
(Also doubtful)

1785
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,550
There has to be a reason
they're letting us eat so well.

1786
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:21,390
(Is there a catch?)

1787
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,630
(In this restaurant...)

1788
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,160
- What?
- Thank you.

1789
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,400
Everything's delicious.

1790
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,040
Get hints
about the gold coin's location...

1791
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,000
from an informant
wearing gold accessories.

1792
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,210
The code word is "Gold."

1793
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,080
Kalguksu is the main dish.

1794
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,080
(Hints were already placed
all over the restaurant.)

1795
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,780
(Hint location 1:
The Wi-Fi notice behind them)

1796
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:52,490
(Hint location 2: Wet wipes that
Se Chan got as soon as he sat down)

1797
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:54,960
(Written right on the back
of the wet wipe!)

1798
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,490
(Hint location 3: Inside the lid
of the napkin case they kept using)

1799
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:00,900
(Get hints about the gold coin's location
from an informant...)

1800
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:05,900
(Hint location 4: The chojang bottles
placed throughout the table)

1801
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,840
(The message is clearly visible
when you pick up the chojang bottle.)

1802
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,040
(They don't notice a thing.)

1803
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:18,180
(Hint location 5: Soda cans
that you get if you order them)

1804
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:22,880
(Find the gold informants
among the numerous staff.)

1805
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:25,350
- It's so delicious.
- Right.

1806
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,860
- It's exquisite.
- It is, right?

1807
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,590
But why are you guys
giving us food today...

1808
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:29,590
What's up with you guys today?

1809
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:31,090
- I mean, are you just...
- Don't worry about it.

1810
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,230
It's really weird.

1811
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,000
What is this?
Why are they just giving us food?

1812
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,670
- Gosh, what is that?
- Gosh, kalguksu!

1813
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,030
(Shouting in excitement)

1814
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,570
- Gosh, this looks delicious.
- This looks incredible.

1815
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,770
- Gosh, this is nice.
- Just eat it.

1816
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,010
It's good.

1817
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,280
(Their suspicions go away
at the sight of kalguksu.)

1818
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,180
- So Min, you can eat this.
- I'll eat this one.

1819
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,780
- My gosh.
- The kalguksu is so good.

1820
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:52,810
Hey, this kalguksu is good.

1821
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,180
The kalguksu is delicious.

1822
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,520
- It's so good.
- Okay, thank you.

1823
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,190
Gosh, this is nice.

1824
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,750
- You want me to have it?
- It's good.

1825
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,390
(They start inhaling
the bewitchingly tasty kalguksu.)

1826
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:07,230
You can feel free to eat more,
and we'll get ready here as well...

1827
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,230
- before we move on.
- Will we move, then?
- Yes.
- This is so delicious.

1828
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:10,570
- Thanks.
- Should I hit the slate?

1829
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,870
- Yes, hit the slate.
- We're really just eating.

1830
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,100
I'll hit the slate. In 1, 2, 3.

1831
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,940
- My goodness.
- Hey, you guys should eat with us.

1832
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,440
- Gosh, this is...
- Yes, there's too much food.

1833
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,440
Chan Hee, you should eat too.
I feel so bad to eat by ourselves.

1834
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,850
(The staff take off,
only leaving the fixed cameras turned on.)

1835
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,580
Of course, you should eat.

1836
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:27,780
I haven't had clams in a while,
but they taste great.

1837
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,020
Gosh, this is so...

1838
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,790
(Choking)

1839
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,260
- What's wrong?
- Darn it.

1840
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:38,290
It's so hot.

1841
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,930
- Did you spill?
- This one is tasty.

1842
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,460
- Don't you have any of those?
- What, Haha?

1843
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:47,400
(He took out a wet wipe
that had the hint on it.)

1844
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,600
- This one is good too.
- Darn it.

1845
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,210
Why don't you look happy today?

1846
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:56,680
We're out of napkins.
Please give us some napkins.

1847
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,680
(This time, he picked up
the napkin case with the hint on it.)

1848
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,520
We're out of napkins. What?

1849
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:02,980
(Haha spots the hint.)

1850
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,320
We're out of napkins.
Please give us some napkins.

1851
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,490
(Get hints about the gold coin's
location from an informant...)

1852
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:09,660
Hey, but it's so good to eat this
since it's been a while.

1853
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,490
(He checks it once more
without the others knowing.)

1854
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,200
(Looking around furtively)

1855
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:17,600
- Who?
- Recently...

1856
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,930
- Right.
- Give it here.

1857
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:20,600
(He sits down quietly
as if nothing happened.)

1858
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,670
(The chojang bottle
with the hint on it)

1859
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,810
Hey, can you get me some kimchi?

1860
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:28,540
(Jae Seok picked up
the chojang bottle.)

1861
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,210
What time do we have to finish by?

1862
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:34,080
(The hint is visible
as he squeezes out the chojang.)

1863
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,480
(Will he spot the hint
just like that?)

1864
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,190
(He saw it.)

1865
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:43,320
(He finishes scanning the hint
without the others knowing.)

1866
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:44,490
(The meal ends as the others have
no idea that the hint even exists.)

1867
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:46,730
- I want to eat it too.
- What do you want?

1868
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:48,330
- I...
- Scallops?

1869
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:49,800
(What will happen if they find
the informant as it says in the hint?)

1870
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,230
What was his name?

1871
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:52,470
(Has the hint)

1872
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:54,840
For the next 15 minutes,

1873
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,400
we'll start the second search.

1874
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,710
- Okay.
- Yes, got it.

1875
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:59,010
- Let's go.
- Okay!

1876
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:00,480
Fifteen minutes!

1877
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,280
- Let's go!
- Fifteen minutes.

1878
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,480
- Nice.
- Come on!

1879
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,680
I'll overcome this.

1880
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,680
(The gold hunters are
still very eager.)

1881
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:08,020
By the way, I was totally...

1882
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,590
You guys had hidden a hint.

1883
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:14,790
I picked up the chojang bottle,
but there was writing on the bottom.

1884
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,860
Gosh, I'm pretty sure
I'm the only one who saw it.

1885
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,130
(Get hints about the gold coin's location
from an informant...)

1886
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:20,600
I knew it. It somehow felt...

1887
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:24,670
There's only so much you can find
from the ones buried in the ground.

1888
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,730
I have to find them.

1889
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,840
(Haha has also obtained the hint.)

1890
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:33,570
So, I know it now.

1891
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,910
(He also starts looking for
the informant right away.)

1892
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:37,510
I have to find the person
with gold accessories.

1893
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:39,310
Gold.

1894
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,380
(Get hints about the gold coin's location
from an informant...)

1895
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,080
Hey, where did he go?

1896
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,850
I want to get the hint.

1897
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,960
I noticed that Jong Seo had
a gold ring on his pinky.

1898
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,090
Where did he go?

1899
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:56,900
(Earlier, during the opening)

1900
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,970
(Producer Jong Seo was teaching them
how to use the metal detector.)

1901
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:05,040
(Haha was watching him intently.)

1902
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,180
(He has a gold accessory.)

1903
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,750
(Producer Jong Seo is
the informant.)

1904
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:16,750
(The informant had been hovering
around the members since morning.)

1905
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:20,920
(He must find Jong Seo
and say the code word, "Gold.")

1906
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,420
Hey, where is Jong Seo?

1907
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,190
(While Haha is specifically
looking for Producer Jong Seo...)

1908
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,530
Where is Jong Seo?

1909
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,560
Where did this guy go?

1910
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,570
(Jae Seok is busy
seeking out the informant.)

1911
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:38,170
(Right then,
he spots Producer Jong Seo.)

1912
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:41,010
(Will Jae Seok figure out
his identity?)

1913
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:43,180
(He recognized the informant.)

1914
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,380
Gosh, I can't believe this.

1915
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:47,650
Hey...

1916
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:48,850
(Suddenly running away)

1917
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,090
Hey, Jong Seo.

1918
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:55,120
Jong Seo.

1919
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,690
(He successfully makes contact
by giving the code word.)

1920
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:58,760
Gold.

1921
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,030
(The code word)

1922
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:02,200
The small room on the second floor
of the tidal flat experience center.

1923
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,330
(The informant's hint)

1924
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,500
(Tidal flat experience center,
2nd floor, small room)

1925
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,740
Mister.

1926
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,400
- What?
- What are you doing?

1927
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,840
- I'm searching right now.
- What?

1928
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:13,780
How did you get this?

1929
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,080
(They don't know
that the other has the hint.)

1930
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,410
- Mister.
- Yes?

1931
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,550
- Why are you doing this?
- Stop saying that I have...

1932
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:22,250
an IQ of 70
in front of so many people.

1933
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,390
- But your IQ is 70, right?
- Gosh, why are you doing this?

1934
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,720
- Gosh, with this...
- Honestly, you have an ugly face.

1935
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,960
There's no way you can find anything
with that. I think...

1936
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,830
this one is better, at least.

1937
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,900
Gosh, I need to use the restroom.

1938
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:37,330
Jae Seok, can you lend me that?

1939
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,570
- Use it. I'm going to the restroom.
- Really, Jae Seok?

1940
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,640
Yes, you can use it for a bit.

1941
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:42,270
Jong Seo, do you have gloves?

1942
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:45,540
Gold.

1943
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:48,580
The small room on the second floor
of the tidal flat experience center.

1944
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:52,410
(Haha now knows
the hint location too.)

1945
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:56,450
(The informant's hint)

1946
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:57,750
The tidal flat experience center.

1947
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:58,820
(Tidal flat experience center,
2nd floor, small room)

1948
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,320
Is this it?

1949
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:05,460
What is this?

1950
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:09,160
This is
the Information Exchange Center,

1951
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,670
which provides information
on the location...

1952
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:12,130
where a large sum
of gold coins is hidden.

1953
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:15,170
We will give you different levels
of information based on weight.

1954
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,510
(I scored!)

1955
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:23,280
(They've only found
3 out of 50 gold coins so far.)

1956
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,880
(The rest of the gold is hidden
somewhere around here...)

1957
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,650
(all in one spot.)

1958
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,020
(The heavier the item you bring,)

1959
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,050
(the higher the level
of information you receive.)

1960
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:32,720
Oh, there's something to this.

1961
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:36,760
So, hang on. I knew it.
Earlier, back there...

1962
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:39,790
I wasn't sure,
but I just brought these.

1963
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,600
What about this?

1964
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,600
Stuff like this.

1965
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,470
I wasn't sure,
so I just brought everything.

1966
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,400
Yes, these are...

1967
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,840
(He gathered so much trash.)

1968
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,040
Should I give you everything?
Oh, this.

1969
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:56,580
This.

1970
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:00,080
About that much?
Yes, I think that's about it.

1971
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,550
Does that count for anything?

1972
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,820
(Level 2 Information is provided.)

1973
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:08,560
For this weight,
we'll give you level two hint.

1974
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:13,490
(He picked up metal trash
without giving it much thought.)

1975
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:17,770
(The trash that he worked hard
to gather became the level 2 hint.)

1976
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:20,400
The level two Information
is sound information.

1977
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,100
What? What is this?

1978
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:32,050
(A repetitive rattling sound)

1979
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:33,210
What is that sound?

1980
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,480
(Is it the sound of the item...)

1981
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,290
(that contains the large sum
of hidden gold coins?)

1982
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:41,960
I heard some kind of rattling noise.

1983
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,960
Gosh, this is...

1984
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:48,300
So, there's no use looking for gold
in the sand over there.

1985
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,700
Gosh, then...

1986
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:54,570
What will those people do?
They're all digging out there.

1987
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,470
(They're doing this.)

1988
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:01,910
(Groaning)

1989
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:09,180
(It's as if he's going to plow
the entire beach.)

1990
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,860
Darn it.

1991
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:19,560
(While even the great Jong Kook
is growing tired...)

1992
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:23,130
No. Stop crying.

1993
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,130
- Is this it?
- There you go.

1994
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,600
Hey, stop it.

1995
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,600
Is it over there?

1996
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,940
No. This thing is crying,
so I'm training it.

1997
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:32,610
No.

1998
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:34,080
(Whining)

1999
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,440
Kong, no. Don't do it.

2000
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,650
(Golden)

2001
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:39,680
Kong...

2002
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:40,920
(Kong)

2003
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,120
- What's going on?
- Is something going on...

2004
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,190
- between these two?
- Are these two dating?

2005
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:46,390
Hey, let's try...

2006
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:47,820
- going over there. What?
- Oh, my!

2007
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:48,960
(Going up in pitch)

2008
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,390
(Both beeping)

2009
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,260
Wait, let's try it again.

2010
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:56,500
(Golden and Kong seem overjoyed.)

2011
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,700
- They're dating.
- Right now, these two are...

2012
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,700
- Let's allow them to meet.
- What is this?

2013
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,870
- This is...
- What do we do?

2014
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:02,340
These two are so funny.

2015
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,540
There aren't any.
I think they're lying about the 50 coins.

2016
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,340
- I don't know if there are 50.
- Right?

2017
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:08,840
Jong Seo.

2018
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:10,950
Give me a pair of gloves.

2019
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:14,750
Mister. Have you always worn
a gold necklace?

2020
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,550
I'm trying out a new style.

2021
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:20,390
- What?
- I'm trying out a new style.

2022
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:24,290
But it stands out way too much.
Mister.

2023
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:27,760
What? Oh, you're wearing a mic?

2024
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:28,960
Would you look at this guy?

2025
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,230
Let me borrow this for a second.

2026
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:33,000
(Ssaebssaeb notices something weird
just by his hunch, with no hint.)

2027
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,270
But this is mine.

2028
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,300
(Out of nowhere,
he steals the gold necklace.)

2029
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,410
- You're just stealing it.
- Why?

2030
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:41,310
The rule isn't about taking it.
It belongs to an NPC.

2031
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,540
It belongs to MBC?

2032
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,280
(He has bad hearing.)

2033
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,580
Oh, NPC.

2034
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,680
Se Chan.

2035
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,150
He has a gold necklace.

2036
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:50,180
Hold on.

2037
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:51,950
Can't we take it like this?

2038
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:53,120
- No. This is mine.
- Seriously.

2039
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,320
How is that his necklace?
It makes no sense.

2040
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,490
It can't be his.

2041
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:57,590
Earlier,

2042
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:59,530
- Haha found a necklace like that.
- Right?

2043
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:00,860
- Yes.
- Is that gold?

2044
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,460
- Where did he go?
- But...

2045
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,370
- Haha.
- Haha.

2046
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:08,800
(At that moment,
Haha is getting information.)

2047
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:15,540
(He takes out every item he has.)

2048
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,380
This one is pretty good, right?

2049
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:22,850
It's the same as the necklace
that's on Jong Seo's neck.

2050
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,020
For this weight, you can get
the level one information.

2051
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,790
Hey, make it level two.

2052
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:28,920
It's going to be level one.

2053
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,620
What is it?

2054
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:35,500
The level one information is
a smell hint.

2055
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:37,470
A smell hint? Right now,

2056
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:39,030
I can't smell well...

2057
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,040
because of my allergies.

2058
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:42,740
Put it under my nose.

2059
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:47,710
(A smell hint
on the gold coins' location)

2060
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,110
What's this?

2061
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:54,780
A clam?

2062
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,280
I smell something fishy.

2063
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:04,690
(Level 1 hint is a smell of clams.)

2064
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:10,300
(To which location
do the two hints point?)

2065
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:14,240
It smelled a bit like the sea.

2066
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:16,000
The sea.

2067
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:18,440
I think it's the mud.

2068
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:21,240
(Is the large amount of gold
buried in the mud with clams...)

2069
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,180
(just as Haha guessed?)

2070
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:28,280
I think there are clues
like the escape room.

2071
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,880
We can't be looking for it blindly.

2072
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:30,950
It makes no sense.

2073
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:33,320
Why would the production crew
hide it and just go, "Find it?"

2074
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:34,490
There must be clues.

2075
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:36,120
"OIV," you're sharp!

2076
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,220
("OIV," you're sharp!)

2077
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:39,230
Seriously, "OIV."

2078
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:40,930
- Jae Seok.
- Jae Seok, I'm something else.

2079
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:41,930
Brothers.

2080
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,160
Please look after us this once.

2081
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,100
Please tell us where it's hidden.

2082
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,300
(He begs Jae Seok
to share what he knows.)

2083
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,270
What have you found out so far?

2084
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:50,640
This isn't just a search
for gold, right?

2085
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,540
- What you find...
- Okay.

2086
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,040
- will be a big help,
- Okay.

2087
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,610
so you should continue on
with the search.

2088
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:56,910
Where were you earlier?

2089
01:07:57,010 --> 01:07:58,180
Like I said, I used the restroom.

2090
01:07:58,180 --> 01:07:59,350
What did you do there?

2091
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:01,450
Number 1 or 2?

2092
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:02,620
Number one, of course.

2093
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,890
By the way,

2094
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:06,150
are we in Dongducheon?

2095
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,890
Why do you guys...

2096
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:09,890
(The Dongducheon Brothers forgot
about the teams and joined forces.)

2097
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:11,260
When the younger one attacks...

2098
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:13,130
- You guys did that in Dongducheon.
- Yes.

2099
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:16,100
Mom always said
that we should attack together...

2100
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,500
- if one of us got picked on.
- Seriously.

2101
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,530
He's my gganbu.

2102
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,230
The Dongducheon Brothers.

2103
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:21,440
Jae Seok, you know something.

2104
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,640
Would you please tell me?

2105
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:25,770
- But Se Hyeong is...
- Okay.

2106
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:27,070
on the other team.

2107
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:28,340
You're right. Se Hyeong, go.

2108
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,210
The thing is,

2109
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:31,780
I'm just wearing clothes
in this color.

2110
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:33,480
I'm always ready to betray my team.

2111
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:36,850
Should I use the restroom?

2112
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,150
Go ahead.

2113
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,950
(He gives Se Chan false information
to use the restroom.)

2114
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:41,490
Hold on. Let me borrow that.

2115
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:42,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

2116
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:47,660
(He believes the hint and leaves
his older brother behind.)

2117
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:50,130
Hold on. This can't be
a simple search for gold.

2118
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,430
He told me
to visit the restroom briefly.

2119
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:54,800
(He told me
to visit the restroom briefly.)

2120
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,140
There must be something
in the restroom.

2121
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:58,310
For goodness' sake.

2122
01:08:58,710 --> 01:08:59,970
What could that sound be?

2123
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,840
(Now that the brothers are gone,
he begins to search for the sound.)

2124
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,510
What's that sound?

2125
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,080
(What could that sound be?)

2126
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,080
They hid only a few here.

2127
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:09,350
This is driving me crazy.

2128
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,990
(Meanwhile,
Se Chan looks for the restroom.)

2129
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:13,050
There must be a secret mission.

2130
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:17,260
(He stumbles upon
the Information Exchange by chance.)

2131
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:18,830
- Can't I go in?
- You can't go in.

2132
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:19,960
Who is inside?

2133
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,300
(You can't go in.)

2134
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,200
Okay!

2135
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,470
(Okay!)

2136
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:31,070
Here. I'll pay four dollars.

2137
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:33,010
(He tries to bribe the guard
with fake money.)

2138
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:34,510
(The guard refuses the fake money.)

2139
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:35,780
Okay. Hold on.

2140
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:36,980
How about gold?

2141
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:39,210
(He tries to bribe the guard
with real gold.)

2142
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:40,350
No?

2143
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:42,020
What's this place?

2144
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,120
You can enter when it's open.

2145
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,350
(You can enter when it's open.)

2146
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:49,190
(You can enter the Information Exchange
when it's open.)

2147
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,830
There must be something. Okay.

2148
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:54,330
(Se Chan ditches his brother
and gains good information.)

2149
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:55,400
When does it open?

2150
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,930
You don't know that. Okay.

2151
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:00,670
Have you seen Se Chan?

2152
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:03,100
(Se Hyeong looks
for his missing younger brother.)

2153
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,540
He didn't go to the restroom,
did he?

2154
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:06,570
He didn't go to the restroom.

2155
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,280
(A sense of betrayal kicks in.)

2156
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,580
He didn't go to the restroom.

2157
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,880
(A sense of betrayal kicks in.)

2158
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:15,920
(The location of the men's restroom)

2159
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,950
(Se Hyeong's camera)

2160
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:19,020
Se Chan.

2161
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,220
Se Chan.

2162
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,220
(Se Chan)

2163
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,930
(The little detective is thorough.)

2164
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:26,160
He isn't here.

2165
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:30,060
(It hurts more to get betrayed
by his younger brother.)

2166
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,970
The second search is over.

2167
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:36,040
After a mission,
you'll have the last search.

2168
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:37,400
Did no one find the gold coins?

2169
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,870
Se Hyeong and Jae Seok did.

2170
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:41,210
I told you
that there were 50 gold coins.

2171
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:43,180
- You didn't find many.
- I think...

2172
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,510
- we found three.
- Three or four.

2173
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:45,580
We only found a few.

2174
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,380
- Did you find three?
- Just you?

2175
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,720
- No, the total.
- The total.

2176
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,520
- The total.
- The total is three.

2177
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:52,620
This mission will help you earn
something useful...

2178
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:55,190
- for the last search.
- Will we get a map?

2179
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:57,490
It's Flag Hunters in Crisis.

2180
01:10:57,590 --> 01:11:00,290
The representatives of the teams
will have a match.

2181
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:02,630
The one who retrieves the flag
on the beach...

2182
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,900
and reaches the finish line first
will win a point.

2183
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,300
- We need to reach the finish line.
- Se Chan should go.

2184
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,000
There'll be a total of four rounds.

2185
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,170
The team with a higher score...

2186
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:13,670
will receive a benefit
for the gold coin search.

2187
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:14,810
- We're too...
- I know.

2188
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:16,240
- Look at them.
- We're weak.

2189
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,580
So Bal and I...

2190
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:18,680
This is good. We'll win.

2191
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:19,910
Se Hyeong does marathons.

2192
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:21,150
Jong Kook should be excluded.

2193
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,920
- Se Hyeong is fast.
- Jong Kook should be excluded.

2194
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:25,350
- We decided on the list of matches.
- Okay.

2195
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:26,990
Round One is...

2196
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:29,190
Jae Seok versus Jong Kook.

2197
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,430
- Okay.
- Tiger and Grasshopper.

2198
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,460
- There we go.
- Good.

2199
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:34,900
Back in the day, Jong Kook did this
on "Let's Go! Dream Team."

2200
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,260
- I did this. You're right.
- He placed first.

2201
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:38,270
Yes. I placed first
in Capture the Flag.

2202
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:41,600
(20 years ago)

2203
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,740
(He was the ace member...)

2204
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:45,340
(of "Let's Go! Dream Team.")

2205
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,340
(Kim Jong Kook, final winner)

2206
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,810
(The game made Jong Kook
who he is now.)

2207
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:51,150
He placed first.

2208
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:53,280
But I played soccer
until midnight yesterday.

2209
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,780
- Really?
- Then your legs must be sore.

2210
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,720
- He's in bad condition.
- Now, the two of you...

2211
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,350
- will move to the starting line.
- Okay.

2212
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,090
Jong Kook played this game
on "Let's Go! Dream Team."

2213
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:02,590
- Let's bring it.
- But my legs aren't moving.

2214
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,430
- Jong Kook, before the game begins,
- Right.

2215
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:08,460
you'll lie on your stomach
and face the other direction.

2216
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,200
- When you hear the pistol...
- Jong Kook...

2217
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,300
- has done this.
- I've done this...

2218
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,700
when you were in elementary school.

2219
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:15,700
- Jong Kook...
- I told you the rules just in case.

2220
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:18,140
is the one who started the game.

2221
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:19,670
(The originator of flag games)

2222
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,310
Jong Kook, good luck!

2223
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,380
Jae Seok, good luck!

2224
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:25,650
Bring up the energy!

2225
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:27,510
- Bring up the energy!
- Let's go!

2226
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:30,580
Did you check the location
of the flag?

2227
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:32,120
- Yes.
- I checked it.

2228
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,220
(They check the location
of the flag.)

2229
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:34,860
- The location of the flag?
- Jae Seok, good luck.

2230
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,190
- Yes.
- I checked it.

2231
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,390
- All right. Look ahead.
- Jae Seok is skinny.

2232
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:41,130
(Did they take away the flag?)

2233
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:42,200
The flag is gone.

2234
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,960
- The flag became smaller.
- Don't tell them.

2235
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,130
- What?
- The flag became smaller.

2236
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:46,400
All right. Look ahead.

2237
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,630
- Jae Seok is skinny.
- What?

2238
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,300
(The original location of the flag)

2239
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:50,300
He became one with the ground.

2240
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:53,410
(They switched it
with a miniature flag.)

2241
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,880
It won't just be about...

2242
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,610
- being fast.
- That's so funny.

2243
01:12:56,610 --> 01:12:57,810
That's so funny.

2244
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:59,150
- They'll look for it now.
- Where is it?

2245
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,980
(Which 1 of them will find
the miniature flag 1st?)

2246
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,480
- Jong Kook will win.
- That's so funny.

2247
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,650
All right. Look ahead.

2248
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:05,750
Get ready.

2249
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:08,520
Where is it?

2250
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:10,560
- Where is it?
- What?

2251
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,360
- Hey!
- Where is it now?

2252
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,190
- Hey!
- Where is it now?

2253
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:15,860
- Where is it?
- What?

2254
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:17,360
- Hey!
- Where is it now?

2255
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:18,900
Run!

2256
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,540
What? Where did the flag go?

2257
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,740
- Run!
- Where is it?

2258
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:23,840
(Laughing)

2259
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,110
- What? The flag!
- Hey.

2260
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:26,240
- Where is it?
- What?

2261
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:27,510
Hey, where...

2262
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:28,640
Where is it?

2263
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,740
(They go to the original location.)

2264
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,650
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

2265
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:35,550
(It's right before
Jong Kook's eyes!)

2266
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:37,280
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

2267
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,390
Where is the flag?

2268
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:42,460
Where did the flag go?

2269
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,920
It's right in front of them,
but they can't see it.

2270
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,160
- They can't see it.
- They can't see the flag.

2271
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,330
- They can't see it.
- It's right there.

2272
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:48,300
- How did they not see it?
- Don't go so far, Jae Seok.

2273
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,160
- It's presbyopia.
- It's presbyopia.

2274
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,900
- Like finding a four-leaf clover...
- What's going on?

2275
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:53,370
(Jae Seok finds something
and runs over.)

2276
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:54,840
- No, it's tiny.
- Don't go there.

2277
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,340
Hey, he's taking the shovel.

2278
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:58,770
- Where are you going?
- That isn't it.

2279
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,610
(He begins to shovel.)

2280
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:03,680
That way, they won't see it.

2281
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,210
They won't find it.

2282
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:06,710
- This is bad.
- He's wearing gloves.

2283
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:08,080
He's burying the flag.

2284
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,680
(Jae Seok is burying the flag.)

2285
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:12,720
Is this the flag?

2286
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,060
(Is this the flag?)

2287
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:17,120
(He's speaking nonsense.)

2288
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,230
With that shovel...

2289
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:19,960
- Is this the flag?
- Is it blue?

2290
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:22,200
Is it blue?

2291
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,460
(He finds the flag.)

2292
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:25,800
- He found it.
- With the shovel...

2293
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:27,170
- He found it.
- With the shovel...

2294
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:29,040
- He found it.
- Did he find it?

2295
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:30,970
- Did he find it?
- He found it.

2296
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:31,970
Did he find it?

2297
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:33,670
(Laughing)

2298
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,140
- He found it.
- Did he find it?

2299
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:36,440
- Did he find it?
- He found it.

2300
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,650
He found it.

2301
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:41,620
(Our team won!)

2302
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:44,990
- There you go.
- He has good eyes.

2303
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:46,620
- I guessed it.
- No way.

2304
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,260
I thought, "Isn't it the flag
they put in the drinks?"

2305
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,420
- That's it.
- Yes.

2306
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:53,260
Jong Kook won Round One.

2307
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,930
- Yes!
- Okay!

2308
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:56,060
I'm so annoyed.

2309
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:57,330
I guessed it.

2310
01:14:57,330 --> 01:14:58,400
I'm so annoyed!

2311
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:01,400
Now, we'll proceed with Round Two.

2312
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,970
It'll be Jae Seok and So Min...

2313
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:04,400
versus Ji Hyo and Daniel.

2314
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,770
- Four members will enter.
- Really?

2315
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:06,970
- That sounds good.
- What is it?

2316
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:09,710
Retrieve a flag on the beach...

2317
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:11,910
and reach the finish line.

2318
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:13,310
- First place will get three points.
- Good.

2319
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:14,850
- Second place will get two points.
- Good.

2320
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:15,920
- That's doable.
- Third place...

2321
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,450
- will get one point.
- Good.

2322
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:19,590
- Okay. It's doable.
- Let's go, Daniel.

2323
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:20,750
Why don't you take off the bag?

2324
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:22,290
Let's go.

2325
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:23,660
- So Min.
- Jae Seok.

2326
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:24,660
It has been a while
since you visited.

2327
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,890
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

2328
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:27,860
We're at a disadvantage.

2329
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:29,860
- No. Jae Seok is fast.
- While that's true,

2330
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,470
So Min is sharp too. Let's watch.

2331
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:33,130
Good luck.

2332
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:34,530
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

2333
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,800
- Let's do this, Daniel.
- Let's go.

2334
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,070
Hey, make sure you win.

2335
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:40,740
So Min, pull out Daniel's hair.

2336
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:42,110
Go fast.

2337
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:46,910
Okay. He's fast. That's good.

2338
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:47,980
What?

2339
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,320
(Jae Seok gets ahead speedily.)

2340
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:52,690
What?

2341
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:54,450
(However)

2342
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:55,990
(So Min still can't control
her body.)

2343
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:58,090
Hey, So Bal! What are you doing?

2344
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,690
He's fast. That's good.

2345
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,200
(She appears
after everyone has left.)

2346
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,730
He runs fast.

2347
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:06,570
(It already looks like
Jeon Gukbap won't win.)

2348
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:08,540
- All right. We'll win.
- What are you doing?

2349
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:10,240
So Bal! What are you doing?

2350
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:13,640
(Jae Seok is the 1st
to reach the halfway point.)

2351
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,080
- Hurry up! What?
- What?

2352
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,110
- What?
- What's this?

2353
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:17,340
- Hurry up! What?
- What?

2354
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,350
- What?
- What's this?

2355
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:19,710
(A ribbon is attached to the flag!)

2356
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,380
- What?
- What's this?

2357
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:22,380
What?

2358
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,650
- What?
- You need to carry all of it.

2359
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,550
- What?
- What's this?

2360
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:28,560
- The end of the ribbon...
- You need to carry all of it.

2361
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,120
needs to get past the finish line.

2362
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,830
(The end of the ribbon
needs to get past the finish line.)

2363
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:36,100
(The ribbon is 100m in length.)

2364
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,630
You need to bring the ribbon.

2365
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,270
You need to carry all of it.

2366
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:40,370
(The tail of the ribbon
needs to get past the finish line.)

2367
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:45,270
(Jae Seok reaches the finish line
and begins to pull the ribbon.)

2368
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:47,570
- What's this?
- Hurry up.

2369
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:49,180
Hey, let go!

2370
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,910
Hey, let go!

2371
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:53,010
- Let go of the flag.
- Daniel, hurry up.

2372
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,480
- Hey.
- Hurry up, So Min.

2373
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,580
Jae Seok, help So Min
when you're done.

2374
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:00,150
(Jae Seok pulls the ribbon quickly.)

2375
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:02,290
How long is the ribbon?
For goodness' sake.

2376
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,390
(The ribbon is endless.)

2377
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:05,990
How is the ribbon so long?

2378
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:07,290
(He must pull 100m
to get to the tail!)

2379
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,800
Jae Seok, hurry up!

2380
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,830
(Daniel comes to get So Min.)

2381
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,530
(A physical fight ensues.)

2382
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:16,070
Jae Seok, hurry up!

2383
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:17,770
(Jae Seok)

2384
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:18,770
Okay.

2385
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:20,970
Jae Seok placed first.

2386
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:21,980
- So Min, hurry up!
- Jae Seok!

2387
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,980
(Jae Seok, 1st place)

2388
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:25,780
Is it okay to help?

2389
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:27,850
Jae Seok, hurry up and take it.

2390
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:29,450
- The green ribbon.
- Hurry up.

2391
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:31,750
Hurry up and take the green ribbon.

2392
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,420
(He gets the tail of So Min's flag.)

2393
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,490
- Hurry up!
- Help Daniel.

2394
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:38,690
(The tail of Ji Hyo's flag
passes the finish line too.)

2395
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:40,160
Ji Hyo placed second.

2396
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,760
Daniel, the ribbon...

2397
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,230
- Ji Hyo, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

2398
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,970
- Ji Hyo, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

2399
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:46,470
(The tail is outside
the finish line again.)

2400
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:48,540
- She can't control her body.
- Hurry up and go back.

2401
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,370
- Go back.
- For goodness' sake.

2402
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:52,040
Daniel, the ribbon...

2403
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:53,870
- Ji Hyo, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

2404
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:57,410
Hey, what are you doing?

2405
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:58,450
(She wraps herself up in the ribbon
so that he can't take it.)

2406
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:00,950
So Bal.

2407
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,450
Gosh, why is the ribbon so long?

2408
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,990
(Daniel is stuck in So Bal's trap.)

2409
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:12,190
(So Min takes off her shoes.)

2410
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:14,690
The ribbon is so long.

2411
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:16,560
She got it.

2412
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:19,530
She got it.

2413
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:21,570
- She got it.
- That isn't ours, So Min!

2414
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,600
(Daniel, So Min)

2415
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,710
(Why is she running
with Daniel's flag?)

2416
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:28,110
- That isn't ours!
- That's ours.

2417
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,740
That's ours. She's taking our flag.

2418
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,980
Isn't this the flag? I brought it.

2419
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:36,420
- Isn't this the flag?
- Hey, Daniel.

2420
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,420
- I brought it.
- So Min's flag is yours.

2421
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:39,450
- What's going on?
- Hurry up.

2422
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:41,890
- Hey, this is yours!
- Take the green ribbon.

2423
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:44,360
- Take the green ribbon.
- This is yours!

2424
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:46,990
(She'll win if she reaches
the finish line first.)

2425
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:48,560
Hey, you don't have much time.

2426
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:51,500
I'll take this.

2427
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,170
- Hey.
- For goodness' sake.

2428
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:55,170
Daniel, this is yours!

2429
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:56,900
(Feeling pressed, Daniel gets past
the finish line with So Min's flag.)

2430
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:57,970
For goodness' sake.

2431
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:00,710
- For goodness' sake. Hey, we lost.
- Daniel took So Min's flag.

2432
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,080
- So Min placed third.
- I mean... Hold on.

2433
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,910
(1st place: 3 points,
2nd place: 2 points)

2434
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:07,580
(3rd place: 1 point)

2435
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:10,250
What? Did the flags get switched?
The flag with the green ribbon.

2436
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:12,790
- For goodness' sake.
- For goodness' sake.

2437
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:16,060
Round Three will be...

2438
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,920
Se Hyeong versus Se Chan.

2439
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,260
- How dare you!
- The war of brothers.

2440
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:22,100
- Let your big brother win.
- If you lose...

2441
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,130
- That's nonsense.
- I can't believe this punk.

2442
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:25,770
If you lose, it'll be embarrassing.

2443
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:27,530
- Se Hyeong.
- Hey, Se Chan...

2444
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:30,400
Se Chan can't win against Se Hyeong.

2445
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,570
Se Hyeong's physique is better.

2446
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,580
They're getting tied
with a rubber band.

2447
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:37,280
- Get ready.
- Good luck!

2448
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,350
(The one who retrieves more flags
will win.)

2449
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:41,580
How cute.

2450
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,520
- How cute. They're cute.
- Se Hyeong.

2451
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:48,360
Se Hyeong.

2452
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:52,390
(They're equally matched
in terms of strength.)

2453
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:55,160
(Neither one of the brothers
wants to lose.)

2454
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,460
Se Hyeong, beat him up.

2455
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,970
- Se Hyeong, beat him up.
- Good. Se Chan has a good physique.

2456
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:00,370
(At that moment)

2457
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:02,000
Se Chan has a good physique.

2458
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,600
There you go. That's it.

2459
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,540
(Se Hyeong goes
in the opposite direction.)

2460
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:07,940
- Go.
- There you go. Go.

2461
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:09,180
- Go.
- There you go. That's it.

2462
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,540
- Nice.
- No.

2463
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,210
- Behind you.
- Drag him.

2464
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:13,250
Drag him. There you go.

2465
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:15,520
No younger brother is better
than the older brother.

2466
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,250
You can't do this
with strength only.

2467
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:20,190
What's up with him?

2468
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,960
No younger brother is better
than the older brother.

2469
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,060
(Panting)

2470
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:27,760
(Se Chan collapses
like an exhausted cow.)

2471
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,530
I'm suddenly in tears.

2472
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:33,630
Se Chan can't do anything
against him.

2473
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:35,100
- It's like...
- Se Chan.

2474
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,940
I've never seen Se Chan
so speechless.

2475
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:38,070
What's up with Se Chan?

2476
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:39,110
I want to win.

2477
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:41,710
(Se Chan strikes back
one last time.)

2478
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:43,480
You have to beat Se Hyeong
at least once in your life!

2479
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:44,880
- There you go!
- There you go!

2480
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:45,950
(They get one flag each.)

2481
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:47,050
I'm exhausted.

2482
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:49,450
Se Hyeong won this round.

2483
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:50,520
Se Hyeong won.

2484
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:53,750
- Look at Se Chan. This is so funny.
- You know...

2485
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:56,190
- This is so funny.
- He couldn't do anything.

2486
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:58,430
- Haha has strong legs.
- Good.

2487
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:00,130
- Nice.
- He's done.

2488
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:05,670
(Getting dragged)

2489
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:06,730
What's this?

2490
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:09,700
(Seok Jin gets dragged
on his knees.)

2491
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:11,670
- Seok Jin, what are you doing?
- What's this?

2492
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,910
He became a chair in the end.

2493
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:16,010
- He's like the giving tree.
- I know.

2494
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:18,080
Team Jong Kook won...

2495
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,150
with a score of 5 to 4
to end the mission.

2496
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:21,250
- Okay.
- Okay.

2497
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,750
- The winner, Team Jong Kook...
- I think we'll get gold.

2498
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:24,820
- Will you give us gold?
- We'll get something.

2499
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:27,220
Team Jong Kook will get
ten steel balls.

2500
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:28,560
- Steel balls.
- What are those for?

2501
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,990
(Steel balls are useful
for gaining a high-level hint.)

2502
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:33,430
The loser, Team Jae Seok,
will get three steel balls.

2503
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:35,360
- What are those for?
- Let's get two each.

2504
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,460
Okay.

2505
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:37,900
- As for us...
- So...

2506
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,670
People who didn't earn any points...

2507
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:40,800
- That's ridiculous.
- None of us earned points.

2508
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,140
- None of us earned points.
- None of us earned points.

2509
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:43,340
- I did.
- Everyone except for you.

2510
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:44,970
Then you take one.
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2511
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:46,740
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

2512
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:48,210
- Okay.
- All right.

2513
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,910
(Everyone except for So Bal
takes 1 steel ball.)

2514
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:54,250
I don't have a steel ball.
Just tell me what it's for.

2515
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:55,850
Tell me.

2516
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:57,380
- I don't know.
- We're on the same team.

2517
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,350
Look for a person
wearing a gold necklace.

2518
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:01,050
What? I didn't catch that.

2519
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:02,160
- A gold necklace.
- What?

2520
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,290
- It's Se Hyeong.
- What?

2521
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:04,320
A gold necklace.

2522
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,860
- It's Se Hyeong.
- What about a gold necklace?

2523
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,230
- Find it.
- Is it Se Hyeong?

2524
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:08,300
- I found it.
- Who has it.

2525
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:10,230
Jong Seo had it.

2526
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,370
So, what does it have to do
with the steel ball?

2527
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,670
- Find it.
- That's what you need to tell me.

2528
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:17,770
Seok Jin, you need to put it
in your nostril.

2529
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:21,040
I don't have a steel ball.

2530
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,980
(In Team Jong Kook, Haha is
the only one who knows its use.)

2531
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,980
- Go to a room on the second floor.
- Okay.

2532
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,650
- If you give this,
- Okay.

2533
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:29,220
you'll receive a hint, okay?

2534
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:30,450
What do you need to give?

2535
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:31,580
- Have you done it?
- This is...

2536
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:32,890
something you can exchange
for a hint.

2537
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:34,350
- Really?
- I've known this for a while.

2538
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:35,390
Have you done it?

2539
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:36,790
You must've found
a steel ball before.

2540
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:37,790
I used something else.

2541
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:39,830
If you find the gold coins,
you must give me one. You promised.

2542
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:41,590
You promised.
If anyone doesn't have it,

2543
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,500
- all of us will get a penalty.
- If anyone doesn't have it,

2544
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,400
- all of us will get a penalty.
- I knew it. I felt like...

2545
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,400
- the rules were too simple.
- Right.

2546
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,700
(Who will hit the jackpot by finding
the large amount of gold?)

2547
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,970
- The last search will begin.
- Let's go.

2548
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:52,140
- The last search.
- We must find gold.

2549
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:53,740
A steel ball.

2550
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:55,710
What is the steel ball for?

2551
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,710
- There's something about it.
- Yes.

2552
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:00,110
- Let's look for it, Ji Hyo.
- Don't you know?

2553
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:03,680
(They begin to search the area
without any clues.)

2554
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,420
There must be something.

2555
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:07,490
There's nothing.

2556
01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:10,620
(Haha, Jae Seok, and Se Chan
head straight to the hint room.)

2557
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:14,390
- I'll use the restroom.
- Go ahead.

2558
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:18,400
(While the three of them go
to receive a hint)

2559
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,670
Seriously.

2560
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,540
There's nothing.
I don't even have a steel ball.

2561
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:24,770
(She spots Jong Seo.)

2562
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:27,570
The fairy of the lamp, genie.

2563
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:30,380
- What's this?
- Give me the code word.

2564
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,510
What's the code word?

2565
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:34,150
You should know that.

2566
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:38,420
(An aggressive use
of the metal detector)

2567
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:39,520
Give me the code word.

2568
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,590
Is there such a thing?

2569
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,720
- Yes.
- Running Man.

2570
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:44,220
Incorrect.

2571
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,160
- Jeon So Min.
- Incorrect.

2572
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,760
- Jeon So Min is a fool.
- Incorrect.

2573
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:48,830
(Code word: Gold)

2574
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:49,960
Yu Jae Seok is a fool.

2575
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:52,200
Incorrect.

2576
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:54,130
How many syllables?

2577
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:55,970
I can't tell you.

2578
01:23:55,970 --> 01:23:57,570
Or... What? Come here.

2579
01:23:58,910 --> 01:24:00,410
Why are you giving me trash?

2580
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:02,680
- Doesn't this work?
- Give me the code word.

2581
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:06,180
Gold.

2582
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,150
(Her wild guess worked!)

2583
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:10,280
Go to the small room
on the second floor...

2584
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:11,450
of the tidal flat experience center.

2585
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:14,350
- What?
- Go to the small room...

2586
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:15,390
on the second floor
of the tidal flat experience center.

2587
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:17,790
The small room on the second floor
of the tidal flat experience center.

2588
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:19,290
The tidal flat experience center.

2589
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:22,660
(While the frog with a good hunch
runs to the 2nd floor)

2590
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,600
- I haven't gone in once.
- Me neither.

2591
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,330
- I know that you have.
- No, I haven't.

2592
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:27,470
- I know that you have.
- Come on.

2593
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:28,840
I'm telling you that I haven't.

2594
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,470
(Whirring)

2595
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,270
It's so heavy. It's a burden.

2596
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:35,780
- It's so heavy.
- Let's pretend to find it.

2597
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:36,940
It's so heavy and loud.

2598
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:39,850
(They get ready
to welcome the guest.)

2599
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,720
This is driving me crazy.

2600
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,190
You're all here.

2601
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:48,890
What's here?

2602
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:50,660
- There's nothing here.
- Jae Seok?

2603
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:53,330
- I'll go downstairs first.
- Let's move out.

2604
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:55,260
Is there something here?

2605
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,200
(Laughing)

2606
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:02,700
(In the middle
of a silent mime game)

2607
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:03,970
All right.

2608
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,810
You three are
hiding something, right?

2609
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:06,840
Be honest.

2610
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:09,880
- Haha...
- It's open.

2611
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,780
It's open. There's something here.

2612
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:13,880
(Haha enters
the open hint room first.)

2613
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,850
I had no idea.
There's something here.

2614
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:16,980
What is it?

2615
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:19,850
You can go in and check.
You'll know it then.

2616
01:25:20,190 --> 01:25:21,990
They're quite heavy.

2617
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:25,490
(Haha only has a level 1 hint.)

2618
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:26,590
(Gold Coins Location Hint)

2619
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:27,690
(Level 1: Smell of clams,
Level 2: Clattering sound)

2620
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:30,600
Okay. I'll give you
the level two hint.

2621
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,000
- Do I have to listen to it?
- Yes.

2622
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:35,870
That's enough, mister.

2623
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:40,340
(It's the clattering sound
Jae Seok heard.)

2624
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:42,480
(Level 1: Smell of clams,
Level 2: Clattering sound)

2625
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:45,250
(Haha now has 2 hints.)

2626
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:47,610
Okay. Thank you.

2627
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,650
Wait. What is it?

2628
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:51,890
(Seok Sam was alone at that time.)

2629
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,690
- Jong Seo with the necklace.
- Yes.

2630
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:56,820
Go to him.

2631
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,890
Gold...

2632
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:00,260
(He catches the other hunters
exchanging information.)

2633
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:03,260
Take these and the steel balls
you got earlier,

2634
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,300
- and go upstairs...
- With the trash?

2635
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,970
Yes. This isn't trash.

2636
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:07,530
You never know
if they'll be considered ore.

2637
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:11,040
- Okay.
- I think it's something...

2638
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,570
like nature protection
or "plogging."

2639
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:18,580
(Unfortunately, Seok Sam's ears
can't hear well.)

2640
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:19,680
Hold on.

2641
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:21,510
(He's startled.)

2642
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:23,580
(Pretending not to care)

2643
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:25,720
All right. Who are you?

2644
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,690
Come this way.

2645
01:26:27,690 --> 01:26:28,690
(The hyena is wary of a wildcat.)

2646
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:29,920
Come this way.

2647
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,160
"Who are you?"

2648
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,330
Please say the password.

2649
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:36,430
Gold.

2650
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,800
Go to the small room
on the second floor...

2651
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,070
of the tidal flat experience center.

2652
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:41,130
So this was what it was. Okay.

2653
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,400
What was that?

2654
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,770
Apple, grape, and pear.

2655
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:49,940
Stay still.

2656
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:55,010
(Yang Se Hyeong, the prankster kid,
plays a prank and runs away.)

2657
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:58,890
Now, Seok Jin...

2658
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:00,490
will definitely say
"apple, grape, and pear."

2659
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:02,490
Hey!

2660
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,690
(Seok Sam summons the informant
who is about the age of his son.)

2661
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:05,960
What's the gold necklace?

2662
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:07,890
What is it?

2663
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,300
Please say the password.

2664
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:11,700
Apple, grape, and pear.

2665
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:14,430
(He really says it.)

2666
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:15,670
That's incorrect.

2667
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,800
(Laughing)

2668
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:20,070
- Grape, pear, and apple.
- That's incorrect.

2669
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:21,540
- Dried persimmon.
- That's incorrect.

2670
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:23,880
(Seok Sam was only harassed.)

2671
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,580
This is annoying.

2672
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:27,150
Hold on.

2673
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:29,780
There's something else in here.

2674
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:32,050
(Seok Sam enters the building
where Haha and Se Hyeong were standing.)

2675
01:27:32,050 --> 01:27:33,550
Where is everyone?

2676
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:38,420
Look. There's dirt.

2677
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,060
There's dirt.

2678
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:43,330
(He finds the hint room's location
using his sharp eyes.)

2679
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,630
Goodness.

2680
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,770
I brought quite a lot.

2681
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:48,700
(Meanwhile,
Jae Seok entered the hint room.)

2682
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,770
A spoon and this.

2683
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:54,210
(He takes out some scrap metal
that looks fairly heavy.)

2684
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:57,040
You find these
where the metal detector beeps.

2685
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,050
- You did a good job.
- Yes, you these.

2686
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:00,680
Here.

2687
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:02,520
This as well.

2688
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,850
(Jae Seok only has
the level 2 hint.)

2689
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:07,820
Is this everything?

2690
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:09,860
What are you saying?
I brought a lot.

2691
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:11,420
Don't you need this?

2692
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:14,330
- If you bring a little more,
- But...

2693
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:16,330
I'll give you the level three hint.

2694
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:18,500
Hold on.

2695
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:22,770
- Ssaebssaeb.
- He came out quickly.

2696
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:24,100
- He came out quickly.
- The steel balls...

2697
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,140
Yes.

2698
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:28,170
I hate whispering the most.

2699
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:30,610
- I need two steel balls.
- I hate whispering the most.

2700
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:32,150
If you give it to me,
I'll give you the hint.

2701
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:34,410
- If I give you the steel balls...
- Let's be quick.

2702
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:36,180
I'll give you the level three hint.

2703
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,220
You'll give it to me?

2704
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:40,490
Here.

2705
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:43,060
(He obtains the level 3 hint by also
submitting Se Chan's steel ball!)

2706
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,260
Wait.

2707
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:46,030
- What's going on?
- What?

2708
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:47,490
This is the level three hint.

2709
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:49,230
(What's the most powerful
level 3 hint?)

2710
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:52,400
What is this?

2711
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:56,700
Is this the location?

2712
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,040
This is a hint that points
to the location of the gold coins.

2713
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:05,880
(Gold Coins Location Hint,
Level 1: Smell of clams)

2714
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,650
What is this?

2715
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:10,480
(Level 2: Clattering sound,
Level 3: Red object)

2716
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,750
Goodness.

2717
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:14,720
This is driving me crazy.

2718
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:19,490
(He leaves the room
without making a guess.)

2719
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:20,530
Come out quickly.

2720
01:29:20,530 --> 01:29:22,660
- Go in, Se Hyeong.
- Yes. Se Hyeong.

2721
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,060
- I gave it to you earlier.
- Sorry.

2722
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:25,160
- Jae Seok.
- Sorry.

2723
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,500
What is this?

2724
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:27,500
I don't know.

2725
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,870
Go inside.

2726
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:30,440
(Level 3: Red object)

2727
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:31,800
Let's go downstairs.

2728
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,940
Why does your expression
look so bad?

2729
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:35,270
I can't tell.

2730
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:36,910
What do you mean?

2731
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,010
- They let me hear a sound.
- Okay.

2732
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:41,210
- A sound?
- Yes.

2733
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:42,850
What sound?

2734
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:45,250
It went "thump, thump."

2735
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:48,490
"Thump, thump, and a beep."

2736
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:49,860
What about my steel balls?

2737
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:52,260
I gave him both the steel balls.

2738
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:54,090
I had to give him
the two steel balls for the hint.

2739
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:56,060
But I...

2740
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:59,300
How am I supposed to find anything
with what you just said?

2741
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,270
I don't even know what sound it is.

2742
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:04,300
I get that for my two steel balls?

2743
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:06,770
"Tu, tu, and beep."

2744
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:08,740
(Even that
is a completely different sound.)

2745
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,010
(Sighing)

2746
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:13,780
But sir, could you also get the hint
using one steel ball?

2747
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:16,280
Just tell me that.

2748
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:18,950
I'm worried I might get disappointed
when I watch it on TV.

2749
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:21,590
You could have earned the hint
using one steel ball, right?

2750
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:23,190
- You were being greedy.
- That was a level one hint.

2751
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:25,120
- You wanted a level two hint.
- Yes.

2752
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,490
These are very expensive.

2753
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:29,130
(The other hunters
obtained the level 2 hint.)

2754
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:31,100
I will give you the level two hint.

2755
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:32,300
(The other hunters
obtained the level 2 hint.)

2756
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,910
Is it the sound of horses galloping?

2757
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,480
(Shaking?)

2758
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:47,310
What sound is that?

2759
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:50,680
The golden coins...

2760
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:53,420
The golden coins are in this thing.

2761
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:56,220
They're inside something, right?

2762
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:59,260
That's what it is. It's the sound
of gold coins shaking.

2763
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:02,530
That's the sound of something
being shaken in a box.

2764
01:31:02,530 --> 01:31:03,530
Or...

2765
01:31:03,530 --> 01:31:05,060
(Jong Kook also thinks something
is shaking inside a box.)

2766
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:07,430
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok looks
at the hint again...)

2767
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:09,800
(after getting rid of Se Chan.)

2768
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:17,740
(He was caught in the act.)

2769
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:19,710
Mister.

2770
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:21,850
Did you get that with my steel ball?

2771
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,320
Mister. Hold on.

2772
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,680
- What is this?
- Hold on.

2773
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,950
- What is this?
- Wait.

2774
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:28,960
- But...
- Just share it with us. What is it?

2775
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,020
- Wait.
- What is this?

2776
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:32,990
- This is a level three hint.
- But...

2777
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:35,530
Let's share it.

2778
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,860
You can't take it alone anyway.

2779
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:40,900
But sir, you and I
have things to settle separately.

2780
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:43,100
You earned the hint
with my steel balls.

2781
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,870
- How can you get tricked again?
- You can't end it with "tu tu."

2782
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:47,370
- Tell me.
- I don't mind sharing.

2783
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:48,640
Of course.

2784
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:51,480
- I think I have a rough hint.
- Come here.

2785
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,880
- I earned a high-level hint.
- Really?

2786
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:57,480
(He shares the level 3 hint
to be fair.)

2787
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:00,590
But it's hard to tell from this.

2788
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:02,690
(What is this object?)

2789
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:03,760
What is this?

2790
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:07,060
Isn't this the back of the car?
The Carnival.

2791
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:08,860
- How is this the Carnival?
- The back.

2792
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:10,400
The back lights?

2793
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,560
- The reverse light?
- Yes.

2794
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,300
The Carnival's reverse light?

2795
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,640
But aren't we mates?

2796
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:17,240
Why are you
trying to run away again?

2797
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:18,270
I'm not.

2798
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:20,110
Carnival's reverse light?

2799
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:21,870
(Se Chan earned his first hint
like that.)

2800
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:22,980
Red...

2801
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:26,210
(He heads to search the car.)

2802
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:30,220
It's a tractor.
It's the tractor's engine.

2803
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:32,490
(Haha searches the tractor
after hearing the level 2's sound.)

2804
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:37,960
(He digs the ground
where the detector reacted.)

2805
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:42,600
Listening to him,
I guess it could be plastic.

2806
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:44,960
I don't think
it's the reverse light.

2807
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:49,840
It sounded like clams
rattling in a basket.

2808
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:52,000
(He comes to the place
where the clams are cleaned.)

2809
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,310
Shaking the clams after putting them
in something like this.

2810
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:56,740
This. Hold on. This...

2811
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:59,880
There are clams here, right?

2812
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:01,680
It sounded like this.

2813
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:06,320
Something like this.

2814
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:08,120
(Clattering)

2815
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:12,430
(He puts more clams
and shakes them.)

2816
01:33:18,530 --> 01:33:22,600
(It sounds similar.)

2817
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:26,410
(If the level 3 hint
was a red plastic object...)

2818
01:33:28,610 --> 01:33:31,740
(The basket is also red!)

2819
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:34,850
It's not this sound, either.

2820
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:36,680
What sound is it?

2821
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:38,120
(Meanwhile, Seok Sam is searching
for the shaking sound.)

2822
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:42,860
I guess you dig for clams here.

2823
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:44,690
You dig for clams here.

2824
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,890
What's the container
you put clams in?

2825
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:50,030
You can't take containers
to put clams in.

2826
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,760
But this...

2827
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,530
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok was also
searching for the red plastic.)

2828
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:58,500
(He searches the commissary.)

2829
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:05,310
(The containers for clams that
Seok Jin mentioned are also red.)

2830
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:07,380
(There are many of them behind him.)

2831
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:08,750
Why is this hanging here?

2832
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:15,050
(Jae Seok's attention
is on the red airplane mobile.)

2833
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:16,660
- Hold on.
- You found it, right?

2834
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:18,320
(The Yangse Brothers are going
through the trash bin for nothing.)

2835
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,360
Wait... It's just trash.

2836
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:22,290
Goodness.

2837
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:23,430
I'm already...

2838
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,830
I'm already out of the story.

2839
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
(There are two gold hunters...)

2840
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,770
(who are still inside the story.)

2841
01:34:32,710 --> 01:34:36,180
(Who will solve the clues
and find the treasure?)

2842
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:40,610
(Who is it going to be,
out of the two?)

2843
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:44,620
- I found it!
- Where?

2844
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,120
- Who is it?
- I found it!

2845
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:50,520
You've finished
searching for gold now.

2846
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:52,660
So, it's Yu Jae Seok...

2847
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:58,300
- who found the last gold coins.
- Okay.

2848
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,870
(He took a look
at the hint photo again...)

2849
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:02,500
(and headed straight
toward the jar with a red lid.)

2850
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:03,600
I think this is it.

2851
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:08,170
(After searching
with his bare hands,)

2852
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:10,810
(he found a stack of gold coins.)

2853
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:11,940
It's here.

2854
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:13,910
(Gold Coin Location Hint,
Level 1: Smell of clams)

2855
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:15,920
(Level 2: Clattering sound,
Level 3: Red object)

2856
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:17,620
It was the lid!

2857
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:18,720
(Among the numerous containers,
the coins were hidden...)

2858
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,390
This was it.

2859
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:22,150
(Among the numerous containers,
the coins were hidden...)

2860
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:25,360
(It was a place
where the metal detector went off...)

2861
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:28,360
(even though the surrounding area
was filled with plastic.)

2862
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:30,530
This is it. They are here.

2863
01:35:30,530 --> 01:35:31,600
(He just found them
with his bare hands.)

2864
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,400
- I was here before.
- I found it!

2865
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:35,030
Ssaebssaeb!

2866
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:37,340
(The lucky winner is
robber Yu Jae Seok.)

2867
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:39,110
- I'll give you some.
- Thank you.

2868
01:35:39,810 --> 01:35:42,010
(Yu readily gave 0.3g of gold
to Yang Se Chan.)

2869
01:35:42,010 --> 01:35:43,310
This is a lot.

2870
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:44,910
Can you give me just one?

2871
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:45,980
How many do you have?

2872
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:47,210
- I have none.
- I'll give you two.

2873
01:35:47,310 --> 01:35:48,950
Thank you, Jae Seok.

2874
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:50,450
You have nothing?

2875
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:51,850
- Yes.
- Jae Seok.

2876
01:35:51,850 --> 01:35:52,850
(1 coin)

2877
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:54,590
- Jae Seok!
- You gave her 2, but why 1 for me?

2878
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:55,960
Jae Seok!

2879
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:58,260
(So Min thanks Jae Seok
with a 40-year-old catchphrase.)

2880
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:00,260
You can take the gold...

2881
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:02,760
you found today as a prize.

2882
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,030
Thank you.

2883
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,330
(Se Hyeong, who picked up
Jae Seok's coin earlier, is exempt.)

2884
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:06,830
All the members
who failed to find gold...

2885
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:07,900
will get the penalty.

2886
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,100
Today's penalty is...

2887
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:10,670
to roll forward three times...

2888
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:11,970
on the mudflat you see...

2889
01:36:11,970 --> 01:36:13,170
- in front of you.
- My goodness.

2890
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:14,510
(Penalty: To roll forward 3 times
on the mudflat)

2891
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:16,640
(They have to roll around
on this mudflat.)

2892
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,510
- This is ridiculous.
- I knew it.

2893
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:19,650
It's short, though.

2894
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:21,350
- That's intense.
- I knew it.

2895
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:23,120
You will have to shower
after the penalty.

2896
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,420
- That's the worst.
- I'm taking an airplane today.

2897
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:26,920
This is the best.

2898
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:30,390
I thought I'd get the penalty,
so I was going to spread a towel.

2899
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:31,820
Are you doing it now?

2900
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:34,330
- Go.
- You got this.

2901
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,300
(He starts getting the penalty.)

2902
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:40,130
It's unbelievable.

2903
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:41,900
(On the soft mudflat,)

2904
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:43,540
(Kim Hunter happily rolls forward.)

2905
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:45,800
- The first one is...
- It won't come off.

2906
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,610
- My goodness.
- Hey, Daniel.

2907
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,110
- This is the worst.
- You're next.

2908
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:51,780
- Oh, no.
- My gosh.

2909
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:53,150
You should use your head.

2910
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:54,150
This is real mud.

2911
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:55,410
If only Se Hyeong pick mine up...

2912
01:36:55,410 --> 01:36:57,350
Gosh, if he didn't pick that up...

2913
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:58,680
- Haha.
- Darn it!

2914
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:00,020
- There you go.
- My goodness.

2915
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,050
- Good.
- There you go.

2916
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:03,090
It's all about spirit.

2917
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:04,920
Good.

2918
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,130
Good job.

2919
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:08,290
- Good job.
- Thank you.

2920
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:09,330
What do I do?

2921
01:37:09,330 --> 01:37:10,500
- Ji Hyo.
- Good job, So Bal.

2922
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,060
- I should go like this?
- Good work, Se Hyeong.

2923
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:13,300
Thank you, Jae Seok.

2924
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,630
(This week's race with Jonathan,
who is back after a long time)

2925
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:18,970
(We will confiscate
your phones now.)

2926
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:21,670
(All their watches are confiscated
all of a sudden.)

2927
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:24,340
(They can't check
the time anywhere.)

2928
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:26,710
(We have no watches and clocks?)

2929
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:28,210
(We covered it in case
you check the time on the street.)

2930
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:29,620
(All they can use
is their intuition.)

2931
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:30,720
(This is so frustrating.)

2932
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:34,620
(They must arrive at the place
for the mission on time!)

2933
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:36,120
(If they are 1 minute early or late,
they fail.)

2934
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:37,120
(Being too specific)

2935
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,390
- It's cold.
- I think it's around 3 p.m. now.

2936
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:40,230
(They desperately need things...)

2937
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:41,830
(like sundials and stomach clocks.)

2938
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:42,900
My stomach is accurate.

2939
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:46,030
(Revealing his stomach clock)

2940
01:37:46,030 --> 01:37:47,030
(A miserable sight)

2941
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:48,130
(Bulging)

2942
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:49,470
(Do I look like a celebrity?)

2943
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,600
(Use your intuition
to tell the exact time.)

2944
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:52,670
(They crossed the line!)

2945
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:54,440
(Will they be able to tell
the exact time without a clock?)

2946
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:55,540
