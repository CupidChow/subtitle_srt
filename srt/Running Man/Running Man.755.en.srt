1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,070
- My goodness.
- Kids would love this place.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,240
It's my first time here.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,510
This place is unbelievable.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,050
My gosh. This is great.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,650
- It's amazing.
- Jong Kook.

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,950
- Yes?
- Let's go to the restroom together.

7
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,020
All right. This is really...

8
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,420
I didn't know we had
a place like this in Korea.

9
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,760
(Mr. Swaggering Gait
enters the place first.)

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,430
Aren't you going to the restroom?

11
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,890
- We should go before the opening.
- I love this place.

12
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,330
- Let's go to the restroom first.
- Restroom?

13
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,700
It took us hours to get here.

14
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,770
The shoot...

15
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,630
The shoot has already begun,

16
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,740
- but why are you going?
- I've finally come here.

17
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,140
- This is really...
- Aren't you cold?

18
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,170
- Aren't you cold?
- He has...

19
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,540
- a prostate problem.
- It's chilly today.

20
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

21
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,010
- Hello.
- See? Young people don't go.

22
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,150
- It's so cold.
- Hello.

23
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,980
- The younger ones don't go.
- Aren't you cold?

24
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,210
I'm not cold.

25
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,520
This place is really nice.

26
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,520
- Jong Kook.
- It's my first time here.

27
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,990
The building behind you is a hotel.

28
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,220
- Where?
- This one.

29
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,420
- This one?
- Behind the restroom?

30
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,420
- This one?
- My goodness.

31
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,990
- It's amazing.
- Is this a hotel?

32
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,730
- Kids will love this.
- Right. Children will like it.

33
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,990
Does this come off?

34
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,000
- No? It's attached.
- I don't think it comes off.

35
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,830
They knew there would be
people like you.

36
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,000
They glued it together
because of people like you.

37
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,940
- I want to take it home.
- Kids would try to take it off.

38
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,000
- So they glued it together.
- Gangwon Province, my hometown.

39
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,010
It's Gangwon Province, my hometown.

40
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,770
We need a place like this in Korea.

41
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,040
Is it because
your outfits look similar?

42
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,440
- Seok Jin.
- You look like family.

43
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,050
- Is Seok Jin wearing a wig?
- By the way...

44
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,250
All right. Welcome
to Legoland, everyone.

45
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,580
- Welcome.
- Yes.

46
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,580
Welcome to Legoland.

47
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,050
Today, we came to a theme park
with various events...

48
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,290
- and things to enjoy.
- Yes!

49
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,820
- I've always wanted to come here.
- Legoland!

50
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,860
I really wanted to come here.

51
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,990
This is amazing.

52
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,730
- This looks so fun.
- It will be really fun.

53
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,800
I've always wanted to come here.

54
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,130
Are we going on the rides too?

55
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,540
- Are there rides?
- Are we?

56
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,740
- There are rides.
- There are?

57
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,240
- Are there rides we can enjoy?
- Of course there are.

58
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,940
- There are rides in Legoland.
- It's for little kids.

59
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,270
- It's a theme park.
- My goodness.

60
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,810
- Of course.
- You know what Lego is, right?

61
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,140
- I know.
- Right.

62
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,710
What are you saying?
They are toy blocks.

63
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,550
- So you build blocks.
- He really likes it.

64
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,880
Hang on. Haha isn't here.

65
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,150
(They noticed Haha's absence
after a long time.)

66
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,990
- Nice.
- Haha is on his way here.

67
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,690
- I see.
- He was sleeping.

68
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,020
- Right.
- And his manager didn't know...

69
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,990
the GPS was off,
so he kept going straight.

70
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,430
- That's what happened.
- So...

71
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,000
we got a call 20 minutes ago.

72
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,400
He said,
"I'm in Hongcheon. I'm sorry."

73
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,970
So...

74
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,770
- while sleeping...
- That means he passed by here.

75
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,900
- He did.
- He woke up in Hongcheon.

76
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,040
He went another 20km.

77
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,040
- In Hongcheon...
- That means he passed by here.

78
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,010
- He will be refreshed there.
- The manager kept on going?

79
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,240
- Yes.
- He just kept going straight.

80
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,510
He must be energized.

81
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,550
It can happen.

82
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,880
Haha will be here in 20 minutes.

83
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,750
- Okay.
- All right.

84
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,480
- It can happen.
- Sure.

85
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,820
- All right.
- It's funny he went to Hongcheon.

86
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,620
- He should come to Legoland.
- Seok Jin, are you wearing...

87
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,530
- a wig again?
- Whenever I wear my hair banged,

88
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,330
people say,
"Seok Jin really loves his wig."

89
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,630
("Seok Jin is wearing a wig again."
"Seok Sam must love his wig a lot.")

90
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,130
"He's wearing it again."
But this is my real hair.

91
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,530
It's my hair. I'm growing my hair.

92
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,000
As you can see, he doesn't have
a full head of hair.

93
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,170
Right. It's a little...

94
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,970
- It's Seok Jin's hair.
- It's my hair.

95
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,270
- Mine.
- Yes.

96
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,140
Hey, what's with your hat?

97
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,480
- Actually, Ji Hyo's outfit...
- Why?

98
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,840
is for young people.

99
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,950
(He changes the topic
to Ji Hyo's hat.)

100
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,550
Ji Hyo's outfit is for young people.

101
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,180
(Jong Kook bursts into laughter.)

102
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,220
Why are you laughing?

103
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,220
Why are you laughing?

104
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,390
- What makes you laugh like that?
- She's upset.

105
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,030
- This is what it is.
- Why? What's so funny?

106
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,960
- Why...
- You're wearing a thimble.

107
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,100
- Isn't this a bowling ball?
- Well...

108
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,530
- What's the theme for your outfit?
- The thing is,

109
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,100
I pulled it down lower
to cover my forehead...

110
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,870
- because it makes me look younger.
- Is that so?

111
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,240
Why do you cover your forehead
when you're already young?

112
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,340
Hey, I said you looked good
only with your glasses on,

113
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,440
and you're not wearing them today.

114
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,840
- Why did you take them off?
- Put them back on.

115
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,110
Last week,
Seok Jin made fun of me...

116
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,540
- about my glasses.
- Put them back on.

117
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,540
- Daniel.
- Yes?

118
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,210
You look good
only with your glasses on.

119
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,680
- You mentioned my glasses.
- Put them back on.

120
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,880
- Hey.
- Why aren't you wearing them?

121
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,080
- You should wear them.
- I didn't bring mine.

122
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,690
- Put them on.
- You should wear them.

123
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,920
(It's done!)

124
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,090
- You look a lot better.
- This is it.

125
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,290
- It's done.
- You look great now.

126
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,260
- Daniel is finally here.
- It's done.

127
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,760
- You look a lot better.
- Until a moment ago,

128
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,630
- I was feeling naked.
- I know.

129
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,870
- This feels right.
- Now...

130
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,040
- I feel confident.
- By the way...

131
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,500
- Hey.
- But I have to wear them.

132
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,510
- They go well with your outfit.
- I know.

133
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,140
- You should wear glasses.
- I feel...

134
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,710
- a little shy again.
- Yes.

135
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,980
- You should wear glasses.
- All right.

136
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,710
We have guests
who are here to enjoy...

137
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,450
- this place with you today.
- Do we have guests?

138
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,180
Yes. Please come on out.

139
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,220
- Who are they?
- Who are you?

140
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,190
- Who are the guests?
- Coming all the way to Chuncheon?

141
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,220
- Oh, dear.
- My goodness.

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,290

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,110
Hello.

171
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,380
I'm Actress Park Ji Hu.
It's nice to meet you.

172
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,510
(I'm Actress Park Ji Hu.
It's nice to meet you!)

173
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,210
You two are doing
a new drama together.

174
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,310
- Yes.
- Right?

175
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,680
- I see.
- Please tell us about it.

176
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,790
It's the SBS drama
called "Spring of Youth."

177
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,960
- "Spring of Youth." A band.
- It's about a young band.

178
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,620
- That's why it features N.Flying.
- Right.

179
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,860
- N.Flying.
- Yes.

180
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,060
(A youth drama that is perfect
for spring, "Spring of Youth")

181
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,400
(With a shocking story, it is
attracting attention every week.)

182
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,570
- So the drama is about romance.
- Romance.

183
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,070
- Yes.
- Is it a romance of youth?

184
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,740
- I bet it is.
- It involves romance.

185
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,810
- It also has mysterious stories.
- I see.

186
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,980
There are things you would like.

187
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,080
- Does someone die?
- It must be about revenge.

188
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,680
- It's revenge.
- I see.

189
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
- They can't tell you everything.
- Revenge.

190
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,250
- Right.
- They can't tell you everything.

191
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,950
- A lot of things happen.
- Someone almost dies.

192
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,290
- Someone almost dies?
- Yes.

193
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,620
- Almost dying.
- Yes.

194
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,960
(He bursts into laughter again.)

195
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,460
Then are you an office worker
in the drama?

196
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,460
Pardon?

197
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,630
She said it was a band.

198
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,200
- A band.
- We're college students.

199
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,240
Isn't the title
"Insurance of Youth?"

200
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,670
- It's "Spring of Youth."
- Spring.

201
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,770
- Spring?
- Ji Hu...

202
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,870
You thought it was "insurance?"

203
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,580
- I thought it was "insurance."
- That's not it.

204
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,940
- "Spring of Youth."
- Why would it say "insurance?"

205
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,280
- I also thought it was "insurance."
- I know, right?

206
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,180
- You make a lot of mistakes.
- "Insurance of Youth?"

207
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,350
Is it an insurance for young people?

208
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,150
I thought it was
about insurance fraud.

209
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,850
It's not "Insurance Fraud."

210
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,590
- It's "Spring of Youth."
- "Spring of Youth."

211
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,590
There was a drama
titled "The Divorce Insurance."

212
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,320
- I see.
- I thought it was about insurance.

213
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,530
- I thought the same.
- It's "spring."

214
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,730
- Spring?
- Spring.

215
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,990
- Yes, spring.
- I see.

216
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,830
We used to be in the same agency,
FNC Entertainment.

217
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,400
- FNC Entertainment?
- Yes.

218
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,870
You were in the agency
for a short while.

219
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,000
- I was.
- Yes.

220
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,670
But he left because
he didn't want to pay a commission.

221
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,170
- He left.
- He thought...

222
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,840
- he deserved more money.
- He didn't...

223
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,910
- want to pay them a commission.
- Right.

224
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,580
- That's not a lie.
- Right.

225
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,680
- It's the American style.
- You...

226
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,380
- What?
- Really?

227
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
- I see.
- That's true.

228
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,620
- Seriously?
- The 100 versus 100 special.

229
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,990
- I was here ten years ago.
- Really?

230
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,590
(10 years ago, an episode
where they invited acquaintances)

231
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,990
(Seok Sam called out Seung Hyub.)

232
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,500
- Really?
- Ten years ago,

233
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,530
- the 100 versus 100 special.
- How could you not remember him?

234
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,970
- Who?
- You...

235
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,630
- Who called him?
- You.

236
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,300
You called me.

237
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,840
But I don't know you.

238
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,210
- You don't even know his number?
- I see.

239
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,910
- You two were in the same agency.
- Through the agency?

240
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,310
- Yes.
- It was through the agency.

241
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,540
- Right.
- But I...

242
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,410
- Was he in FNC Entertainment?
- That's why.

243
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,810
I was in FNC Entertainment, so...

244
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,810
(His agency was FNC Entertainment.)

245
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,480
- That's how it happened.
- Yes.

246
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,050
- You still don't remember him.
- He doesn't.

247
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,890
- You still don't remember.
- Don't pretend that you do.

248
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,020
- By the way...
- He doesn't remember.

249
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,090
- How can you not remember that?
- The thing is,

250
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,920
things like this happen a lot.

251
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,220
- It happens a lot.
- You don't have to feel upset.

252
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,790
- I'm fine.
- Don't be disappointed.

253
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,130
It's been a long time
since your debut.

254
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,900
Now that you're back
after becoming huge like this,

255
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,630
I'm so happy for you.

256
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,800
- Nice to meet you again.
- The seed I planted...

257
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,600
- became a lead role in a drama.
- You planted a seed?

258
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,340
- It wasn't you.
- When did you plant a seed?

259
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,440
I planted a seed in Running Man
ten years ago.

260
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,340
But you didn't recognize him
after planting the seed.

261
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,110
- He's right.
- I can't remember all the seeds...

262
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,110
I've planted.

263
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,980
- I've grown a lot.
- Right.

264
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,150
- I'm serious.
- So...

265
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,420
how old were you back then?

266
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,780
Back then, I was 25.

267
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,820
- What? Really?
- No, I was 24.

268
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,450
- Are you 34 now?
- Are you in your mid-30s now?

269
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,520
- Seriously?
- My goodness.

270
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,060
- I thought he was in his 20s.
- I thought...

271
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,460
- He's older than me.
- I thought so too.

272
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,030
- He's older than me.
- Hey.

273
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,760
- He's older than you.
-You look like you're...

274
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,400
- in your late 20s.
- I know.

275
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,300
- Ye Eun.
- Look at her.

276
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,400
- Ye Eun.
- Yes?

277
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,030
Why are you blushing?

278
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,400
After she found out...

279
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,000
- that he was older than her,
- Exactly.

280
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,570
- she started blushing.
- Hey.

281
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,970
- All of a sudden.
- What's with you?

282
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,110
- Her ears turned red.
- Seung Hyub.

283
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,680
- She is...
- Hello.

284
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,310
She changes
depending on the possibility.

285
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,680
- She's unbelievable.
- She's shy.

286
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,180
What's wrong with you?

287
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,050
- So Seung Hyub was here before.
- Yes.

288
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,860
- It's your first time here, right?
- Yes.

289
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,890
What dramas did you do?

290
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,330
I was on "All of Us Are Dead."

291
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,630
In the drama...

292
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,160
Did you die from a bite?

293
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,570
- I survived until the end.
- How...

294
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,800
- I survived.
- She didn't die.

295
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
(She is one of the few
who survived until the end.)

296
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,300
- You watched it.
- So she survived.

297
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,410
It's not like...

298
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,940
- everyone in the drama dies.
- But...

299
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,640
- most of them end up dying.
- Most of them die.

300
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,240
Today, we will have a race...

301
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,350
with the two lead roles
of the SBS drama, "Spring of Youth."

302
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,450
- It's called Spring Voting.
- What?

303
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,220
We will have a total...

304
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,950
- of three rounds of voting.
- Voting?

305
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,750
The voting methods and benefits...

306
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,720
- will change in each round.
- Okay.

307
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,290
Only the members
selected in each round...

308
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,290
- can enjoy the benefits.
- I see.

309
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,000
- Let's get changed...
- My goodness.

310
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,760
- and go to the first voting place.
- I should be nice to the others.

311
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,870
- All right.
- Okay.

312
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,400
Haha can't even change his clothes.

313
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,340
- We're starting without Haha.
- He has to change right away.

314
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,370
- He will join us after changing.
- Let's go.

315
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,900
- He can join us after changing.
- After changing.

316
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,540
Hello. I'm sorry.

317
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,870
- You're here.
- I'm so sorry.

318
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,610
Did you say hello to them?

319
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,810
- Yes, I did.
- Ji Hu and Seung Hyub.

320
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,110
- I'm Park Ji Hu.
- Nice to meet you.

321
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,280
Haha.

322
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,950
- Kids will love this.
- Seriously,

323
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,180
- kids will be excited.
- They'll go crazy.

324
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,720
- Children would love it.
- They'll go crazy.

325
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,690
(In a world
made of colorful blocks,)

326
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,430
(there are attractions that are
loved by both adults and children.)

327
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,690
Ji Hu, do you like the rides?

328
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,260
I can ride them
even with my eyes closed.

329
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,860
- Really?
- Can you?

330
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,860
You should ride it
with your eyes open.

331
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,700
- Why would you close your eyes?
- Right.

332
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,200
- That's the L Tower.
- The L tower?

333
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,470
- The L Tower.
- Right. It's the L Tower.

334
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,110
- You're right.
- Yes.

335
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,410
- There's the Seoul Tower.
- My goodness.

336
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,740
- Awesome.
- They made a small Seoul here.

337
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,350
Gosh, that's so pretty.

338
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,380
- This is pretty.
- My goodness.

339
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,080
- This is amazing.
- There's Namdaemun.

340
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,980
- That's the World Tower.
- Hey, is that Gyeongbokgung Palace?

341
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,250
- I think it's Gwanghwamun.
- Gwanghwamun.

342
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,290
This is Gyeonghoeru,

343
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,760
- and this is Gyeongbokgung Palace.
- It says Gyeonghoeru.

344
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,390
- I can't believe this.
- My goodness.

345
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,730
They made the roof tiles like this.
It's so cool.

346
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,930
This is interesting.

347
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:23,930
- It's really fun.
- It's so cool.

348
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,960
- It is.
- Children will love this place.

349
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,400
- Kids will love it.
- It's educational.

350
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,530
- This way.
- I see.

351
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,070
What was the opening about today?

352
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,100
What are we going to do?

353
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,670
The opening?

354
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,700
- First...
- Just tell me the keywords.

355
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,810
- There will be voting.
- We will vote.

356
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,010
- For what?
- We don't know.

357
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,510
- There are two rounds of voting.
- Okay.

358
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,880
- What is this?
- There are two spies today.

359
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,380
- This looks like you.
- There are spies?

360
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,580
- It doesn't look like me.
- Hey.

361
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,120
I think it looks like you.

362
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,050
- No, it looks like you.
- My goodness.

363
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,920
- What?
- I'm serious.

364
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,020
Really?

365
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,290
I'll tell you
about the first benefit...

366
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,360
Oh, right.
There will be voting today.

367
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,530
- Voting?
- Yes.

368
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,060
I'm sorry,
but you should tell him privately.

369
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,800
This is what I heard.

370
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,800
Daniel keeps telling me...

371
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,000
that they are doing a drama
named "Spring Waltz."

372
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,140
- He changed the title again.
- It's "Spring of Youth."

373
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,240
"Insurance of Waltz."

374
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,570
- I mean, "Insurance of Spring."
- "Insurance of Waltz?"

375
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,010
What was that? "Insurance of Youth?"

376
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,140
- It's driving me crazy.
- "Spring of Youth."

377
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,940
- I'm so confused.
- It's "Spring of Youth."

378
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,810
- Who will tell me the truth?
- You should catch up.

379
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,210
- I'll catch up.
- Okay.

380
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,780
This mission is
for the first benefit.

381
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,020
It's called Draw the Last Syllable.

382
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,820
There will be 2 teams of 5.

383
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,220
You will look at the drawing...

384
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,890
of the person in front of you
and guess what it is.

385
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,390
Then you will draw a word...

386
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,560
that starts with the last syllable
of the previous word.

387
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,930
- It's upgraded.
- Yes.

388
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,930
The 1st player will be given
the 1st syllable,

389
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,870
and the last player
will be given the last syllable.

390
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,340
Let's say you're given
the syllables Na and Yi.

391
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,770
You should draw something
that starts with Na.

392
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,270
And the last word
should end with Yi.

393
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,940
Yes. It should end with Yi.

394
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,280
We should pick a smart member...

395
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,310
- for the last player.
- You're right.

396
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,880
When we played Word Chain last time,

397
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,020
you succeeded
even though you had more members.

398
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,220
- We did? When did we do that?
- Yes.

399
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,250
- When was that?
- When did we do that?

400
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,250
- I don't remember.
- You did it.

401
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,860
(They succeeded in the mission
even with 7 members.)

402
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,490
(Mackerel - fishbowl - pot)

403
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,560
(Handcart - curry)

404
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,860
(Agitator truck - condominium)

405
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,230
(But they weren't given
the last syllable back then.)

406
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,230
Condominium?

407
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,870
Each team will be given two chances.

408
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,200
You will get one point...

409
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,840
for each successful word.

410
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,410
If all the members
of the team succeed,

411
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,180
there will be two extra points,

412
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,010
so you will get
a total of seven points.

413
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,980
The team
with a higher score will win.

414
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,720
You can split into 2 teams of 5
as you want.

415
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,920
- It's 5 to 5.
- It's 5 to 5.

416
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,220
- We should split these two.
- Yes.

417
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,050
Why don't we play
rock-paper-scissors in pairs?

418
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,350
- The winners will be a team.
- Okay.

419
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,760
- Good, right?
- I see.

420
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,890
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

421
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,020
- But your drawing skills...
- I win.

422
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,160
should be similar.

423
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,590
- What?
- Our drawing skills?

424
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,930
That's true.

425
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,660
Jae Seok, you and I
should be split up.

426
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,070
- Right.
- All right then.

427
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,270
- I'll play with you.
- You and Haha.

428
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,440
- Haha and me.
- Ssaebssaeb and me.

429
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,740
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

430
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,740
I win.

431
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,910
- Good.
- I win.

432
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,070
Good.

433
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,980
- Do you draw well, Seung Hyub?
- I try.

434
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,580
- Jae Seok, I'm...
- You know what?

435
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,250
- Drawing skills don't matter.
- You draw well.

436
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,280
I like to draw.

437
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
- He's good.
- My dream...

438
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,250
- was to become an art teacher.
- He draws well.

439
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,780
- How should we sit?
- You go first.

440
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,020
- Should I go first?
- You're the fastest at drawing.

441
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,050
- But unintentionally...
- Got it.

442
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,360
- Seung Hyub, how's your drawing?
- I should go second.

443
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,090
- You'll go 2nd.
- I'll go 3rd.

444
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,860
- Good.
- This won't be easy.

445
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,790
Be sure to draw the key element.

446
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,830
Okay.

447
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,430
- No discussing.
- You cheaters. Watch and learn.

448
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,730
We're not as bad as you.

449
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,870
You were pushed down the line
for being terrible at drawing.

450
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,370
Let's see how good Seung Hyub is
at drawing.

451
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,840
- What on earth?
- What is it?

452
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,310
- What on earth?
- What's wrong?

453
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,510
- I thought this was falling.
- He couldn't see.

454
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,450
- I can't believe it.
- Come on.

455
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,010
He gets scared so easily. I love it.

456
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,550
I love Daniel too.

457
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,850
- He's such a coward.
- All right.

458
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,320
I'll slowly count five seconds
for each of you.

459
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,820
- Do we only get 5 seconds?
- Only 5 seconds?

460
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,590
Daniel will draw something
that starts with the first syllable.

461
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,260
Jong Kook will draw something
that matches the last syllable...

462
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,060
- and complete the sequence.
- In five seconds?

463
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,530
The first syllable is "da,"

464
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,670
and the last syllable is "sa."
You get five seconds.

465
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,670
- One, two,
- A word starting with "da."

466
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,470
- three, four.
- I see.

467
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,810
(First syllable: Da)

468
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,970
- Four.
- Good luck.

469
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,010
I get it now.

470
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,710
I was almost there.

471
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,240
All right.

472
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,580
(Beginning with "da,"
someone with glasses?)

473
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,180
- I know what it is.
- Let me see it.

474
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,320
What's that?

475
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,980
Daniel.

476
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,090
- It's Daniel.
- Let's show them how it's done.

477
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,320
It's Daniel.

478
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,660
(Will he recognize Daniel
who's right in front of him?)

479
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,760
- I know what it is.
- Close the door.

480
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,760
Let me see it.

481
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,190
He doesn't know.

482
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,960
- Don't you know what it is?
- You should know!

483
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,900
- One...
- I know what it is.

484
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,100
- How can you not know this?
- Two.

485
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,230
(He knows who that is,)

486
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,430
(but he must find a word
starting with "el.")

487
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,470
Four.

488
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,440
Five.

489
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,040
(Elsa?)

490
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,310
(Haha recognized Elsa.)

491
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,940
I'll take my time.

492
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,410
(However, it looks
like a haunted Elsa!)

493
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,150
- How can she know that?
- This is a tough one.

494
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,380
(Did Ji Hyo recognize it?)

495
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,120
(Ji Hyo starts to draw.)

496
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,590
- Did you get my drawing?
- Goodness.

497
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,620
You have to link it
to the last syllable.

498
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,790
What is this?

499
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,030
What on earth is this?

500
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,530
You have five seconds.

501
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,660
(She looks just as clueless.)

502
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,730
- Wait. Hold on.
- Look carefully.

503
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,640
- One. Three.
- What is this?

504
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,840
(He tries to draw something
to the best of his ability.)

505
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,610
This is impossible.

506
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,870
What on earth is this?

507
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,640
What is this?

508
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,380
What on earth is this?

509
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,310
Please close the door.

510
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,450
(Sighing)

511
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,380
- And go.
- I'll explain later.

512
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,520
- Four.
- You'll then understand me.

513
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,850
(Will he be able to draw something
that ends with "sa?")

514
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,090
Show us and explain your drawings.

515
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,320
- What was yours?
- Look.

516
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,190
A word starting with "da."
I drew me, Daniel.

517
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,030
You should've drawn a squirrel!

518
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,430
- Daniel...
- What was yours?

519
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,530
- I got it immediately.
- Of course.

520
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,700
- And I was excited.
- What did he draw?

521
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,770
- But it ends with "el."
- Right.

522
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,930
What starts with "el?"

523
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:29,970
- El...
- Elsa.

524
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,440
Exactly. I guessed it right.

525
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,170
(Everything was going smoothly
up until Elsa.)

526
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,610
Elsa. That's "sa."

527
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,240
A person.

528
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,580
- A person.
- A person?

529
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,310
- Mine is Rambo.
- Rambo?

530
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,880
(Jae Seok managed to draw Rambo.)

531
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,020
That's Rambo.

532
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,450
(Four consecutive correct answers)

533
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,950
What did you draw?

534
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,420
- What is it?
- Two.

535
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,620
- One.
- One.

536
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,720
- What's that?
- Investigate.

537
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,860
(Investigate is incorrect.)

538
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,230
Investigate?

539
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,330
(Their first attempt was close.)

540
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,830
An additional investigation.

541
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,770
- An additional investigation.
- You should've said that sooner.

542
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,100
- It's over.
- It doesn't make sense.

543
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,000
I like the improvisation
and the drawing works.

544
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,410
What do you mean I improvised?

545
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,370
- Here's how it goes.
- That was so close.

546
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,540
- Jae Seok...
- Make it vague.

547
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,640
- Vague?
- This is Rambo.

548
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,380
- That goes for all of us.
- We'll just make it work.

549
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,050
- How can this be Elsa?
- I'll draw first.

550
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,420
- Yes, you.
- Ji Hyo, come here.

551
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,150
I'll go second.

552
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,290
Sure, you go second.

553
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,720
- Let's do this, guys.
- Yes, let's do it.

554
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
- Be on your toes!
- Go, team.

555
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,460
Here are your syllables.

556
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,660
(First syllable: Ji,
Last syllable: Na)

557
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,530
- Not again.
- Four.

558
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,000
(First syllable: Ji)

559
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,670
Three, two...

560
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,840
So that's what he drew.

561
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,870
- What's that?
- I get it.

562
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,470
It's a tough one though.

563
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,610
You know what that is, right?

564
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,740
Does it end with "ne?"

565
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,280
- What? Why?
- Same here.

566
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,810
(It's tough to think of a word
that starts with "ne.")

567
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,350
You gave him a hard one
to work with.

568
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,220
(Jong Kook easily draws something
that begins with "ne.")

569
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,550
You get it, right?

570
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,560
- It's...
- Right.

571
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,390
Don't give him any clues.

572
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,790
(Daniel got what Jong Kook drew.)

573
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,530
Four.

574
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,160
- Go, team.
- Can I show her?

575
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,760
Ji Hyo, stay alert.

576
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,970
(There are no bumps in the road.)

577
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,200
She's done.

578
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,640
- Open.
- Five.

579
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,410
(Will Seung Hyub be able
to complete the sequence?)

580
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,610
Three, two.

581
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,780
We're on different teams,
but I find myself rooting for them.

582
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,080
Get it right, will you?

583
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,410
- Exactly.
- Look at him.

584
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,720
- We're embarrassed for you.
- Open the doors.

585
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,180
Show us your drawings.

586
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,350
- Go ahead.
- What did he draw?

587
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,690
- What is that?
- What's Jae Seok's?

588
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,750
- Is that a worm?
- That's a worm.

589
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,220
- I...
- That's a centipede.

590
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,190
- I drew a worm.
- Exactly.

591
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,190
I drew a worm.

592
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,230
That's a centipede.

593
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,330
- What?
- How is that a worm?

594
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,730
- That's a centipede.
- It's a worm.

595
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,730
- She already called it.
- There's no worm here.

596
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,830
It's a centipede.

597
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,670
- A worm.
- It's digging out from the dirt.

598
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,640
- Okay.
- This is dirt.

599
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,540
- It's a worm.
- See? It's a worm.

600
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,510
- Fine, we'll allow it.
- See? It's a worm.

601
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,670
- And him?
- Go ahead.

602
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,580
- A duvet.
- Bedding.

603
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,240
- Bedding.
- Bedding.

604
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,110
- Bedding, right?
- Yes, bedding.

605
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,310
- You said duvet.
- Bedding.

606
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,720
- Bedding.
- Bedding.

607
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,320
(It still makes sense.)

608
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,690
- Handcart.
- How's that a handcart?

609
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,990
- A collar.
- What's a collar?

610
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,760
(They're finally back on track.)

611
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,960
Sure, we'll give it to you.

612
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,460
(It must start with "ra"
and end with "na.")

613
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,000
Is it ranana? Say that it's ranana.

614
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,600
- Ranana!
- He went for it.

615
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,100
- We'll definitely win.
- You guys are a mess.

616
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,570
- Move, guys.
- This was tough.

617
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,970
That was so close.

618
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,510
- I couldn't think.
- Who calls it a bedding?

619
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,610
- A duvet.
- It's a duvet.

620
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,910
I can't believe him.

621
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,880
A bedding?

622
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,510
You guys are the worst.

623
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,920
- That was the worst.
- Tell me about it.

624
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,980
- He's the spy.
- What?

625
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,520
(Haha's on his own mission
trying to pick out the spy.)

626
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,220
I can tell who the spy is.

627
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,390
- How many rounds will we play?
- Is there a spy among us too?

628
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,390
- Yes, there is.
- Really?

629
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,290
Team Jae Seok scored eight points.

630
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,860
That was a tough game.

631
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,500
- Seok Jin.
- Wait.

632
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,700
- The order.
- Decide on the order.

633
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,400
Why don't you go last?

634
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,440
- Go last.
- We need you to improvise.

635
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,540
Should I go last?

636
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,040
- Should I guess it?
- We need you in the middle.

637
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,170
- In the middle.
- That's right.

638
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,610
- Yes, draw that.
- Look.

639
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,910
Let's say the syllable is "ji."

640
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,380
What's easier?
A worm or a centipede?

641
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,150
- A worm.
- Right? Go with the easier one.

642
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,780
- And...
- What about "sa?"

643
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,920
"Sa?"

644
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,120
- An apple.
- An apple.

645
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,420
Go with fruits.

646
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,290
- Go with easier words.
- Easier words.

647
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,220
Hold on a second.
What do you think you're doing?

648
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,820
- You can't strategize.
- It's not that.

649
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,330
They didn't know what to draw...

650
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,830
- for syllables like "sa."
- This is wrong.

651
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,930
Guys, bring it in.

652
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,430
- Sure.
- We only need to get one to win.

653
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,830
- One, two, three, go team.
- One, two, three, go team.

654
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,570
Seok Jin,
improvise the heck out of it.

655
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,600
Got it.

656
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,070
- I got it.
- All right.

657
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,740
We'll shut it down
if it's ridiculous.

658
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,110
- Of course.
- Got it.

659
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,580
- Unbelievable.
- Here are your syllables.

660
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,550
(Their first attempt, na and mi)

661
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,050
- This is an easy one.
- It's too easy.

662
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,720
- It's too easy.
- This is an easy one.

663
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,580
- They're throwing you a point.
- It's spring.

664
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,450
We had a lot of easy ones too.

665
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,420
Five, four,

666
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,230
- That's where they get stuck.
- three...

667
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,160
(The new empty head
wasn't part of the plan.)

668
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
- Two...
- Let's swap seats.

669
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,770
It's over for them.

670
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,570
- Unbelievable.
- It's not bad.

671
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,870
It just had to be Se Chan
next to Ye Eun.

672
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,640
It's already over for them.

673
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,540
(He lost the will to fight.)

674
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,910
It's already over for them.

675
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,650
- Se Chan, there's a word for this.
- Hey!

676
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,850
- What is that?
- Give me something to work with!

677
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,120
- Just make sense of it.
- It's over for them.

678
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,290
You know what this is.

679
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,750
Unbelievable.

680
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,520
- Show him.
- I'll make something up, so...

681
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,090
Unbelievable.

682
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,400
- Five, four...
- What is that?

683
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,130
I'll make something up, so...

684
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,630
- Unbelievable.
- So just draw anything.

685
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,000
- What...
- That's vague for sure.

686
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,140
Im Chang Jung!

687
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,610
- Yes, good.
- That's vague.

688
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,080
- Wasn't that already drawn?
- Of course not.

689
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,120
(He drew before looking
at Haha's drawing.)

690
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,350
- Nami.
- I'm curious.

691
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,620
- Is that Nami?
- It just has to make sense.

692
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,560
- Let's see.
- Im Chang Jung.

693
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,020
- Can you make it work?
- Yes.

694
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,320
What did you draw? Is that Oh Na Mi?

695
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,360
Yes, it's that.

696
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,790
- Yes, it's that.
- What did you draw?

697
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,400
I don't know. What's yours?

698
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,830
Share your answers.

699
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,830
Butterfly.

700
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,030
Secret.

701
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,000
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

702
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,100
Secret? I...

703
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,670
This is Seokguram.

704
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,440
- Seokguram?
- How is that Seokguram?

705
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,710
It's like this.
Butterfly, gravestone,

706
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,780
Seokguram.

707
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,180
- Right.
- Seokguram.

708
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,310
- Seokguram?
- It ends with "am."

709
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,020
- I happened to read your mind.
- What is it?

710
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,320
Amna.

711
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,550
Amna?

712
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,420
- I mean, anyone.
- Anyone?

713
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,360
- Anyone!
- What's that?

714
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,960
She's Nami.

715
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,600
(Nami)

716
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,070
(Weirdly enough, it looks like her.)

717
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,830
You failed.

718
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,470
- You failed.
- You failed. Again.

719
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,800
- Team Seok Jin scored two points.
- What?

720
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,040
- Of course.
- If you...

721
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,410
- manage...
- Why?

722
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,010
to complete the sequence
this time around,

723
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,510
- you'll win.
- It didn't make sense.

724
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,480
- We'll lose if we don't?
- Right.

725
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,880
- Otherwise, we'll win?
- Yes.

726
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,050
- Good.
- We actually did a good job.

727
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,220
- Right.
- We did a good job.

728
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,650
This is your last chance.

729
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,150
If you don't complete
the sequence this time,

730
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,220
- Right.
- you'll lose.

731
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,390
Count down slower, please.

732
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,430
- Here are the syllables.
- I can't believe they're winning.

733
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,590
- Here we go.
- We'll win.

734
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,130
These are easy.

735
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,700
- These are too easy.
- Too easy.

736
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,300
- Go ahead.
- This is way too easy.

737
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,100
- Five, four...
- It's too easy.

738
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,170
- Three.
- You don't even have to...

739
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,840
- draw it that well.
- Two.

740
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,500
- And after that...
- There you go.

741
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,040
- That's right.
- Good.

742
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,910
- Okay!
- He got it.

743
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,340
- Just look at that.
- There you go.

744
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,580
- What is it?
- All right.

745
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,780
This is way too easy.

746
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,220
- This is easy.
- Ye Eun might not get it.

747
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,550
(They just have to link it
with auto shop and terminal.)

748
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,950
This just got back.

749
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,190
- How can she not know this?
- Go ahead.

750
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,560
(She didn't recognize the handcart.)

751
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,390
- She's ruining it for us.
- Don't let it show.

752
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,800
I don't think
I'll be able to make something up.

753
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,860
- Ye Eun's done for.
- It ends with her.

754
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,530
- It's over for them.
- Ye Eun!

755
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,630
It's over.

756
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,500
She doesn't even know what she drew.

757
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,770
I know. She's clueless.

758
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,910
Just draw anything,
and I'll make it work.

759
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,410
- Go ahead.
- I'm already done with mine.

760
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,810
Just draw anything.

761
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,840
Just draw anything. Either way...

762
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,850
(Anyone and Nami are back.)

763
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,080
It's over for them.

764
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,280
- This is it.
- She's a killer.

765
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,750
Let's make this round work.

766
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,020
Make it work. Try it. Go.

767
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,590
(The improvisation show begins.)

768
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,220
- Bath.
- Handcart.

769
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,590
Take your time.

770
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,930
- Ca...
- Why did you go with "ca?"

771
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,230
(An animal that begins with "ca?")

772
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,660
Handcart. Handcar?

773
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,930
Capybara!

774
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,170
(There's the capybara!)

775
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,540
- Capybara!
- Capybara!

776
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,540
(Capybara works.)

777
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,000
- That works.
- Capybara.

778
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,010
(It's down to Haha and Seok Jin.)

779
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,410
Ra...

780
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,540
- Ratatouille.
- Ratatouille.

781
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,110
(Last syllable: Ra)

782
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,980
- Ratatouille?
- Ratatouille.

783
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,110
(Ratatouille? Lee So Ra!)

784
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,150
Lee So Ra.

785
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,890
Lee So Ra. She sang "I Am Happy."

786
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,020
- Show that.
- Lee So Ra.

787
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,660
"Lee So Ra's Propose." The TV show.

788
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,220
- Lee So Ra!
- That's Lee So Ra.

789
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,790
- That's right. That's Lee So Ra.
- I drew Lee So Ra.

790
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,630
- Give us this one.
- I drew her!

791
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,060
- Give us the point.
- It's fun, but they don't win.

792
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,230
We can somehow accept "Lee So Ra,"

793
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,900
- but this one...
- Ratatouille?

794
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,800
- Ratatouille!
- He's waving.

795
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,900
(Wrong)

796
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,670
- Capybara was a good one.
- This is Lee So Ra.

797
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,210
- I can't believe we won.
- Yes.

798
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,410
- Gosh.
- Well done.

799
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,550
- Good job.
- We already...

800
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,910
- So...
- That was awesome.

801
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,750
- Lee So Ra was a good one.
- Honestly...

802
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,320
I'll explain the rules
of the first vote.

803
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,220
Through the first vote,

804
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,120
we'll decide who will ride...

805
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,690
the thrilling spinning coaster
behind you that spins 360 degrees...

806
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,930
as it races along the track.

807
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,290
- The winners?
- I can't ride that.

808
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:22,800
(A roller coaster for kidults
that spins 360 degrees)

809
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,900
The seats spin on the spot
as the train goes forward.

810
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,800
- For real?
- That's so scary.

811
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,540
I can't ride that.

812
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,480
I can't ride stuff like this.
I feel nauseous already.

813
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,680
This is no joke.

814
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,110
- I might puke.
- That's so scary.

815
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,110
The chosen members
must not only go on the ride,

816
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,020
but they must also carry out...

817
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,720
- a penalty mission of sorts.
- Are you serious?

818
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
- Oh, good.
- Please...

819
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,820
I can't do it.

820
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,660
If I ride this,
I'll get really under the weather.

821
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,530
- Let's get someone on.
- It's time to vote,

822
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,560
- and you'll vote with your team.
- Okay.

823
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,560
- Do that.
- Okay.

824
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,570
We'll use
an ancient Spartan voting system...

825
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,000
called "shouting vote."

826
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,170
- What's that?
- "Shouting?"

827
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,200
The person who receives
the loudest shouts...

828
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,270
- wins the vote.
- I see.

829
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,540
- We shout?
- Okay.

830
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,810
That's fun.

831
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,210
An army of ten crew members...

832
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,780
will be selected to vote.

833
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,380
One representative from each team
will walk between them...

834
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,020
and say something that they think
will make the crew shout.

835
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,820
The team of the person
who made the crew shout loudest...

836
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,460
will avoid the roller coaster.

837
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,060
The losing team
will ride the spinning coaster.

838
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,430
There's a benefit
for the winning team.

839
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,100
They can exclude
three crew members...

840
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,440
when it's time
for the losing team to vote.

841
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,500
- Okay.
- You can exclude three...

842
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,640
- whom you think will be loud.
- Sounds good.

843
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,640
- Three people is huge.
- That means they have just seven...

844
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,810
to shout for them.

845
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:43,010
We need them to shout
when we pass by.

846
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,850
- Do something.
- Make them excited.

847
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,680
- Yes, we must do something.
- We must do something.

848
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,690
Crew army, come in, please.

849
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,750
It's about the team.

850
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,560
- We need them to scream.
- Oh, they're our family.

851
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,330
Hey, hi. Our family's here.

852
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,300
- Gosh.
- Good. They're family.

853
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,500
Oh, vote for us, please.

854
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,600
- Good. Hello.
- Thanks in advance.

855
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,030
- This won't be easy.
- This...

856
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,700
- It's not easy.
- It isn't.

857
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,710
We'll measure the decibels
the moment you exit the row,

858
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,310
and that number
will be your number of votes.

859
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,340
Sounds good.

860
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,110
- You're good at this.
- One hour.

861
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,310
Something to get them excited?

862
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,420
How about leaving an hour early?

863
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,620
- Who wants to go home?
- Going home early.

864
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,050
- "Who wants to go home?"
- Going home early.

865
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,690
Something to get them excited?

866
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,750
- "Shout if you want to go home!"
- A coffee truck?

867
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,090
- What?
- We must pay for one, then.

868
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,860
We can just pay for it.

869
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,760
(The eldest
doesn't want to spend a fortune.)

870
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,860
Pay for it.

871
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,930
- Shall we pay for one?
- Yes.

872
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,400
- They don't like coffee trucks.
- That's not good.

873
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,230
- They like personal perks.
- Something for themselves.

874
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,270
- Something for me.
- Something for me.

875
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,540
- What, then?
- Do you have another idea?

876
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,600
- Cash.
- Cash.

877
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,210
- A gift certificate.
- Fifty dollars.

878
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,210
(Instead of a coffee truck,
they'll pledge 50 dollars.)

879
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,510
Isn't 50 dollars too little?

880
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,440
Shall we start at a few dollars
and slowly go up?

881
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,580
- Yes, deal.
- Yes.

882
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,210
- What?
- Raise the amount.

883
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,120
What should I do?

884
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,220
- What?
- What should I do?

885
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,780
- You?
- The three cutesy motions.

886
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,920
- Act cute.
- Happy birthday comments.

887
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,690
- Act all cute...
- If that doesn't work,

888
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,060
- Ji Hu will spend cash.
- Cash?

889
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,830
You can go
from 10 to 50 dollars, okay?

890
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,830
- Yes.
- Okay.
These two?

891
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,400
- Up to 50 dollars?
- It must be them.

892
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,800
Good job.

893
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,570
It must be that.
That's the only way.

894
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,730
- I think it's awesome.
- It's the only way.

895
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,340
I think your IQ is really high.

896
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,210
It's incredible.

897
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,840
We'll definitely win.

898
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,580
- The score will soar.
- Who should do it?

899
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,110
You and him, you two can do it.

900
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,610
- Okay.
- That's best, right?

901
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,950
- Okay.
- Do we go between them?

902
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,950
Let's do it.

903
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,420
Did you select your representatives?

904
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,920
- We'll go first.
- Ye Eun and...

905
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,290
- You can go first.
- Pick three people to exclude.

906
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,690
- Three people?
- Which three...

907
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,930
Women can shout
pretty high and loud.

908
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,360
They're loud.

909
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,370
The Jimmy Jib director...

910
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,800
- He's pretty large.
- He's broad-chested.

911
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,370
But to save face, he doesn't shout.

912
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,210
- Right.
- You know what I mean, right?

913
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,740
Let's not exclude him. Leave him.

914
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,010
- We must exclude the cheeky ones.
- The cheeky ones?

915
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,180
We must drop the cheeky ones.
Do we take out Myung Jae?

916
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,180
(Cheeky director Myung Jae is out.)

917
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,780
- Good.
- Myung Jae, step back.

918
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,380
(Cheeky director Myung Jae is out.)

919
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,020
I think Ye Seul can shout loudly.

920
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,320
She looks like it, right?

921
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,820
Ye Seul's a bit...

922
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,390
Ye Seul's out.

923
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,490
One more person.

924
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,790
The Installation director?

925
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,630
- No, well...
- He's pretty feisty.

926
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,930
- He looks feisty. Jin Woo's out.
- Look at him.

927
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,330
- Jin Woo. That's it.
- Just look.

928
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,900
We'll exclude the energetic people.

929
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,970
We must. That will do. Good.

930
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,740
Okay. We're done.

931
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,310
Two people
from the losing team can go first.

932
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,140
- We have two shots.
- Ye Eun will kick it off.

933
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,850
- Are you ready?
- Go, Ye Eun.

934
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,950
- Let's go.
- I'm ready.

935
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,520
- Talk loudly. With confidence.
- Shout loudly.

936
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,820
I'm declaring, right?
(Team Seok Jin: Ye Eunidas)

937
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,850
I'm here.

938
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,560
(The decibels go up as she speaks.)

939
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,420
When you're tired and feel down.

940
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,090
- Good.
- I'll be cute.

941
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,430
- I'll be cute.
- Three types.

942
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,600
I'll show you
the triple set of cuteness.

943
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,030
I'll send it to you as an audio file
or call you on video.

944
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,770
Goodness.
There's no way they'll shout.

945
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,600
(Acting cute)

946
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,640
(Booing)

947
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,110
(They boo her dreadful attempt
at being cute.)

948
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,310
(Acting cute)

949
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,480
(The number won't change.)

950
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,490
(Acting cute)

951
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,850
(A supply with no demand)

952
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,020
I'd rather watch you eat.

953
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,490
- I'd rather watch you eat.
- Ji Hu, move in.

954
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,190
She's not going anywhere.

955
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,190
You did well.

956
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,400
- It's hard.
- Ji Hu, you have a shot.

957
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,030
- Let's do this.
- Go for it.

958
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,770
- You know what to do.
- Yes.

959
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,900
- Speak loudly.
- An octave higher.

960
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,370
- You're acting in a drama scene.
- Okay.

961
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,270
Ji Hu, after your speech, tell them
to applaud and count to three.

962
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,180
Okay. As soon as I finish talking,

963
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,580
the people who scream
and shout the loudest...

964
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,450
will get ten dollars each.

965
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,920
Will get ten dollars each.

966
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,290
(Money!)

967
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,690
(It's definitely more effective
than acting cute!)

968
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,190
I'll give you 30 dollars each!

969
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,230
Forty dollars! Fifty dollars!

970
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,200
(The shouts become louder
as the amount goes up.)

971
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,100
(This pledge is definitely working.)

972
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,270
(Screaming)

973
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,010
(Screaming)

974
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,310
(Ji Hu's vote is over.)

975
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,840
We did it.

976
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,110
(What's the final count?)

977
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,550
- Please.
- Please.

978
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,520
- It's 86.
- It must be higher.

979
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,320
- It's just 86.
- Then...

980
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,720
- What?
- You did well, Ji Hu.

981
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,290
- Thanks.
- It's okay.

982
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,290
Well done.

983
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,420
It's lower than I thought.

984
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,120
Simple is best.

985
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,860
You three can come back in.

986
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,660
(The excluded crew members
return for Team Jae Seok's vote.)

987
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,830
Can the two representatives
go together?

988
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,200
- Two people in one go.
- We'll do it just once.

989
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,400
- Yes, you can do that.
- Do it. That's an advantage.

990
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,740
- Then...
- There's one more voice.

991
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,540
They'll lose energy later on.

992
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,410
- Everyone.
- Seung Hyub, you too.

993
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,310
- Oh, me too?
- I know you're tired.

994
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,310
That's right.

995
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,580
I was offended.

996
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,680
They'll give ten dollars
to the loudest? Are you kidding me?

997
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,720
It's a joke.

998
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,490
(They start off...)

999
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,290
(Positive reaction)

1000
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,820
(by criticizing the other team.)

1001
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,330
- We'll actually pay.
- The person...

1002
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,030
- who shouts the most...
- What's that?

1003
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,200
will get 200 dollars.

1004
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,160
(Actual bills make an appearance.)

1005
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,030
(They scream at the sight of cash.)

1006
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,570
This is it!

1007
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,110
(Team Jae Seok's cash pledge...)

1008
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,510
- Does anyone have cash?
- That's what we need.

1009
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,080
With 50-dollar bills...

1010
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,110
Good.
If you do that...

1011
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,280
(Jong Kook thought of it,)

1012
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,480
(and Jae Seok opened his wallet.)

1013
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,490
(It was effective.)

1014
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,490
Is it actual cash?

1015
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,590
(Screaming)

1016
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,260
(Screaming)

1017
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:36,570
(Voters gather around
the visible promise of cash.)

1018
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,530
(They vote until the very end.)

1019
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,570
- That will do.
- Where did the cash come from?

1020
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,010
- He has cash?
- Suddenly...

1021
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,110
Just like that?

1022
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,740
- Okay.
- It's visible.

1023
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,280
Yes. It's visible.

1024
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,250
- Hey. What is this?
- Come on.

1025
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,580
- That's too much.
- The rich won.

1026
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,650
I'm 23 years old.

1027
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,350
The rich win, then.

1028
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,790
The voters gathered around me.

1029
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,560
Gosh. That was something.

1030
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,520
We have the shouting vote results.

1031
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,230
- Jae Seok's team won.
- What the heck is this?

1032
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,030
Here. It's yours to spend!

1033
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:13,200
(They carry out the pledge
that captivates the voters.)

1034
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,740
That's it. Thank you, everyone!

1035
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,770
- Gosh.
- That was amazing.

1036
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,710
- It was...
- Well done.

1037
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,810
- It was an obvious win.
- That was unbeatable.

1038
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,950
- It was an obvious result.
- Fake pledges never work.

1039
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,220
You lost the shouting vote,

1040
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,020
so you'll ride the spinning coaster.

1041
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,120
- All of us?
- All of us?

1042
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,520
Yes, all five of you.

1043
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,020
As you were told,

1044
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:39,730
you must put on lipstick
as nicely as you can on the ride.

1045
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,960
- You succeed if you manage that.
- Okay.

1046
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,070
It's not hard.

1047
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,570
- Are you good at this?
- I enjoy rides,

1048
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,500
but I'm not sure
about spinning 360 degrees.

1049
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,040
I really can't do this.

1050
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,470
- You really can't?
- No.

1051
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,910
- Why not? You just can't?
- I just can't.

1052
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,870
- I can't do these rides.
- It's hard.

1053
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,210
- Come here.
- Come this way.

1054
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,810
- Okay.
- My gosh.

1055
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,280
- Let's go.
- I wanted Daniel to ride this.

1056
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,650
- For real.
- What about Yu Jae Seok?

1057
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,650
- See you later, Seok Jin.
- Or do you want to...

1058
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,680
- See you later.
- go instead of me?

1059
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
Instead of you?

1060
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,920
Just go and ride it.

1061
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,520
Gosh, that's scary.
I'm even scared of this.

1062
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,290
- Please.
- Seriously.

1063
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,360
Come on.

1064
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,060
- For real.
- It was a manhole.

1065
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,490
- You can't be scared of a manhole.
- No, I'm so serious.

1066
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,500
That's how scared I am.

1067
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,630
- So don't tease me.
- All right.

1068
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,330
Seok Jin, aren't you scared?

1069
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,370
- I am scared.
- But they say this isn't that bad.

1070
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,040
The Nevis Swing here...

1071
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,070
- That's right.
- And didn't you ride this too?

1072
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,310
- What did you ride?
- Me? My goodness.

1073
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,180
- Did you... The cordless bungee.
- The cordless bungee.

1074
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,880
- I did the cordless bungee jump.
- Right.

1075
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,250
- My gosh. The cordless bungee.
- Cordless?

1076
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,420
- Oh, no. We're in trouble.
- Hello.

1077
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,780
- My gosh.
- This is crazy.

1078
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,150
Yes, hello.

1079
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,890
- I guess they do this on purpose.
- Yes, they do.

1080
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,220
- The Lego hands?
- Like this?

1081
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,320
- Yes.
- The Lego hands.

1082
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,890
- We're in trouble.
- This is insane. Oh, no.

1083
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,020
- My gosh.
- Please go to the front.

1084
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,090
Does this spin?

1085
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,560
- I'm in huge trouble.
- Oh, no.

1086
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,830
I can't ride spinning things.

1087
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,100
Gosh, I vomit on these things.

1088
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,070
- I can't ride spinning rides.
- I get dizzy.

1089
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,640
What if we vomit?

1090
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,740
(Scared)

1091
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,710
- Have people vomited before?
- Have people vomited before?

1092
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,540
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

1093
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,980
Hello.

1094
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,010
How will we sit?

1095
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,580
- This is crazy.
- Can we get in this one too?

1096
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,750
- Yes.
- Please stand here.

1097
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,810
This one is the least scary, right?

1098
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,020
This is the front, right?

1099
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,520
Haha, let's sit together.

1100
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,990
Haha, please sit with me.

1101
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,250
Yes, I'll feel more courageous
if I sit next to you.

1102
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,190
- Nevis!
- Swing!

1103
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,760
- Shall we face each other?
- Seok Jin is sitting alone.

1104
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,090
- Am I sitting alone?
- Yes.

1105
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,800
- Sit in front.
- But it's the scariest in front.

1106
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,330
It's not scary. It spins.

1107
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,070
(The guy in his late 50s
or early 60s...)

1108
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,800
(gets cast aside on his own
because of the nimble cowards.)

1109
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,140
- I'm in trouble.
- Se Chan.

1110
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,200
(The guy in his late 50s
or early 60s...)

1111
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,240
(gets cast aside on his own
because of the nimble cowards.)

1112
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,710
Ji Hu.

1113
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,670
Se Chan.

1114
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,680
- Beep.
- I'm scared.

1115
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,240
Does this come down?
It should, right?

1116
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,450
Isn't there a thing here?

1117
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,750
- Take the lipsticks.
- The lipstick is black.

1118
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,650
Oh, my. Is this really lipstick?

1119
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,190
Oh, it is.

1120
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,860
(The black lipstick that
they'll apply while on the ride)

1121
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,120
- We have to do this. Pull this.
- What?

1122
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,360
- Pull this.
- Oh, this?

1123
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,560
- Hey, why is this screw loose?
- Can we do this?

1124
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,360
Why, you little...

1125
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,030
You were born to tease me.

1126
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,640
That's true. The screw is...

1127
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,240
- Guys.
- What?

1128
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,740
Why did you do badly
and make us get on this ride?

1129
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,240
Gosh, seriously.

1130
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,850
(As Seok Sam grumbles,
they are about to take off.)

1131
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,750
I'm scared.

1132
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,350
- It's starting.
- I'm so scared.

1133
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,250
All right. We can do this.

1134
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,390
How bad could it be?

1135
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,130
- I hope I can look pretty.
- Why am I in the very front?

1136
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,860
- Oh, it's starting!
- It starts like this?

1137
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,260
Why am I in the very front?

1138
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,900
- Oh, it's starting!
- It starts like this?

1139
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,000
Do it now.

1140
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,030
(They finally set off.)

1141
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,430
I don't like this.

1142
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,340
- It goes up right here.
- I think it started.

1143
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,640
- Yes, it's going up.
- Right?

1144
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,070
- It's spinning.
- The sound is a bit...

1145
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,310
It's going now.

1146
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,910
- Oh, it spins.
- That's right. Going up.

1147
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,310
- There they go.
- Look at that.

1148
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,310
Yes, that's right.

1149
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,120
(Peacefully applying makeup)

1150
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,480
(Screaming)

1151
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,890
(The cowards can't even try to apply
the lipstick.)

1152
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,020
Gosh, please.

1153
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,360
(Groaning)

1154
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,560
(Dry heaving from being scared)

1155
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,870
(They face the drop in no time.)

1156
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,070
Is that good? Did I apply it well?

1157
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,540
- Ye Eun, are you okay?
- No!

1158
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,140
- I think I got it.
- Here we go.

1159
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,110
- No.
- Oh, no.

1160
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,180
No, please.

1161
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,110
- No.
- Please.

1162
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,680
(Screaming)

1163
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,250
(Laughing)

1164
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,990
Ye Eun, are you alive?

1165
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,330
(About to die)

1166
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,100
(Screaming)

1167
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,470
(Yelling)

1168
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,600
Mom!

1169
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,270
(About to cry)

1170
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:49,450
(While the cowardly brothers get
their screen time as they shiver)

1171
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,210
- You're so mean!
- Darn it!

1172
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,980
(Feeling awesome)

1173
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,490
(Passed out)

1174
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,260
- Oh, it's fast.
- My gosh.

1175
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,700
- Hey, it looks like fun.
- It's nice.

1176
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,970
- That must be exciting.
- This looks like fun.

1177
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,500
(Screaming)

1178
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,040
(Experiencing
the world beyond death...)

1179
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,540
(on a ride that kids also ride)

1180
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,580
(Squeezing Ji Hu's hand tight,
eyes shut tight)

1181
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,990
(Shrieking)

1182
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,090
(Yelling)

1183
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,060
Oh, it must be over.

1184
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,260
(They narrowly escaped death.)

1185
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,130
Bye.

1186
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,840
Oh, please.

1187
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,070
I think it's over.

1188
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,310
Gosh, this is so scary.

1189
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,910
(Gosh, this is so scary.)

1190
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,380
(They don't look that great
in the first place,)

1191
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,110
(but they look even more pathetic
after that experience with gravity.)

1192
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,850
- I'm dizzy.
- What is this? Are we going again?

1193
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,890
- No, we're stopping.
- Are we going again?

1194
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:03,950
I had motion sickness.

1195
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,150
- Is it over?
- I'm dizzy.

1196
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,060
Is this the end?

1197
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,260
- I had motion sickness.
- It's over, right?

1198
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,560
That's the end.

1199
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,430
- Thank you.
- My goodness.

1200
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,730
Hey, you did better than I thought.

1201
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,500
What is this thing doing?

1202
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,100
(Trying to escape
as they come to a stop)

1203
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,140
This thing.

1204
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,840
Oh, thank you.

1205
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,570
- It was fun, though.
- It was fun.

1206
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,540
Gosh, that sinking feeling
in the pit of your stomach.

1207
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,980
- Hey, what's scary about that?
- It's over in a flash.

1208
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,950
- It's a piece of cake.
- It's for kids.

1209
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,280
- Gosh, those cowards.
- My goodness.

1210
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,450
- I could even draw on that ride.
- Then,

1211
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,190
if you want to ride it...

1212
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,350
(You can ride it.)

1213
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,060
- No.
- I'm fine.

1214
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,160
- It's not like I want to ride it.
- I'm fine.

1215
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,460
- No, that's okay.
- We don't have to.

1216
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,360
Earlier...
You know how that thing spins?

1217
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,830
As it was spinning,

1218
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,070
you two weren't there. So,

1219
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,100
- Oh, because we had spun around?
- I was like, "Did they fall off?"

1220
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,670
- It was all right, wasn't it?
- They look like the Grim Reaper.

1221
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,570
- What is that?
- It was a dark color.

1222
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,410
- It was okay, but...
- It was all right.

1223
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,480
Gosh,
these guys should really go on it.

1224
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,240
I know. You really have to ride it.

1225
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,350
Then, after a short break,

1226
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,720
- we'll move to the next location.
- Okay!

1227
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,850
(Where is the next location
where they'll vote for the second time?)

1228
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,020
Let's go!

1229
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,350
We're here. Where are we?

1230
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,520
It must be a dakgalbi restaurant.

1231
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,890
- That sounds so delicious.
- That's insane!

1232
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,060
The smell!

1233
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,660
It's insane.

1234
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,330
- There she goes again.
- The smell.

1235
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,600
I have to eat this.

1236
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,800
It smells delicious.

1237
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,670
Now,
you will vote for the second time.

1238
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,740
- Please.
- You can get into teams...

1239
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,910
with five members each.

1240
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,910
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

1241
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,740
But why do I keep playing
rock-paper-scissors with you?

1242
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,310
Is it because I look like you?

1243
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,750
Is it because
my mouth is protruding? What is it?

1244
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,480
You keep coming right at me.

1245
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,120
- Rock-paper-scissors. Okay.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1246
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,150
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1247
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,220
Oh, I lost.

1248
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,950
- Scissors. I lost.
- I won.

1249
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,560
Hey! Enjoy being on the same team
as those old men!

1250
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,630
The second vote...

1251
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,530
will be to elect a team leader.

1252
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,830
- To elect a team leader?
- Yes.

1253
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:56,030
- You just got into teams of five.
- Yes.

1254
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:59,640
You have to choose
each team's leader wisely.

1255
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,470
The reason why you have to choose
your team leader wisely...

1256
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,970
is because each team's leader...

1257
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,080
will decide whether or not...

1258
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,510
you will get to eat dakgalbi,
Chuncheon's most popular dish.

1259
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,610
I have to eat this.

1260
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,650
It says what the mission is
in the envelope.

1261
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,650
(First, the topic of the mission for
the team leaders is revealed.)

1262
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,850
Let's see.

1263
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,360
- Oh, okay.
- Haha.

1264
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,020
I think...

1265
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,130
It could be origami.

1266
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,360
- I'm not good with my hands.
- You are?

1267
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,560
Then, you can stand aside.

1268
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,600
(She admits her defeat.)

1269
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,370
- What about you?
- I think I'm bad with my hands too.

1270
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:32,430
- I'm honestly good with my hands.
- Your hands?

1271
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,270
- Then, you do it. Make up for it.
- Really?

1272
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,270
Daniel, I'm sorry, but...

1273
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,510
You can't say
you're good at everything.

1274
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,710
Don't do this.

1275
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,680
No, but I am good.
When I was little,

1276
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,510
I received 30 awards for drawing.

1277
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,810
- This is about our meal.
- Oh, then...

1278
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,410
- It's either you or me.
- Right.

1279
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,980
- Because if we're using our body...
- Right.

1280
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,020
- Right.
- That could be it.

1281
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,420
- So, we could...
- Then...

1282
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,450
This is about our meal.

1283
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,360
- Okay.
- We can totally eat.

1284
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,190
Hey, our meal depends on this.
Ye Eun.

1285
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,730
- Yes, I know.
- Right.

1286
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,690
- Go into the voting booth.
- There are voting booths.

1287
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,960
Gosh, this vote...

1288
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,230
My, what could this be?

1289
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,030
(The secret voting booth
looks pretty legit.)

1290
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,300
Our meals depend on this.

1291
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,700
- Right?
- Gosh, this is hard.

1292
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,600
They have voting booths.

1293
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,940
- There are voting booths.
- They're all prepared.

1294
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:16,750
(The one person who will protect
the team's meal)

1295
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,180
(Kim Jong Kook)

1296
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,880
Gosh, we really have to eat this.

1297
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,590
(Yu Jae Seok)

1298
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,490
Gosh, this vote...

1299
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,490
(Ttuk and Kkuk amicably vote
for one another.)

1300
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,790
We have to eat.

1301
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,130
Our meal depends on this.

1302
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,130
(Team Jae Seok's 5 members
finish voting.)

1303
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,860
Gosh, what's this?

1304
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,000
(Next, Team Haha goes to vote.)

1305
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,400
- There must be a reason.
- Let's go.

1306
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,870
Could this be a trick, perhaps?
Is it a trap?

1307
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,470
Now, each team's leaders
have been decided.

1308
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,510
- Team Haha voted for...
- What is it?

1309
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,480
- Choi Daniel as your leader.
- Yes.

1310
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,110
Daniel received three votes.

1311
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,680
Seung Hyub received two votes.

1312
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,880
That's how we voted?

1313
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,150
(The team voted for Daniel
who's good with his hands.)

1314
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,850
Meanwhile, Team Jae Seok...

1315
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,090
(Team Jae Seok's leader
who'll go up against Daniel)

1316
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,820
(The two wrote each other's names.)

1317
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,960
Jae Seok received four votes,

1318
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,030
and Jong Kook received one.

1319
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,100
- Who voted for me?
- Who voted for him?

1320
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,030
He must've voted for me
feeling burdened.

1321
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,000
Jae Seok is your team leader.

1322
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,170
So, Jae Seok and Daniel
are representing...

1323
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,840
- their teams.
- You can do this.

1324
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,540
This is doable.

1325
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,640
What do you mean I'm beatable?

1326
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,140
We've already won.

1327
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,240
Now, please bring in the table.

1328
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,310
What is it?

1329
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,210
- Be good with your hands.
- Be good with your hands?

1330
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,650
- Does it have to do with speed?
- You must have to be fast.

1331
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,180
- Maybe you have to peel something.
- What is this?

1332
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,990
- What is all this?
- You must have to be fast.

1333
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:31,990
- Be good with your hands?
- Could this be it?
(Buns and beverages are being set
on the table.)

1334
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,560
Could this be it?

1335
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,130
Jae Seok tenses up
when he has to do something fast.

1336
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,660
Exactly. That's why I said
it shouldn't be me.

1337
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,960
Let's see what you have to do first.

1338
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,930
- I don't want to miss my meal.
- You can beat Daniel.

1339
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,370
- The fork...
- Here's the game...

1340
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,430
the team leaders will play
to determine who eats lunch.

1341
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:48,370
Only with your hands,
you must keep the table set as is.

1342
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,710
The game is Pull Out the Tablecloth.

1343
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,810
- You need to pull it out.
- Pull Out the Tablecloth.

1344
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,410
- Pull Out the Tablecloth?
- No way.

1345
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,540
(Flustered by the unexpected game)

1346
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,740
Pull it out?

1347
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,350
No way.

1348
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,880
I'm really good at this.

1349
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,150
I want to eat those buns.

1350
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,190
- You can do it, Jae Seok.
- Pull Out the Tablecloth.

1351
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,920
- You can do it.
- You can do this.

1352
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,720
- He's good at things like this.
- You've got this.

1353
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,020
I have a feeling
you'll be good at this.

1354
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,460
Is this what you have to pull out?

1355
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,890
- This will be hard.
- You chose a member...

1356
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,130
to represent the team.

1357
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,130
You will take turns
trying to pull it out.

1358
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,170
You will try to pull it out
without knocking over the items.

1359
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,870
The first person who succeeds,
along with his team,

1360
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,940
will get to eat dakgalbi.

1361
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,610
The team that loses...

1362
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,280
will have lunch
only with basic side dishes.

1363
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,510
- Daniel.
- Oh, no.

1364
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,050
- The team will get to eat dakgalbi.
- Pull it all the way to your body.

1365
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,020
Like this.

1366
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,820
- Not like this.
- That would topple over.

1367
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,880
Pull it hard.

1368
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,590
That's what you need to do.

1369
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,590
This is what Se Chan said.

1370
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,460
Make sure to pull it
all the way to your body.

1371
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,160
No way. He eavesdropped.

1372
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,690
Pull it all the way to your body.

1373
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,800
Can I check how long it is?

1374
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,830
Yes, of course.

1375
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,030
- Daniel.
- Yes?

1376
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,730
Can I offer my help?

1377
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,600
What is this, a golf game?

1378
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,140
Are you checking
where you need to putt?

1379
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,170
(He's seen people
do this somewhere.)

1380
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,310
- The cloth is quite long.
- Jae Seok...

1381
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,310
Do you have to pull it out
in one motion?

1382
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,480
- It can't be caught on the table.
- It's quite long.

1383
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,810
- It's shorter on that side.
- This will be at least 80cm.

1384
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,220
Pull this from here.

1385
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,920
- I'd like to try first.
- Sure.

1386
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,190
(Team Leader Yu goes first.)

1387
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,350
Really?

1388
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,360
Good for you, Jae Seok.

1389
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,460
- You can do this.
- The order doesn't really matter.

1390
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,620
- Right.
- The order doesn't matter.

1391
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:18,290
- You can do this.
- Know when to pull hard.

1392
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:21,460
Imagine the cloth as the hair
of the enemy that hurt your parents.

1393
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,530
(He can't even hear
Seok Sam's weird metaphor.)

1394
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,170
- Don't pull it straight back.
- He's good at these games.

1395
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,570
- Right. You can do this.
- He's good at them.

1396
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:28,000
Pull it all the way to your body.

1397
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,510
- This...
- Shift your weight.

1398
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,440
- Grab it closer.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

1399
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,740
You'll have more room that way.

1400
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,010
Seeing them discussing this
is only a good thing for us.

1401
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,550
Even from behind,
you can tell he's burdened.

1402
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,750
- His shoulders.
- He's already nervous.

1403
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,950
- "Dad's Challenge!"
- Pull it downward.

1404
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:42,950
Hold on a second.

1405
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,250
- "Dad's Challenge!"
- Wait.

1406
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:45,420
Don't keep your arms too far apart.

1407
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,860
It's all in his hands now.

1408
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,390
Know when to pull hard.

1409
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:49,960
- Don't let anything get caught.
- If he fails,

1410
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,930
his younger siblings
won't get to eat lunch.

1411
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,530
Look at how hungry we are.

1412
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,900
He is being watched by 100 people.

1413
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,300
- Just pull.
- All right!

1414
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,870
- Don't be nervous.
- Even from behind,

1415
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,000
you can tell he feels burdened.

1416
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,040
He's already chicken.

1417
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,640
- He won't be able to do it.
- Be quiet, will you?

1418
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,180
- I was just...
- Jae Seok, you can do this.

1419
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,750
He can try it 100 times.
He still won't be able to do it.

1420
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,650
- This won't work.
- Start!

1421
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,880
- Okay, good.
- Where's the tension?

1422
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,820
- Pull on it slightly.
- He's chicken.

1423
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,190
(Sighing)

1424
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:20,720
- They'll come down crashing.
- Yes, crashing.

1425
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,090
- Darn it.
- See?

1426
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,060
Darn it.

1427
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,600
(A perfect failure)

1428
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,970
- It should've been tighter.
- This isn't easy.

1429
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,430
Jae Seok, hear me out.

1430
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,900
You had to hold it with tension.

1431
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,170
- He knows what to do now.
- This isn't easy.

1432
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:35,300
This isn't easy.

1433
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:36,440
Look.

1434
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,640
He was too slow.

1435
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,040
You need to pull it out really fast.

1436
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,610
- Of course.
- Really fast.

1437
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,810
This can't be done.

1438
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,910
This is nerve-wracking.

1439
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,950
- Of course. It isn't easy.
- I know, but please.

1440
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,120
(Daniel said he was good
with his hands, and now he's up.)

1441
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,090
Someone needs to succeed
for anyone to eat lunch.

1442
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,520
Yes, that's the spot.

1443
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:57,090
Remember to maintain
your strength and speed.

1444
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,830
- Maintain my strength and speed.
- That's easier said than done.

1445
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:00,130
- He's really fast though.
- Go, Daniel!

1446
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,870
Daniel, make a swoosh sound
like a whip.

1447
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,630
Swoosh. Like this.

1448
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,670
Swoosh. Like this?

1449
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:08,270
It's already over for him.

1450
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,640
He's going to fail.

1451
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,240
Daniel, if you fail this too,

1452
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,040
you'll be the villain of this race.

1453
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,510
Also, keep your eyes on the items.

1454
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:15,740
- Should I look at them?
- Yes, look at them.

1455
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,780
- Watch.
- You've got this.

1456
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,910
- Only look at the items.
- I bet...

1457
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,250
- they'll come crashing down.
- Swiftly.

1458
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,550
- Start.
- I don't think he can do this.

1459
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,550
(Can Team Leader Choi prove
he is good with his hands?)

1460
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:26,960
Don't drag it.

1461
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,120
Darn.

1462
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,930
- Unbelievable.
- Are you kidding me?

1463
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,730
(Tumbling)

1464
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,230
- They went flying.
- He does nothing right.

1465
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,470
(Anger)

1466
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,330
- I told you so.
- He does nothing right.

1467
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,440
They went flying.

1468
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,470
- I mean...
- Hold on.

1469
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,370
- Won't we get to eat dakgalbi?
- He's angry.

1470
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:46,340
This is why... Look.

1471
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,840
Here's why Se Chan told you
to shift your weight back.

1472
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,310
You should keep
the tablecloth leveled.

1473
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:52,750
You pulled it downward,
so everything went flying.

1474
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,720
- Do you get it now?
- Yes, I get it.

1475
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,950
- Yes, I...
- Can you step aside?

1476
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,690
Keep it leveled.

1477
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,220
(Now it's Jae Seok's turn
once more.)

1478
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,220
- Pull it out all the way.
- Keep the tension.

1479
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,790
- Make sure it's taut like this.
- Got it.

1480
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:06,930
- If this is shorter...
- Okay, we're good.

1481
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,530
That's it.
You're holding it correctly.

1482
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:09,930
- Now, go.
- Looking good.

1483
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,070
(As coached by Trainer Kook,
he holds the cloth taut.)

1484
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,600
Start.

1485
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,500
- You can do this.
- Swiftly.

1486
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,570
You can be fast.

1487
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:16,970
You're fast, Jae Seok.

1488
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,540
- Jae Seok, be swift.
- He's not ready yet.

1489
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,740
- Start.
- Pull it out swiftly.

1490
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,450
- He heard you.
- Didn't he say, "Star?"

1491
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:24,950
You pulled it out enough earlier.

1492
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,850
(Team Leader Yu's second attempt)

1493
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:31,450
(How will he do this time?)

1494
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:32,850
That's it!

1495
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,260
No, it can't be true.

1496
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:37,730
That's it!

1497
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:40,730
- That's it!
- He did it.

1498
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:42,260
(One of the cans on top
tumbled down.)

1499
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,430
- You're actually doing it.
- No way.

1500
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,870
If only that had stayed in place.

1501
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,240
- How did he do that?
- That was close.

1502
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,040
- No way.
- You almost had it.

1503
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,740
- That was as good as done.
- It's done now.

1504
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,270
He can absolutely do this.

1505
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:55,840
(There seems to be hope
for Team Jae Seok.)

1506
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,310
- No way.
- I knew it.

1507
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,550
- We'll be able to eat.
- Hold onto that feeling.

1508
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,720
- We'll be able to eat.
- I think so too.

1509
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,120
(Team Jae Seok moves a step closer
to the dakgalbi.)

1510
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,450
- No way.
- My gosh.

1511
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,420
- How...
- I should grab it like so.

1512
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,460
Daniel, look.

1513
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,460
Don't bounce up like so.

1514
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,960
- Don't bounce?
- Squat down instead.

1515
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,090
- Squat down?
- Yes.

1516
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,800
- Like so?
- There's no way he can do this.

1517
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,370
(Swoosh!)

1518
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,670
(Practicing hard with the apron)

1519
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,140
I'm sure we'll get to eat.

1520
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,110
- I'll give it a try.
- He can't do it.

1521
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,210
- You've got this.
- You can do it.

1522
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:26,240
- Go, Daniel.
- I'm nervous.

1523
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,640
- Good luck!
- Go, team!

1524
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,140
(If he fails like last time,
the others will have the dakgalbi.)

1525
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,810
- Go ahead.
- Bend down a bit more.

1526
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:32,310
- Hold it taut.
- As taut as you can.

1527
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:33,450
There's a good chance he'll succeed.

1528
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:34,920
- No way.
- There's no way.

1529
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,050
- Start.
- Jump back swiftly.
(Did his special training pay off?)

1530
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,690
Good. That's how you do it.

1531
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,920
Swoosh!

1532
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,090
(Did he succeed?)

1533
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:45,830
Good. That's how you do it.

1534
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,870
(Only a can and a fork
fell off the table.)

1535
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,930
(However, he improved immensely
on his 2nd attempt.)

1536
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,200
- That's it.
- That was amazing.

1537
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,270
That was so close.

1538
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,940
(That was close.)

1539
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,940
- You did much better.
- I should've pulled harder...

1540
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,970
with my left arm.

1541
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:01,040
I get it now.
I know what I need to do.

1542
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,940
- You've got this.
- Faster.

1543
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,510
I need to be a little faster.

1544
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,280
Let's get everything in the center.

1545
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,150
(Setting the table together)

1546
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,650
This is great teamwork, you guys.

1547
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:13,220
He almost had it,
so we need to make sure...

1548
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,560
- everything's in place.
- Of course.

1549
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,890
- A minor difference...
- Exactly.

1550
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:19,560
Please. I hope he fails.

1551
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,860
(Mr. Free Meals
desperately wants dakgalbi.)

1552
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,230
I think he'll do it this time.

1553
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,270
- Shift the weight back.
- Jump backward.

1554
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:26,970
That will send the items forward.

1555
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,040
(Determined)

1556
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,040
- This looks good.
- Yes, we're all set.

1557
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,310
- It's perfect.
- Good luck.

1558
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:32,840
- Scientifically, it's perfect.
- Good luck!

1559
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,880
Start.

1560
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,310
He's got it.

1561
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,080
- We'll win.
- This is perfect.

1562
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,580
- I want to eat.
- Don't be nervous.

1563
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:40,420
- You've got this.
- Just grill the chicken.

1564
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,450
- He won't succeed.
- You're good.

1565
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:43,350
All we have to do
is set the table to eat.

1566
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,790
(It's probably the last chance
Jae Seok will get.)

1567
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,090
Our team will eat.

1568
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,520
It's over.

1569
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,260
(Well?)

1570
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:53,730
Our team will eat.

1571
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:54,800
It's over.

1572
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,930
- He did it!
- He did it!

1573
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:01,200
(He succeeded!)

1574
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,210
He did it, right? He did it.

1575
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:05,010
- Jae Seok succeeded.
- Okay!

1576
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,010
(Jae Seok succeeds.)

1577
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,440
Team Jae Seok...

1578
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,450
- will be the one to eat.
- Okay.

1579
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:11,510
(The 5 members of Team Jae Seok
will eat dakgalbi.)

1580
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:13,220
- No way.
- You did great.

1581
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,980
- Nice.
- That was amazing.

1582
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,550
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1583
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:17,590
- You did great.
- I don't even like dakgalbi.

1584
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:18,620
It's fine.

1585
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,060
- I've had too much chicken.
- You did your best.

1586
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,760
- I'm sorry.
- He's right. You did great.

1587
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,790
But that was challenging.
How did he even do it?

1588
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,030
No way.

1589
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:27,060
Okay! We're having dakgalbi.

1590
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,730
- Dakgalbi!
- Let's eat.

1591
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,630
- Good job.
- Let's have dakgalbi.

1592
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,200
- Goodness. Thank you.
- My gosh.

1593
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,240
Let's eat.

1594
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,540
(Lightly grilled
on a charcoal stove)

1595
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,200
Are you sure we can enjoy this?

1596
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,740
- Tell me about it.
- I wanted this badly.

1597
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,370
Let's have some protein.

1598
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,740
- Absolutely.
- I haven't had dakgalbi in a while.

1599
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,550
(Thanks to the team leader,
Team Jae Seok gets to feast.)

1600
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:45,280
- I can't believe it.
- No way.

1601
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,720
- Here we go.
- This is insane!

1602
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,790
Are you sure we can enjoy this?

1603
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,750
- This is insane.
- It's been grilled.

1604
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,220
- I'll enjoy this.
- I'll enjoy this.

1605
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,460
I'll enjoy this.

1606
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,230
Guys, please enjoy it.

1607
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:59,590
- I'll cut it with my teeth.
- Here.

1608
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:00,760
Check this out.

1609
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,170
That looks really good.

1610
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:06,230
- I saw the juice.
- That juice.

1611
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,740
- No way.
- The juices are flowing.

1612
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,470
Seok Jin, is it good?

1613
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,280
(Juicy meat under soft skin)

1614
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,310
How is it?

1615
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,480
- Please enjoy.
- Enjoy!

1616
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:19,880
Check this out.

1617
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,020
(The protein monster
tries the gochujang dakgalbi first.)

1618
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,320
- Unbelievable.
- That looks really good.

1619
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,350
(Munching)

1620
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,160
(Food Fighter
desperately wanted dakgalbi.)

1621
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,960
- Is it that good?
- Gosh, this dakgalbi.

1622
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,200
(Showing her joy by twisting)

1623
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,030
I should try some too.

1624
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,170
It's so good.

1625
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,770
(While they're enjoying their food)

1626
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,140
(There's one person enjoying it
more than anyone else.)

1627
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,740
(In bliss)

1628
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,880
Oh, thank you.

1629
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,980
(Right then)

1630
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,380
- Here it is.
- They served it right away.

1631
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:54,780
- Makguksu!
- I want some too.

1632
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,050
- Gosh, dakgalbi and makguksu.
- With the dakgalbi...

1633
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:59,860
An extra order of makguksu, please!

1634
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,220
(Slurping)

1635
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,960
(Totally focused)

1636
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:05,790
(She cuts up some dakgalbi
and adds it to her makguksu.)

1637
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,960
- It's fine.
- I love this.

1638
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:12,270
(Taking a big bite)

1639
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,770
Is this not it?

1640
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,070
It's so good.

1641
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,570
(Eat the makguksu...)

1642
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,080
(with the dakgalbi.)

1643
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,180
(The girl on a diet lets loose
at the obviously yummy combination.)

1644
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,380
This is Ye Eun's cheat meal.

1645
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,380
(Food Fighter eats it all up
like she's possessed as usual.)

1646
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,790
- That's peculiar.
- It's not what we usually see.

1647
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,090
It's all chicken thigh.

1648
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,590
(And those who must watch them)

1649
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:35,790
(Painful)

1650
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:36,990
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1651
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,460
- No.
- Don't be.

1652
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,760
- Daniel, you fought well.
- But really...

1653
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,800
- We lost, but we fought well.
- It's not that you did badly.

1654
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,200
Jae Seok was just good.

1655
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,070
Rice? Where?

1656
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,270
Do we really not get any?

1657
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,810
(Envious)

1658
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,840
- At least we get pickled tomatoes.
- Right.

1659
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,110
Tomatoes.

1660
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:58,010
This is nice. We get rice too.

1661
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,280
I should mix this with my rice.

1662
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,080
Oh, we get one each.

1663
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,450
- Still, at least we get one each.
- Oh, what?

1664
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,420
Here you go.

1665
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,190
Kimchi...

1666
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,460
(He doesn't seem to want to
move his chopsticks.)

1667
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,560
- It's sour.
- Is it sour?

1668
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,560
It's sour?

1669
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,930
It smells like vinegar.

1670
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:16,060
Excuse me.

1671
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,970
(Sour)

1672
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:22,970
It would be nice if someone could
cut this up and make it look nice.

1673
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,940
- Hey, I worked part-time.
- Like decorations?

1674
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,440
I own a barbecue restaurant.

1675
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,480
- Please do it for us.
- Yes, please do.

1676
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,680
(The duo casually takes charge
of the tongs.)

1677
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,120
- It's so tasty.
- You should lower the heat.

1678
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,590
It's getting burnt.

1679
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,790
- It's so good.
- Hey.

1680
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,460
Hey, if you burn it...

1681
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:43,090
Hey.

1682
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:44,790
Hey, if you burn it...

1683
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,760
If you burn it, you're fired.

1684
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,370
Haha, at least put it in my mouth.
If you just put it down like this...

1685
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,730
- It's like you're a dog.
- Gosh, this guy...

1686
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,700
(Flustered from being served
directly on the table)

1687
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,740
So, will you not eat it?

1688
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,540
Haha, put it in my mouth.
Why did you just put it down?

1689
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,570
(Eating it right up)

1690
00:53:58,570 --> 00:53:59,640
Of course, I'll eat it.

1691
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,740
So, should we take our bowls...

1692
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,880
(Sliding it over)

1693
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,750
Oh, boy.

1694
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,180
(Blocking their view
with his huge body)

1695
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,550
- Is it tasty?
- You can't put it there, mister.

1696
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:09,880
- Mister, what are you doing?
- What?

1697
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:10,920
(Pretending like he's cutting it)

1698
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,490
(Sticking it right in his rice bowl)

1699
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:15,290
(The barbecue restaurant's
part-timer smuggles meat.)

1700
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:17,090
- Mister, what are you doing?
- What?

1701
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,130
- Mister.
- He didn't put it in here.

1702
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,360
(Switching off the bowls)

1703
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,860
- What? It's nothing.
- No.

1704
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:21,930
- He didn't put it in.
- Hey.

1705
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,600
- Switch places.
- He didn't put it in.

1706
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,870
No, go away.

1707
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:27,270
- Seung Hyub, you do it.
- Yes?

1708
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:29,270
- Oh, okay.
- You do it. I can't trust...

1709
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:32,110
- I'll switch the grill for you.
- It's hot.

1710
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,880
- I'll switch the grill for you.
- Hey!

1711
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,780
- Hey, nice.
- Hey! Where are you going?

1712
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,280
- Switch out the grill.
- Hey!

1713
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,280
Gosh, what is this?

1714
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,550
- The grill is kind of charred.
- Hey, why are you taking that?

1715
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,550
(The thieves get to have some
dakgalbi thanks to the part-timer.)

1716
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,020
- Hey!
- The grill.

1717
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,490
- Can we get a new grill?
- What are you doing?

1718
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:49,560
Hey, stop. They're so shameless.

1719
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,330
- It's so good.
- Is it?

1720
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,060
- Thanks.
- Go ahead.

1721
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:54,130
(Seung Hyub gets to
take a bite now too.)

1722
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:55,860
- Have some rice too.
- Gosh, seriously?

1723
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,370
- You can't trust anyone.
- I know.

1724
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:59,100
- Why let them steal from you?
- Right?

1725
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,340
It's so good.

1726
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,370
- I love this.
- How tasty is this?

1727
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,170
Hey, this is so good. Isn't it?

1728
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,710
- What?
- A quiz?

1729
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:07,740
Hey, what is this? What's going on?

1730
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,580
- What?
- My gosh. What could this be?

1731
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,780
- Hey, what is this?
- What is it?

1732
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,380
Oh, we're voting.

1733
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,920
It must be the third vote now.

1734
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,190
Gosh, what could it be this time?

1735
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,290
(What will they be voting for
this time?)

1736
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,890
The last vote is...

1737
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,990
You learned about choosing
the new pope. What was it?

1738
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,860
- Conclave.
- Conclave.

1739
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,360
- Se Chan...
- Why did you raise your hand?

1740
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:29,960
What? Why?

1741
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,770
I was going to answer,
but I was wrong anyway.

1742
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:35,270
Using the conclave method,

1743
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,970
- we'll need a unanimous vote.
- What?

1744
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:40,180
- It must be something big.
- The item on the agenda...

1745
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,940
that you'll be voting for today...

1746
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,750
is today's penalty.

1747
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:45,750
What?

1748
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:49,120
You will have a discussion on
the topic of the penalty.

1749
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,890
After your given time is up,
we'll have a secret vote.

1750
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,890
If you get a unanimous decision,

1751
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:57,660
you can go home
after doing the penalty.

1752
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,930
- If we get a unanimous decision?
- Is it today's penalty?

1753
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:01,130
What if we don't?

1754
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,930
If you don't reach
a unanimous decision,

1755
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:07,470
the discussion topic will be
switched to a more intense penalty.

1756
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,540
After another discussion,
you will vote once more.

1757
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:13,880
If you fail to reach a unanimous
decision after three tries,

1758
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,710
everyone will have to...

1759
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,880
wear penalty costumes
for the next shoot.

1760
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,980
- Oh, no.
- We can't have that.

1761
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,080
We'll have to come to work
two hours earlier.

1762
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,180
It's hard.

1763
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,920
(They must get to work
at the crack of dawn.)

1764
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:29,020
(Running Man's penalty costumes
go all out.)

1765
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,060
- That's bad.
- Ye Eun, how long...

1766
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,090
did the radish costume take?

1767
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,290
- It took nearly two hours.
- That's right.

1768
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,600
- Really?
- I had to wear a bald cap too.

1769
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,660
It's because
you have to wear a bald cap.

1770
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:35,700
Wear it, dry it,

1771
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,500
- color it, add to it...
- They have to color it.

1772
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,700
- They glue things on too.
- It's no joke.

1773
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:40,900
They sear it on too.

1774
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,900
- It takes two hours.
- Seung Hyub and Si Hu,

1775
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,740
you have to do the penalty
and send pictures for proof.

1776
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,370
- Oh, really?
- We'll send you a makeup team.

1777
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:47,380
- That's right.
- You really have to.

1778
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,580
- A makeup crew will come to you.
- I'm nervous.

1779
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,610
I hate coming early
and going home late the most.

1780
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,980
Right, we have to come
two hours earlier.

1781
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,380
Hey, we have to come in
two hours earlier.

1782
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:56,920
I'll tell you
the first penalty proposal.

1783
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,990
(The voting can only end
if they reach a unanimous decision...)

1784
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,090
(and make the white smoke rise.)

1785
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:01,920
(The Run-clave voting begins.)

1786
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:04,590
The first penalty proposal is...

1787
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,660
- What is it?
- Only the eldest members,

1788
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,560
Seok Jin and Jae Seok
will stay behind...

1789
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,070
and find 5
of the 2,000 or so members...

1790
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:15,940
of the Chuncheon Park clan
who live in Chuncheon.

1791
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:17,170
You'll get their signatures
before you can go home.

1792
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,010
- The Chuncheon Park clan? Simple.
- Yes.

1793
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,210
- That sounds nice.
- There are plenty of Parks.

1794
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,080
- In Chuncheon, the surname Park...
- There are plenty of Parks.

1795
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,110
- People with the surname Park.
- But...

1796
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,250
There are plenty of people
with the surname Park.

1797
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,180
I mean, there's Park Ji Hu.

1798
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:29,580
- The Chuncheon Park clan.
- But...

1799
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,190
Oh, five of them?

1800
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,790
- But, you know...
- There are lots of Parks.

1801
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:35,460
It's not just any old Park.
It's the Chuncheon Park clan.

1802
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,190
There are lots of people
from the Miryang Park clan.

1803
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:38,690
- But not the Chuncheon Park clan.
- Oh, the Chuncheon Park clan?

1804
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:40,830
- There are plenty of Chuncheon Parks.
- The Chuncheon Park clan.

1805
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:43,130
Gosh, this won't work because...

1806
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,000
We came to this beautiful city
of Chuncheon,

1807
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,440
- it makes no sense...
- He's disagreeing already.

1808
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,100
for just the two of us
to do this beautiful penalty.

1809
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,100
- Also,
- It's a penalty.

1810
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,580
they mentioned the two eldest members,
Jae Seok and Seok Jin,

1811
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,710
- Right.
- but Jong Kook acts like...

1812
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,380
he's the eldest a lot more.

1813
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,110
- That's right.
- Of course.

1814
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:00,920
You saw it, right?
A little while ago, when we had meat,

1815
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,050
I cut Jong Kook's meat for him.

1816
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,390
- They have footage of that.
- I mean,

1817
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,360
this shouldn't be for Jae Seok
and Seok Jin.

1818
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,290
- Jong Kook. And Haha is also...
- Wait.

1819
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:12,460
- Yes, Haha too.
- But this is what I think.

1820
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,200
Anyway, Running Man decided...

1821
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,930
- the first penalty for us.
- They... That's right.

1822
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,200
- But I'm making a suggestion.
- So... Yes.

1823
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,370
Okay, it's fine that
you're making a suggestion, but...

1824
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:22,070
- Now is not...
- All right. Sir.

1825
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:23,070
- Let's go slowly.
- I mean, sure.

1826
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:25,470
- Guys, please talk slowly.
- It's all fine, but...

1827
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:27,380
Hey, if it's all fine,
why are you so...

1828
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,280
- It sounds great,
- Right.

1829
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,450
but the penalty won't change
just because we say that.

1830
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:33,950
- Let me just say one thing.
- You just keep going...

1831
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,020
- You haven't done it for a while.
- Yes.

1832
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:38,350
We can't fix the proposal
that the staff gave us just now.

1833
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,490
- That's right.
- Of course.

1834
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:40,560
- They said only Jae Seok...
- I know that.

1835
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,560
and Seok Jin will stay behind...

1836
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,760
- in the first penalty.
- That's right.

1837
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,060
And you have to accept this...

1838
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,990
- for us to finish quickly overall.
- That's right.

1839
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:48,300
But you won't get to be exempt
just because we go to the second plan.

1840
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,730
- Hang on.
- I think...

1841
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,430
- Mister, wait up.
- Sir, hang on.

1842
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:53,870
If your tone of speech is so...
How should I put it?

1843
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,670
- If you're so coercive...
- I'm not coercive.

1844
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:57,570
- Well, you are coercive...
- Hear me out.

1845
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:59,770
- I think this is right.
- Right?

1846
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,210
It will get all nasty...

1847
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:02,780
- and become a muddy battle.
- "Nasty?"

1848
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,850
- "Nasty?"
- "Nasty?"

1849
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:07,750
Of course it'll be nasty
if you people don't do the penalty.

1850
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:08,750
"You people?"

1851
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:11,850
- Convince them.
- My gosh.

1852
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,990
- Hey, do you want us to do this...
- Hang on. Come out here.

1853
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:15,220
- or not?
- I can't believe this punk.

1854
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,690
- You ratty old rag.
- Hang on.

1855
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,130
- "A ratty old rag?"
- Hey, man.

1856
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:19,590
- Your hair looks like a rag.
- Hey.

1857
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:21,460
- How dare you, with that hairstyle?
- Look here.

1858
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,470
- You look like a mop in the corner.
- Oh, my!

1859
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:27,040
- No, I mean...
- Hey, then, you guys should...

1860
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:28,540
try to convince us
by calming us down.

1861
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,570
- Don't you think?
- So, look here.

1862
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:30,770
- Fine, we'll calm you down.
- What are you doing?

1863
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:31,940
Gosh, I can't believe this.

1864
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,540
- Hey, I'm offended. This won't do.
- I know.

1865
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,540
- I'm offended.
- So, we...

1866
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:37,980
But when we talk about this stuff,
most of all...

1867
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:41,120
The staff proposed this to us,
but your basic attitude...

1868
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,780
should be very apologetic.

1869
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,650
- So, your attitudes...
- Without...

1870
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:46,090
Without sounding
the least bit apologetic...

1871
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:47,690
We're so sorry.

1872
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,090
- This is...
- What?

1873
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:52,130
- We're sorry, okay?
- Sorry.

1874
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,700
- Sorry.
- No, but...

1875
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,100
We're sorry. All right?

1876
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,460
- We're really sorry.
- Sorry.

1877
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,700
- Let's go home early.
- Sorry.

1878
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,900
- Let's go home early, okay?
- We're really sorry.

1879
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,370
- I mean...
- You guys,

1880
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:03,940
if you treat us this way...
Don't you know the rule?

1881
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,170
Don't you know it's supposed to be
a unanimous decision?

1882
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,870
- We all have to agree.
- I'm sorry.

1883
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,440
- Come here. I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

1884
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,840
- Gosh, Seok Jin.
- Sorry.

1885
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,280
- To the people in Chuncheon...
- We're sorry.

1886
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,750
- Hey, what is this?
- This attitude...

1887
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,650
- So, just sit down for now.
- Why are your shoulders so stiff?

1888
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,720
- All right. Sit down for now.
- For the citizens of Chuncheon,

1889
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,390
- Just sit down, okay?
- you can let them see you more.

1890
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:19,890
- Just sit down first.
- You're the representative.

1891
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:21,890
- The representative.
- Ye Eun, please say a word.

1892
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:23,460
- Ye Eun, please say a word.
- I also think...

1893
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,790
that Jae Seok and Seok Jin,
my seniors whom I respect,

1894
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,900
should lead by example.

1895
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,900
You should lead by example.

1896
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,170
- Right, lead by example.
- That's good.

1897
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,540
- "Lead by example?"
- "Lead by example?"

1898
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:36,970
- Hey, that sounds good.
- What?

1899
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,540
- Don't use that phrase.
- Lead by example.

1900
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:39,910
- What is she saying?
- Lead by example.

1901
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:42,180
Don't try to put us in a box
called "leading by example."

1902
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,780
- Then, taking the lead.
- No, not leading by example.

1903
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,580
- Taking the lead.
- What? "Taking the lead?"

1904
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,680
- Hey, use a different phrase.
- "Taking the lead?"

1905
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,350
I don't have a wide vocabulary.

1906
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:51,820
I don't have a wide vocabulary.

1907
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,890
- I know how that feels.
- Think it over once more.

1908
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,390
All right, everyone.
Instead of the same old voices...

1909
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:00,460
- here at Running Man,
- That's right.

1910
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,760
- let's hear from the new folks.
- Yes, Seung Hyub and Ji Hu.

1911
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,770
- Yes, go ahead.
- Right.

1912
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:05,370
- Okay, Seung Hyub... Okay, Ji Hu.
- I think...

1913
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:08,900
that Jae Seok and Seok Jin,
my seniors whom I respect,

1914
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,640
should represent us
in the beautiful city of Chuncheon...

1915
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,540
- to see the sights,
- That's right.

1916
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:16,280
- She speaks so eloquently.
- and do the penalty.

1917
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,580
Then, I think I'd be so touched
that I'd continue to...

1918
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:19,780
- think about Running Man...
- Hey, don't cry, Ji Hu.

1919
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,180
- Why are you crying?
- Hold it back.

1920
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,580
I'd continue
to think about Running Man...

1921
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:24,120
- Oh, my.
- Don't cry.

1922
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,350
- Hey.
- Ji Hu.

1923
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:27,560
- Ji Hu, don't do that.
- Ji Hu.

1924
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,860
- It's okay.
- Why are you making her cry?

1925
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,560
- Today is a good day.
- Gosh, seriously.

1926
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,290
- All right, Ji Hu. Have a seat.
- Indeed.

1927
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:34,400
- Don't cry.
- She's so warmhearted.

1928
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,500
- Hey, stop crying.
- Right.

1929
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,800
- And now, Seung Hyub.
- What's that?

1930
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:40,100
I came on Running Man
for the 1st time in 10 years.

1931
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,540
- Oh, he's right.
- Why are you crying too?

1932
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,210
- Don't cry.
- Is this that big of a deal?

1933
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:47,540
When I saw the two of you,
I felt the most...

1934
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,240
My heart feels the warmest,

1935
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,650
and I'm the happiest.

1936
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,480
- I couldn't remember you.
- It felt so nice...

1937
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,980
- to be back.
- I can see his sincerity.

1938
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,420
It's like what we said earlier.

1939
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,350
Since you planted the seed,

1940
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:00,760
- I could grow up well and return.
- That's right.

1941
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,390
- He has a way with words.
- So seeing Seok Jin again...

1942
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:05,730
- He has a way with words.
- They had better go.

1943
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:07,500
- He really has a way with words.
- Let's go and vote.

1944
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:09,400
- Hey, we...
- He's right.

1945
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,670
- Many people...
- Seung Hyub grew up...

1946
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:11,900
- and came back after ten years.
- Yes.

1947
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,840
You remember exactly what was said
during the opening.

1948
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,470
Daniel, say a few words.

1949
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:16,540
Okay.

1950
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,640
Firstly, I complexity agree
with what...

1951
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,210
Seung Hyub said.

1952
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,480
- "Complexity?"
- "Complexity?"

1953
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,980
- It's "Completely."
- It's "Completely."

1954
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,250
- It's "Completely."
- Completely.

1955
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:28,050
- It's "Completely."
- Also, I think differently.

1956
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,280
Chuncheon Park Clan.

1957
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,890
Getting an autograph
from five people...

1958
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:33,120
from the Chuncheon Park Clan
in Chuncheon?

1959
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,620
I don't think of it as a penalty.

1960
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,860
The residents of Chuncheon...

1961
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:38,790
- will be overjoyed.
- That's right.

1962
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,630
- That's incredible.
- You guys have a job that gives...

1963
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:41,660
- laughter and joy...
- I agree.

1964
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:43,660
- to people.
- That's right.

1965
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,570
- I don't think of it as a penalty.
- That's right.

1966
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:49,200
I think of it
as doing what you can do.

1967
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,170
- I agree. He's persuasive.
- He's persuasive.

1968
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:53,310
He's persuasive.

1969
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:55,140
- He has a way with words.
- He's persuasive.

1970
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,440
- From this side,
- He's persuasive.

1971
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,850
one person should speak
as a representative.

1972
01:02:57,850 --> 01:02:59,580
- I'll do it.
- We're getting persuaded.

1973
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,080
As for Jae Seok,

1974
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,820
when else
would he look after the public?

1975
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,850
As for Jae Seok,

1976
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,790
when else
would he look after the public?

1977
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:09,090
(The man who looks after
the public, Saint Yu)

1978
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:10,660
- The public?
- He should go outside...

1979
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:13,290
- and hold people's hands.
- You should visit the markets.

1980
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,600
- You should shake hands.
- People are struggling...

1981
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:18,330
these days,
so he should look after the public.

1982
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:21,900
I think such an activity
is essential around this time.

1983
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,010
- The public?
- It's about time you did that.

1984
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:25,070
(Seok Jin is convinced.)

1985
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,140
You know...

1986
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,640
- It'll be a big consolation.
- All right.

1987
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,840
- What he said just now...
- I'm convinced.

1988
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,950
- was nice.
- People are struggling.

1989
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:32,710
- From Ji Hu, the lineup...
- Yes.

1990
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:33,980
- Seriously.
- From Ji Hu...

1991
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,620
- Seriously, the two of you...
- Go on.

1992
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:37,080
should think about it.

1993
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:39,250
- Come to think of it,
- You guys are the youngest today.

1994
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,320
- your hometown is...
- My hometown is...

1995
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,660
- in Gangwon Province.
- in Gangwon Province.

1996
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,690
- Then you should go.
- It's in Gangwon Province.

1997
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:43,960
- In that case...
- It's your hometown.

1998
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,760
- You should go.
- You should go.

1999
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,600
- You should go.
- Seok Jin of Gangwon Province!

2000
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,760
- Let's go.
- You should go.

2001
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,300
- Let's have a unanimous vote.
- Let's go.

2002
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,900
- Let's vote.
- Let's go.

2003
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,270
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2004
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:54,800
- Let's go.
- Let's go and vote.

2005
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,970
- All right. Let's go.
- All right.

2006
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:58,110
- It's a unanimous vote, right?
- Let's go.

2007
01:03:58,110 --> 01:03:59,470
- Let's go, Seok Jin!
- Let's have a unanimous vote.

2008
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:00,640
- All right.
- Let's go! Hey!

2009
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,880
- Let's be altruistic for once.
- Let's go.

2010
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,310
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go.

2011
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:05,550
- Let's go.
- All right.

2012
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,450
(The vote begins.)

2013
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:09,750
Agree.

2014
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,090
Let's do this.

2015
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:12,420
Who else would do it?

2016
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:13,550
Let's go.

2017
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,720
- It's what we need to do. Let's go.
- That's right.

2018
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,820
Go in there.

2019
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:20,260
(Agree or disagree)

2020
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,760
It's agree or disagree, right?

2021
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,730
(All younger members agree
to the penalty.)

2022
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:25,130
- All right. It was beautiful.
- Yes.

2023
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:26,970
- It really was. It made me happy.
- It was very nice.

2024
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:31,610
(The two oldest members
begin to vote.)

2025
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:37,650
(Unanimity depends
on the two members.)

2026
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:39,280
Let's energize the public...

2027
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:40,950
before we leave.

2028
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:42,580
You know,

2029
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:45,520
we're embarrassed that we stalled...

2030
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,390
- in the beginning.
- Really?

2031
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,290
- Good.
- A drawn-out conversation...

2032
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:51,490
lets us feel each other's sincerity.

2033
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,660
- That's right.
- Ji Hu became a bit emotional.

2034
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:54,900
- I mean...
- Seriously,

2035
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,000
- my eyes turned red.
- Ji Hu touched my heart.

2036
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:00,500
- The result of the vote is out.
- Okay.

2037
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:02,740
You expected to see...

2038
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,240
- a unanimous vote.
- A unanimous vote.

2039
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,270
(If the result is unanimous,)

2040
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:06,310
(everyone will go home
except for Seok Jin and Jae Seok.)

2041
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:08,140
- White smoke?
- What?

2042
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:09,680
No way.

2043
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,410
Is it really unanimous?

2044
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:12,580
- Oh, my.
- It must be unanimous.

2045
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:13,650
- Are you serious?
- It must be unanimous.

2046
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:15,920
I'll read them one at a time.

2047
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,550
- Agree.
- Okay.

2048
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:18,920
(Agree: 1 versus Disagree: 0)

2049
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,450
- Agree.
- That's right.

2050
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:21,990
- Agree.
- Everyone agreed.

2051
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:24,460
- Agree.
- That's right.

2052
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,660
Agree.

2053
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,300
- Agree.
- That's right.

2054
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,930
(Only 4 votes remain.)

2055
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:33,230
- Agree.
- That's right.

2056
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:34,300
We're set.

2057
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,570
(Will they succeed in having
a unanimous vote?)

2058
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,770
(Agree or disagree
Voter: Jee Seok Jin)

2059
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:39,840
Disagree.

2060
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,880
(Seok Jin disagreed.)

2061
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,080
- Disagree.
- What?

2062
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,550
Who did that?

2063
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:45,780
- Agree.
- Okay.

2064
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:47,520
Disagree.

2065
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,780
- It's the two of them.
- Hold on.

2066
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:52,550
(Laughing)

2067
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:54,020
- Hold on.
- For goodness' sake.

2068
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,920
- It wasn't us.
- Who was it?

2069
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,260
- Who disagreed?
- Who was it?

2070
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,860
- Who disagreed?
- Who disagreed?

2071
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,430
- I guess someone felt bad.
- Jae Seok.

2072
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:02,900
- Who disagreed?
- You listened to the nice words...

2073
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,730
- and changed your mind.
- They planned it.

2074
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:05,770
Forget it.

2075
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:07,500
- We refuse to go.
- I won't do this.

2076
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,470
- Let's take it to the end.
- Let's go.

2077
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:10,840
- I knew that this would happen.
- Gosh, they...

2078
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:13,440
The first attempt
for a unanimous vote...

2079
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:15,240
failed.

2080
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:19,180
I'll now reveal the second proposal
for the penalty.

2081
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,480
Here's the first proposal.

2082
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,090
If all members participate,

2083
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:26,190
it'll take about six hours
to complete.

2084
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:30,830
You'll complete a jigsaw puzzle
with 3,000 pieces before going home.

2085
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:31,830
- Will it take six hours?
- Yes.

2086
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:34,160
- There will be 3,000 pieces.
- We can't do that.

2087
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:35,860
- The scale became so big.
- Six hours?

2088
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,260
Here's the other option.

2089
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:40,770
Three people including Haha...

2090
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,600
will travel for 30 minutes in a car,

2091
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,310
go to the top of Mount Maebong
in a gondola,

2092
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:48,240
- ride the air swing, and go home.
- Hold on.

2093
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,150
- Before you begin the debate,
- Air swing.

2094
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,450
you'll watch a video
of the air swing.

2095
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:56,420
- Are you serious?
- Haha gets scared the most easily,

2096
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,350
- so he's included.
- What's an air swing?

2097
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:01,160
(What's the air swing penalty
for 3 people including Haha?)

2098
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,320
- What?
- I can't ride it.

2099
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:07,290
(Riding a swing at the cliff)

2100
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:10,360
- She's about to fall off.
- It's impossible.

2101
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:13,470
- Do you go beyond the cliff?
- You go beyond the cliff.

2102
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:15,240
- It's impossible.
- You rode the Nevis Swing.

2103
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,510
- That's scary.
- It's nothing.

2104
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:20,610
The two of you should've carried out
the previous penalty.

2105
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,510
- Haha.
- It's nothing.

2106
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:24,880
- You rode the Nevis Swing.
- How will you ride it?

2107
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:25,980
Do you want to choose that option?

2108
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,110
- Go with 3,000 pieces.
- Haha.

2109
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,220
As for me,

2110
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,350
I think the air swing
for three people will be better.

2111
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:35,360
Compared to spending 6 hours
on a 3,000-piece jigsaw puzzle,

2112
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,760
it's much more reasonable.

2113
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,090
- Hold on. Here's what I think.
- That's my opinion. Okay.

2114
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,830
You just said
that it was reasonable.

2115
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:41,830
Wasn't Stage One
the most reasonable?

2116
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:43,630
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

2117
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:45,500
- If you get hung up on the past,
- The past...

2118
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,730
you won't be able to move forward.

2119
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:48,770
You should have
a sense of responsibility.

2120
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:51,070
- That's why I'm saying this.
- Okay.

2121
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:54,540
In any case, Haha is
the bravest one among us.

2122
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:58,780
(The sugarcoated words
make even Haha laugh.)

2123
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,350
- Isn't he the cowardliest?
- The Nevis Swing.

2124
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:03,080
He's the one
who successfully rode...

2125
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:04,850
the scary Nevis Swing.

2126
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,320
Firstly, I'm...

2127
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,860
for the air swing for three people.
But here's what breaks my heart.

2128
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,090
The fact that Haha is included
breaks my heart.

2129
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,890
Although it breaks my heart,

2130
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:14,700
that's what the production crew
decided on.

2131
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,960
So Haha should...

2132
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:17,530
It can't be helped.

2133
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,430
We should go with the air swing
for three people.

2134
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,940
- It's for three people, right?
- Yes.

2135
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:24,140
Swing, centipede, and you.

2136
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:26,040
We'll go together.

2137
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,880
- They rhymed in Korean.
- Is that so?

2138
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,880
- Is that so?
- He really is a rapper.

2139
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,380
- They rhymed.
- The rhyme was incredible.

2140
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:33,080
Se Chan.

2141
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,180
I think we should be realistic...

2142
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:37,380
with these two options.

2143
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:40,090
- Look. It'll be the grand finale.
- That's right.

2144
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:42,460
Imagine everyone doing
a 3,000-piece jigsaw puzzle.

2145
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:44,860
- We worked hard on the show.
- It'll be lackluster.

2146
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:46,130
- It'll be lackluster.
- Imagine us sitting on the floor.

2147
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:47,830
- It won't be fun.
- It'll be lackluster.

2148
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:49,230
- If we do it,
- That's right.

2149
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:51,130
it'll be aired for only ten minutes.

2150
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,270
- If Haha goes there,
- That's...

2151
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:55,000
- he'll be the main character.
- That's right.

2152
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,240
It'll be fun to scream...

2153
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,840
- and give reactions.
- Listen.

2154
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,110
- You're right.
- Who sat next to me...

2155
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:00,540
on the Nevis Swing?

2156
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:02,080
Me!

2157
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,280
- Right?
- Me!

2158
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:06,180
Compared
to a 3,000-piece jigsaw puzzle,

2159
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:07,350
- the air swing...
- Look.

2160
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:10,620
He mentioned
the Nevis Swing earlier.

2161
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:11,790
Back then, the Nevis Swing got...

2162
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:13,220
- incredible reactions.
- Seriously.

2163
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,860
If three people ride the air swing
at the end of the episode,

2164
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,990
- it'll be great for Running Man.
- That's right.

2165
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:20,230
- That's right.
- It'll be a good picture.

2166
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:22,760
- Yes.
- Think only about Running Man.

2167
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,700
That's right.
Think about Running Man.

2168
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:27,570
That's right.
It'll be a beautiful picture.

2169
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:30,640
It'll be nice
to see it on Running Man.

2170
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:33,610
If I end up going somewhere
with Haha...

2171
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:35,680
and riding something,

2172
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,350
I'd rather complete
a 3,000-piece jigsaw puzzle.

2173
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,150
- She has a different opinion.
- Really?

2174
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:42,150
That one is for everyone.

2175
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:44,450
I think we need to persuade her.

2176
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:45,790
- Haha isn't the issue.
- As for me...

2177
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:47,250
- Ji Hyo.
- We need to persuade her.

2178
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:48,560
- As for me,
- Right now...

2179
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,960
- I'd rather die together.
- The tables have turned.

2180
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:53,260
If all of us hang our heads
and look for the puzzle pieces...

2181
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,400
- It'll take six hours.
- It won't be fun.

2182
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,500
- Only our backs will be visible.
- If there are 3,000 pieces,

2183
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,730
we can take 300 pieces each.

2184
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:59,370
Even if we film for 6 hours,
15 seconds will be aired.

2185
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:00,770
We just need to do it.

2186
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:02,370
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

2187
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:05,540
Will you vote
for the 3,000-piece jigsaw puzzle?

2188
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:07,310
Yes.

2189
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:10,740
- What's up with her?
- Hold on.

2190
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,680
- Ji Hyo, don't do that.
- Why not?

2191
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:15,180
Hey, you won't be included
in the three.

2192
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:17,080
- We can't change her mind.
- We need to persuade her.

2193
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,590
- Ji Hyo, in that case,
- Yes?

2194
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,720
- which option will you vote for?
- As for me...

2195
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,820
(Haha)

2196
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:25,130
Will you vote for Haha's penalty?

2197
01:10:25,890 --> 01:10:27,330
Are you crazy?

2198
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,000
- That was funny.
- Just what do you want?

2199
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,070
- I... I told you.
- What's up with her?

2200
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:33,070
What's up with her?

2201
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:34,970
- As for me,
- Tell us what you want.

2202
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:37,070
- What?
- that's what my heart wants.

2203
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,570
But I think it'll be nice
to carry out a penalty together.

2204
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:42,440
So tell us what you "lily" want.
Tell us what you really want.

2205
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:43,910
What's up with your pronunciation?

2206
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:45,080
(Seok Jin's tongue got twisted
like the current situation.)

2207
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,250
- Seok Jin, what's up with you?
- "Lily?"

2208
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:48,420
- Tell us what you really want.
- What do you mean by "Lily?"

2209
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:52,050
Seok Jin is so scared
of riding the air swing.

2210
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:53,520
He's intimidated.

2211
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:56,120
- He's intimidated.
- I can never ride that.

2212
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,530
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Let's do this.

2213
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:00,190
I'll tell you in a cool way.

2214
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:03,500
I swear that I'll write "Agree."

2215
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,700
- Which one?
- Then...

2216
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,470
- Really?
- But if my penalty gets chosen,

2217
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,570
I'll definitely choose
either Seok Jin or Jae Seok.

2218
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,170
Okay?

2219
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:14,340
- If you say that...
- We...

2220
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:15,780
- Why are you guys complaining?
- Okay?

2221
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:18,010
- Go ahead and sacrifice yourselves.
- I mean...

2222
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,410
- Guys.
- I mean...

2223
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:22,280
Why didn't you guys persuade us more
in the previous round?

2224
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,750
- We did that.
- That penalty was better.

2225
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,220
- We did that.
- We persuaded you guys.

2226
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:26,920
- I mean...
- We couldn't possibly do it more.

2227
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,290
- The previous one was much better.
- It was much better.

2228
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:30,620
- I'll choose the air swing.
- Me too.

2229
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,960
- I'll agree to it.
- The air swing for three people.

2230
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,390
- I'll agree to it.
- This is only Stage Two.

2231
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:34,860
- Stage 3...
- Stage 3.

2232
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:35,930
- will be harder.
- It'll be harder.

2233
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:38,300
- Let's put an end to it.
- The previous one was better.

2234
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,300
Let's end it.

2235
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,870
- Let's go.
- The next one will be worse.

2236
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:41,900
(They agree to vote
for the air swing.)

2237
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:44,440
- Let's vote.
- Okay. Let's go.

2238
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,640
- I'll choose the air swing.
- Me too.

2239
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,910
- I'll agree to it.
- The air swing for three people.

2240
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:51,780
(Song Catfish's choice)

2241
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:57,120
(She votes for the air swing.)

2242
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,590
Stage Two?

2243
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:01,820
(Haha holds the key
for the unanimous vote.)

2244
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,530
(Sighing)

2245
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:06,090
Let's write, "Agree."

2246
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:10,830
I actually wrote it.

2247
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,370
I actually did it.
I'm the coolest, right?

2248
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:13,930
(He really voted for the air swing!)

2249
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,000
I'll pick 1 of the 2.

2250
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,940
- Here.
- I'm serious.

2251
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:21,480
I made this decision
out of love for Running Man.

2252
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,510
- Yes. You experienced...
- Okay.

2253
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:23,510
- the Nevis Swing.
- Okay. Let's go.

2254
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:24,610
All right. Okay.

2255
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:26,750
- Here's the first vote.
- It has to be a unanimous vote.

2256
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,520
- The air swing for three people.
- Okay.

2257
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,220
(Voter: Yang Se Chan,
The air swing for three people)

2258
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,890
- The air swing for three people.
- That's right.

2259
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:33,320
- Nice.
- Of course.

2260
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,560
- The air swing for three people.
- Nice.

2261
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,820
It must be a unanimous vote.

2262
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,030
- That's right.
- We have to succeed in it.

2263
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,560
- Did you write, "Agree?"
- The air swing for three people.

2264
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,060
- Okay. We need ten votes.
- Yes.

2265
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:46,800
Agree to the air swing
for Haha and two other people.

2266
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,800
(Voter: Song Ji Hyo)

2267
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,040
That's good. Agree.

2268
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,140
- I wrote, "Agree."
- Good.

2269
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,640
The air swing for three people.

2270
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:54,540
- How many votes remain?
- It's over.

2271
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:55,640
We got this.

2272
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,210
The air swing for three people.

2273
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:58,550
- Is it over?
- We got this.

2274
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:59,780
- What's going on?
- How many votes remain?

2275
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,250
It must be a unanimous vote.

2276
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:02,250
- How many votes remain?
- We got this.

2277
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,320
- Haha.
- Right now...

2278
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,320
(A unanimous vote
is just out of reach.)

2279
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,290
- Three votes remain.
- Three votes remain.

2280
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:08,020
(Only 3 votes remain!)

2281
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:09,620
Gosh, I'm nervous.

2282
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:12,660
I'm nervous. The thought of going
makes me nervous.

2283
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,330
This is incredible.

2284
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,860
The air swing for three people.

2285
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:19,130
- Do two votes remain?
- No way.

2286
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,300
- Two votes remain.
- Two?

2287
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,500
(If 2 more people agree to it,
they'll get a unanimous vote!)

2288
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,770
- But Ji Hyo...
- All right.

2289
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:25,510
- Ji Hyo.
- The jigsaw puzzle.

2290
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:27,240
- What?
- Who did that?

2291
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,880
(1 vote for the jigsaw puzzle)

2292
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,550
- Who did that?
- The 3,000-piece jigsaw puzzle.

2293
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:34,380
- Who did that? Two people?
- There were two such votes.

2294
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:36,180
- Who were those 2?
- Who were those 2?

2295
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,090
- I swear...
- Come on.

2296
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:39,350
I swear I voted for it.

2297
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:42,620
(Again, it's
the Chuncheon Park Clan duo.)

2298
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,490
(Voters: Jee Seok Jin, Yu Jae Seok)

2299
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:47,230
(Both of them voted
for the jigsaw puzzle.)

2300
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,900
- Seriously.
- Seriously. I swear...

2301
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:53,000
- I did you guys a favor.
- That's right.

2302
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,970
- Seriously.
- You shouldn't have threatened us.

2303
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:56,540
- I was really going to go.
- Why did you threaten us?

2304
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:58,940
- Seriously.
- You were too coercive.

2305
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:00,970
Had you told us
that people would be picked...

2306
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:03,180
- at random through a draw,
- That's right.

2307
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,610
- I would've agreed to it.
- Had you suggested a draw,

2308
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:07,110
- I would've agreed to it.
- Forget it.

2309
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:10,020
Jae Seok, look
at Ji Hu and Seung Hyub's faces.

2310
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,190
- They look so disappointed.
- Ji Hu.

2311
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,690
Ji Hu this is what adults are like.

2312
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:15,560
- Seriously. It's cruel.
- For goodness' sake.

2313
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,720
Seok Jin, I voted for the air swing.
I wrote it down.

2314
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,990
- I know that.
- I wrote it down.

2315
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:20,060
- Seriously.
- All right.

2316
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:23,230
It's time for the last stage.

2317
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:24,530
Is this the last stage?

2318
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:28,970
If you fail to get
a unanimous vote at this stage,

2319
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:31,310
- This is driving me crazy.
- you'll wear special makeup...

2320
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:33,110
as a penalty next week.

2321
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:34,710
- We have to do this.
- Seriously.

2322
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:36,140
- Seriously.
- We need a unanimous vote.

2323
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:37,310
It'll take two hours.

2324
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:40,880
In this case, the guests
will be exempt from the penalty.

2325
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:41,980
(The guests' cooperation is crucial
for the last proposal.)

2326
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:44,450
The last proposal will be revealed.

2327
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:46,750
For one hour,

2328
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:49,560
all members will enjoy canoeing
in the river...

2329
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,460
- before going home.
- Jae Seok, we'll burn to death.

2330
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:56,160
(A sudden canoeing experience
under the scorching sun)

2331
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,700
- All members?
- It's a good one.

2332
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,130
- Canoeing?
- It's good. It'll be better.

2333
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:01,200
- It isn't half bad.
- The other option is this.

2334
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,240
- The ink bomb for five people.
- Five people?

2335
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,240
That's right.

2336
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:06,110
- Let's go with that.
- Ink all the way.

2337
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:08,010
- Hold on. What's the ink bomb?
- Ink.

2338
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:09,410
- I'll get it.
- Will it drop from the top?

2339
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:11,650
It's a big bomb
that drops from the top.

2340
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,850
- It's a bomb...
- Really?

2341
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:15,480
that drops from a structure.

2342
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:16,580
(The bomb dyes you
from the scalp to the toenails.)

2343
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,690
You know this, right?
If the ink goes into your ears...

2344
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:20,690
- Ink will come out for 3 days.
- It'll last 3 days.

2345
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:22,060
Black water will keep coming out
of the ears.

2346
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,590
It'll look like
you have dirt under your nails.

2347
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:24,690
- Dirt.
- Yes.

2348
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:25,930
You'll need to throw away
your underwear.

2349
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:28,160
How will you pick five people?

2350
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,300
Please don't say
that someone will choose them.

2351
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,530
It won't work like that.

2352
01:15:31,530 --> 01:15:33,200
It'll be put...

2353
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:34,770
(To continue on with the theme,
it'll be chosen through a vote.)

2354
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:36,300
- to a vote.
- A vote.

2355
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:38,610
- A vote?
- To be honest...

2356
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,040
- I... To be honest...
- Hold on.

2357
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,210
- Will it be put to a vote?
- Can we not do that?

2358
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:44,750
- If we have a vote...
- Let's go.

2359
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,280
- Hold on.
- Will we have a vote?

2360
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,480
- Will we have a vote? Okay.
- A vote.

2361
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,080
- I mean...
- We can't have a vote.

2362
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,580
- Listen.
- Why...

2363
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,720
- You guys are mischievous.
- I can't believe you guys.

2364
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,090
Can't you guys be more lenient?

2365
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,090
There's a good system...

2366
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:57,260
- called a draw.
- We need to leave after the shoot.

2367
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:00,290
- Since when did they team up?
- Let's wear the special makeup.

2368
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:02,800
- Let's do that. It won't work.
- No, it won't.

2369
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,860
Right?

2370
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,370
- We have no teamwork.
- How about canoeing?

2371
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:07,170
- Let's go canoeing.
- Let's go canoeing.

2372
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:08,600
- Those two will mess it up.
- Let's go canoeing.

2373
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,100
(At this rate, they'll fail again
as they did in the previous stages.)

2374
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,370
- Canoeing is a good idea.
- Canoeing.

2375
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:13,410
Please give us bodyguards.

2376
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:15,280
Two bodyguards each. After all...

2377
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,980
I think we'll get ambushed today.

2378
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,720
I think someone will hit my head.

2379
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,880
- We'll get ambushed today.
- It isn't too late.

2380
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,650
Hold on. Why are you guys
so anxious from the beginning...

2381
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:28,490
to the end?

2382
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:30,260
- You guys are so anxious.
- It isn't like that.

2383
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:32,130
- She said that we'd have a vote.
- Just enjoy yourselves.

2384
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:34,190
You guys might not get chosen.

2385
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:36,060
- That's right.
- We won't hold you two accountable.

2386
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,330
- We promise. We can do that, right?
- We won't do that.

2387
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:38,430
- We can do that.
- We won't write your names.

2388
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:39,630
- We won't hold you two accountable.
- Seriously.

2389
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:40,900
Jae Seok, think about it.

2390
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:43,640
Imagine us canoeing
at the end of the shoot.

2391
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,810
It'll be bad.

2392
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:46,570
If we go canoeing,

2393
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:47,840
how long will it take
to get to the location?

2394
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,140
The drive will take
a little over 30 minutes.

2395
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:51,680
Then you'll canoe for an hour
and come back.

2396
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,850
- It'll take two hours.
- You should've chosen the swing.

2397
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,820
Going back and forth,
putting on the gear...

2398
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,450
- You should've chosen the swing.
- Seriously.

2399
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:58,620
- Exactly.
- You should've done that.

2400
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:01,360
You should've gone with finding
people with the last name of Park.

2401
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:05,290
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin
are put under the fire again.)

2402
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:07,060
- The thing is...
- Look at them.

2403
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:08,700
- Why did they pick Jae Seok and me?
- The thing is,

2404
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,060
- we should've done that.
- Yes.

2405
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:12,330
- I blame the production crew.
- That's right.

2406
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:14,100
- They made us think, "No way."
- That's right. "No way."

2407
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,300
The ink penalty for five people
will be neater and better.

2408
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,010
- That's right.
- If we go canoeing,

2409
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:19,370
- we'll need to row for an hour.
- That's right.

2410
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:20,570
- All of us will be pouting.
- Hey.

2411
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:21,610
- Let's get the ink bomb.
- Let's get it.

2412
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:22,610
Let's go.

2413
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:24,110
- Okay.
- It'll be better...

2414
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:26,150
than wasting time.

2415
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:27,310
Let's go with the ink bomb.

2416
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,680
- We're used to the ink bomb.
- Let's go with that.

2417
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,880
- Go ahead.
- By the way...

2418
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:31,450
(Raising his hand)

2419
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:34,760
By the way, we won't need to wear
the special makeup, right?

2420
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,860
We won't need to wear
the special makeup, right?

2421
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:39,290
- That's right.
- Exactly. Look at this.

2422
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:40,730
- Hold on.
- I'm intrigued.

2423
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,000
I keep getting the urge
to be mischievous.

2424
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,930
- In that case...
- We won't pick you guys.

2425
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:45,630
- We won't pick you guys.
- We won't pick you guys.

2426
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:46,930
- We won't pick you guys.
- We'll never pick you guys.

2427
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:48,440
- Can you write that down?
- Of course.

2428
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,800
- We promise.
- I can write that down.

2429
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,100
- We promise.
- He's something else.

2430
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,970
- I can write that down.
- Ji Hyo...

2431
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:55,280
- But think about the future.
- This is our struggle, after all.

2432
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,180
- When you wear a lot of makeup,
- Okay.

2433
01:17:57,580 --> 01:18:00,050
viewers become very happy.

2434
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:02,450
Viewers become very happy.

2435
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:03,580
(He threatens them
to get their promise.)

2436
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:05,150
- No.
- Hey, you...

2437
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:07,090
- It isn't fun.
- As a viewer of Running Man,

2438
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:09,090
I love it when the members
wear special makeup for the opening.

2439
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:10,690
- Ji Hu.
- Hey.

2440
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:13,290
- That's right.
- While you guys saw correctly...

2441
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:15,260
- But today...
- Stop meddling and leave.

2442
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,170
(They become exempt right away.)

2443
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:20,300
We don't want the guests
to receive the penalty,

2444
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,770
- so...
- It rarely happens.

2445
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:24,240
- You guys will be exempt.
- Ji Hu and Seung Hyub...

2446
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,010
- should be exempt.
- That's right.

2447
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:29,110
If you vote for the ink penalty...

2448
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:30,910
for five people,

2449
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:33,750
- write down who should get...
- Two names?

2450
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:36,120
the penalty as well.
Write down two names.

2451
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,420
- Two names?
- Two names? Okay.

2452
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:39,590
The top five people
will receive the penalty.

2453
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:41,290
- All right.
- Everyone.

2454
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:42,920
- Let's have a unanimous vote now.
- Okay.

2455
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,360
- Five people.
- The ink bomb.

2456
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,890
- Let's do it and go home.
- Five people.

2457
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:47,260
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

2458
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:48,800
We rarely pick the guests
for the penalty.

2459
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,030
- No, we don't.
- No, we don't.

2460
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:52,070
- Especially for the ink bomb.
- We won't pick them.

2461
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:53,100
- We won't pick them.
- I'll trust you guys...

2462
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:54,100
and pick the five-person one.

2463
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:55,440
- Of course.
- Ji Hu and Seung Hyub.

2464
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,800
- We should choose the ink bomb...
- That wouldn't be polite.

2465
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:58,940
for five people.

2466
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,140
Canoeing will take too long.

2467
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:01,440
- It'll take too long.
- That's right.

2468
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,610
If we include the time
for putting on the gear,

2469
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:04,240
- it'll take 3 to 4 hours.
- It'll take 3 to 4 hours.

2470
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,050
- The jigsaw puzzle will be better.
- That's right.

2471
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:08,010
- What?
- I was for the jigsaw puzzle.

2472
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:09,450
- Hold on. Just now...
- Chuncheon Park Clan.

2473
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:11,180
- That was why we wrote it down.
- That would've been the best.

2474
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:13,150
You just needed to find people
whose last name was Park.

2475
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:14,650
- While it's true,
- It would've been heartwarming.

2476
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:16,360
- we didn't expect this outcome.
- We didn't expect...

2477
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,820
- this outcome.
- We had no idea.

2478
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,390
All right. Okay.

2479
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,160
- Okay. Let's go.
- It's nothing hard.

2480
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,560
Let's take the ink bomb.

2481
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,400
- That's right.
- Then we can go home.

2482
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,270
The ink bomb for five people.

2483
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:28,670
- My goodness.
- How should I say it?

2484
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,200
- I know.
- Stage One was up in our faces.

2485
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,340
- So we became rebellious...
- We wanted to avoid it.

2486
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:34,110
because we wanted to know
which penalties would follow.

2487
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:36,180
- Yes. "Why must we say yes?
- We became rebellious.

2488
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:38,210
- Yes. "Why must we do that?"
- All our lives, we said no...

2489
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:39,980
- when everyone else said yes.
- Exactly.

2490
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,150
They made good use
of our tendencies.

2491
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,350
- Seriously.
- We're in the palm of their hands.

2492
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:45,020
We aren't so easy.

2493
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:46,750
Let's take the ink bomb and go home.

2494
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,660
- That's right.
- We can clean up with a towel.

2495
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:51,220
(The guest who won't need to wear
special makeup, Seung Hyub)

2496
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,660
We'll never pick you guys.

2497
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,630
We won't pick you guys.

2498
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:01,000
(Ink bomb for 5 people)

2499
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,910
(Trusting the members' words,
he picks the ink bomb for 5 people.)

2500
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,140
- We won't pick them.
- I'll trust you guys...

2501
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,240
- and pick the five-person one.
- Of course.

2502
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,510
(Ji Hu also believes
their promise...)

2503
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:16,320
(and picks the ink bomb.)

2504
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,150
Whose names should I write down?

2505
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:19,850
(If the 2 of them pick
the ink bomb,)

2506
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:21,520
(10 people will have
a unanimous vote!)

2507
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:23,520
As long as they don't change
their minds...

2508
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:25,060
- They'll definitely do it.
- They'll definitely do it.

2509
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:26,430
- I'm 100 percent sure of it.
- They'll definitely do it.

2510
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:27,560
I can bet my entire fortune.

2511
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:29,660
We need to get the ink bomb.

2512
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:34,700
(The ink bomb for 5 people
versus the group makeup show)

2513
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,900
- Seriously, Seok Jin.
- We'll get a unanimous vote.

2514
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,000
We'll get it for the ink bomb.

2515
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,010
(What will be their choice?)

2516
01:20:39,370 --> 01:20:42,710
The last voting result is out.

2517
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:44,840
- Yes.
- This time...

2518
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:47,150
- We'll be doing makeup.
- This time...

2519
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:52,150
There were ten votes
for everyone getting the ink bomb.

2520
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:54,020
(Unanimity was achieved
for Ink Bomb for 5.)

2521
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,020
Really?

2522
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,990
- You succeeded.
- Really?

2523
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:58,060
This makes no sense.

2524
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,030
- It worked.
- This is how it should be.

2525
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:01,830
- Right.
- It had to work.

2526
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,530
(They failed to achieve unanimity
in the 1st vote.)

2527
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:08,130
(They failed to achieve unanimity
in the 2nd vote.)

2528
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,540
(After re-re-voting)

2529
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,070
It worked.

2530
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:18,510
(They miraculously
achieved unanimity!)

2531
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,010
- Right.
- It had to work.

2532
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:21,080
- Right.
- We did it.

2533
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,180
- Good.
- What a relief.

2534
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,350
- Seriously.
- It's the "Spring of Youth."

2535
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:27,550
- Nice.
- Good. "Spring of Youth."

2536
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:30,620
We already voted for the names.

2537
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:31,930
- The names.
- We have the names now.

2538
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:34,530
You will open the votes this time.

2539
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:36,560
That's nice.

2540
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,570
Can I be hopeful?

2541
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,600
If it goes wrong, you might get
the penalty even with one vote.

2542
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,800
- Right.
- That's right.

2543
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,340
Five people with the most votes.

2544
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:46,410
- Yes.
- Yes.

2545
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,980
I'm nervous.

2546
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:50,940
- It's worrisome.
- This is the first vote.

2547
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:52,850
- What?
- Why?

2548
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:55,780
- Tell us.
- I was very shocked.

2549
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:57,020
- Why?
- Seung Hyub and Ji Hu.

2550
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:58,180
- What?
- What?

2551
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,520
(Ballot count:
Seung Hyub 1, Ji Hu 1)

2552
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,260
Hold on. What is this?

2553
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:04,360
(Someone wrote the names
of the guests!)

2554
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,430
- Suddenly?
- Really?

2555
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:09,630
- Who was it?
- Voter, Jee Seok Jin.

2556
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,260
- Goodness.
- Why did you say that?

2557
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:13,430
Voter, Jee Seok Jin.

2558
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:15,000
(Turning)

2559
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,340
(Goodness)

2560
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:18,140
- Goodness.
- Why did you say that?

2561
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:20,140
How could you write them?

2562
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:21,840
You shouldn't say that.

2563
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,980
- Don't say the names.
- You shouldn't say the names.

2564
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,410
I won't say the names.

2565
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:27,250
I didn't know.
I won't say it from now on.

2566
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:28,650
He won't do it from now on?

2567
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:30,250
I didn't know.

2568
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,590
- You're really amazing.
- Why?

2569
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:34,490
He's a challenger.

2570
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:36,620
- He...
- He's trying...

2571
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:38,390
- Why can't you look back?
- to spread out the votes.

2572
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:40,160
- You're trying to save himself.
- I mean...

2573
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:43,700
I wanted you to get
a full Running Man experience.

2574
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:45,830
- Voting for the ink bomb.
- Yes.

2575
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:47,530
What is it?

2576
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:51,240
- Seung Hyub, Ji Hu.
- What is this?

2577
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,270
(Seung Hyub and Ji Hu again)

2578
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:53,910
Stop joking!

2579
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:55,280
- It's true.
- No way.

2580
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,780
- Really?
- You're all so mean.

2581
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:58,710
- Seriously.
- Ji Hyo?

2582
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:00,450
(Who was it this time?)

2583
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,850
- No way.
- Let me see.

2584
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:03,020
- Really?
- Song Ji Hyo.

2585
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,820
- Ji Hyo?
- Song Ji Hyo.

2586
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:06,150
- Ji Hyo did that?
- But...

2587
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:07,350
No.

2588
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:08,790
- Ji Hyo?
- Ji Hyo suddenly...

2589
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:10,090
Ji Hyo...

2590
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:11,620
- Goodness.
- We don't know.

2591
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,630
- Seriously.
- You never know.

2592
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:14,760
There are four votes.
It's determined.

2593
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,260
- It's almost determined.
- It's determined.

2594
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:17,630
- No. We can't be sure yet.
- We can't be sure.

2595
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:18,870
We can't be sure yet.

2596
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:20,070
(The next vote is opened.)

2597
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:21,840
The five people for the ink bomb.

2598
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,340
- You wrote that.
- Jee Seok Sam, Haha.

2599
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:26,740
That's your handwriting.
It's your handwriting.

2600
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:28,610
You wrote this.

2601
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,610
It's Yu Jae Seok.
Five people for the ink bomb.

2602
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:33,150
Why are you saying that?

2603
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:35,280
- It's his handwriting.
- Why are you watching from behind?

2604
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:37,220
- You're...
- Okay.

2605
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:38,650
We can't be sure yet.

2606
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:40,650
(Ballot count: Seok Jin 1,
Haha 1, Seung Hyub 2, Ji Hu 2)

2607
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:41,960
(Laughing)

2608
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,660
(Ballot count: Seok Jin 1,
Haha 1, Seung Hyub 2, Ji Hu 2)

2609
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:44,820
- What is it?
- Who is it?

2610
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,460
- The names are coming out now.
- Hold on.

2611
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:49,630
- Did you leave out your dad?
- Who?

2612
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:50,930
Jae Seok and Daniel.

2613
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,500
- Daniel.
- Jae Seok and Daniel.

2614
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,670
It has properly started now.

2615
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,540
- Ye Eun.
- I only have one vote.

2616
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,070
- We don't know.
- We have two votes.

2617
01:23:58,070 --> 01:24:00,010
We really can't be sure.

2618
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,880
- Gosh.
- What is it?

2619
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:04,010
Jae Seok and Haha.

2620
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:05,880
- I still have 1.
- These 2...

2621
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,910
- Awesome.
- You two appear many times.

2622
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:10,250
- Hey.
- It's almost determined.

2623
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:12,350
- Hold on.
- Haha is there for sure now.

2624
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:14,650
- We don't know yet.
- We don't know about the rest.

2625
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,560
- We still have more votes.
- We don't know yet.

2626
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,260
(Jae Seok 2, Seok Jin 1, Haha 2,
Daniel 1, Seung Hyub 2, Ji Hu 2)

2627
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:19,730
Jae Seok and Haha.

2628
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:22,560
Who was that? Why?

2629
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:24,000
- Hey.
- Why are you doing this?

2630
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:27,270
(The strong candidate Jee
avoided getting a vote again.)

2631
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:29,940
You're going to let Seok Sam go
like this?

2632
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:32,840
Wait. Now...

2633
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,340
- Hold on. Let's see.
- There are four votes left.

2634
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:37,180
One, two, three, four.

2635
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,410
All the names are there.
Daniel also has one.

2636
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,150
- What?
- Here we go.

2637
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:43,150
- Daniel.
- Jee Seok Jin and Ji Ye Eun.

2638
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,290
- Ye Eun is coming up.
- Who was that?

2639
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:47,290
- Who was that?
- Ye Eun is coming up.

2640
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:48,720
- Who was it?
- Tell me who wrote that.

2641
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,260
- Hold on.
- No. We won't tell.

2642
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:52,590
(Voting results)

2643
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:55,060
- What?
- Why? Am I out?

2644
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,660
Song Ji Hyo and Daniel.

2645
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:57,660
- This...
- What?

2646
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:58,770
- Everyone's name is here.
- You never know.

2647
01:24:58,770 --> 01:24:59,870
- Mine...
- What is this?

2648
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:01,030
You never know.

2649
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:02,900
- What is this?
- Hold on.

2650
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:05,740
We're exempted!

2651
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:07,140
Let me check the results so far.

2652
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:08,640
We don't have Se Chan
and Jong Kook yet.

2653
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:11,180
- First...
- Jae Seok and Haha are there.

2654
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:13,150
It's set for Haha and me.

2655
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,510
- Jee Seok Sam, Daniel,
- Daniel,

2656
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:16,350
- Seung Hyub, and Ji Hu are tied.
- Seung Hyub, and Ji Hu are tied.

2657
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:17,750
- They're tied.
- If you get one more vote...

2658
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:19,720
- How many are left?
- We have two left!

2659
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,450
- We have two left!
- Two!

2660
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,190
(Jae Seok 3, Seok Jin 2, Haha 3,
Daniel 2, Ye Eun 1, Ji Hyo 1,)

2661
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:24,860
Let's go!

2662
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:25,990
(Seung Hyub 2, Ji Hu 2)

2663
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:27,130
It wouldn't be me, right?

2664
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:28,800
At the end.

2665
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:31,300
- It's a close game.
- Is it?

2666
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:34,830
(Voting results)

2667
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:35,870
Jee Seok Jin...

2668
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:39,340
(Voting results)

2669
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,240
- and Haha.
- Really?

2670
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,510
- Check it.
- Jee Seok Jin and Haha.

2671
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:44,540
Haha.

2672
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:46,250
(Feeling relieved)

2673
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,880
Jee Seok Jin and Haha.

2674
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:48,880
- It's true.
- How is it going?

2675
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,450
Haha has four votes.

2676
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:52,250
Haha will surely get it.

2677
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,720
- Haha.
- He has the most votes.

2678
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,460
- Haha.
- How did this happen?

2679
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:57,720
- The swing...
- He...

2680
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,760
- Because of the swing...
- He didn't do anything wrong.

2681
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,200
I even voted for the swing.

2682
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:04,060
What happened to him?

2683
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:05,200
Why did you do this?

2684
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,530
- He...
- I don't know.

2685
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:08,330
- He...
- He came late.

2686
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:09,640
- He came late.
- Accept it.

2687
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:11,700
- He came late.
- He came late.

2688
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,040
- First...
- You've been ruled out first.

2689
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,440
- Right now,
- We're exempt.

2690
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,510
Seok Jin, Jae Seok, and Haha
are surely getting it.

2691
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:20,080
- There are three candidates.
- Daniel, Seung Hyub,

2692
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,750
and Ji Hu have one exempted spot.

2693
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,250
- We have a chance.
- Yes.

2694
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:25,620
- There might be a re-vote.
- It could be possible.

2695
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:28,560
Or if Ji Hyo and Ye Eun get a vote,

2696
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,990
- there will be a re-vote.
- Really?

2697
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:33,790
Let it be tied. Please.

2698
01:26:33,790 --> 01:26:35,360
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Haha: Penalty
Jong Kook, Se Chan: Exempted)

2699
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,930
- Please.
- Please.

2700
01:26:37,930 --> 01:26:40,030
(Daniel 2, Ye Eun 1, Ji Hyo 1,
Seung Hyub 2, Ji Hu 2)

2701
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:41,170
(Who will be the final 2?)

2702
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:43,270
- What happens to me then?
- How did it go?

2703
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:45,970
- How did it go?
- Yu Jae Seok and Song Ji Hyo.

2704
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:47,510
- What? It's Ji Hyo!
- Now...

2705
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:48,740
- It's Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

2706
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:50,710
- In this case...
- You survived. Come here.

2707
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:52,180
- Now...
- Please.

2708
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,510
- One.
- Seok Jin,

2709
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:54,510
(Ye Eun: Exempted)

2710
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:57,450
- Seok Jin, Jae Seok, and Haha...
- Haha.

2711
01:26:57,450 --> 01:26:58,550
- will get the penalty.
- Penalty.

2712
01:26:58,550 --> 01:27:00,090
And Daniel,

2713
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:02,420
Ji Hyo, Seung Hyub, and Ji Hu.

2714
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,820
- These four...
- A re-vote!

2715
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:06,060
- will be re-voted!
- Yes!

2716
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:09,060
(Daniel, Ji Hyo, Seung Hyub,
and Ji Hu will be re-voted.)

2717
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:11,800
- We survived!
- We survived!

2718
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:13,530
- We survived.
- I'll let you survive.

2719
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:15,000
- Will you help us this time?
- I'll let you survive.

2720
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,040
- I will help you this time.
- You should help us this time.

2721
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,940
Will all ten of us vote again?

2722
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:21,270
- Yes.
- You will each write one name.

2723
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,140
Come on.

2724
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:25,240
- Congratulations, Ye Eun.
- We decided not to do this.

2725
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,950
- Among them?
- Se Chan.

2726
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:28,780
- I switched the penalty for you.
- Who are the candidates?

2727
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:30,150
- Daniel...
- Please remember that.

2728
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:31,520
Ji Hyo...

2729
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:33,920
Do you have anything
on your schedule after this, Ji Hu?

2730
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:35,560
- I do.
- What about you?

2731
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,860
Do you have anything
after this, Seung Hyub?

2732
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,020
- I don't.
- I...

2733
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:39,490
You don't?

2734
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,160
Let's not write each other down.

2735
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:42,730
- Seung Hyub. Let's not.
- Let's vote.

2736
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:44,160
I know, right?

2737
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:46,270
- Gosh...
- In the end,

2738
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:49,370
the production crew played us again.

2739
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,040
I should have said okay
on the first round.

2740
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,640
- We should have done that.
- We got played.

2741
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:57,710
I know.
Are there any Chuncheon Parks?

2742
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:00,450
If by coincidence,
a family of eight people said,

2743
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:03,020
"We're all Chuncheon Parks..."

2744
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:06,990
The situation has become messy.

2745
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,250
I know.

2746
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:11,190
We crossed
a narrow path together as well.

2747
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:12,290
Right.

2748
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:15,030
- There are two spots left.
- Let's do this.

2749
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:17,430
- We'll reveal the result.
- Will it be me?

2750
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:19,470
- Let's go.
- Two seats are enough.

2751
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:20,600
- Right.
- It's 50 percent.

2752
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:21,930
That's a lot. Fifty percent.

2753
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:23,000
Song Ji Hyo.

2754
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,240
(Ji Hyo 1)

2755
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,340
- We have Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo did things today.

2756
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:28,540
To everyone...

2757
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,180
She has to learn a lesson today.

2758
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:31,640
Daniel.

2759
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:33,410
They're sharing the votes.

2760
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:34,410
(Daniel 1, Ji Hyo 1)

2761
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:36,380
- Daniel's chances...
- Daniel.

2762
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:38,450
Daniel is going up.

2763
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:39,650
Are there three spots left?

2764
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:41,720
- Daniel.
- There are two.

2765
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,060
Two spots. Daniel...

2766
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,720
- He has it.
- is very popular.

2767
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:46,460
Lee Seung Hyub.

2768
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:48,860
(Daniel 3, Ji Hyo 1, Seung Hyub 1)

2769
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:50,160
- Goodness.
- Daniel wrote Seung Hyub,

2770
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,500
and Seung Hyub wrote Daniel.

2771
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:53,630
Daniel wrote Seung Hyub,
and Seung Hyub wrote Daniel.

2772
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:56,400
(They betrayed each other.)

2773
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:58,770
- You said we shouldn't do this.
- You wrote each other down.

2774
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:00,940
- I mean...
- That's what happened.

2775
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:02,280
- You said that.
- I was just joking.

2776
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,380
- That's what happened.
- I just did it as a joke.

2777
01:29:04,510 --> 01:29:06,750
- You wrote my name?
- Yes.

2778
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:08,350
Thanks.
Daniel.

2779
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:10,850
(Daniel 4, Ji Hyo 1, Seung Hyub 1)

2780
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:12,920
- It's over.
- It's an overwhelming number.

2781
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:13,920
It's the majority.

2782
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,990
- Two people...
- Why me?

2783
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:17,890
Lee Seung Hyub.

2784
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:20,790
- He's going up.
- It's the two of them.

2785
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:22,930
Why are you doing this, Se Chan?

2786
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:24,260
Who?

2787
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:25,470
Why did I do that?

2788
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:26,500
(It's why he checked his schedule.)

2789
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,840
Daniel has 4 votes, Ji Hyo has 1,

2790
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,240
- Right.
- and Seung Hyub has two votes.

2791
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,040
- Ji Hu.
- There are three votes left.

2792
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,170
- That's...
- Three.

2793
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:34,510
- Ji Hu...
- Seriously.

2794
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:35,510
Song Ji Hyo.

2795
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:37,040
- She's going up.
- It would be over now.

2796
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,440
We don't know
what will happen from now.

2797
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,950
- Daniel.
- Daniel.

2798
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:43,020
(Daniel 5, Ji Hyo 2, Seung Hyub 2)

2799
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:44,250
(Ji Hu: Exempted)

2800
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,590
- Ji Hu is out.
- Right.

2801
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:46,620
Ji Hu is out.

2802
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:47,620
There's one left.

2803
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:48,890
- Will it be Ji Hyo or Seung Hyub?
- Do we vote again?

2804
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,260
- One...
- Will it be Ji Hyo or Seung Hyub?

2805
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:54,630
(Whose name will be
on the last vote?)

2806
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:55,700
Is it out?

2807
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:56,860
I bet we need another vote.

2808
01:29:57,630 --> 01:29:59,300
Gosh, the last vote...

2809
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:00,600
Is it Ji Hyo or Seung Hyub?

2810
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,500
- This vote determines the result.
- Is it one of them?

2811
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,300
- Is it 1 of them?
- It's 1 of them.

2812
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,470
- It's done.
- All right. It's one of them.

2813
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:07,140
(The one who gets the last vote
will be covered with ink.)

2814
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:09,040
- This one vote...
- We don't need another vote.

2815
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,180
- We don't.
- My goodness.

2816
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,480
The fifth vote.

2817
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:19,320
(Between Seung Hyub and Ji Hyo,
who will get the ink?)

2818
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,390
Song...

2819
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:26,730
Song Ji Hyo wrote Lee Seung Hyub.

2820
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:28,290
(He's getting the ink.)

2821
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:29,360
Lee Seung Hyub.

2822
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,560
(The guest,
Seung Hyub gets the ink.)

2823
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:35,470
(The last vote is
from Ji Hyo to Seung Hyub.)

2824
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:37,600
- My goodness.
- Ji Hyo is amazing.

2825
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,840
- Ji Hyo.
- She knew this would happen.

2826
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,180
(Sighing)

2827
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:44,180
All right then.

2828
01:30:44,410 --> 01:30:47,650
Seok Sam, Haha, Daniel,
Seung Hyub, and me

2829
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:48,650
(Ink Bomb for 5)

2830
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,080
- Okay.
- All right then.

2831
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:53,120
- Let's go to the ink bomb.
- Yes.

2832
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:54,850
- Wait.
- Why was I picked?

2833
01:30:54,850 --> 01:30:56,190
- Hang on.
- It was a popularity vote.

2834
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:57,660
Seok Sam and I...

2835
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:58,960
will get the level one penalty.

2836
01:30:58,960 --> 01:30:59,960
What?

2837
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:02,060
- What?
- Let's turn back time.

2838
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:03,260
Turn back time.

2839
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:04,900
- I'll find the Chuncheon Park clan.
- We will...

2840
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,230
- find five people.
- Yes.

2841
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:07,670
- I want to go downtown.
- Can't we?

2842
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:09,770
It's already over.

2843
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,340
- Can't we do that?
- I like it.

2844
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:14,140
So this is how it falls.
I've seen it on TV.

2845
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,510
- This is crazy.
- My goodness.

2846
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:16,980
You're being so weak.

2847
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:19,980
- This will be a good memory.
- Of course.

2848
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:22,110
- When else would I do this?
- I haven't done it for a while.

2849
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:23,480
- Me neither.
- By the way,

2850
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:24,750
I understand that
we should be doing this.

2851
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:26,350
But why is Haha here?

2852
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:29,120
- He got four votes.
- He didn't do anything wrong.

2853
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,190
- We should...
- I even said I'd go on the swing.

2854
01:31:32,290 --> 01:31:33,630
- Let's go.
- You two...

2855
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:35,030
should stand face-to-face...

2856
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:36,930
- and hug each other tightly.
- Like this.

2857
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,460
- So this is how it ends.
- Hang on.

2858
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:39,700
- Wait.
- Seriously,

2859
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:40,830
- what is this?
- So it ends like this.

2860
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:41,930
I'm scared.

2861
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:45,870
All right. One, two, three.

2862
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:49,110
(The waterfall of ink drops.)

2863
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:53,510
(Screaming)

2864
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:55,180
It's really strong.

2865
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:58,480
(The refreshing ink bath is done!)

2866
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:02,050
- Okay.
- I feel like crying.

2867
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:03,460
- It sent into my whole body.
- My gosh.

2868
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,760
- Okay.
- That was really hard.

2869
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:12,230
(Running Man's official
Unlucky Hand, Painter Yu)

2870
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:16,170
(Jae Seok will decide
on the time to get off work today?)

2871
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:19,740
(Painter Yu's world of art is
as difficult as ever.)

2872
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:22,640
(Find a place
only with Jae Seok's drawing!)

2873
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,180
What is this?

2874
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:25,680
This is...

2875
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:30,180
(Will there be a citizen
who recognizes Jae Seok's drawing?)

2876
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:32,020
(It's Dongdaemun.)

2877
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:33,190
But how...

2878
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:39,060
(They can't give up like this.)

2879
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:41,330
(His drawing skills
have improved quite a lot.)

2880
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:43,860
(Will they be able
to get off work on time?)

2881
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:45,700
(Drawing Road Trip)
