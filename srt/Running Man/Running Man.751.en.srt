1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,610
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,480
(Running Man)

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,580
It's raining.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,080
It's raining a lot.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,280
(It is a rainy spring day in April.)

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,420
It's so cold.

7
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,690
- It's nice we came to the sauna. - I know. It's warm.

8
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,620
(The members have arrived at a sauna.)

9
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,320
- Okay. - Hello.

10
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,960
- Hello. - Hello.

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,960
Look at them.

12
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,160
Look at them.

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,500
(The parrot shirt)

14
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,430
- Hello. - Hi.

15
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,960
- Hello. - Hello.

16
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,200
(The partial wig)

17
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,170
- Today, Seok Jin... - Well,

18
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,730
- Today, Seok Jin... - Well,

19
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,970
- I kept my promise. - Seok Jin.

20
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,370
Aren't you the youngest member here?

21
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,840
- It's not about a promise. - Yes.

22
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,310
He's fallen for its charm.

23
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,410
(Wigs)

24
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,680
- He's crazy about it. - He keeps looking in the mirror.

25
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,540
(These two items are actually from last week.)

26
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,180
(Auction Item 1: Idol wig)

27
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,210
- You look young. - You look young.

28
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,720
(Seok Sam's stylist)

29
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,620
I didn't even clip it. I just put it on my head.

30
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,920
- I'll bid 21 dollars and... - That's 21 dollars.

31
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,190
(Sold)

32
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,390
- Seriously. - It's pretty.

33
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,120
(Auction Item 2: Vintage parrot shirt)

34
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,020
- This is... - It goes well with denim jeans.

35
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,120
We found it at a vintage shop in Seongsu-dong.

36
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,890
- Six dollars? - Six dollars.

37
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,460
(Haha's stylist)

38
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,390
(Sold)

39
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,590
- I could wear this next week. - Haha could wear it.

40
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,830
But the wave looks a little like a mother's.

41
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,930
(They wore the outfits to the opening, like they promised.)

42
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,470
- A little. - It would've looked better...

43
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,370
if I had gone to a salon and got it done properly.

44
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,670
(Especially with this wig...)

45
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,500
- It's nice, though. - But it looks great now.

46
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,170
- Today, you're really... - I couldn't go to a salon.

47
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,770
(More than any other style,)

48
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,110
Seok Jin, you look like you're in your 20s.

49
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,610
(it makes him look much younger.)

50
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,210
I'm serious.

51
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,210
They said it looked natural from the side.

52
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,280
- It looks natural from everywhere. - It does look natural.

53
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,320
- Really? - Yes.

54
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,180
He seems to like it a lot.

55
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,820
- It looks good at the front, too. - It looks like your hair.

56
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,820
I shouldn't bow, though.

57
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,120
You can see it when I do this, right?

58
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,360
- Still, it's hard to tell. - I can't tell.

59
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,460
- It looks natural. - Right.

60
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,520
Can't you tell it's a wig?

61
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,830
- No. - Seriously, I can't tell.

62
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,430
- Really? - If we have a guest today,

63
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,900
- don't say anything. - We should ask.

64
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,630
- Okay. Anyway... - They wouldn't know.

65
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,500
(Chuckling)

66
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,630
They wouldn't know.

67
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,470
- It looks so natural. - It's hard to tell.

68
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,140
(Clearing his throat)

69
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,570
- Anyway... - By the way,

70
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,540
you're a lot less confident now.

71
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,470
- In the morning... - Why?

72
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,340
(He seems dispirited, unlike Young Seok Sam.)

73
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,340
- I just... - I went, "What's with his shirt?"

74
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,410
- It's from last week. - That's what I chose.

75
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,510
It's nice.

76
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,210
He keeps doing things to look better.

77
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,920
- I'm trying everything. - Right.

78
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,080
Look at his belt.

79
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,320
- Right. - He tries to make it look better.

80
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,390
(Sunglasses, rolled sleeves, belt with a big buckle)

81
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,550
- It won't work. - You can't pull it off.

82
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,820
(He could not improve his look with the parrot shirt.)

83
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,190
- No. - No matter what you do...

84
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,290
- It's not working. - No.

85
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,960
- It's okay. - Nothing works.

86
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,960
- It won't last long. - Hey.

87
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,730
Take it off. Let me try it on.

88
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,600
- Why? - You look very confident now.

89
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,270
- Just give it to me. - What?

90
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,930
(Nodding)

91
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,340
With the wig on, he wants to try something new.

92
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,670
- But why? - Why is he being like this?

93
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,300
- Why? - I want to try it on.

94
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,810
(They are all surprised to see him take the challenge.)

95
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,270
- He's feeling very confident. - Why?

96
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,540
- I mean, he's... - He thinks...

97
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,980
(Gosh)

98
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,080
- he can pull off anything. - Let me try it on.

99
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,480
- You're so young. - Let me try it on.

100
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,850
- Give me that. - Why do you want to wear this?

101
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,210
I think I can pull off anything.

102
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,120
- What's wrong with him? - You're so young.

103
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,080
(Will Young Seok Sam manage to pull off this look as well?)

104
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,120
Seok Jin, you look like you're in your 20s. Seriously.

105
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
You look like the guy who mugged me at school.

106
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,160
This doesn't look good, right?

107
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,530
- No. - Hey, give it back to me.

108
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,160
- His personality is very... - He sounds strange.

109
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,730
He became strange because of his hair.

110
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,000
(Only his lid changed, but his personality became cooler.)

111
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,100
- His personality... - He's changed.

112
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,630
- He's different. - He's changed.

113
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,200
(Cool guy)

114
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,700
Look at him.

115
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,510
Because of his work schedule, Daniel had to go abroad for work...

116
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,340
(The rented member is absent...)

117
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,010
- I know. - We heard.

118
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,980
(due to an event he has abroad.)

119
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,110
- and couldn't come today. - Okay.

120
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,180
- We have guests for today. - So he's overseas.

121
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,050
(Today's guest is revealed.)

122
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,750
- We have guests? - Please come on in.

123
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,120
- Who is it? - Who are the guests?

124
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,550
- Hello. - Goodness.

125
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,490
(The flirting machine, Kim Ah Young)

126
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,690
- It's Ah Young. - Hey.

127
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,020
You're here.

128
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,420
- Hello. - The duck.

129
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,690
(He discovered the duck.)

130
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,890
- Hello. - Ah Young.

131
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,790
(And behind Ah Young...)

132
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,330
- It's KAI. - This is crazy.

133
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,530
(KAI of EXO)

134
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,530
This is crazy.

135
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,070
(KAI of EXO is undisputably a popular solo artist!)

136
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,170
(A man who is called the textbook of K-pop performance)

137
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,570
(KAI is back after his military service!)

138
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,970
(He's making a comeback with his new song, "Wait On Me" after 2 years.)

139
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,840
(The world-class performer KAI)

140
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,370
- KAI! - It's KAI.

141
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,540
- Hey. - Come here.

142
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,880
(He greets the older guys.)

143
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,710
- Hey, KAI. - My goodness.

144
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,750
- Hello. - This is crazy.

145
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,120
- Hello. - Hi, Ah Young.

146
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,490
- Hi, Ah Young. - Hi, Ah Young.

147
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,490
I will stay back.

148
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,320
(She didn't hear him.)

149
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,690
- Seok Jin. - All right.

150
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,760
You should be in the center.

151
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,260
- Ah Young is really something. - She brought this.

152
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,390
The thing she got last time.

153
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,060
(This duck bag...)

154
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,200
- Do you still have this? - How did she bring that?

155
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,660
- What is this? - I got it.

156
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,200
(It's the token of love that Se Chan gave her last time.)

157
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,760
My gosh.

158
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,870
- What is this romance? - I got a gift.

159
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,700
Appearance-wise, my ideal type is Daniel.

160
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,270
- Me? - Seriously?

161
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,940
- You should exchange numbers. - Stop it.

162
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,510
(But she had something going on with the 9-foot catfish.)

163
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,010
- Exchange your numbers. - Okay.

164
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,640
After the shoot of Running Man, I called her in the car...

165
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,640
(Daniel exchanged numbers with Ah Young.)

166
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,180
- on my way home. - Okay.

167
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,150
(He called Ah Young right away,)

168
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,550
(but the phone was turned off.)

169
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,980
- Her phone was turned off. - What?

170
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,680
Wasn't it the wrong number?

171
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,880
(She didn't even call him back.)

172
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,920
And she didn't even call me back.

173
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,750
So I thought it was probably for show.

174
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,260
(Running Man's Ok Soon, Ah Young, shook the hearts of two men.)

175
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,490
That's strange.

176
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,090
- Ah Young brought this. - You brought this?

177
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,760
(She shows off her charms from the beginning.)

178
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,030
- I got it the other day. - Daniel isn't here today.

179
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,760
- This is... - By the way, Ah Young,

180
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,430
we heard you didn't answer Daniel's call...

181
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,630
after doing all this.

182
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,700
- The thing is... What was that? - Yes.

183
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,400
- I didn't get the call. - You didn't?

184
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,370
Back then... Ye Eun would know.

185
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,310
(She didn't get the call from Daniel?)

186
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,270
My phone was turned off at the moment.

187
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,580
(She says that Daniel's missed call did not show up on her phone.)

188
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,510
But when I turned it on, I didn't get the missed call message.

189
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,210
- Really? - So actually,

190
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,950
I thought maybe he was a little uncomfortable.

191
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,350
- I was a little... - I see.

192
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,050
(Quickly immersed)

193
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,120
- I thought, "Was it just business?" - That's a misunderstanding.

194
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,390
You misunderstood each other.

195
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,520
(There was a misunderstanding between the two.)

196
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,950
So I thought it was probably for show.

197
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,260
That's too sad.

198
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,520
- It was a misunderstanding. - No. They fell out with each other.

199
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,160
(Twitching)

200
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,790
- That's too bad. - It's so sad.

201
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,730
- It's like a drama. - So Se Chan is out.

202
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,900
What's funny is that...

203
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,200
she's saying that with the bag I gave her.

204
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,970
This is ridiculous.

205
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,270
- So she's... - How interesting.

206
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,340
(She is the type who cares for all the guys around her.)

207
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,270
She's really something.

208
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,470
- She's strange. - No.

209
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,300
- We should watch her closely. - Ah Young has...

210
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,670
- a unique way of flirting. - It's strange.

211
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,240
(Thanks to that, the small fry is drunk on love.)

212
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,810
- And we have KAI here. - KAI.

213
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,280
(It has been a long time since KAI was on the show.)

214
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,950
- KAI! - How long has it been?

215
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,880
- It's been... - This is when KAI came.

216
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,020
It was the day when Jong Kook shook Jae Seok around.

217
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,790
(Young KAI 11 years ago)

218
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,150
- Is that when you came? - Right.

219
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,150
- That's when I came. - Right?

220
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,290
It's been a really long time.

221
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,060
- It's been so long. - Yes.

222
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,930
- And I served in the military. - Yes.

223
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,930
It's been two months...

224
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,960
- since I was discharged. - Really?

225
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,260
- It hasn't been so long. - It hasn't been long.

226
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,730
- It's been long. - So...

227
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,230
I find this situation interesting.

228
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,470
- Really? - Yes.

229
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,770
You grew your hair a lot in two months.

230
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,400
Jae Seok, KAI and Seok Jin have the same hairstyle.

231
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,210
They have the same hairstyle.

232
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,340
- It's similar. - Is it the same?

233
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,440
- I copied your hairstyle. - It's similar.

234
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,710
Can't you tell it's a wig?

235
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,180
(Earlier, they said they would test the guests...)

236
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,180
- No. - Seriously, I can't tell.

237
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,820
- Really? - If we have a guest today,

238
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,190
(to see if it looks like a wig or not.)

239
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,450
- you shouldn't say anything. - We should ask.

240
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,220
- Yes. - Is it...

241
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,120
- Is it the same? - Yes. I copied...

242
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,320
- your hairstyle. - Doesn't he look a lot younger?

243
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,620
You look a lot younger.

244
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,630
They don't know.

245
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,490
(Laughing)

246
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,160
- Did you get a hair transplant? - I changed my hairstyle.

247
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,730
- Really? - Did I get a hair transplant?

248
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,230
I thought he got a hair transplant.

249
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,870
- No? - That's his hair. He grew it out.

250
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,040
- Really? - Is that true?

251
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,570
- My hairstyle... - A hair transplant?

252
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,170
(The two were completely fooled.)

253
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,800
He changed his hairstyle.

254
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,310
- It looks pretty. - I changed my hairstyle.

255
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,440
It's a little...

256
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,010
I tried too hard to look younger, right?

257
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,250
- Yes. - Okay.

258
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,350
"Yes."

259
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,950
(Patting)

260
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,780
Why...

261
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,980
- Why does he keep touching it? - Why?

262
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,550
- I feel really shy. - Seok Jin.

263
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,320
Just act natural. Why are you doing this?

264
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,790
Actually, KAI was my favorite.

265
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,060
- Seriously? - Yes.

266
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,760
KAI was my favorite.

267
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,030
(Ye Eun suddenly confesses her love for KAI.)

268
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,290
- Seriously? - Yes.

269
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,600
- Since when? - When did you like him?

270
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,930
- When he performed "Growl." - "Growl."

271
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,940
(Newly debuted KAI, in 2013)

272
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,970
How old were you back then?

273
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,100
I was 20.

274
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,370
- Ye Eun was 20. - It was 10 years ago.

275
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,840
(He was her favorite when she was 20 years old.)

276
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,570
- Was it ten years ago? - Yes.

277
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,970
- And KAI was your favorite? - Yes.

278
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,940
(Interrogating)

279
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,880
- Your favorite? - What did you like about him?

280
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,910
He's the coolest... He's the best dancer.

281
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,550
- You liked the best dancer. - That's why.

282
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,650
You seem very calm though.

283
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,380
- Don't you feel nervous? - I'm nervous.

284
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,420
- She knows it won't work. - Look at her hands.

285
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,590
- Her hands are like this. - What can she do about it?

286
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,320
- That's too harsh. - Why are you twisting your hands?

287
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,860
(Food Fighter became shy after seeing her favorite artist.)

288
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,920
Why are you twisting your hands?

289
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,490
- I'm so nervous. - Are you praying now?

290
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,400
So KAI is back...

291
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,000
(KAI is back with a new song.)

292
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,960
- with his new song. - Right.

293
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,830
- The dance is amazing. - We should listen to it.

294
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,640
Let's listen to KAI's new song then.

295
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,370
- What's the title? - It's "Wait On Me."

296
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,140
- "Wait On Me." - "Wait On Me."

297
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,110
- Wait a minute. - This is like a stage.

298
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,740
- This is a stage. - It's a stage.

299
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,540
(The sauna music show begins.)

300
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,280
- Let's go, KAI! - My goodness.

301
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,510
- The stage in a sauna. - The dance is amazing.

302
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,550
- KAI dances so well. - It's amazing.

303
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,750
("Wait On Me" by KAI)

304
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,880
- The dance. - He's a great dancer.

305
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,890
There you go.

306
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,790
He threw it.

307
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,860
(Amazed)

308
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,300
- I can't believe this is a sauna. - That's great.

309
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,470
- In a sauna... - His dance is amazing.

310
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,040
(He gives a high-quality performance at a sauna, early in the morning.)

311
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,240
- He's different. - My goodness.

312
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,440
- He's on another level. - My gosh.

313
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,410
- So early in the morning. - In the morning.

314
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,440
(He dominates the stage wearing only one pair of white socks.)

315
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,210
- This is crazy. - It's unbelievable.

316
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,080
It must be difficult to dance here.

317
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,250
(That's so cool!)

318
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,550
That was crazy.

319
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,560
- KAI, you're so cool! - Are you serious?

320
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,960
- That was brilliant. - Did you like it?

321
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,160
(Seok Sam is deeply impressed.)

322
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,860
- You've got it. You nailed it. - Was it good?

323
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,460
- That was amazing. - He threw it like this.

324
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,900
- It was the best. - He caught it and went like this.

325
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,940
- Gosh, my back. - Afro.

326
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,170
(He acts like he knows.)

327
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,400
- Afro. Okay. - Right.

328
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,870
- That's reggae. - Yes.

329
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,410
- That was amazing. - It was so cool.

330
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,540
It's really cool.

331
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,540
The floor is slippery.

332
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,910
- In a sauna. - It was slippery.

333
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,410
(Brave)

334
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,680
- Right. In the morning. - You're really good.

335
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,750
Those who are not good at dancing...

336
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,480
- would blame the slippery floor. - Right.

337
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,280
And they'd go, "I'll give it a try anyway."

338
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,320
- But he wasn't like that. - I don't mind.

339
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,520
- I don't mind. - He doesn't blame it.

340
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,990
- You don't mind it? - I don't mind the floor.

341
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,220
You can even dance on the ground, right?

342
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,090
I've been in this field for 14 years.

343
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,430
- I don't mind it. - That's great.

344
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,860
(He is full of passion.)

345
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,960
Anyway, we have Ah Young and KAI here.

346
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,470
- Ye Eun's favorite! - Her favorite!

347
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,740
Ye Eun can't focus on the shoot today.

348
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,300
(Going overboard)

349
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,170
Before we start the race,

350
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:59,580
you will be divided up into pairs and make couples.

351
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,080
(Brightening up)

352
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,050
- Couples? - Hang on.

353
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,410
We should give way to them.

354
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,780
(Senseless)

355
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,980
- This isn't about giving way. - Let's just do it.

356
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,550
(The mood turns strange.)

357
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,390
- Couples regardless of gender. - I see.

358
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,020
- We should see Ye Eun get rejected. - Ddochi.

359
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,420
- Come on. - Getting rejected by KAI.

360
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,520
Gender does not matter. But still...

361
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,530
(Acting cool)

362
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,930
This is the day for Ah Young and Ye Eun.

363
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,190
- Right. - I think so.

364
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,760
- By the way... - Thank you.

365
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,670
- Is it already decided? - Is it random?

366
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,200
(The match-making rules are revealed.)

367
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:26,440
We have five rooms in this sauna now.

368
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,470
- You'll pick a room and go inside. - Really?

369
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,940
The two people who choose the same room will become a couple.

370
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,110
- Hang on. That means... - I see. That's how.

371
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,580
- Two, four, six... - We are an odd number.

372
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,620
(There are 9 people in total.)

373
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,050
- Eight. - What about the one person?

374
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,050
A team of three?

375
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,320
Each room has a capacity of two people.

376
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,620
If the room you chose is already full,

377
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,220
- We should move? - you must go to another room.

378
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,560
And the one person...

379
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,890
- who fails to become a couple... - It will be so lonely.

380
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,290
will take part in the race...

381
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,660
- as a single. - Oh, no.

382
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,130
- Ye Eun will play solo. - Ye Eun will play solo.

383
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,630
(It is devastating news for the romance hunters.)

384
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,300
- Ah Young will play solo. - Oh, no.

385
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,040
Let's say one person comes in.

386
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,010
- And the next person comes in too. - It's over.

387
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,670
Then can the person who was in the room choose the partner?

388
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,980
- Is it over? - Once the room is full...

389
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,680
(They cannot take it back once they enter the room.)

390
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,210
- It's over like that. - If you open the door...

391
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,240
and there are two people,

392
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,380
(They have to leave the room if there are 2 people in it.)

393
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,950
- you have to go somewhere else. - I can't reject my partner?

394
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,210
- We have to accept the person? - No matter what?

395
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,210
It's random.

396
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,550
- Yes. - It's totally random.

397
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,120
For your information, I will tell you...

398
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,250
- about the room temperatures. - The temperatures.

399
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,690
- It's important. - The Red Clay Room...

400
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,360
- is 98°C. - What?

401
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,360
(Red Clay Room, 98°C)

402
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,530
But you have to stay in the room...

403
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,460
until the couple matching is over.

404
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,530
But it's 98°C.

405
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,060
- Then it's better to go first. - And...

406
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,670
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - The Red Clay Ball Room is 70°C.

407
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,070
(Red Clay Ball Room, 70°C)

408
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,900
- I can't go in there. - That's better.

409
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,040
- It's better to go first. - The Salt Room...

410
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,440
- is 84°C. - What?

411
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,840
And there is an Ice Room and an Oxygen Room.

412
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,910
- I'll go to the Oxygen Room. - The Oxygen Room.

413
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,950
- Ice Room or Oxygen Room. - That's better.

414
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,180
(The Oxygen Room and Ice Room are expected to be popular.)

415
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,280
- Ice Room or Oxygen Room. - Where will you go?

416
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,750
The women...

417
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,720
- will go into the rooms first. - Okay.

418
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,050
- The women! - The women.

419
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,820
- So those four... - What are you doing, Seok Jin?

420
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,520
- You should go, ma'am. - You should go, ma'am.

421
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,460
(Seok Soon is also in the female division.)

422
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,420
- Is it me? - Seok Soon should go.

423
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,960
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Okay.

424
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,060
Rock-paper-scissors.

425
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,860
- He's really doing it. - Are you really doing it?

426
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,100
- Rock-paper-scissors. - He's really doing it.

427
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,100
- I lost. - It's okay.

428
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,670
(Order of selection for the female division)

429
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,230
- You go first, Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo goes first.

430
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,370
Rock-paper-scissors.

431
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,100
- I'll go first. - Okay. Go.

432
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,000
(Ji Hyo is up first.)

433
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,300
- By the way, - Gosh, that's...

434
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,410
Ji Hyo looks like the owner of a mountain cabin.

435
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,910
- I know. - Right. The old one.

436
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,710
(They were too focused on Seok Sam's wig...)

437
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,240
Why is she wearing the hat? It's not a penalty.

438
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,380
(to notice her captain's hat.)

439
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,550
(Ice Room, Red Clay Ball Room,)

440
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,750
(Red Clay Room, Salt Room, Oxygen Room)

441
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,320
(Ice Room, Red Clay Ball Room, Red Clay Room...)

442
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,250
Ice Room or Oxygen Room.

443
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,860
(Will she choose the cool Oxygen Room or the Ice Room?)

444
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,150
I will...

445
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,560
(What?)

446
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,860
This is not bad.

447
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:33,030
(She chose the second hottest Salt Room, at 84°C.)

448
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,330
This is not bad.

449
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,930
The Salt Room.

450
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,670
I'm easily affected by the cold.

451
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,640
I like warm places.

452
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,440
This is a little hot, though.

453
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,840
- Let's go. - Ye Eun goes next. Then I'll go.

454
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,580
(In the waiting room...)

455
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,910
- Give us a hint before you go. - Right.

456
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,210
- A hint? - Yes.

457
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,250
(Acting cute)

458
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,210
Ye Eun, Ah Young, give us a hint.

459
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,280
- Right. - How do we give them a hint?

460
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,180
Do you like even numbers or odd numbers, Ye Eun?

461
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,490
- What do you like? - I like the lucky number.

462
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,750
- The lucky number. - Seven.

463
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,850
- Okay. - It's seven.

464
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,220
(But there are only 5 rooms.)

465
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,720
- I don't think there's Room Seven. - I mean...

466
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,320
- There aren't 7 rooms. - I like number 3.

467
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,260
(Actually...)

468
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,390
This is what she likes.

469
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,900
(The hint is only meant for KAI.)

470
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,030
- Number three. - This is it.

471
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,030
- I will never choose Room Three. - Why not?

472
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,960
- I brought the duck today. - I see.

473
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,970
It's number five.

474
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,170
- Number 5. - Number 5!

475
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,300
- Then it makes 10. - She said number 5.

476
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,200
(Empty Head)

477
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,670
- Is it 5 or 2? - Is it 5 or 2?

478
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,370
- Number five. - Five and two.

479
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,210
Ah Young is unbelievable.

480
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,280
- It's really... - I should get the story going.

481
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,480
(She's a professional.)

482
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,550
- She's unbelievable. - Today,

483
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:27,620
(Reporting)

484
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,610
I said, "It's too bad that Daniel isn't here today."

485
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,350
- And she said, "I have Se Chan." - No!

486
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,490
She found a new man right away.

487
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,820
(Fascinated)

488
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,720
- Se Chan. - She is...

489
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,920
- I just meant... - Go ahead and do it.

490
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,630
- You should go into Room 5. - Room 5.

491
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,160
(She is serious.)

492
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,460
- Right. - She's amazing.

493
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,400
(She will take care of Se Chan today.)

494
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,800
- Did she say it was okay? - Ah Young is unbelievable.

495
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,970
- Ah Young is... - She has good endurance.

496
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,500
(Amazed)

497
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,400
- I'm persistent. - It's good.

498
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,540
- The next person should go. - Where will you go?

499
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,940
(Ye Eun heads off.)

500
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,970
- Look at her. - I can't go to Room Three.

501
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,840
Ye Eun, what do you like, even or odd numbers?

502
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,810
- I'll check the atmosphere first. - The atmosphere?

503
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,440
- The atmosphere. - I think she will...

504
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,710
go into the room with the lowest temperature.

505
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,680
I'm sure she won't choose the hot one.

506
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,020
She won't go into the hot room.

507
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,550
(Ice Room, Red Clay Ball Room,)

508
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,020
(Red Clay Room, Salt Room, Oxygen Room)

509
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,850
Should I go to the Ice Room?

510
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,890
(The guys were right.)

511
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,460
I'm going in.

512
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:12,900
(As expected, the frail Ye Eun chooses the Ice Room.)

513
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,600
I think I made the wrong choice.

514
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,340
Did I make the wrong choice?

515
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,970
(She's ranting about how cold it is.)

516
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,470
It's cold in here.

517
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,410
I wonder who'll join me.

518
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,980
(Staff)

519
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,540
Who do you want it to be?

520
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,610
KAI.

521
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,450
But why do I get the feeling that someone else will join me?

522
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,350
(Suddenly worried)

523
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,280
- Next up, we have... - I'll go.

524
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,980
(The next one up...)

525
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,750
(is Ah Young.)

526
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,250
- Ah Young. - I should get going.

527
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,950
- How about the Oxygen Room? - What if she joined Ye Eun?

528
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,250
(Turning back)

529
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,490
- Why did you look at Se Chan? - Did you see her just now?

530
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,620
The Oxygen Room.

531
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,660
(Smiling)

532
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,660
- Ah Young... - Why did you look at Se Chan?

533
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,930
- Did you see her just now? - She's no joke.

534
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,400
- Seriously? - She's not in her right mind.

535
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,460
- She... - No way.

536
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,770
- She can be ruthless. - Don't let this get to you.

537
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,300
- How can I not? - You make it obvious...

538
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,970
by showing that you like it.

539
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,640
Doesn't it hurt your pride?

540
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,140
(The woman who has Se Chan showing his broad gums)

541
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,040
- He loves it. - The way I see it...

542
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,680
I don't know which room to choose.

543
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,410
I was going to choose room number five.

544
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,920
(Scouring for Room 5)

545
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,850
What do I do?

546
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,880
- Five. - Five?

547
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,790
(Ice Room, Red Clay Ball Room)

548
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,150
How are the rooms numbered?

549
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,790
Is it one, two, three, four, five?

550
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,620
(Red Clay Room, Salt Room, Oxygen Room)

551
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,590
I was going to choose room number five.

552
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,590
(Ah Young was going to wait for Se Chan...)

553
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,360
(in Room 5, the Oxygen Room.)

554
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,760
What do I do?

555
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,560
(Ice Room, Red Clay Ball Room,)

556
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,930
It's cold in here.

557
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,800
(Red Clay Room, Salt Room, Oxygen Room)

558
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,800
(Ye Eun waits for KAI in the Ice Room.)

559
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,670
KAI could join me in here.

560
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,700
(However)

561
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,340
(Screaming)

562
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,680
(Ah Young chose the Ice Room.)

563
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,150
- Ah Young, no way. - This room...

564
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,650
(How did this happen?)

565
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,950
This is room number five.

566
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,050
Is this room number five?

567
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,350
(After pondering, Ah Young counted in the other direction.)

568
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,680
One, two, three, four, five.

569
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,620
This is room number five, right?

570
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,220
(She enters the Ice Room.)

571
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,260
This is room number five.

572
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,460
This was at the far end, making it room number five.

573
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,160
I had no idea. What do we do?

574
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,330
(Ah Young and Ye Eun became a couple.)

575
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,430
- What else? We're a team now. - Really?

576
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,760
(Screaming)

577
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,800
- What was that? - They must've partnered up.

578
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,500
(They could hear the duet of screams.)

579
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,970
So that's what happened.

580
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,140
Se Chan, are you okay with this?

581
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,970
- What a bummer. - They're a couple now.

582
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,570
- Who's next? - Right, sure.

583
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,440
(It is Seok Soon's turn.)

584
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,040
- They ended up as a couple. - Off I go.

585
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,280
It's for the best.

586
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,340
Oxygen Room.

587
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,140
I don't want to team up with anyone in that room.

588
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,420
(Seok Soon wants to have a male partner.)

589
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,250
I'm going in here.

590
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,620
(He chooses the seemingly empty Red Clay Ball Room.)

591
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,120
It'll be warm in here.

592
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,850
Let's go.

593
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,720
(Ice Room, Red Clay Ball Room,)

594
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,850
Is it empty?

595
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,790
(Red Clay Room, Salt Room, Oxygen Room)

596
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,260
Let's show them our chemistry.

597
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,830
(Members of the female division have made their choices.)

598
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,520
I think I made the wrong choice.

599
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,860
It's getting hotter.

600
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,790
Can we get going? Let's see.

601
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,900
Hold on a second.

602
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,860
Someone must definitely be in the Oxygen Room.

603
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,400
(Jae Seok is first to choose for the male division.)

604
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,030
The Salt Room.

605
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,970
Wait.

606
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,240
I won't be going in the Red Clay Room...

607
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,440
that is 98℃.

608
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,940
(Which room will Jae Seok choose?)

609
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,050
(The Oxygen Room)

610
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,110
No one's here.

611
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,110
Okay.

612
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,250
This is perfect.

613
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,850
(34°C)

614
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,420
I love it.

615
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,890
Why did everyone make difficult choices?

616
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,360
(Jae Seok chose the oxygen room, which was surprisingly empty.)

617
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,590
Maybe it's because this is at the entrance.

618
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,830
The room is fresh like oxygen.

619
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,290
(It is Se Chan's turn.)

620
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,330
One.

621
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,600
One, two, three, four, five.

622
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,070
(Se Chan's potential partner already ended up with someone else.)

623
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,230
Which room should I choose?

624
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,640
- It's cold. - Why did I even bring this with me?

625
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:12,210
(Who will Se Chan be partnered up with?)

626
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,250
(He unites with Seok Sam in the Red Clay Ball Room.)

627
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,650
(Laughing)

628
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,850
(Laughing)

629
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,420
My gosh.

630
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,860
- Seok Jin. - Hey.

631
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,860
(Seok Soon and Se Chan are a couple.)

632
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,660
- Hey. - Seok Jin.

633
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,390
- I mean... - Team Young and Rich.

634
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,600
Team Young and Rich.

635
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,870
Will I know who's inside the second I open the door?

636
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,330
(Next is Jong Kook.)

637
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,100
No one's answering me.

638
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,540
(Which room did the embarrassed Jong Kook choose?)

639
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,780
- What the... Are you kidding me? - What?

640
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,210
(The Oxygen Room, where Jae Seok is)

641
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,240
Why are you here, Jae Seok?

642
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,710
(Whining)

643
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,080
Why did you enter this room?

644
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,580
(Is he smiling?)

645
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,920
Why are you in here when there are plenty of hotter rooms?

646
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,390
- Is it over once I open the door? - That's right.

647
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,690
(Dripping with love, they became a match!)

648
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,950
- This isn't so bad. - This is good.

649
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,590
- Actually... - Jong Kook.

650
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,720
- It's not like we'll be dating. - This is good.

651
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,860
(Three couples are already made.)

652
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,360
- Nice. - Exactly.

653
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,490
Okay.

654
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,030
I came here today...

655
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,560
to have a romantic connection with someone.

656
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,530
- I'm doomed. I know. - Life doesn't always go your way.

657
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,400
(It did not go as Ah Young had planned.)

658
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,300
- That's what makes it entertaining. - Right.

659
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,440
I'm a huge fan of KAI.

660
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,170
Didn't I once tell you that?

661
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,240
I had a feeling about this...

662
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,080
(Ye Eun is also upset.)

663
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,070
when I knew who was going to be on the show.

664
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,540
He was my bias.

665
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,940
I knew you'd be thrilled.

666
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,950
- The Ice Room. - I hear someone.

667
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,710
(At that moment...)

668
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,050
Who could it be?

669
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,720
(KAI appears.)

670
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,820
(Screaming)

671
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,290
(Even KAI chose the Ice Room.)

672
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,960
Ah Young, get lost!

673
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,030
This is you. Come on in.

674
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,930
- You... - We'll be a group of three.

675
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,960
(A sad...)

676
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,170
You're in the right place.

677
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,530
(lie)

678
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,830
I'd love to enter. Can't I do that?

679
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,940
(One must choose another room if the selected room is full.)

680
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,810
(The guilty one)

681
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,310
Still, we had the same idea.

682
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,440
(She sees the silver lining.)

683
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,180
We had the same idea.

684
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,310
(Red Clay Room, Salt Room)

685
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,710
(He should choose the Salt Room if he wants to be a couple.)

686
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,050
Who am I going to be partnered with?

687
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,310
Where should I go?

688
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,950
(He chooses the empty Red Clay Room.)

689
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,960
- No one's here. - Is it just me?

690
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,620
I think I chose the wrong room.

691
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,190
(Ji Hyo chose the Salt Room as the first one up.)

692
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,790
It's getting hotter in here.

693
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,430
I'm even wearing thermal clothing.

694
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,360
(Gradually melting)

695
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,570
It's hot.

696
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,170
(Haha is the last to go.)

697
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,970
Let me see. The Oxygen Room has been filled, right?

698
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,270
(Red Clay Room, Salt Room)

699
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,010
(Ji Hyo and KAI are both desperate, even if it is Haha.)

700
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,180
Haha.

701
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,210
Haha, you need to come in here.

702
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,520
It's too hot.

703
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,120
(Whoever isn't chosen will be a singleton.)

704
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,550
Oh, no.

705
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,060
Please...

706
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,560
(He chooses a room without hesitating.)

707
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,000
(Which room did Haha choose?)

708
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,200
What?

709
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,470
(Ji Hyo in the Salt Room)

710
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,070
How was this room not filled?

711
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,770
- My partner. - I thought it would've been filled.

712
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,870
(Haha and Ji Hyo are a match.)

713
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,040
How was this room not filled?

714
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,440
I was close to evaporating.

715
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,040
(Four couples were made.)

716
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,040
- Weren't you the first to choose? - We filmed something else.

717
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,480
- It's too hot. Let's sit. - Someone must be alone.

718
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,650
KAI, you're the singleton.

719
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,720
(KAI is by himself.)

720
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,380
Wait. I'm the singleton?

721
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,620
I'm the singleton?

722
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,790
(The results from the first match-making)

723
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,320
Se Chan, which room were you in?

724
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,490
- The Red Clay Ball Room. - You were next door.

725
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,960
But Ice Room was room number five.

726
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,020
We heard you two.

727
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,260
- KAI... - Is he single for the day?

728
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,330
(KAI will be single for the day.)

729
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,860
was alone in his room,

730
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,730
- making him a singleton. - That's too bad.

731
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,270
Those of you with partners...

732
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,670
will each receive a couple's badge.

733
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,030
- Okay. - Nice.

734
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,070
That's quite nice.

735
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,740
- You don't get one, being single. - You don't get one.

736
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,940
(Upset)

737
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,940
Okay.

738
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,470
- The first partner selection... - What a bummer.

739
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,970
is now over.

740
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,310
(Today's race is revealed.)

741
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,540
- Here are today's rules. - This is hilarious.

742
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,710
- I won't take this. - Do you know what day today is?

743
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,510
- Today? - The day we're joined by KAI.

744
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,980
What day is April 14?

745
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,120
White Day!

746
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,020
(It is March 14.)

747
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,750
- What? - That's March 14.

748
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,150
- That's March 14. - I've heard about this a lot.

749
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,390
Isn't it Jjajangmyeon Day?

750
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,960
It's called Black Day.

751
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,390
(Ye Eun is correct.)

752
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,820
It's called Black Day.

753
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:52,160
(April 14 is Black Day, also known as Jjajangmyeon Day)

754
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,260
- How does one even know that? - Of course.

755
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,100
Who remembers what April 14 is?

756
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,570
- It's related to food. - How does she keep the weight off?

757
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,430
- No way. - Why am I not surprised?

758
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,540
(Black Day, April 14)

759
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,040
- How did you know this? - Black Day...

760
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,170
- is a day for singletons. - I see.

761
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,210
(The unofficial day to comfort those without a lover)

762
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,040
That's why we have prepared this race.

763
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,870
A Good Day To Be Single Race.

764
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,280
- Being a couple isn't good. - You benefit...

765
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,680
from being single and not a couple.

766
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,250
- Being a couple isn't good. - You benefit...

767
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,510
from being single and not a couple.

768
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,050
(Yes!)

769
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,350
- What? - Lucky him.

770
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,620
Is it bad to be a couple?

771
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,850
- No wonder... - Hold on.

772
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,850
- Then... - No wonder.

773
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,590
(The heart was crying on the badge.)

774
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,590
During this race,

775
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,760
the singleton will be given many advantages.

776
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,960
- Yes! - You should've told us.

777
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,560
Meanwhile, couples will face disadvantages.

778
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,800
- Darn! - Nice!

779
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,230
- Seriously? - Of course.

780
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,900
This is good for KAI.

781
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,530
(Being single was the good one.)

782
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,400
Of course. This is what I'm talking about.

783
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
If it's meant to work out, it will, no matter what.

784
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,840
- You'll switch it up each round. - Do we switch it up?

785
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,340
That's right. A second ago,

786
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,370
(And another rule)

787
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,940
you were thrilled to receive a couple's badge.

788
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,980
- You can't have a lot of them. - The more you have,

789
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,010
- the worse it will be for you. - Of course.

790
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,450
Every time you become a couple, you will receive one.

791
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,780
Whoever is single won't receive a badge.

792
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,820
However, losing the missions and games...

793
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,020
will result in additional badges for everyone.

794
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,660
- I see. - You'll change clothes and regroup.

795
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,690
- Okay. - All right!

796
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,690
- Unbelievable. - Got it.

797
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,630
(What will be the first advantage for the singleton?)

798
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,260
- All right. - Let's do this.

799
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,600
- Right. - Thanks.

800
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,770
What are you making us wear? I look like a thug.

801
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,470
Ji Hyo, yours is pretty though.

802
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,600
Don't you think I'll put people off?

803
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,270
Ji Hyo, yours is pretty though.

804
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,840
Unbelievable.

805
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,970
(Their team uniforms are on the flashier side today.)

806
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,310
(Laughing)

807
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,680
Check this out. Don't you think I'll put people off?

808
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,050
- Why is this so big? - What do you mean?

809
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,380
Why are they so big?

810
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,920
- These aren't mine. - I know that.

811
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,690
(The shameful shirtless guy)

812
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,950
Se Chan, this is highly provocative.

813
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,120
(Embarrassed)

814
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,790
That's nice.

815
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,090
- You look cute. - We should watch out for Jong Kook.

816
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,690
- I guess this is a quiz. - The dog looks like it's growling.

817
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,730
- That's a cute puppy. - It looks like it's growling.

818
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,000
(The dog seems to have a temper, like its owner.)

819
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,030
You cute thing.

820
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,760
- Se Chan. - This is cute.

821
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,030
(They all come in with unique matching clothes.)

822
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,730
- What on earth is this? - Those kittens are adorable.

823
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,430
- They're cute. - The cats...

824
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,270
- I could give you this. - No way.

825
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,440
(The French Fry is jealous of the cat.)

826
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,870
- Unbelievable. - What am I seeing?

827
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,340
(This one is King Kong.)

828
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,910
- Seok Jin, I... - Bok Choy, move.

829
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,010
- Bok Choy? - Bok Choy. What is this?

830
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,750
(The couples are all here.)

831
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,480
- I'm French Fry. - French Fry, move.

832
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,610
- French Fry? - French Fry.

833
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,250
(Couple Number 1: French Fry and Vegetables)

834
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,850
- Vegetables. - I'm Vegetables.

835
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,080
- Is this Versace? - Don't ask.

836
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,490
- Is this Versace? - The pants are too baggy.

837
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,350
(Couple Number 2: Bok Choy and Versace)

838
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,890
- I look like a thug. - What's with his?

839
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,890
(Couple Number 3: Angry Dog and Brother Gorilla)

840
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,790
- It's a puppy but... - Hey, Rilla.

841
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,820
They're also a couple.

842
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,660
(Couple Number 4: Big Nipples and Jee-kitten)

843
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,660
- KAI looks nice. - Don't I look nice?

844
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,160
(Envious)

845
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,200
- You look nice. - Look at him.

846
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,770
- I look good today. - You look good.

847
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,270
(The first benefit as a singleton, a normal outfit)

848
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,670
- We're all making him look good. - You definitely look better.

849
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,700
(He was able to get all the good looks.)

850
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,340
- The color's nice too. - He looks better than everyone.

851
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,870
I'm sorry to say this, but Se Chan's putting me off.

852
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,170
- I know, but... - Tell me about it.

853
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,940
This works for me, but it'll also work for Jae Seok.

854
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,450
- You... - Jae Seok!

855
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,610
(Low-chested)

856
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,080
- Jae Seok! - Seriously?

857
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,490
(A t-shirt that allows you to look like Jae Seok)

858
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,420
- It's too much to the side. - If I wear this in a sauna,

859
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,620
- people will think I'm Jae Seok. - Are you kidding me?

860
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,960
- It's too much to the side. - His nipples are around his belly.

861
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,860
(Further explanation)

862
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,220
- I know that. - What is this?

863
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,890
- Unbelievable. - It's too much to the side.

864
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,760
We'll now begin the first mission.

865
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,100
(The first mission for the couples)

866
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,570
You must pull together as a team to answer the question.

867
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,900
(A Good Day to Be Single, Wait on the Answer)

868
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,970
- It's Wait On the Correct Answer. - I see.

869
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,240
Two couples will make one team.

870
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,910
Please form a team of four members.

871
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,710
- It'll be 4 on 4. - Yes, 4 on 4.

872
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,410
- Is KAI by himself? - What about me?

873
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,180
(Single)

874
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,010
The singleton may choose any team...

875
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,620
- to join. - No way!

876
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,050
- That's the best option. - You're lucky.

877
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,820
(Being single is the best today.)

878
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,250
- That's the best option. - Lucky him.

879
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,320
- This is a day to be single. - Darn.

880
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,720
One from each team will come forward...

881
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,690
- and play Palm Face Down or Up. - Let's play Palm Face Down or Up.

882
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,690
(They will play Palm Face Down or Up.)

883
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,830
Palm face down or up.

884
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,490
- Palm face down or up! - Palm face down or up!

885
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,900
(Se Chan and Seok Jin, and Ye Eun and Ah Young are on the same team.)

886
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,560
- Hey, we're... - We're a team?

887
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,030
- How will we... - Okay!

888
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,900
- We can manage. - We're a mixed bunch.

889
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,540
- Seok Jin, you lead us. - What are we to do?

890
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,840
- You stay out of it. - Were you trying to match us?

891
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,140
Okay!

892
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,170
(They already think they won.)

893
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,780
We'll give you a question with multiple possible answers.

894
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,750
You have to answer in order one by one.

895
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,150
- That's the quiz. - Okay.

896
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,050
If just one person gets it wrong, the other team gets to answer.

897
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,250
I said the singleton got an advantage.

898
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,860
The team including KAI who's the current singleton...

899
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,220
just has to get four answers right among five people.

900
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,360
- Okay. - That's great.

901
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,330
- You must give four answers. - That's a good perk.

902
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,060
(Join our team!)

903
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,600
That's four correct answers between five people.

904
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,470
Whenever they see fit, one person can yell "pass."

905
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,870
- Come on. - Join our team.

906
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,040
- It's a huge advantage. - It's a great perk.

907
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,440
(The incredible benefit exclusive to the team the singleton is a part of)

908
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,470
- We get to use the advantage. - KAI can now pick the team...

909
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,680
- he wants to join. - Joining us is more advantageous.

910
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,310
You need to win and then see how things go.

911
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,640
(The brainy in Running Man)

912
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,610
- This is the team. - KAI. We're young.

913
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,250
- KAI. We're young. - Choose youth.

914
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,620
- Youth... What? - Youth.

915
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,880
- Hey. - Stop it.

916
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,250
- Youth. - If you put it that way...

917
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,990
(Seok Sam didn't drink enough water from the fountain of youth.)

918
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,250
- I'm young. - Youth.

919
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,750
- I'm young. - We're in our 30s.

920
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,790
- We're young. - I paused.

921
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,760
- We're young. - We're in our 30s.

922
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
Youth.

923
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,390
- Okay, I'll join them. - Will you go over there?

924
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,160
- Hooray! - You'll join us?

925
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,860
(KAI chooses the young team.)

926
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,630
They didn't appeal for you to join.

927
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,500
This.. This is the team to join.

928
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,970
(Disappointed)

929
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,070
One pass from our team would make it a sweep.

930
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,840
(Team Brain missed the chance to pass.)

931
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,600
- Seriously. - Come on...

932
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,640
I joined them.

933
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:32,080
(What will happen to singleton KAI who made a bold decision?)

934
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,270
We must beat them now.

935
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,410
Members on the losing team get one more badge each.

936
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,650
- That's not good. - We must win at all cost.

937
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,320
(Today, having many badges in the final stage is a disadvantage.)

938
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,510
- We must win. - Decide which order you'll answer.

939
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,950
- Okay. Let's focus on Jae Seok. - Hey.

940
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,590
You start us off, and we'll follow.

941
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,950
(Brainy Jae Seok takes the lead.)

942
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,250
- Got it. - Okay.

943
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,590
(Team of 4: Jae Seok, Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Haha)

944
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,490
- Is this right? - Yes.

945
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,520
You start us off.

946
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,790
- Are you good at quizzes? - I'm not.

947
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,790
(Honest)

948
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,260
Then Seok Jin, you start us off.

949
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,390
(Smart Seok Sam will go first.)

950
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,960
- You go first. - Ah Young, you studied.

951
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,430
- You go second. - Can't KAI go next?

952
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,800
(Not confident)

953
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,800
- I'm really useless. - No.

954
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,070
Why? KAI, you're next.

955
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,230
- Me? - I'm really bad at this.

956
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,900
- You can always pass. - I'll rely on my confidence.

957
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,570
- Okay, do that. - It's all about confidence.

958
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,140
- It's all in the spirit. - KAI!

959
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,710
(KAI with the spirit will go second.)

960
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,370
- You have the spirit. - That's all I have.

961
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,640
- Good luck! - Good luck!

962
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:11,310
(Team of 5: Seok Jin, KAI, Ah Young, Ye Eun, Se Chan)

963
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,380
You'd better not pass. I'm last, and I'm useless.

964
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,010
- We really need to win. - Okay. I'm serious.

965
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,150
- We have to win. - Let's not joke around.

966
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,550
- We'll start with an easy question. - Okay!

967
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,150
(The first question is easy.)

968
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,620
- Okay! - Let's do this!

969
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,660
- Let's go! - Let's go!

970
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,660
Let's do this!

971
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,630
- Haha, that's too much. - What was that?

972
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,430
- Beep, beep! - What is that?

973
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,060
Let's do this!

974
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,070
- Beep, beep! - Stop it.

975
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,130
(Cheering)

976
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,740
Dream's dad is back.

977
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,770
(Dream is Haha's son.)

978
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,140
When one person answers, the next person must go right away.

979
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,970
- That's right. - If you stall,

980
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,680
- I'll mark you as incorrect. - We know the rules.

981
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,680
- Don't you worry. - You needn't explain the basics.

982
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,420
Leave the easy answers for those in the back.

983
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,320
- Don't give an easy answer. - Okay.

984
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,150
(They should let the students in the back say the easy answers.)

985
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,950
- There will be easier options. - Let us answer those.

986
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,950
- He looks down on us too much. - He's smart.

987
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,260
- Here's the first question. - I know that.

988
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,460
Concentrate.

989
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,490
Let's go!

990
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,560
Name the aespa members.

991
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,960
Let me answer! WINTER.

992
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,660
- NINGNING. - KARINA.

993
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,630
- Let me answer! - Darn you.

994
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,630
(Wrong)

995
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,630
KARINA.

996
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,970
- Let me answer! - Okay.

997
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,670
(He was too late.)

998
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,700
- Let me answer! WINTER. - GISELLE.

999
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,370
- KARINA. - NINGNING.

1000
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,240
(Wrong)

1001
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,870
- Let me answer! - Darn it.

1002
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,570
(Ye Eun was late even though all the answers were revealed.)

1003
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,670
- What are you doing? - What...

1004
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,280
Let me answer! GISELLE!

1005
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,980
- NINGNING. - KARINA.

1006
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,750
- WINTER! - Okay!

1007
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,280
(Correct)

1008
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,580
Wait. Hey, Ye Eun!

1009
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,250
- Hey, Ye Eun! - That was terrible.

1010
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,620
- Ye Eun! - We gave it to you.

1011
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,250
- You should've gotten this. - I...

1012
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,150
- He said GISELLE. - What was that?

1013
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,690
(Ddochi couldn't say the answer.)

1014
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,890
What was that, French Fry?

1015
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,490
We have one pass.

1016
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,890
- You can say "pass." - I only thought of KARINA.

1017
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,790
(She also forgot that she could pass.)

1018
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,860
- That's why you got flustered. - Say "pass."

1019
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,700
Excuse me.

1020
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,870
- You should know the answer. - KARINA...

1021
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,900
(Bickering)

1022
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,230
- KARINA's my relative. - NINGNING.

1023
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,800
- Why fight when you won? - We're related.

1024
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,500
- Hey! - You always talk about KARINA.

1025
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,670
How can you not know GISELLE?

1026
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,370
(They won, and they still want to squash their opponents.)

1027
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,770
You always talk about KARINA.

1028
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,280
Why fight when you won?

1029
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,210
(He doesn't understand.)

1030
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,710
- Yes, why... - What?

1031
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,780
GISELLE, NINGNING, KARINA, WINTER.

1032
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,450
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1033
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,850
(Proud)

1034
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,880
- KAI. You chose the wrong team. - What?

1035
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,220
- You chose poorly. - Totally.

1036
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,750
- Wait. Until it's over... - Okay.

1037
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,890
- It's not over until it's over. - Okay.

1038
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,490
- We have a pass. - Ye Eun!

1039
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,190
- Switch with Se Chan. - Yes.

1040
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,760
This won't work. Goodness.

1041
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,660
(French Fry was demoted in the end.)

1042
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
I knew it.

1043
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,430
- We had it in the bag. - I see an operation took place.

1044
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,470
- Okay. - Let's go.

1045
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,070
- We had it. - You used a scalpel.

1046
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,700
- Sorry. - KARINA!

1047
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,600
- Be quiet. - KARINA!

1048
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,910
(Mr. Fog Horn is on a high.)

1049
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,240
- Stop it. - Beep, beep!

1050
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,640
- That's... - It's too much!

1051
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,640
- He mentions KARINA all the time. - Yes.

1052
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:24,510
(I love KARINA.)

1053
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,210
- RINA. - And he forgot.

1054
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,550
This time, you don't answer separately.

1055
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,250
You each say one syllable to form a Chinese idiom.

1056
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,680
(It's a four-character idiom quiz...)

1057
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,020
(where each person guesses one character at a time.)

1058
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,520
- Sound good! - What?

1059
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,490
A four-syllable Chinese idiom!

1060
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,160
Swap seats with me. I'll go last.

1061
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,630
- I'm good at that. - KAI, you come here.

1062
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,960
- Are you good at this? - I'm good at this.

1063
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,260
- Chinese idioms. - Okay.

1064
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,530
(Chinese Character Girl will go second.)

1065
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,400
- Okay, let's have a go. - We have a pass if it's too hard.

1066
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,430
- Okay. - Listen to what they say.

1067
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,070
- Pass if it's too hard. - Memorize their answers.

1068
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,970
(The second question is revealed.)

1069
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,370
- Okay. - Here's the question.

1070
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,170
- Here goes. - It's hard when it's strung out.

1071
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,470
What Chinese idiom means life's fortunes and misfortunes...

1072
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,810
are ever-changing and hard to predict?

1073
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,310
- Life's fortunes and misfortunes... - Predicting life's fortunes...

1074
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,220
Seok Jin, change. Life.

1075
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,490
(They can't think of anything based on the explanation.)

1076
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,060
The direct translation means "a frontier man's horse."

1077
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,790
- A horse. - Let me answer!

1078
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,090
A horse.

1079
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,390
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1080
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,560
(Seok Jin was faster!)

1081
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,460
- Sae! - Ong!

1082
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,560
- Ji! - Ma!

1083
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,800
Okay!

1084
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,060
(Correct!)

1085
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,170
- Sae! - Ong!

1086
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,530
- Ji! - Ma!

1087
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:20,270
(They got it in one go!)

1088
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,270
- Yes! - That was it!

1089
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,040
- That was it. - No way!

1090
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,680
(The team of 4 missed the 4-character idiom question.)

1091
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
- Ah Young... - I did it!

1092
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,380
- It's okay. - She said "chi."

1093
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,080
(Pathetic)

1094
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,410
- Let's go. - It's okay.

1095
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,510
- Okay! - Didn't I do well?

1096
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,680
(Excited)

1097
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,320
- Well done. - We're on a roll.

1098
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,550
- Nice one. - We're on a roll.

1099
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,520
- We're on the up and up. - Nice!

1100
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,920
(They caught up with them right away!)

1101
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,020
- We just have to go up. - My gosh.

1102
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:42,290
(Team of 4: 1, Team of 5: 1)

1103
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,490
Ah Young, you knew that idiom?

1104
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,660
- Yes. - That's awesome.

1105
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,960
- You're a genius. - Isn't that cool?

1106
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,030
- Ji Hyo. - Let's keep going.

1107
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,330
(Ji Hyo goes first.)

1108
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,630
- I'll go last. - Ye Eun.

1109
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,360
- Stay there. - Give us an easy one.

1110
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:50,270
(To the director)

1111
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,070
No, Big Sis... I called her "Big Sis."

1112
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,540
Give us a tough one. I'm really sorry.

1113
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,900
(The director is younger than him, but he called her Big Sis.)

1114
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,970
- Who are you trying to put down? - Come on.

1115
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,910
Director. Give us a tough question.

1116
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,310
Calling her "Big Sis"...

1117
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,640
You each have to say a word.

1118
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,910
(The third question)

1119
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,850
- Listen. - A word.

1120
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,250
- Pass if you're stuck. - Just say something.

1121
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,980
(Team of 5 hasn't used a pass yet.)

1122
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,420
- Pass if you're stuck. - But I can't.

1123
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,050
- You can pass. - Pass if you're stuck.

1124
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,850
- You can't think of it, though. - Right.

1125
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,690
Say an English word beginning with the letter A.

1126
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,960
- Let me answer! - Apple.

1127
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,590
- Pass. - Pass.

1128
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,160
(Wrong)

1129
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:19,530
Hey! I was going to say "apple."

1130
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,060
(They used two passes and lost their chance!)

1131
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,600
- America! - Come on!

1132
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,830
(The opponents have the chance.)

1133
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,330
Why are there so many?

1134
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,240
- What else is there? - America.

1135
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,270
Okay, America.

1136
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,770
Let me answer! America.

1137
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,910
Apartment.

1138
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,910
Appointment.
Apple!

1139
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,410
(Correct)

1140
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,550
(Angry)

1141
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,450
Just a moment.

1142
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,650
- Come on! - Seriously.

1143
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,950
This is on you!

1144
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,550
- Why? - You said "apple."

1145
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,650
The easier answers...

1146
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,320
- were ours. - Seok Jin.

1147
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,220
Listen, Seok Jin. The easy one...

1148
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,660
- The A word I know... - You!

1149
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,790
- Why... - Why is this Se Chan's fault?

1150
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,060
The A words...

1151
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,600
We said we'd skip the easy ones.

1152
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,570
(The girl who has a crush on him is the only one who is on his side.)

1153
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,960
Hey, "apple"...

1154
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,270
- The A words... - He did fine.

1155
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,270
What's wrong with "apple?"

1156
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,370
- Why did you say "apple?" - Right.

1157
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,270
(Infuriated)

1158
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,710
"Apple" starts with the letter A.

1159
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,510
(He thinks it's unfair.)

1160
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,710
- Leave the easy ones for them! - Yes!

1161
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,380
- There are many... - You should've skipped it.

1162
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,940
"Apartment!"

1163
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,150
There are so many.

1164
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,650
"Awesome."

1165
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,880
- "Awesome." - "Avoid."

1166
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,320
- You messed up. - "Avoid."

1167
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,320
- "Avoid." To get away from. - My gosh.

1168
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,050
But you... I'm disappointed you weren't ready to go next.

1169
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,790
- I prepared to say "apple." - Me too.

1170
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,860
(Super brazen)

1171
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,660
We all thought of "apple."

1172
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,890
Ye Eun, you go to the front. Show us.

1173
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,400
(They unnecessarily switch seats again.)

1174
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,460
- You go first. - And you...

1175
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,530
- Let me go to the back. - This is so funny.

1176
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,000
(Team of 4: 2, Team of 5: 1)

1177
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,930
Sit over there.

1178
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,330
- Are you ready? - "Avoid."

1179
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,170
- Here's the next question. - Okay.

1180
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,810
Say an English word starting with C.

1181
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,870
- C? - Let me answer!

1182
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,280
- Center. - We started right away?

1183
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,580
(He zoned out and lost.)

1184
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,340
- Go! - Let me answer!

1185
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,250
- Go! - Let me answer! Center.

1186
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,350
(Saying the answer right away)

1187
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,650
- It's you. - Pass!

1188
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,250
- Con... - What's going on?

1189
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,050
- Center. - It's you.

1190
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,650
- Pass. - What's going on?

1191
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,790
(He passed too late too.)

1192
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,150
- Now think. - Let me answer!

1193
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,190
- Let me answer! - Let me answer! Center.

1194
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,790
- Converse. - Club.

1195
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,790
Cycle.

1196
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,330
(Correct)

1197
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,460
Cycle.

1198
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,270
- What? - This is on you.

1199
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,600
This is on you.

1200
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,240
- Why is it on me? - It is.

1201
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,410
(Pass Man blames Se Chan again.)

1202
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,370
- Hey! - He's...

1203
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,070
- You're just... - KAI.

1204
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,610
- Why is this... - KAI, you're so mean.

1205
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,940
Hey! "Control!"

1206
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,480
C, O... That's "control," punks!

1207
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,650
(He feels so wronged that he can't control his face.)

1208
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,150
How did you get stuck on the second word?

1209
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,780
- Seok Jin! - It wasn't me.

1210
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,690
- C words are common! "Control!" - This is Se Chan's fault!

1211
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,050
- It's on him. - They're so terrible.

1212
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,620
I passed. I said "pass."

1213
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,360
- Who was next, then? - It was you next.

1214
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,630
- He didn't pass with confidence. - "Pass!"

1215
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,900
What are you even doing?

1216
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,860
- This team's a mess. - Oh, dear.

1217
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,170
(The 5 misfits' teamwork is shattered.)

1218
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,330
We're an assorted bunch of misfits.

1219
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,140
- What now? - Ah Young should go first.

1220
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:42,210
(Team of 4: 3, Team of 5: 1)

1221
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,500
- Ah Young. - Help us out.

1222
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,070
- Then... - Ye Eun, come here.

1223
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,070
- Then... - This is infuriating.

1224
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,610
(They'll decide the order for each other.)

1225
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,380
Let's have the other team set out your...

1226
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,980
- Arrange our order? - We'll do that.

1227
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,750
- Ji Hyo at the front. - Okay.

1228
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,880
- Then Haha. - Okay.

1229
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,350
Then Jong Kook and Jae Seok.

1230
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,550
(They make the Empty Head Siblings go first.)

1231
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,880
- At the end? - That's fine.

1232
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,780
- It won't change anything. - What about our order?

1233
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,950
Your team...

1234
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,850
- Ah Young, Se Chan. - Ah Young, Ssaebssaeb.

1235
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,360
- "Ssaebssaeb." - Ssaebssaeb.

1236
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,890
- And then... - And then Ye Eun.

1237
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,230
- Ye Eun, KAI, Seok Sam. - KAI, Seok Jin.

1238
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,560
This is the Running Man order.

1239
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,230
That's the order of smarts. You need to think of that.

1240
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,200
(Trying to think positively)

1241
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,370
- Is this a good thing? - No, it's not.

1242
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,140
- It's not a good thing. - Okay.

1243
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,240
- Actually... - I'll show them.

1244
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,370
I wasn't sure if I should put KAI third or fourth.

1245
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,610
(He thought about putting KAI in the front too.)

1246
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,440
It's our last shot.

1247
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,780
KAI's performance is... Compared to what I expected...

1248
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,810
(KAI used two passes.)

1249
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,450
He's surprisingly good at messing it up for us.

1250
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,280
(Team of 5 is 2 points behind.)

1251
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,780
He's problematic.

1252
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,350
(The next question is revealed.)

1253
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,320
- What spirit. - My gosh.

1254
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,850
- It's all about spirit. - Say a proverb...

1255
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,950
that mentions food.

1256
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,050
- Let me answer! - Let me answer.

1257
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,120
- Rice cake... - I know one.

1258
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,060
Let me answer! Eating rice cakes lying down.

1259
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,060
One more rice cake for an enemy.

1260
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,660
- Smaller chilies are hotter. - Pass!

1261
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,860
Eat a pheasant and its egg!

1262
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,500
(Correct)

1263
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,600
Seok Jin, he passed again!

1264
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,700
- Well done. - He passed!

1265
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,800
(He used 3 passes.)

1266
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,900
- You passed? - So what?

1267
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,500
- It's okay. You did well. - It worked.

1268
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,710
- You can't play! - It worked, didn't it?

1269
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,670
- KAI doesn't play! - The timing was nice.

1270
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,710
He doesn't play.

1271
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,210
(He totally relied on passes.)

1272
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,780
- You passed! - Why?

1273
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,110
- The timing was nice. - You passed again?

1274
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,450
I handed it over to them.

1275
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,580
(Shameless)

1276
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,880
- You did well. - Are you an X-Man?

1277
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,650
- It worked out. - Is he an X-Man?

1278
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,520
(Confused)

1279
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,950
- You passed it nicely. - Is he an X-Man?

1280
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,750
You got to do that because he joined your team.

1281
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,390
- Yes. - He has the energy.

1282
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,590
- Yes. - It's all about that.

1283
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,120
If KAI does this well,

1284
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,690
- not anyone can pass this well. - Seriously.

1285
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,760
- Not everyone can say "Pass." - For real. It's hard to say it.

1286
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,960
Hearing this is persuasive.

1287
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,260
- It was nice timing. - It was.

1288
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,330
(They suddenly say it was good that he used passes.)

1289
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,630
- "Pass." - And Seok Jin was able to...

1290
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,030
- continue the game behind him. - That's right.

1291
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,230
He passed on his turn so refreshingly.

1292
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,040
- I trusted you, Seok Jin. - Hey, let's say a cheer.

1293
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,100
- Okay. Let's go. - All right?

1294
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:22,040
(It's currently 3 to 2.)

1295
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,440
- We did really well. - It's fine. We can give them one.

1296
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:27,210
(If Team of 5 can't get it right again, they'll lose!)

1297
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,140
- Let's go! - Let's do this!

1298
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,340
- Let's go. - Let's just take it easy.

1299
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,350
Sing a segment from a song...

1300
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,010
- that has a season in it. - Raise your hand!

1301
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,750
- Oh, no. - Go!

1302
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,050
- Hurry up! Say, "Let me answer!" - Let me answer.

1303
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,520
Tree, tree

1304
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,790
(A children's song)

1305
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,920
- A winter tree - Aren't we saying the title?

1306
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,090
A sad song like the winter rain

1307
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,890
("Winter Rain")

1308
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,290
Yell out loud.

1309
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,430
Let me answer!

1310
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,030
(Time is over.)

1311
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,100
- I sang an easy one on purpose. - A sad song like the winter rain

1312
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,430
Let me answer!

1313
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,670
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

1314
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,870
- I sang an easy one on purpose. - A sad song like the winter rain

1315
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,040
(Stealing Jong Kook's answer)

1316
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,440
- The four of us? - As the spring wind blows

1317
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,770
- That's it. - Again, at this beach

1318
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,840
- No! - That didn't include a season.

1319
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,440
(Wrong)

1320
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,210
- Let me answer. - Why?

1321
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,440
- Let me answer. - Why?

1322
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,150
Again... No.

1323
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,650
- Go! - Why did you do that?

1324
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,950
- Just do the one you sang earlier! - A sad song

1325
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,650
(Jae Seok made a mistake.)

1326
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,050
Like the winter rain

1327
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,820
(Seok Jin has a chance!)

1328
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,420
- Go! - Why did you do that?

1329
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,720
- Just do the one you sang earlier! - A sad song like the winter rain

1330
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,560
- As the spring wind blows - Just sing an easy one.

1331
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,920
- What? - Spring, spring, spring is here

1332
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,260
(Hesitant)

1333
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,960
- Just pass. - As the spring wind blows

1334
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,390
(It's the same song.)

1335
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,160
- He already sang that one. - Wrong.

1336
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,590
(Wrong)

1337
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,400
- Let me answer. - Just pass!

1338
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,960
- I'm sorry. - Gosh, seriously.

1339
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,900
(Jae Seok has a chance again.)

1340
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,100
- I'm really... - What?
- Let me answer. - Just pass!

1341
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
I'm sorry.

1342
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,840
- Like the winter rain - What?

1343
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,800
(It's mine.)

1344
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,440
It's so...

1345
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,040
The sky is open to us

1346
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,170
- That doesn't have a season! - That's wrong!

1347
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,840
(Wrong)

1348
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,180
- That's not right. - Let me answer.

1349
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,310
(This is our chance!)

1350
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,340
- That doesn't have a season! - That's wrong!

1351
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,780
- Let me answer. - Just stay here.

1352
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,280
A sad song like the winter rain

1353
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,880
As the spring wind blows

1354
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,780
- Spring, spring, spring is here - Oh, in the lyrics?

1355
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,290
- Do you love spring so much, fools? - That's it.

1356
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,420
Did we do it?

1357
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,650
(Correct)

1358
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,250
- There are so many. - Yes, there are songs about...

1359
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,490
spring, summer, and fall.

1360
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,920
- When fall comes - You're right.

1361
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,160
- There's one for every season. - Spring, summer, fall, winter

1362
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,330
I suddenly couldn't think of any.

1363
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,360
- Why did you do that, Jae Seok? - I couldn't think of a song.

1364
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,330
You sang that one about the tree earlier.

1365
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,670
- I couldn't remember that one. - You sang "Tree, tree."

1366
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,670
- Still, we did it. - We only have one left!

1367
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,300
(They're tied 3 to 3!)

1368
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,200
- Only one left. - Yes!

1369
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,910
(The last question will decide the winner.)

1370
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,510
My gosh. Seriously.

1371
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,210
- Let's win, no matter what. - Let's go!

1372
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:06,710
(The last question is revealed!)

1373
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,640
- Gosh, we are... - Let's go!

1374
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,780
- We can win. - What do we do?

1375
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,540
(Serious)

1376
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,980
We can win.

1377
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,110
- Let's do this with confidence. - Yes, with confidence.

1378
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,580
- KAI, just pass if you don't know. - Okay.

1379
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,020
This time, you'll each give an answer.

1380
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,590
Say a proverb that has the name of a place in it.

1381
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,750
- The name of a place? - Let me answer.

1382
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,790
- Let me answer. - The name of a place.

1383
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,820
Pass!

1384
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,960
- My goodness. - Oh, my.

1385
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,990
Pass!

1386
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,190
(He coolly passes from the get-go.)

1387
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,090
- My goodness. - Oh, my.

1388
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,600
What? The name of a place?

1389
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,060
(The Pass Man just keeps on going.)

1390
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,070
Let me answer.

1391
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,470
Get slapped in Jongno...

1392
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,270
and vent at the Han River.

1393
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,510
Following a friend to Gangnam.

1394
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,740
(Time over. It's wrong.)

1395
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,770
- You were too late. - Let me answer.

1396
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,040
- Let me answer. - They already said two.

1397
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,740
- Pass. - Following a friend to Gangnam.

1398
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,350
- Get slapped in Jongno. - Oh, are you going to say that one?

1399
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,650
- No. - That's not right.

1400
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,950
You can't just get slapped.

1401
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,050
You can't just get slapped.

1402
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,420
- What did you do? - I don't know.

1403
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,890
- Hang on. - I know this one.

1404
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,190
Cutting through the Jeolla and Gyeongsang Provinces...

1405
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,190
(Cutting through the Jeolla and Gyeongsang Provinces...)

1406
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,530
What was this?

1407
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,400
Cutting through the Jeolla and Gyeongsang Provinces.

1408
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,960
- That's the song, "Hwagae Market." - Oh, "Hwagae Market."

1409
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,000
(My gosh)

1410
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,570
That's not a proverb.

1411
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,570
(Flabbergasted)

1412
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,370
- We'll give you a hint. - "Horses to Jeju Island."

1413
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,910
(A hint for the members who are struggling)

1414
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,380
There's a proverb with Mr. Kim in it.

1415
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,210
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1416
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,310
Looking for Mr. Kim in Seoul.

1417
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,310
Looking for Mr. Kim in Seoul.

1418
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,220
Following a friend to Gangnam.

1419
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,580
Get slapped in Jongno.

1420
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,990
- Darn you. - Let me answer!

1421
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,150
- Come on, Jae Seok! - What?

1422
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,320
(The opponent has a chance.)

1423
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,360
Why are you doing that?

1424
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,060
- Let me answer! - My gosh!

1425
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,230
- Following a friend to Gangnam. - There's another one!

1426
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,060
Get slapped in Jongno and vent at the Han River.

1427
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,960
- Pass. - Send horses to Jeju,

1428
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,160
and send people to Hanyang.

1429
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,260
Okay.

1430
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,770
(They will win as long as Se Chan can answer correctly!)

1431
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,370
- Mung bean pancake. - Wrong.

1432
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,600
What? Se Chan.

1433
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,100
- Mung bean pancake. - Wrong.

1434
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,040
(Mung bean pancakes?)

1435
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,640
What? Se Chan.

1436
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,970
- Mung bean pancakes are... - Looking for...

1437
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,440
(That's ridiculous.)

1438
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,680
(Ssaebssaeb ruined it when they were so close to winning.)

1439
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,740
- It was funny, though. - Following a friend...

1440
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,980
- What? Se Chan. - Okay, we can do this.

1441
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,910
(It's a golden opportunity for Team of 4.)

1442
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,110
- Let me answer! - Mung bean pancakes are...

1443
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,410
(The game ends if they get this correct.)

1444
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,250
- Okay, we can do this. - Let me answer!

1445
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,920
Looking for Mr. Kim in Seoul.

1446
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,580
Following a friend to Gangnam.

1447
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,590
Send horses to Jeju, and send people to Hanyang.

1448
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:03,430
Get slapped in Jongno and vent...

1449
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,530
at the Han River.

1450
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,760
(Correct)

1451
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,530
- Okay! - Okay!

1452
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,560
Nice.

1453
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,800
- Gosh, why can't you... - Here it comes.

1454
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,070
(Angry)

1455
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,600
- Why can't you guys do this right? - Gosh, seriously!

1456
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,140
- Why did you say mung bean pancake? - What was that about?

1457
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,170
- Did you want to eat that? - You could've just said...

1458
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,170
- "Looking for Mr. Kim in Seoul." - This wasn't about...
saying what you want to eat.

1459
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,370
- My goodness. - Why did I say that?

1460
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,410
(Ssaebssaeb let them win by making a mistake.)

1461
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,710
- This was the worst. - Why did you say mung bean pancake?

1462
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,110
But there aren't that many proverbs.

1463
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,340
- You know? - That was hard.

1464
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:27,280
(Badges)

1465
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,110
To the losing team with 5 members, we'll give you each 1 badge.

1466
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,950
- They're not a match for us. - They never stood a chance.

1467
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,420
- Let's play another game. - All right.

1468
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,220
- We'll move to the next location. - Okay.

1469
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,190
There's another benefit for the singleton.

1470
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,190
Being a singleton is awesome today.

1471
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:38,630
(What kind of benefit will KAI have?)

1472
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,860
- It's nice. - That sounds so nice.

1473
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,730
- It's totally awesome. - That sounds so nice.

1474
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,230
Do we walk around like this?

1475
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,800
(They're going to walk around in the current outfit.)

1476
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,230
But the team outfits are...

1477
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,130
I wore a pretty outfit today.

1478
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,470
So, just to let you know, we have a limousine...

1479
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,170
- and a compact car over there. - Gosh, that's an actual limousine.

1480
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,140
We have a limousine and a compact car over there.

1481
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,110
(It's a real limousine.)

1482
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,240
The singleton gets to move...

1483
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:56,180
(It's a real limousine for KAI, the singleton.)

1484
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,050
to the next location in a luxury limousine.

1485
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,180
- My gosh. - Goodness, it's so long.

1486
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:01,780
(You can't see the end of the long, luxurious white car.)

1487
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,450
Gosh, that sounds so nice.

1488
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,120
I told you. It's different.

1489
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,090
- Gosh, it's real. - It's a limousine!

1490
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,890
The rest of you will get into groups of two pairs each...

1491
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,320
(And the couples...)

1492
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,820
and drive yourselves in the compact cars.

1493
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,430
(get compact cars that are too practical.)

1494
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,860
Oh, these two?

1495
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,860
- Gosh, really? - How will we...

1496
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,160
My goodness. This is...

1497
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,800
(They got them compact cars so that they can get closer.)

1498
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,300
- Gosh, no way. - But...

1499
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,130
You have to turn the lever to roll down the window.

1500
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,230
(You can rarely see windows that roll down with a crank handle.)

1501
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,770
Since the limousine seems too big for just one person to ride in,

1502
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,870
(Even the staff members were surprised by the limousine.)

1503
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,940
- So? - KAI will get...

1504
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,310
(KAI will get a chance to choose his plus 1.)

1505
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,370
- a chance to choose. - Two people.

1506
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,440
Me. KAI.

1507
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,840
- KAI will get a chance to choose. - Two people.

1508
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,970
Me. KAI, I'm your fan.

1509
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,110
You can go and take a look first,

1510
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:30,010
(The person chosen by KAI can get in the limousine with him.)

1511
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,810
- and you can make your choice. - Sounds good.

1512
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,080
Just choose Ye Eun and Ah Young.

1513
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,550
Let's go together. Yes.

1514
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,950
- KAI, - You answered yourself.

1515
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,750
(Jae Seok wants to join him.)

1516
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,220
- I'm your fan. - Leave the locust out.

1517
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,590
- KAI, you have great spirit. - Jae Seok.

1518
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,090
We all seem like...

1519
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,390
- KAI is the best one among EXO. - We're like...

1520
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,760
- Hey, leave the locust out. - weird fans.

1521
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,290
- I'll have to see. - Let's go and see first.

1522
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,930
- I'll be cool-headed. - Let's just go and see.

1523
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:44,960
Hey, this is...

1524
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,760
- Don't be swayed by him. - As long as you go...

1525
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,800
Hey, leave the locust out.

1526
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,230
(He even escorts him.)

1527
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,830
Gosh, it's huge.

1528
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,500
(Among people who want to accompany him, who will he choose?)

1529
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,140
No way.

1530
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,200
You should get in, KAI.

1531
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,340
- I've never been in one. - My gosh!

1532
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,340
- I've never been in a limousine. - Gosh, it's so long.

1533
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,280
- Haven't you? - No, I haven't.

1534
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,980
- Okay, you can ride one next time. - No.

1535
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,310
- Jae Seok, I want to ride it. - You can ride it some other time.

1536
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,750
KAI, I like... I like KAI.

1537
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,120
- Is that right? - Yes.

1538
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,520
- I like KAI. - So, right now,

1539
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,150
we're shooting. I'm sorry.

1540
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:15,120
(As his wild fans are being told to calm down...)

1541
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,060
(This is crazy!)

1542
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,160
- Gosh, a limousine! - My gosh!

1543
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:22,300
(The pinnacle of luxury that they've only seen in movies)

1544
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
This is awesome.

1545
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,070
You... I want to ride in it.

1546
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,740
(From non-alcoholic champagne to finger food)

1547
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,700
This is so nice. They have snacks in here.

1548
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,040
This is so nice.

1549
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,840
I told you. This is totally different.

1550
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,670
(The singleton can enjoy all of this.)

1551
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,010
Jae Seok, this is awesome. It's nice.

1552
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,440
They have champagne in here too.

1553
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,810
- I know, right? - They have champagne too.

1554
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:40,550
(Who is the lucky one chosen by KAI?)

1555
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,280
- He says there's champagne too. - Oh, there's champagne in there?

1556
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,220
- Is it just 1 person? - Just 1 person?

1557
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,320
- Ye Eun. - You should choose Ye Eun...

1558
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,450
- and be totally uncomfortable. - Ye Eun should go.

1559
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,250
- Just the two of us? I love it. - Oh, really?

1560
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:47,390
(Candidate 1: French Fry who claims to be a fan)

1561
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,460
- Wouldn't it be awkward? - It would be.

1562
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,390
- I hope he chooses Ah Young. - Then, why would you go?

1563
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,990
(No)

1564
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,490
- Ah Young, you should go. - No.

1565
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,960
(Candidate 2: Ok Soon in Running Man)

1566
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,830
- I really hope he chooses Ah Young. - No, I think it would be awkward.

1567
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,860
Actually, if Ah Young goes in the limousine right now,

1568
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,200
it would infuriate Ye Eun the most.

1569
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,370
And Ye Eun can drive.

1570
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,700
Ye Eun will drive?

1571
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,700
(She switches jobs and becomes a limousine driver.)

1572
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,400
- And Ye Eun can drive. - No.

1573
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,800
- Ye Eun will drive? - By herself?

1574
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,810
- She likes it. - That's not bad.

1575
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,170
- Ye Eun can drive. - That would be funny if you drove.

1576
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,170
(Laughing)

1577
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,980
That sounds good.

1578
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,310
- I like it. - All right. Yes.

1579
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,550
- Ah Young, should we go together? - Really?

1580
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,750
- Ah Young, should we go together? - Really?

1581
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:17,120
(Spirit Man chose Ah Young over his passionate fan.)

1582
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,050
- Ye Eun! - Look at Ye Eun.

1583
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,850
- Ye Eun is furious. - All right, get in.

1584
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,250
I can't believe I get to enjoy such a luxury.

1585
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,420
- Nice one! Okay! - No way!

1586
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,660
(Laughing)

1587
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,760
- EXO... - You're literally unbelievable.

1588
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,490
- No way! - By the way, Ah Young.

1589
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,260
You're literally unbelievable.

1590
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,300
- You are... - Whenever I come on Running Man,

1591
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,430
- You're the queen of scandals. - I become Ok Soon.

1592
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,030
And when you're next to Ye Eun,

1593
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,670
you're the best at making her flip out with anger.

1594
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,540
And when Ah Young stands next to Ye Eun,

1595
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,740
(Whenever Ah Young is on the show, a strange love triangle is made.)

1596
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,040
- she really stands out. - That's right.

1597
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,310
- That's true. - Just always stick next to her.

1598
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,740
Ye Eun, I'll see you later.

1599
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,780
Ye Eun, I'll see you later.

1600
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,980
- Have fun. - Look at her face.

1601
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,120
Isn't SUHO the best among EXO?

1602
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,890
(The romantic rivalry...)

1603
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,680
- Gosh, this is awesome! - Have fun.

1604
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,620
- This is amazing! - Isn't it great? It's so awesome.

1605
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,890
(begins again.)

1606
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,590
- Gosh, thank you for giving me... - Sure.

1607
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,790
- Then, Ye Eun. - Let's go.

1608
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,360
You can drive this car.

1609
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,290
- Will you let her drive? - Don't do that.

1610
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,530
(What will happen to the three of them?)

1611
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,800
- Will I drive? Will you? - It's fine.

1612
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,630
- My goodness. - Come on.

1613
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,830
My gosh.

1614
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:06,070
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook get in the compact car.)

1615
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,600
The compact car is the way to go. This is comfortable.

1616
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,170
(It's filled with his muscular body.)

1617
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,370
- Compact cars are nice. - They're easy to drive.

1618
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,840
Hang on. Where's the car key?

1619
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,640
- Is this it? What's going on? - No, you have to...

1620
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,910
You have to take it out. Take it out like a sword.

1621
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,650
- Like that. - Oh, I got it.

1622
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,780
- Keys are electronic these days. - Right.

1623
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,180
(From the windows to the key, everything is manual.)

1624
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,120
Gosh, compact cars are nice.

1625
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,090
All right. There's a person coming. Beep!

1626
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,920
(A high-toned sensor alarm is included.)

1627
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:26,120
Compact cars have their own charm as you drive them.

1628
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,760
- Right. They're easy to park, - When I was young,

1629
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,660
(Team Compact Car sets off while trying to think positively.)

1630
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,230
- and you don't spend a lot on gas. - they were all like this.

1631
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,800
- Okay, let's get going. - My gosh. This is so...

1632
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,360
Ji Ye Eun, you were rejected.

1633
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,830
(Another Team Compact)

1634
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,830
- Ye Eun. - Yes?

1635
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,130
You were rejected.

1636
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,730
I'm used to being rejected.

1637
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,400
But Ye Eun, do you want me to be honest?

1638
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,670
You're too good for him.

1639
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,670
Don't lie to me!

1640
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,880
(She feels rather happy.)

1641
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,910
- You're the most annoying, Se Chan. - For real.

1642
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,440
- Seok Jin, be honest. - What?

1643
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,380
- Okay. - Is KAI too good for her?

1644
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,250
- Or... Who is it again? - Ye Eun is too good for him!

1645
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,850
- See? - Oh, you're lying.

1646
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,990
You're right.

1647
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,650
(Laughing)

1648
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,160
- It was a lie. - How did you know I was lying?

1649
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,160
(They tease her as soon as she gets in.)

1650
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,820
- How did you know? - You don't miss a hint.

1651
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,460
- Ye Eun. - Yes?

1652
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,660
It was all over your face which isn't ideal.

1653
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,460
- I'm fine. - Here's what I think.

1654
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,230
He saw you stuffing your face with snacks.

1655
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,870
I think that put him off.

1656
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:15,170
(He picks at the wounds of her heartbreak twice in a row.)

1657
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,770
- Is that so? - That's not it.

1658
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,170
- I won't eat in front of him. - Here's what I think, Ye Eun.

1659
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,170
I won't eat.

1660
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,280
- If you like someone, - Yes?

1661
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,740
- you can't express your feelings. - Exactly. That's how it is.

1662
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,680
(He finally comforts her properly.)

1663
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,280
- We're all like that. - You're embarrassed.

1664
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,080
That's normal. Who would you choose...

1665
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,150
between KAI and Se Chan?

1666
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,220
(It puts her at ease.)

1667
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,450
- Se Chan. - Of course.

1668
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,550
You're right.

1669
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,720
If I had to choose between KARINA and Ye Eun,

1670
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,290
I'd choose KARINA.

1671
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,960
You're so annoying.

1672
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,660
(Ddochi got fooled again.)

1673
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,130
- I hate you. - I want to meet her, that's all.

1674
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,560
- That's all. - Ye Eun.

1675
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,800
That means I don't like you as much.

1676
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,630
Same here. I'd choose KAI.

1677
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,430
But you were rejected!

1678
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,970
He can be so evil.

1679
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:51,070
(While they're bickering instead of flirting)

1680
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,270
- Se Chan. - What?

1681
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,940
- You're the worst. - Whatever.

1682
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,680
- No way. - This is so nice.

1683
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,280
(Spirit Man and Ok Soon's limousine)

1684
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,840
This is amazing.

1685
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,910
Who knew I'd get to experience this kind of luxury?

1686
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:57,850
This...

1687
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,280
(The belt is tight.)

1688
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,320
- Seat belts, please. - The seat belt...

1689
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,620
- How... Do I pull gently? - Se Chan got mine for me.

1690
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,650
Could you help me with my seat belt?

1691
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:05,790
(She suddenly thinks about her old crush.)

1692
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,560
I finally got it.

1693
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,330
(She pulled the belt out by herself.)

1694
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,430
Where's the buckle receiver?

1695
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,730
(She can't buckle her seatbelt.)

1696
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,460
Hold on.

1697
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,100
This can be pulled out. Allow me.

1698
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:24,410
(His manners make her forget about her old crush.)

1699
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,080
- I'm a bit nervous. - Really?

1700
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,510
- Isn't this amazing? - It's so good.

1701
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,580
- Tell me about it. - I haven't been in one before.

1702
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,780
I can't reach anything with the seat belt on.

1703
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,720
- Right? - We should. Here you go.

1704
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:36,350
(They try the non-alcoholic champagne first.)

1705
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,950
Could you... Good.

1706
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,890
No way.

1707
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,820
(Popping)

1708
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,230
(Cheering)

1709
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,930
It's non-alcoholic, but...

1710
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:47,330
(She suddenly changes her voice as if she's on a dating show.)

1711
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,460
This is great.

1712
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,170
Thank you.

1713
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,670
Goodness.

1714
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,700
This isn't easy to drink.

1715
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,170
- This... - Aren't we being dramatic?

1716
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,870
- I know. - But that's what they want from us.

1717
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,610
I can't make it look as good as they do in the movies.

1718
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:02,540
(They're saying nonsense because they feel awkward.)

1719
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,480
- Let me pour you a glass. - Sure.

1720
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,480
KAI, here you go.

1721
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,020
- Is that enough? - Sure.

1722
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,620
I'll put this in here. Hold on.

1723
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,690
- Can you reach it? - I can.

1724
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,490
I hope we get along.

1725
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,230
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1726
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,470
Gosh, it's a beverage. It's like soda.

1727
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,770
(Nonsense)

1728
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,770
(They keep drinking.)

1729
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,640
It's non-alcoholic.

1730
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,010
- It's non-alcoholic. - I'm feeling a bit tipsy.

1731
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,580
I'm feeling a bit tipsy.

1732
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,940
(Ok Soon uses her skill.)

1733
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,780
(Ok Soon's tip for girls: Act drunk)

1734
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:40,880
(Sighing)

1735
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,420
Who would you say is your ideal woman?

1736
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,590
- My ideal woman? - It's a commonly asked question.

1737
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,760
(Laughing)

1738
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,330
Sir, why are you laughing?

1739
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,830
- My ideal woman? - Why are you laughing?

1740
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:54,660
(The cameraman ruins the role-play.)

1741
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,200
These questions are asked.

1742
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,860
- We ask these on the bus. - This is small talk.

1743
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,900
Yes, small talk.

1744
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,470
(They continue the role-play.)

1745
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,400
We asked about our MBTI personalities...

1746
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,500
and what we look for in people.

1747
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,400
I like women who love what they do.

1748
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,840
(Ok Soon's tip for girls: Seize the chance to appeal)

1749
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,110
I like women who love what they do.

1750
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:09,480
(Firm)

1751
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:07,940
I absolutely love what I do.

1752
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:13,150
I'm not lying when I say...

1753
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,250
that it feels like I'm dating myself.

1754
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,120
Doesn't that mean you don't have room for someone else?

1755
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,620
Sorry?

1756
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,160
(Spirit Man makes a bold statement.)

1757
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,160
You probably don't have room for anyone else.

1758
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,730
I have room set aside for others.

1759
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,460
- It's been set aside? - That's right.

1760
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,100
Who is your ideal man?

1761
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,330
- My ideal man? - Yes.

1762
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,700
A proficient dancer and...

1763
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,870
Unbelievable.

1764
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,340
I like someone with momentum.

1765
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,010
- With momentum? - Yes.

1766
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,040
I believe momentum drives you forward in life.

1767
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:41,180
(Spirit Man's looking at her with suggestive eyes.)

1768
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,540
- I truly mean that. - I agree.

1769
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,880
- I'm not saying that for TV. - It's true.

1770
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,310
Lately, I've been interested in men who have a driving spirit...

1771
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:47,750
(When Ok Soon gets one step closer,)

1772
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,950
and momentum. Thank you.

1773
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,750
(Spirit Man gets two steps closer.)

1774
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,990
- Then... - Goodness.

1775
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:52,990
- Thank you. - We'll do our best.

1776
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:55,490
Let's do our best.

1777
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:57,530
(The two smooth talkers' serious showdown)

1778
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,860
Just a second. Why is my arm this short?

1779
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:59,800
There we go. Sure.

1780
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,660
(While the two guests are securing their screen time,)

1781
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,500
- Have spirit. - Go, us. Have spirit.

1782
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:05,530
(everything is dull in the small car.)

1783
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,400
- You know... - Ye Eun, in front of us...

1784
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,870
is KAI's limousine.

1785
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,810
- Where? - To the right. Take a look.

1786
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,040
(They spot the limousine, of all cars.)

1787
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:10,840
- Should we go to the right... - It's fine.

1788
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,870
and roll the window down?

1789
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:15,240
- I'm all right, ning, ning, ning - Ning, ning, ning

1790
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,410
I can only imagine how fun it'll be...

1791
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,650
(Teary-eyed)

1792
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:18,910
- for the two of them. - They must be having champagne.

1793
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,150
They...

1794
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,080
It'll be like "Single's Inferno" in there.

1795
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,950
That'll be Paradise, then.

1796
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,290
- Say hi. - That'd be funnier.

1797
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,560
- Say hi. - Should I?

1798
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,060
- Say hi. - Seok Jin, please don't.

1799
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,260
(Rolling)

1800
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,530
- You should. - Say hi.

1801
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,430
- Say hi. - How do I open the window?

1802
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:32,530
- Roll it down. - It won't go down.

1803
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:34,000
(In a hurry)

1804
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,930
- You have to make circles. - The camera is in the way.

1805
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,270
Ah Young, KAI.

1806
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,000
(Se Chan can't see inside the car.)

1807
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,100
- It won't work. - Hey.

1808
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,040
Ah Young, KAI.

1809
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,570
- Se Chan. - Hey.

1810
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,070
- Se Chan. - Right now...

1811
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,070
- I can't see them. - You can't see anything.

1812
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,140
- I... - Se Chan, I can see you.

1813
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,850
At first glance, I thought you were driving shirtless.

1814
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,110
(She calls Se Chan.)

1815
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,580
- Ye Eun... - Ye Eun's angry right now.

1816
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,050
She's crying her eyes out.

1817
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,220
(Se Chan only talks about Ye Eun before he leaves.)

1818
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,380
Anyway, have fun.

1819
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,090
- Sure. - Se Chan!

1820
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:03,930
- What was that? - He's my ex.

1821
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,100
He's been giving me the cold shoulder today.

1822
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,870
However, it's time to find new love. Right?

1823
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,100
- Right. - I should find new love.

1824
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:15,500
(Ok Soon in Running Man is immersed in her story.)

1825
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,300
- Of course. - New love is always...

1826
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,240
- waiting for us. - That's true.

1827
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,310
Anyway, I'm grateful.

1828
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:19,210
I must be lucky when it comes to guests.

1829
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,480
- How so? - Those I'm on the show with...

1830
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,580
have been nice and humorous.

1831
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,050
Do you think you lucked out once again?

1832
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,750
This was the best.

1833
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,550
Need I say more, KAI?

1834
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,190
I'm thrilled to be with you on Running Man too.

1835
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:34,120
This is what I've been running towards.

1836
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,690
I became a fan of yours after watching your work.

1837
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,530
- Really? - Yes, for real.

1838
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,300
- I also... - I enjoyed your Seoul dialect.

1839
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,530
- Goodness me. - I mean that.

1840
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,270
- This is too good to be true. - You're like a celebrity to me.

1841
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,840
What on earth are you saying? You're the celebrity among us.

1842
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,440
You're like a celebrity to me.

1843
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,540
What else did you enjoy?

1844
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,870
Also, you look way better in person.

1845
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:55,110
Hold on. You're joking, aren't you?

1846
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,950
- I mean it. - Really?

1847
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,410
No way.

1848
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,220
Don't tell me we're already there.

1849
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,690
Sir, can you drive us around the block again?

1850
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,520
Do we have to get out? But I don't want to.

1851
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:08,820
(They get to the next location while flirting.)

1852
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,490
- No way. - This looks good.

1853
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,200
(Everyone has arrived at the Chinese restaurant.)

1854
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:12,190
- The smell is incredible. - Gosh, the smell.

1855
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:13,400
- The smell is amazing. - This is killing me.

1856
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:14,700
- Goodness. - What's this?

1857
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,160
Will some of us not get to eat?

1858
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,730
(In the middle of the restaurant...)

1859
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,500
Won't everyone get to eat?

1860
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,370
- Where do we sit? - Goodness me.

1861
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:22,070
(is a table divided by partitions.)

1862
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:21,500
- What's this? - What's this?

1863
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,540
I want jjajangmyeon.

1864
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,270
I think we'll have to guess the dish.

1865
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:26,070
- Or maybe not. - I'm starving.

1866
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,940
Earlier, I told you...

1867
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,280
(Today is Black Day.)

1868
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,280
- that today was Black Day. - Sure.

1869
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,710
Ye Eun called it Jjajangmyeon Day.

1870
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,020
(You should eat jjajangmyeon!)

1871
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:34,250
On Black Day, one should have jjajangmyeon.

1872
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,850
By deciding who the couples will be,

1873
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,690
(After choosing new couples,)

1874
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:37,650
we'll be left with a singleton...

1875
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:41,460
who will get to eat the jjajangmyeon.

1876
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:44,660
(only the singleton will get to eat jjajangmyeon.)

1877
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,190
- Is it only for the singleton? - Being a singleton is better.

1878
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,790
It's better to be single.

1879
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:48,330
You will each be served five dishes.

1880
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:50,330
At the signal, you will then...

1881
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,730
- choose one of the dishes you want. - Sure.

1882
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,470
If two of you...

1883
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:56,440
choose the same dish,

1884
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,910
- those two will become a couple. - A couple?

1885
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,640
Without being able to eat,

1886
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,840
the couple will be moved to the Couples Zone.

1887
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:06,520
(It means when 2 people choose the same thing, they're out.)

1888
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:05,750
- Please... - Our answers can't overlap.

1889
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,550
The last man standing will enjoy a bowl of jjajangmyeon...

1890
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,720
and a dish of their choice as a singleton.

1891
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,990
That's what I want.

1892
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,960
The last man standing will enjoy a bowl of jjajangmyeon...

1893
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:17,760
(Only the singleton can enjoy the Black Day food.)

1894
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,090
and a dish of their choice as a singleton.

1895
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:23,500
(Only one person can eat Chinese food.)

1896
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,630
That's what I want.

1897
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,330
I'm having yuringi. That's what I'm having today.

1898
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,500
I want tangsuyuk.

1899
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,870
- I want that too. - Since it's Black Day,

1900
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:26,870
the couples will get to eat steamed black rice and pickled radish.

1901
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:29,040
(Couples will have white rice mixed with black rice and pickled radish.)

1902
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:29,240
- You will also get a badge. - Come on.

1903
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:32,510
(Chinese food is available to the couples for tasting only.)

1904
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,310
Can't we at least have jjajangmyeon?

1905
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,340
- That's mean. - This is a restaurant...

1906
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,440
with a history of 50 years.

1907
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,340
- Can't we at least have the sauce? - We should get some jjajangmyeon.

1908
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,580
You can't do this to us.

1909
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,550
Please take a seat...

1910
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,120
(They're going to the table with partitions.)

1911
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,410
- that's been divided. - Oh, no!

1912
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:40,520
- I'm serious about this. - This...

1913
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,920
- I'll leave this up to fate. - Come on.

1914
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,620
- Our answers can't overlap. - No.

1915
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,290
Choose the rarest dish.

1916
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,020
(As long as it's not 2 people,)

1917
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,260
- This is insane. - Come on.

1918
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,820
(it's okay to choose the same dish as others.)

1919
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,560
We only get five options,

1920
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,630
so we're bound to choose the same dish.

1921
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,960
Even if I pick something others don't want,

1922
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,400
I bet someone else would've chosen it.

1923
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,860
I'm choosing the first dish. No one's to choose that.

1924
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,430
Ah Young's already full...

1925
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:58,830
and doesn't need to have jjajangmyeon or kimchi stew.

1926
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,170
I'm already full.

1927
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:02,270
Thank you, Running Man.

1928
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,310
(Genuine)

1929
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,440
There was champagne in the limo.

1930
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:05,570
(Tossing)

1931
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,470
- Really? - Yes.

1932
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,910
We enjoyed a glass of champagne.

1933
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,940
(Receiving)

1934
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:08,780
Champagne, cheese, and...

1935
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,280
- I bet it was nice. - It was.

1936
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:11,050
(Upset)

1937
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,250
I bet Ye Eun's boiling inside.

1938
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,280
I bet Ye Eun's boiling inside.

1939
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,050
(Big Eyes is driving Ddochi crazy.)

1940
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,190
It's always the same when Ah Young's here.

1941
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:19,860
First, it was Se Chan. Then it was Daniel.

1942
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:21,890
(Ah Young took her men.)

1943
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,160
And now it's KAI.

1944
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,620
Her choice got better and better.

1945
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,490
(Will it end differently this time?)

1946
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,090
- I mean... - She's...

1947
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,190
She's a femme fatale.

1948
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,960
- The food is here. - Really?

1949
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:29,360
(5 Chinese dishes are served.)

1950
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,360
- Let's see. - I'm starving!

1951
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,560
What do I do?

1952
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,500
I wonder what will be served.

1953
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:37,040
(1. Minced meat and vegetable jjajangmyeon)

1954
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,570
I don't know which to choose.

1955
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:37,170
- No way. - This looks amazing.

1956
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:38,940
There's jjajang...

1957
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:42,410
(2. Seafood jjajangmyeon)

1958
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,980
Minced meat and vegetable jjajangmyeon...

1959
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,010
and seafood jjajangmyeon.

1960
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,880
- No way. - That looks good.

1961
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:47,380
(3. Jjamppong)

1962
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,480
- Seafood jjamppong? - Jjamppong.

1963
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,720
- That's so good. - I want it badly.

1964
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:51,120
(4. Tansuyuk)

1965
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,150
- Is that tangsuyuk? - Tangsuyuk.

1966
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,420
- Tangsuyuk! - Everything looks good.

1967
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:54,420
(5. Pickled radish)

1968
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,290
- Pickled radish? - They're killing me.

1969
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:55,320
Is this one of the choices?

1970
00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:00,160
(Bite-sized samples of 5 Chinese dishes)

1971
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,590
There are three of each.

1972
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:00,200
That's why you'll all be served the dishes.

1973
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,360
What should I have?

1974
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,630
(Eyes widening)

1975
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,500
- This... - Is this gan-jjajangmyeon?

1976
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,170
Minced meat and vegetable jjajangmyeon...

1977
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:09,640
(If 2 people choose the same dish, they can have 1 bite only.)

1978
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:06,170
and seafood jjajangmyeon.

1979
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,770
- This looks good. - Seafood jjajangmyeon and radish?

1980
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,200
I've already made up my mind.

1981
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,710
- I'd love to eat this. - Tangsuyuk?

1982
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:13,710
(The first choice)

1983
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,610
Please choose your dish on the count of three.

1984
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:14,310
Okay. I've made up my mind.

1985
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,710
I'm having this first for sure.

1986
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,310
- I'm going to choose what I want. - One...

1987
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,280
One, two, three.

1988
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,920
(Choosing the dish)

1989
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,880
- Do we eat it? - No, pick up the dish.

1990
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,520
One, two, three.

1991
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,520
(Spirit Man chooses tangsuyuk.)

1992
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,190
I'm having this first for sure.

1993
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:26,690
I don't think I'll be anyone's partner.

1994
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,590
(Confident)

1995
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,220
- Please. - Please.

1996
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:30,390
(Ye Eun chooses jjamppong.)

1997
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,060
This is bad. Another person couldn't have chosen this.

1998
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:33,300
(Haha chooses minced meat and vegetable jjajangmyeon.)

1999
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:32,360
Why am I nervous?

2000
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,600
I'm nervous too.

2001
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:36,230
(Ah Young chooses pickled radish.)

2002
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,730
- What now? - I'm nervous.

2003
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,200
All right.

2004
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,400
(Jjamppong, tangsuyuk, pickled radish)

2005
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,530
- At least I'll have no regrets. - I...

2006
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,540
(Minced meat and vegetable jjajangmyeon)

2007
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:40,740
- I'm nervous. - Are we done?

2008
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,670
- Do we have a couple? - We have ourselves a couple.

2009
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,070
(A couple was made right away?)

2010
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,940
- Really? - Seriously?

2011
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,140
We have ourselves a couple.

2012
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:48,610
(Who are the two that chose the same dish?)

2013
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,270
- Really? - Seriously?

2014
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,280
- Who are they? - There's a couple?

2015
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,880
- Who are they? - They're the unluckiest!

2016
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,910
Congratulations, Se Chan...

2017
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:54,650
- Congratulations, Se Chan and KAI. - Yes!

2018
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:59,190
(They chose tangsuyuk.)

2019
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,750
Se Chan and KAI

2020
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,960
For real? You and I really don't get along.

2021
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:02,790
(Spirit Man is eliminated immediately this time.)

2022
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,160
- Okay! - What did they choose?

2023
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,630
- What was it? - What?

2024
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:04,630
(Tangsuyuk, jjamppong, pickled radish, tangsuyuk, jjamppong)

2025
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:04,790
- Tangsuyuk. - Oh, really?

2026
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,460
(Minced meat and vegetable jjajangmyeon)

2027
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,430
- Okay! - That's a relief.

2028
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:08,160
- Hey, tangsuyuk is not the one. - No, but...

2029
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,830
Who starts off with noodles?

2030
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:12,070
(As soon as it begins, they're moved to the seat for couples.)

2031
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,430
I thought there would be lots of people, for sure.

2032
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,740
Gosh, do we really only eat this?

2033
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,770
Yes.

2034
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:19,010
(As many as 5 people chose jjamppong.)

2035
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,010
- Can we eat now? - Do we get to eat?

2036
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:18,570
Gosh, five of us wanted seafood jjamppong?

2037
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,610
You can start eating.

2038
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:24,110
(Noodle Jae Seok slurps it at once.)

2039
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,280
Of course. I knew there would be lots of people who wanted this.

2040
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,350
Hey, KAI.

2041
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:25,980
- My gosh. - Haha, you had...

2042
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:29,620
(Food Fighter who wanted to have jjajangmyeon is eating jjamppong.)

2043
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,450
I always only get rice.

2044
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:30,090
I'm sorry, but the seafood jjamppong...

2045
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:34,490
(It's the Running Man members' favorite dish, indeed.)

2046
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,020
Gosh, this is delicious.

2047
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:38,260
(Haha chose minced meat and vegetable jjajangmyeon by himself.)

2048
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,730
I wanted to eat something else.

2049
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,500
(Ah Young can eat pickled radish only.)

2050
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,830
Can't I eat something else?

2051
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:45,200
Five of you chose seafood jjamppong.

2052
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,170
- Okay. - We can't eat the radish, right?

2053
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,740
This is delicious.

2054
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:50,170
(The first sample isn't enough.)

2055
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,240
Gosh, this is so good.

2056
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:53,210
(A bite of salty food stimulates their appetite.)

2057
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,640
- It's so good. - This is the best!

2058
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,740
Gosh, this is so nice.

2059
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,140
- Really. - I hope I never become a couple.

2060
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,080
Let's not become a couple. Let's survive alone!

2061
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,680
Now, let's make the second choice.

2062
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,880
- Okay. - I got over one crisis.

2063
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,920
I won't go in a different direction.

2064
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,620
- What should I eat? - All right. On the count of three,

2065
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,250
(Will a couple be made this time again?)

2066
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,720
hold up your choice.

2067
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,250
This is a game of wits.

2068
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,620
In 1, 2, 3.

2069
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:09,660
(They choose a dish.)

2070
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,620
- Okay. - I hope they become couples.

2071
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,290
- All right. Please. - I bet there's a high chance...

2072
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:13,530
- that many of them chose tangsuyuk. - I'm sure there are a lot.

2073
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:15,830
If you eat jjajangmyeon, you have to have some tangsuyuk.

2074
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,670
- That's right. - In 1, 2, 3.

2075
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,800
(As expected, Ye Eun chose tangsuyuk.)

2076
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,830
- Okay. - I hope they become couples.

2077
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,740
(Haha chose minced meat and vegetable jjajangmyeon again.)

2078
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,970
- Okay. - I hope they become couples.

2079
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:23,040
All right. Please.

2080
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,810
(Jong Kook and Seok Jin chose jjamppong 2 times in a row.)

2081
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,870
- Okay. - I hope they become couples.

2082
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:25,910
All right. Please.

2083
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:29,310
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo chose the seafood jjajangmyeon.)

2084
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:27,380
Let's not become a couple.

2085
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,410
Please, let's go.

2086
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:34,380
(Depending on Ah Young's choice, the couples will be decided.)

2087
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,910
This looks so good.

2088
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:33,280
- Please. - If you eat jjajangmyeon...

2089
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:34,650
So, first of all...

2090
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,650
(What is Ah Young's choice after only eating pickled radishes?)

2091
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,650
Can't I eat something else?

2092
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,490
So, first of all, we have...

2093
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,090
(A couple is made again.)

2094
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:42,260
- new couples. - Who is it?

2095
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:47,060
(Who will have eaten their last bite?)

2096
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,190
- Who is it? - Who is it?

2097
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:46,290
- Who? - I think it might be me.

2098
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:47,730
- No way. - Who is it?

2099
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:48,960
Congratulations.

2100
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:51,900
(Tangsuyuk, jjamppong, seafood, jjanppong, seafood, minced meat)

2101
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:51,470
Kim Jong Kook and Jee Seok Jin.

2102
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:55,900
(Jong Kook and Seok Sam are a match with jjamppong 2 times in a row.)

2103
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,270
Kim Jong Kook and Jee Seok Jin.

2104
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,780
(The 3 who chose seafood jjajangmyeon survive.)

2105
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,440
What was it?

2106
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:00,240
The rest of you can eat.

2107
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,310
Okay!

2108
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:04,310
(Unexpectedly, Food Fighter was the only one to choose tangsuyuk.)

2109
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,310
- I can eat this, right? - Yes, you can.

2110
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:06,380
(Finishing in one bite)

2111
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,580
(Savoring the food)

2112
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:09,420
- Why don't I have any? - Hey, I want something else.

2113
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,920
(Haha, with his childish taste buds, survives as he loves jjajangmyeon.)

2114
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,460
Gosh, we blew them away.

2115
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:15,220
(Happy)

2116
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:16,490
- Hey, did you choose jjamppong? - I did.

2117
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:22,060
(They savor their second dish as well.)

2118
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:26,640
Haha, you changed your choice, didn't you?

2119
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,970
I didn't. I chose the minced meat and vegetable jjajangmyeon twice.

2120
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:30,540
Oh, you chose that before too?

2121
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,070
I like minced meat and vegetable jjajangmyeon.

2122
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:33,410
(He has strong preferences.)

2123
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,340
Oh, that's a signal.

2124
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,880
Hang on. There has to be two more couples, right?

2125
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:36,340
(The third choice)

2126
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,350
- Now, you will be making... - There are five of us, right?

2127
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,780
(5 people are left.)

2128
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,050
- your 3rd choice. - There are 5 of us.

2129
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,420
The probability is...

2130
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,080
The chances are getting slimmer now.

2131
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,590
All right. On the count of three, please pick up your choice.

2132
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:47,320
(They're more likely to be matched as there are less people.)

2133
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,460
In 1, 2, 3.

2134
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:53,130
(Pickled radish, tangsuyuk)

2135
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,160
In 1, 2, 3.

2136
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,890
There might be two couples this time.

2137
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,100
But the meal is...

2138
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:54,130
(Seafood jjajangmyeon, jjamppong)

2139
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,800
Please show us your choices.

2140
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:57,330
(All four chose a different dish!)

2141
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,470
I will never change my choice.

2142
00:54:58,530 --> 00:54:59,630
I won't go in a different direction.

2143
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,670
(If he chooses minced meat and vegetable jjajangmyeon again,)

2144
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,640
I like minced meat and vegetable jjajangmyeon.

2145
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,740
- In 1, 2, 3. - I will never change my choice.

2146
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:06,210
(they can all eat without becoming couples.)

2147
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,840
No way.

2148
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,480
(What's the result?)

2149
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,610
- This is... - What is it?

2150
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,780
There is one new couple this time as well.

2151
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,650
(Another couple is made.)

2152
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,910
- What? - Who is it?

2153
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,920
(Haha's choice overlaps with someone.)

2154
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,310
There is one new couple this time as well.

2155
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,580
- What? - Who is it?

2156
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,720
- Who is it? - People get caught pretty easily.

2157
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:21,560
(Which of them has become a couple with Haha?)

2158
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,350
- I bet it's Ye Eun. - Congratulations.

2159
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:19,690
I'm sure it's Ye Eun.

2160
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,220
Congratulations.

2161
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,530
The couple is Haha and Song Ji Hyo.

2162
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,790
(Pickled radish, tangsuyuk, seafood jjajangmyeon, jjamppong)

2163
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:24,930
I survived!

2164
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:28,530
(The Mapo Siblings matched twice in a row.)

2165
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,460
Haha and Song Ji Hyo.

2166
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,460
Gosh, all of a sudden...

2167
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,370
(Haha chose jjamppong instead of jjajangmyeon.)

2168
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,830
Come on, Haha. Did you choose jjamppong?

2169
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,770
- I suddenly chose jjamppong. - For real?

2170
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:35,470
(Food Fighter goes down the perfect route...)

2171
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,970
(from jjamppong to tangsuyuk, and lastly, the pickled radish.)

2172
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:38,040
- I did it. - Yes!

2173
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:40,340
(Jae Seok tried jjamppong, jjajangmyeon, and tangsuyuk,)

2174
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,140
Nice.

2175
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:40,880
Honestly, this is so good.

2176
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,580
(the top 3 Chinese dishes.)

2177
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,810
- You still ate a lot. - That's right.

2178
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:46,380
(Ah Young eats seafood jjajangmyeon twice in a row.)

2179
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:46,110
Come on, Haha. Seriously?

2180
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:49,150
Gosh, Jae Seok is doing so great. You know?

2181
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:53,020
(The 3 of them finished the samples they liked.)

2182
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,420
- I really... - Hey, Jae Seok...

2183
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,550
I'm really just choosing what I want to eat.

2184
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,160
Hey, how did he survive?

2185
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,290
If two of you choose the same thing here,

2186
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,430
(Only one of them will become a singleton.)

2187
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:57,630
you will become the final couple.

2188
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:58,660
All right.

2189
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:01,930
Okay. In 1, 2, 3.

2190
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,730
But it's not easy for all three to choose different dishes.

2191
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,570
- There will be a couple this time. - I'm sure.

2192
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:09,070
(Will the last couple be made?)

2193
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,140
- Right? - I think so.

2194
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,470
I want to eat jjajangmyeon.

2195
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,110
(Food Fighter still hasn't gotten to taste the jjajangmyeon.)

2196
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,210
In 1, 2, 3.

2197
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:18,550
(Food Fighter's winning move with the pickled radish!)

2198
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,110
Oh, hang on.

2199
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,480
(Ye Eun)

2200
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,280
In 1, 2, 3.

2201
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,120
(Ah Young chooses the tangsuyuk.)

2202
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,620
- This will be hard. - Yes, it will be.

2203
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:27,560
(Did Jae Seok choose the same thing as these two?)

2204
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:30,630
Congratulations, we have a new couple.

2205
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,860
(The final couple is born.)

2206
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,060
- We have a new couple. - Who is it?

2207
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:36,400
(Who will be the one person to be left single?)

2208
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,330
Who's single? Which one is the singleton?

2209
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:36,600
I think it might be me.

2210
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,070
Who's single? Which one is the singleton?

2211
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:41,070
(Which one is matched with Jae Seok?)

2212
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:40,370
I think it might be me.

2213
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:41,940
- The final couple is... - Yes?

2214
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,970
Yu Jae Seok and Kim Ah Young.

2215
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,410
- Food Fighter! - Food Fighter! Indeed!

2216
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:50,350
(The final couple chose tangsuyuk.)

2217
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:49,140
- Did you choose this? - Tangsuyuk?

2218
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,780
(Ji Ye Eun becomes the singleton!)

2219
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:56,620
- Food Fighter! - Food Fighter! Indeed!

2220
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:56,520
(Food Fighter survived!)

2221
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,620
- That's impressive. - My gosh.

2222
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:00,160
(Food Fighter beat 8 people and became the last person to be left.)

2223
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:59,890
- That's amazing. - Indeed!

2224
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,490
When it comes to eating, Food Fighter is...

2225
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:02,320
(Respect)

2226
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:03,460
- You chose the pickled radish? - Food Fighter!

2227
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,360
(Shouting first)

2228
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:07,130
- Food Fighter! - Food Fighter!

2229
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:08,760
(Now, she shouts "Food Fighter" first.)

2230
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:08,730
- That's amazing. - When it comes to eating,

2231
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:09,900
she's at the top.

2232
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,930
You can't beat Zhu Bajie.

2233
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:13,100
For real. She's on a whole different level.

2234
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:14,570
Am I single?

2235
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:18,140
- She's Ji Bajie, indeed. - That's impressive.

2236
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:22,140
(Her strategy to choose the pickled radish worked!)

2237
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:21,180
Ji Bajie, you really bet everything on the last choice, didn't you?

2238
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,280
- My gosh. - Indeed, Ji Bajie.

2239
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,310
Ye Eun, you can choose one between jjajang and jjamppong.

2240
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:26,750
(Singleton Ye Eun starts ordering.)

2241
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:27,550
And you can choose between tangsuyuk and nanja wanseu.

2242
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,850
- I'll choose... - You should choose jjajangmyeon.

2243
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,150
- jjajangmyeon... - Indeed, Food Fighter.

2244
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,150
- Tangsuyuk. - and tangsuyuk.

2245
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:33,860
- Eat nanja wanseu. You won't? - No. I like tangsuyuk.

2246
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,460
(Firm)

2247
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,720
She has simple taste.

2248
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,720
She sticks to the basics.

2249
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,390
- That's right. - Yes, I stick to the basics.

2250
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:41,600
(Food Fighter Ji goes for the classic dishes.)

2251
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,630
She sticks to the basics.

2252
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:43,260
Hey, let's watch the fodder show again today.

2253
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,200
- She did a fodder show last time. - This part...

2254
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:47,870
(The talk of the town, the driving fodder show)

2255
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,570
- The fodder show was a big hit. - Really?

2256
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:49,200
- Like feeding her food? - Yes.

2257
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,770
(KAI saw it too.)

2258
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:50,810
- While she was driving? - She eats really well.

2259
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,740
- It's coming. - Let's see it.

2260
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:54,480
(The Food Fighter Show is about to be re-released.)

2261
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,480
I like tangsuyuk. Minced meat and vegetable jjajangmyeon.

2262
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,680
(Tangsuyuk and minced meat and vegetable jjajangmyeon...)

2263
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,580
I stick to the basics.

2264
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,310
(are classic Chinese dishes.)

2265
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,750
This is the traditional taste.

2266
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:01,920
(The happiest meal for a singleton)

2267
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,580
Hurry up and slurp your noodles for us.

2268
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:03,920
- Food Fighter! - Food Fighter!

2269
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,090
- She's shouting it herself. - Food Fighter!

2270
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:08,460
- That looks so good. - Ji Bajie.

2271
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,990
(Food Fighter starts eating alone.)

2272
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,820
Take a bite.

2273
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,630
- That looks delicious. - Let's go.

2274
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,260
- I'll pour this in. - Ji Bajie.

2275
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,100
- Look at that. - That's a lot of food.

2276
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,970
(Exclaiming)

2277
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,200
Gosh, I'm sorry I'm eating alone.

2278
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,470
- It's okay. - It's fine.

2279
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:22,940
- You're not really sorry. - My gosh.

2280
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,370
You look so happy.

2281
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,470
And I'm the type to pour my sauce.

2282
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,310
(Ms. Ji always pours the sauce over it.)

2283
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,410
- You like to pour your sauce? - This is the way I like to eat.

2284
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:29,480
- Is that so? - That looks good.

2285
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,780
Because that's how tangsuyuk is supposed to be served.

2286
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,080
You mean it's soggy?

2287
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:37,590
(Foodie Genius has strong preferences for this.)

2288
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,750
I like it when the sauce gets absorbed.

2289
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,220
- Do you like that? - The sauce gets absorbed...

2290
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,250
and becomes chewy.

2291
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:39,490
The way you eat it has so many calories.

2292
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,920
(Staring)

2293
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:40,960
Pouring the sauce is part of the cooking too.

2294
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,960
The sauce gets absorbed.

2295
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,260
So, are we...

2296
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,760
at a fan meeting for a YouTuber who does eating shows?

2297
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,860
(Food Fighter Fanmeet Live)

2298
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,460
Are we at a fan meeting for a YouTuber who does eating shows?

2299
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,770
- Seriously. - I'm a huge fan!

2300
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:54,970
(Food Fighter TV)

2301
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,130
- We get to see this live! - I'm a huge fan!

2302
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:53,230
This is a great event.

2303
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,200
- We get to see this live. - Yes, it's an event.

2304
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,640
By the way, thanks to Food Fighter, our elder here...

2305
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,110
- He came in a brand new wig. - That's right.

2306
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,380
(I love Food Fighter.)

2307
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:01,580
He's a big fan.

2308
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:04,180
(He's wearing a wig not to be refused entry.)

2309
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,180
I came like this because there was an age limit.

2310
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,950
Gosh, I didn't really do much.

2311
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:08,380
Gosh, no. We've spent so much money to send you our support.

2312
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,380
- You know? - That's right.

2313
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,950
- Food Fighter is eating! - Here it goes!

2314
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:14,090
- Here goes the food! - Food Fighter is eating!

2315

(Food Fighter TV)

2316
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:21,200
(Her eating show can restore even a lost appetite.)

2317
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:24,730
- Food Fighter! - Food Fighter!

2318
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:24,670
(Cheering quietly)

2319
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:26,730
- That looks so good. - How is it? Describe the taste.

2320

(Jee Gwan Sik donated: How is it? Describe the taste.)

2322
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:29,070
"It's so tasty."

2323
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,670
- Is it good? - It's so tasty.

2324
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,010
I knew it.

2325
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,380
Oh, she's eating the tangsuyuk.

2326
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,580
Oh, it's tangsuyuk. My gosh.

2327
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:37,110
(Eating)

2328
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:40,110
(You must eat neatly during an eating show.)

2329
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,480
Gosh, I can't believe I'm seeing this in person.

2330
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,520
(Emotional)

2331
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,850
- Gosh, Food Fighter. - This is crazy.

2332
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:44,250
"It's so tasty."

2333
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:47,960
(The jjajangmyeon show doesn't disappoint.)

2334
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:48,090
- Gosh, I'm jealous. - That's impressive.

2335
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,730
- Gosh, I'm jealous. - I'm so jealous.

2336
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,830
- Darn it. - I want to eat it too.

2337
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:55,400
(Their favorite food is right in front of them,)

2338
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,230
That looks so good.

2339
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,200
(but they can't eat it.)

- Food Fighter is... - It's so...

2344
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:04,340
How did I end up here?

2345
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,870
- What do you mean? - Because you're the Food Fighter.

2346
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:10,040
(Everyone is looking at her mouth.)

2347
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,880
- We can't beat you in eating. - How did I end up winning?

2348
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,040
I know, Food Fighter.

2349
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,350
Oh, do we get something too?

2350
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:12,850
- What's that? - Oh, my.
- Oh, we get... - What is this?

2351
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:16,080
(White and black rice with pickled radish for the couples)

2352
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,380
- Gosh, this is... - What is this?

2353
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,220
Don't we get any soup?

2354
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:19,150
I know. They could give us some jjamppong broth...

2355
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:20,660
- or something. - That would be so great.

2356
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,620
It would be good if we had some jjajang sauce, at least.

- Hey. - Yes?

2358

- Food Fighter. - Yes?

2365
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:36,640
Can't you give us the bowl...

2366
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,840
- that you poured the sauce out of? - Yes, right.

2367
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,110
Can't you give us the bowl...

- that you poured the sauce out of? - Yes, right.

- This? I can give you this. - Give it to me.

2371
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,980
- Yes, I'll take that. - I'll take it.

2372
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,250
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors?

2373
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,880
Excuse me. Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2374
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,250
- Hey, where are you dipping that? - What are you doing?

- Hey, you just... - Rock-paper-scissors.

(He took it in the meantime.)

2377
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,190
- Where do you think you're dipping? - Play rock-paper-scissors.

2378
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:52,350
Your half-eaten pickled radish...

2379
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:53,490
- Who wants it? Rock-paper-scissors. - Play with me.

2380
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:55,560
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Who wants it? Rock-paper-scissors.

2381
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,860
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Let's go.

2382

01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,530
- KAI. - I'm going to participate.

01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,960
- KAI. - Hey.

2386
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,400
- I'm going to participate. - My goodness.

2387
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:04,100
(Everyone wants the empty sauce bowl.)

2388
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,660
You have the spirit.

2389
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:03,970
Come on in. Everyone, come on in.

2390
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:06,230
The one who plays the same hand as Food Fighter should take it.

2391
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,270
- That's a good idea. - Okay.

2392
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:08,400
The one who plays the same hand as Food Fighter.

2393
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,710
- All right. Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2394
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,810
(Food Fighter plays rock.)

2395
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,940
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2396
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,710
- I played rock. - Okay.

2397
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:16,940
Is it just one? I played rock.

2398
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:19,810
- Thank you so much. Seriously. - Is this fate?

2399
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:20,950
Seriously.

2400
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:23,220
- Thank you so much. Seriously. - Is this fate?

2401
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,620
- It's fate. - I'm so jealous.

2402
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:28,060
(He's happy about the sauce bowl as if he owns the whole world.)

2403
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,690
KAI got it.

2404
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:26,720
- For goodness' sake. - He played rock.

2405
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,390
- KAI, you're incredible. - Mix it with rice.

2406
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:29,960
He has the spirit.

2407
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:32,390
(Grinning)

2408
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,660
His spirit is amazing.

2409
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,960
You know, even KAI loves something like that.

2410
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:35,600
(Relating)

2411
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,100
He likes it.

2412
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,830
- He became quite easygoing. - Yes. He became quite easygoing.

2413
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:39,470
- He became quite easygoing. - I love it.

2414
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,670
(The former psychic gave up many things.)

2415
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,740
I can't believe that he's mixing it with rice.

2416
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,840
- Should I have a tasty spoonful? - Of course.

2417
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,310
Mix only a bit of rice.

2418
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:49,440
(He scrapes the sauce on the inside of the bowl.)

2419
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:48,180
When you have rice...

2420
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,450
(He makes a spoonful.)

2421
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:50,880
That's it.

2422
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,510
- That's right. - Okay.

2423
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:54,780
- I think it'll make me happy. - Enjoy it.

2424
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:56,550
Half a bite.

2425
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:58,320
(Savoring)

2426
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,620
How is it? Is it good?

2427
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:00,390
- Is that it? - This is it.

2428
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,160
- How is it so tasty? - It's tasty, right?

2429
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:04,560
- Hey. - That's right.

2430
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:07,360
(The global star, KAI is moved by a spoonful of jjajang.)

2431
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,830
- It's really tasty, right? - Yes, it's really tasty.

2432
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,560
Aren't you going to eat that?

2433
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:10,730
What?

2434
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,600
Do you want it?

2435
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,340
(Smiling)

2436
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,840
- What? This one. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

2437
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,970
- Sure. You can have it. - Really? Okay.

2438
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:19,410
- All right. - Jong Kook took the bowl.

2439
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:20,410
(Jong Kook takes it.)

2440
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,510
I can enjoy a spoonful of rice with this.

2441
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,880
Jong Kook is something else.

2442
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,810
- Look at this. - What are you doing?

2443
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,320
(Scraping)

2444
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:30,590
The jjajang sauce from Food Fighter...

2445
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,850
- satisfied two people. - Seok Jin,

2446
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,820
(Savoring)

2447
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,720
it went from KAI to Jong Kook.

2448
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,090
- Jong Kook, are you done? - I...

2449
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,660
- Will you eat that? - Give it to me.

2450
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,790
- Will you eat that? - Yes.

2451
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,260
- I can get two spoonfuls. - Really?

2452
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,460
Of course.

2453
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,860
It's more than enough.

2454
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:45,430
(Mr. Shirtless scrapes the jjajang sauce in a natural way.)

2455
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:48,270
(His eyes go wide.)

2456
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:49,400
- It's really tasty, right? - Right?

2457
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,440
There's the aroma.

2458
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,640
- Here. - Jae Seok, one bite remains.

2459
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,210
- There's the aroma. - That's right.

2460
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:54,280
My goodness.

2461
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,710
Why did you leave this bit on the outside?

2462
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,580
Have a spoonful of rice...

2463
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:00,720
(While they share the jjajang sauce)

2464
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,010
- and stick your nose in the bowl. - Is there something?

2465
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,420
Please give me pickled radish.

2466
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,450
- Please give me pickled radish. - I'll do that.

2467
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:07,890
(Without hesitation)

2468
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:06,620
- For tangsuyuk... - Let's exchange it with tangsuyuk.

2469
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:07,660
- Yes. - Give me a piece of tangsuyuk.

2470
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:08,720
- Let's exchange it with tangsuyuk. - Okay.

2471
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,190
- Take it. - Okay.

2472
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:15,260
(Haha exchanges his pickled radish for tangsuyuk.)

2473
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,290
It's better.

2474
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:13,360
I'm taking a small piece.

2475
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,530
Bok Choy.

2476
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:15,560
That's right.

2477
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:16,930
What are you doing?

2478
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,730
I got it for pickled radish.

2479
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:20,100
- I have pickled radish too. - We have pickled radish too.

2480
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:22,500
(Ah Young also tries.)

2481
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,800
- We could've done the same, okay? - Then go right ahead.

2482
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,840
Eat it.

2483
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,540
- I have pickled radish too. - Eat it.

2484
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:26,610
(No)

2485
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,340
- Pickled radish. - What are you doing?

2486
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,980
Do you want some black rice?

2487
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,310
- Sit down. - Okay.

2488
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,150
Hey, Ye Eun.

2489
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,380
You're very cold to Ah Young.

2490
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,750
- Sit down. Seriously. - I...

2491
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,990
(Food Fighter might let her take her men,)

2492
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,020
Then please give me a piece of tangsuyuk.

2493
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:39,750
(but she won't let her take her food.)

2494
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,190
How dare you!

2495
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,460
I can finish the rice with jjamppong soup.

2496
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:42,860
(KAI stands up.)

2497
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,720
I can't eat it.

2498
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,930
Are you done with this?

2499
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,860
Are you done with this?

2500
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,800
- Seriously. I need it to eat. - Hey.

2501
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:53,470
(He takes the sauce bowl 4 people scraped.)

2502
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,100
- You know... - I need it to eat.

2503
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,240
- I'm not done with it. - Hold on.

2504
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,900
(He understands.)

2505
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,040
There's the aroma.

2506
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,810
- The aroma. - It's mine, Jae Seok.

2507
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:00,580
(Firm)

2508
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:59,570
- I gave you one bite. - I wasn't done with it.

2509
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:00,710
- I gave you one bite. - It's KAI's.

2510
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:02,580
- It's mine. - It's KAI.

2511
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:05,210
- After eating some rice... - It's satisfying so many people.

2512
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,650
(Smelling)

2513
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:07,050
- Enjoy the aroma. - It's incredible.

2514
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,080
Then it's different.

2515
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:11,950
(They finished a pitiful meal.)

2516
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,720
- We finished it. - It fed four people.

2517
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,450
Ye Eun is so generous.

2518
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:14,490
- Since Ye Eun became single, - This is it.

2519
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:15,090
(Ye Eun is the new singleton.)

2520
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:17,230
she'll receive a chance to change into a different outfit.

2521
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:17,790
(She can take off the French Fry T-shirt.)

2522
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:19,690
When she moves to the next location,

2523
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:23,560
(She gets to ride the limousine she had wanted.)

2524
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,300
- she can take a limousine. - Really?

2525
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:22,660
- Then... - Will one get chosen again?

2526
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:23,660
Hyung In.

2527
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:26,130
Hyung In, will he wear this?

2528
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,170
Yes.

2529
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,440
(They'll move to the next location after KAI gets changed.)

2530
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,740
- What? - You need to wear this.

2531
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:32,110
That's right, KAI.

2532
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,940
(The result of the lunch mission)

2533
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:35,110
- The couples will get a badge each. - Okay.

2534
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:37,210
- One each. Give it to me. - For goodness' sake.

2535
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:40,150
(The members gathered after the meal.)

2536
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:39,280
Ye Eun, I'm jealous.

2537
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,480
I'm scared. What should I do?

2538
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,350
- Isn't it Detective Conan's outfit? - Seriously.

2539
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:46,120
(KAI has never worn a matching T-shirt.)

2540
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:45,020
- Isn't it better than you expected? - The Japanese cartoon.

2541
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:47,390
- It's nice. KAI's outfit is normal. - Hey.

2542
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:48,920
- You look fine. - It suits him.

2543
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,420
(But it suits him.)

2544
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,190
- It suits me, right? - Director,

2545
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,790
- he's on my team. - It's unfair.

2546
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:52,960
- It's unfair. - What's this?

2547
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,100
- I... - What's this?

2548
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:57,270
(Brazen)

2549
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,100
- The dressed one and the naked one. - That's right.

2550
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,570
- I see. - I'm the dressed one.

2551
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,970
- I'm the naked one. Okay, I get it. - You're the naked one.

2552
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,070
(Does he agree?)

2553
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:01,470
- KAI looks cute. - I look cute, right?

2554
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,040
The production crew went easy on him because he was a Korean Wave star.

2555
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,670
- How could you do that? - Look at his outfit.

2556
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:07,710
- Seok Jin. - What?

2557
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:09,880
The production crew made you look very young.

2558
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,110
That's right. Think of it that way.

2559
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:14,220
(He looks younger.)

2560
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:12,580
- Cats. - Cat daddy.

2561
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,150
- Listen. - Cat daddy.

2562
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,320
I can't say anything serious with this hairstyle.

2563
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:20,350
(His authority disappeared with age.)

2564
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:20,590
When I said something serious while eating, everyone laughed.

2565
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:25,330
- I can't believe it. - Firstly, Ye Eun became single.

2566
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:27,600
(Ye Eun is the current singleton.)

2567
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:27,430
You'll move to a new location.

2568
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:31,270
Please pick a member with whom you'll ride the limousine...

2569
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:32,530
(She should choose 1 person to get in the limousine with her.)

2570
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:32,770
- and go downstairs. - Here's what I think.

2571
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:34,770
- KAI? - She won't be able to pick KAI.

2572
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:36,370
- Of course not. - She'll be too nervous to do so.

2573
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,310
(Is it uncomfortable to be accompanied by KAI?)

2574
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:37,840
- She should still pick him. - Whom will she pick?

2575
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,910
- Since Ah Young set a precedent... - That's right.

2576
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:42,640
(It's me.)

2577
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:42,240
It's time for a twist.

2578
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:44,310
- It's time for a twist indeed. - Whom will you pick?

2579
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:45,710
- Whom will you pick? - KAI.

2580
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:47,550
- Whom will you pick? - KAI.

2581
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:49,320
(She picks KAI without hesitation.)

2582
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:53,220
(The plot twist is that there's no plot twist.)

2583
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:50,650
- Good. - Ye Eun will ride...

2584
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:52,320
the limousine with KAI.

2585
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,490
- Okay. - Let's go downstairs.

2586
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:55,260
- KAI. - Good.

2587
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:59,730
(The genre weirdly changes whenever they get in the car.)

2588
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,430
Jae Seok, shall I drive?

2589
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:59,630
- Do you want to do that? Okay. - Yes, I can drive well.

2590
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,960
- Ye Eun. KAI. - Is this our vehicle?

2591
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,530
- All right. - I'll watch the episode.

2592
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,330
- Se Chan is right next to you. - I'll watch the episode.

2593
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:07,440
Nothing will happen.

2594
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,700
Make sure nothing happens.

2595
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,810
- Ah Young. - Yes?

2596
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:14,680
- Se Chan is sitting next to you. - Se Chan...

2597
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,310
- "Ye Eun." - "Make sure nothing happens?"

2598
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:18,450
(The immoral guy is left out.)

2599
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:18,550
Jae Seok, I was just trying to be funny.

2600
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,510
- KAI... - You can drive well, right?

2601
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:21,520
That's right.

2602
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,920
(Ah Young will drive this time.)

2603
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,680
- I can drive well. - You're...

2604
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,820
- You're the best driver, right? - I'm the best driver.

2605
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,150
You seem to be very kind.

2606
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:27,760
- Who? - You.

2607
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,760
- Me? - Yes. Right?

2608
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,420
- Se Chan is kind. - He's kind.

2609
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,960
- You... - Are you trying to start something?

2610
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:33,490
Ah Young.

2611
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,460
- I can't catch a break. - Are you trying to start something?

2612
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,500
(She keeps flirting so that he can't think straight.)

2613
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,370
- I mean... - You flirted with KAI earlier.

2614
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:39,700
Right before getting in the car...

2615
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,140
It was for the show.

2616
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:42,870
You said that you liked a man with the spirit.

2617
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,370
(If she flirts with KAI for the show,)

2618
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:43,940
- Gosh. - You're something else.

2619
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:45,240
Ah Young is something else.

2620
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:48,010
(why does she flirt with Se Chan?)

2621
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,110
- Ah Young is the best. - I don't give up.

2622
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:52,010
(Meanwhile, Ye Eun became a successful fan.)

2623
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:52,680
It's my first time riding a limousine.

2624
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:55,150
- I'll open the door. - My goodness.

2625
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:56,750
(She opens it herself.)

2626
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:56,720
- Thank you. - Please get in.

2627
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,890
Gosh, this is incredible.

2628
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:00,450
(Exclaiming)

2629
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,690
- Isn't it incredible? - This is incredible.

2630
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:02,490
(Closing)

2631
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,390
It's incredible.

2632
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,490
It closed on its own.

2633
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:08,130
- It closed on its own. - What are you doing right now?

2634
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:09,560
- It closed on its own. - Gosh.

2635
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:11,830
(Their beginning is quite different.)

2636
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,470
This is incredible.

2637
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:14,140
This is incredible.

2638
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:15,670
Wear a seatbelt like this.

2639
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,170
- It's here. - I'll hold it.

2640
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:20,910
(Pulling hard)

2641
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:25,450
(The seatbelt is tight again.)

2642
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,940
I can't do it.

2643
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:25,180
Seriously.

2644
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,480
- It... - It doesn't come out smoothly.

2645
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,220
- It doesn't, right? - Do it gently.

2646
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,680
- Gently. - Gently.

2647
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:33,020
(Thanks to the seatbelt, the atmosphere lightened up.)

2648
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,020
- Gently. - Thank you.

2649
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:33,090
- Slowly. - You're warmhearted.

2650
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:35,420
(A polite hand)

2651
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:35,160
Thank you.

2652
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,590
(Then it becomes silent again.)

2653
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:40,360
This is incredible.

2654
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:42,760
- Can we eat it? - Yes, we can.

2655
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:46,270
(She spots food even after eating so much.)

2656
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:43,960
There are snacks.

2657
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:45,300
What would you like to eat first?

2658
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:47,230
What did you eat earlier?

2659
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,600
Earlier...

2660
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,870
Did you drink Champagne with Ah Young earlier?

2661
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:50,970
- I drank Champagne. - Is that so?

2662
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:52,670
All right.

2663
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,140
(Since he drank champagne with Ah Young...)

2664
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:56,810
(She extended her arm, but she couldn't reach.)

2665
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,510
Hold on.

2666
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:02,420
(She can reach easily!)

2667
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,480
- Is this how you do it? - We did that earlier.

2668
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,080
- We did that earlier. - Really?

2669
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,320
Okay.

2670
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:07,320
(She slouches even when she pours the drink.)

2671
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,990
Are you pouring me a glass?

2672
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:07,250
Yes, I'm pouring you a glass.

2673
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,490
I'll pour you a glass.

2674
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:11,330
(She looks like a servant rather than a date.)

2675
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:11,060
Now...

2676
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:13,860
Did you do this with Ah Young?

2677
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,430
Yes.

2678
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,670
- I guess you want to do the same. - Yes.

2679
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:21,340
- I'm insecure. - Is that so?

2680
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,970
- I'm insecure. Yes. - Is that so?

2681
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:26,010
- I'll put it back in. - Thank you.

2682
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,270
(Reaching)

2683
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,510
- It's nice. - Are you happy?

2684
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:34,150
(Will Gibbon be able to win over KAI?)

2685
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,220
Thank you, Running Man,

2686
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:35,480
It's nice.

2687
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,620
- What's your ideal type? - Mine?

2688
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:41,390
(Ah Young asked the same question.)

2689
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:40,520
What's your ideal type?

2690
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:41,620
- My ideal type? - Yes.

2691
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:42,960
As for me...

2692
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,060
It's someone who loves her work.

2693
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,160
It's me.

2694
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,900
Is that so?

2695
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,830
(Ye Eun with long arms is appealing aggressively.)

2696
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:50,870
- I love my work so much. - Really?

2697
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:53,370
- What's your MBTI? - Mine?

2698
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:54,340
(Immediately asking a question)

2699
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:55,540
It's INFJ.

2700
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,870
- What's yours? - It's ISFP.

2701
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,370
(I'm an ISFP.)

2702
01:08:58,540 --> 01:08:59,670
We're perfect for each other.

2703
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:00,810
What makes you say that?

2704
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:04,380
(It's only half.)

2705
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,740
We're both introverts and feelers.

2706
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:04,910
- Two parts are the same. - Yes.

2707
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:06,310
- I'm the perceiving type. - The perceiving type.

2708
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:08,020
- I'm spontaneous. Yes. - You're spontaneous.

2709
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,950
- We're a good match. - Are we?

2710
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,350
- Yes. - I plan things ahead of time.

2711
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:14,260
I plan things ahead of time.

2712
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:14,090
(Actually, he argued with Ah Young...)

2713
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:15,620
(about the Perceiving type and the Judging type.)

2714
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,620
I like someone who's different from me.

2715
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:19,130
(Harmony with the opposite type)

2716
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:18,190
- I also think harmony is important. - Really?

2717
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:21,100
- You're a really nice person. - My goodness.

2718
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:21,860
(He called Ah Young a nice person.)

2719
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:23,800
(Doubting)

2720
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,330
Are we a good match?

2721
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,030
I don't make plans.

2722
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,300
So we're a pretty good match.

2723
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,100
(Insisting)

2724
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,970
- We're a good match. - Yes.

2725
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:29,670
- I think we're a good match. - Is that so?

2726
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:31,010
What's your blood type?

2727
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:32,270
(She checks his blood type this time.)

2728
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:32,070
- My blood type? - Yes.

2729
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:33,110
It's type A.

2730
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:35,210
- It's the same as mine. - Really?

2731
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:36,440
- We're a good match. - Are we?

2732
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,440
Yes.

2733
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:39,580
- I heard you liked "SNL Korea." - Your ideal type...

2734
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:40,780
I really like it.

2735
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:44,250
Then you must like me.

2736
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:50,290
(The beginner is flirting by brainwashing him.)

2737
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:46,190
Is that how you flirt?

2738
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:49,260
You must like me because Ah Young left the show.

2739
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,590
I'm the only one who remains.

2740
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:53,290
I watch it often. I've watched nearly all the episodes.

2741
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:54,400
You must like me.

2742
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,470
(Laughing)

2743
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,600
You must like me.

2744
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:02,070
(He doesn't have the spirit anymore as he's brainwashed by her.)

2745
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,570
- What should I do? - I see.

2746
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:01,900
- It's a bit too much. - It's a bit...

2747
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,940
- I see. - What should I do?

2748
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:05,410
- I guess it happened that way. - Yes.

2749
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:07,270
I see.

2750
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:09,640
- Then my ideal type is... - It's me.

2751
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,980
(Did the brainwashing work?)

2752
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,910
I see. I didn't know. I found out today.

2753
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:13,550
From today onward, my ideal type is...

2754
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,090
(KAI fell into her trap.)

2755
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,780
- It's me. - I didn't know.

2756
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,380
- I found out while talking to you. - Really?

2757
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,420
We're the fated pair.

2758
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:22,790
(Meanwhile, Ok Soon and her former love interest)

2759
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,430
Why can't I make them move on their own?

2760
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:24,630
(Windscreen wipers)

2761
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,230
I'll do it. Hold on.

2762
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,490
- I got it. - I see.

2763
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:28,930
Is it aggravating?

2764
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,900
(Attentive)

2765
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,160
- Shall I change it? - No. It's good.

2766
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,530
- Is this speed good? - Yes.

2767
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,470
(It's okay.)

2768
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:32,600
Okay.

2769
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,370
- Is it good? - Yes, it's good.

2770
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:36,100
What's up with the two of you?

2771
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,510
- Did you fasten your seatbelt? - Yes, I did.

2772
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:40,740
(It seems like they'll stop, but they keep going.)

2773
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:40,570
- It's perfect. - My goodness.

2774
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:42,510
- Be careful. - Has it begun once more?

2775
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:44,780
Ah Young, you'll cut him off again.

2776
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:46,410
- She won't answer my calls. - Well,

2777
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:48,680
when did things ever end between us?

2778
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:52,090
I never thought that things had ended.

2779
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,790
(She flirts constantly, as naturally as breathing.)

2780
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:53,990
- Ah Young... - Ah Young is impressive.

2781
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,760
She's something else.

2782
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,490
- My goodness. - I'm making...

2783
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:59,230
- my own story. - Seriously.

2784
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,600
You guys are a bit like Gwan Sik and Ae Sun.

2785
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,670
Good.

2786
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,100
Be careful.

2787
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,240
There's a person in the back, Ah Young.

2788
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:11,540
- Seriously. - Ah Young, what happened?

2789
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,570
(The national MC became invisible.)

2790
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:12,770
What was that?

2791
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,040
- You did this. - I wanted to try it.

2792
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,240
Good.

2793
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,380
Thank you.

2794
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:18,680
Don't mention it.

2795
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,950
Do you guys think that I'm not here?

2796
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:25,190
It's that way. Stick to the right.

2797
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:26,550
- Jae Seok, what do you do... - Slowly.

2798
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,160
(Forcing herself to ask a question to Jae Seok)

2799
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,590
on your day off?

2800
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:28,960
You don't get a day off, right?

2801
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:31,530
- You know, Ah Young, - Yes?

2802
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:32,790
it's too late.

2803
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:36,060
Step on the brakes slowly. Switch to the right lane.

2804
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:38,100
(There's love in the limousine and the small car.)

2805
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:37,100
That's so funny.

2806
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,840
(They arrive at Yeouido Park, the location of the mission.)

2807
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:40,030
Shall we put on raincoats?

2808
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,370
- Thank you. - Let's use an umbrella.

2809
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:43,540
That sounds good.

2810
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:45,640
- I'll do it. - Really?

2811
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:46,810
I'll do it.

2812
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:48,740
(Thanks to Ye Eun's hypnosis, the two of them became close.)

2813
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:50,880
(Satisfied)

2814
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:53,010
I don't need to put on a raincoat.

2815
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:56,580
(The members arrive.)

2816
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,390
- Ah Young was unstoppable. - Why?

2817
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:00,950
- Did she flirt? - Yes.

2818
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:01,960
- Gosh. - Was it nice?

2819
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:03,960
(Watching their flirting up close, which is an eyesore)

2820
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,320
I didn't flirt.

2821
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,760
- She must be good at it. - Why did you do that?

2822
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,330
- Ah Young is good at flirting. - It'll keep Se Chan awake at night.

2823
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:08,260
- Ah Young is good at flirting. - Leave Se Chan alone!

2824
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:09,960
- I didn't do anything. - She drove.

2825
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,970
When she stepped on the brakes, she did this.

2826
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,130
Did she do that?

2827
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:16,540
- Hey, I was nearly invisible. - Really?

2828
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,710
- Did she do that to you? - I was nearly invisible.

2829
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:20,310
- Did she do that to you? - Did she do that to you too?

2830
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:21,580
- Why didn't you do that to me? - What?

2831
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:24,710
(Is the spirited man jealous?)

2832
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:25,880
- Look at Ye Eun. - I wasn't driving then.

2833
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,150
Hold on. We talked about it.

2834
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:29,780
(Growling)

2835
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:30,220
- We talked about it. - He's jealous.

2836
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,290
KAI's ideal type is me.

2837
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:34,760
Is it true?

2838
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,660
- I didn't know about my ideal type. - Okay.

2839
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,930
But she told me repeatedly.

2840
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:40,760
- Did she gaslight you? - "It's me."

2841
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,900
"It's me." She told me repeatedly,

2842
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,100
- so I found my ideal type. - It's me.

2843
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,270
- She was right there. - She gaslit him.

2844
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:47,170
Thus, I became his ideal type.

2845
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:51,410
I think it's Ah Young.

2846
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:53,610
(Screaming)

2847
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:57,640
(The love triangle is in a frenzy.)

2848
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,640
- Is your arm okay? - It was no joke.

2849
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,180
- He totally rejected her. - Seriously.

2850
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,350
All right. I'm sorry.

2851
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,450
Please stand between them.

2852
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,950
(Ddochi ended up losing again.)

2853
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:04,690
Gosh, the weather turned chilly.

2854
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:06,750
(They move into the park.)

2855
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,690
- There's something. - There's something.

2856
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:08,960
- What? - Is it a big set again?

2857
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,060
- What is it? - Gosh.

2858
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,730
(Something is covered with a mysterious canvas.)

2859
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:12,190
The scale is impressive.

2860
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:13,630
What is it?

2861
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,030
Those are balloons.

2862
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:17,100
(The black balloons fill up the board.)

2863
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,700
- There's something. - What's this?

2864
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:20,730
The mission is called Shoot for the Answer.

2865
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:23,100
(Shoot for the Answer)

2866
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:21,840
- What's that? - Shoot for the Answer.

2867
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,400
- Ah Young. - At the starting line,

2868
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,570
- set off on a bicycle. - A bicycle?

2869
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:28,410
Take the dart pins, turn around at the halfway point,

2870
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:31,310
and pop the balloons at the finish line.

2871
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:33,450
(Zeus, Poseidon, the Almighty of the Underworld)

2872
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:34,980
Read the question under the balloons and give the correct answer.

2873
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:35,820
(Hades, correct)

2874
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:37,820
After throwing the dart pins, raise your hand first...

2875
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:39,390
- for a chance to answer. - Good.

2876
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:41,690
- Okay. - You can only bring...

2877
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:44,190
- two dart pins at a time. - Okay.

2878
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:47,090
The team that answered correctly can sit out...

2879
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:49,130
- of the next round. - Okay.

2880
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:51,370
The 1st place will get 1 badge.

2881
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:53,670
The 2nd place will get 2 badges. The 3rd place will get 3 badges.

2882
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:56,270
- The 4th place will get 4 badges. - Then it'll be over.

2883
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:59,040
The team that fails to answer any question...

2884
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,540
will get five badges.

2885
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,610
- Then it'll be over. - Seriously.

2886
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:02,710
Then we'll receive a penalty.

2887
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:07,110
For the four couples, we prepared the special bicycles.

2888
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:08,720
- They played a trick. - It'll be fun.

2889
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,050
- Draw a lot... - KAI, go ahead.

2890
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,650
- for a bicycle. - My partner, KAI.

2891
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:12,820
You need to pick well.

2892
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:13,990
The center one.

2893
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:15,090
- This one. - The remaining one.

2894
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,960
- I'm KAI's partner. - You need to pick well.

2895
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,460
- The center one. - I'm KAI's partner.

2896
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,530
Shall we open it?

2897
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:21,400
- Number 3. - Number 2.

2898
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,400
- Number 4. - Number 2.

2899
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:23,460
- Number 1. - Number 3.

2900
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:24,500
- Number 2. - Number 4.

2901
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:25,530
Number one.

2902
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:27,500
We'll show you the bicycles.

2903
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,500
- Open. - Number one. Please.

2904
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,900
(A good one)

2905
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:31,740
- Do I get a regular bicycle? - Please.

2906
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,040
(Singleton)

2907
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:33,710
- Number 2. - Is ours number 2?

2908
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:35,780
(How do the bicycles for couples look like?)

2909
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,310
- Is this number one? - What?

2910
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:36,610
- Is this number one? - A forklift?

2911
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:37,950
Let's see number three.

2912
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:39,680
- That's... - Number one.

2913
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:41,320
(Bicycle for number 5)

2914
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,980
- Number five is mine. It's fine. - It's fine.

2915
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,980
(A bicycle for a singleton, easy to ride, fast)

2916
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,720
- It's fine. - Ours is fine.

2917
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:45,490
(Bicycles for numbers 2 and 4)

2918
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,720
- It's fine. - Hey, ours is fine.

2919
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:47,990
(Has to be seated side by side, only one person can pedal)

2920
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:46,790
We picked well.

2921
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,220
- For number 4, only 1 will pedal. - We picked well.

2922
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:50,360
(Bicycle for number 3)

2923
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:50,560
- Hold on. - Gosh, it'll be fun.

2924
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,590
(A bicycle with a wagon, hard to turn because it's heavy)

2925
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:53,230
- Jae Seok, it's a stroller. - What's up with number three?

2926
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:56,030
- Hey, number 1 is the worst. - Number 1 is the worst.

2927
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:57,630
- What? - What's this?

2928
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,300
- How does it work? - For goodness' sake.

2929
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:01,600
(Bicycle for number 1)

2930
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,600
- Number 1 is the worst. - Number 1 is the worst.

2931
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:02,470
- My goodness. - Seok Jin.

2932
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,840
(Must turn their backs on each other)

2933
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:04,440
- They put it backward. - It's no wonder no one picked it.

2934
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,040
(One must go backward)

2935
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,970
- I mean... - Seok Jin.

2936
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:07,540
- One should depend on the other. - That's...

2937
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:09,010
- You should do it alone. - I'll do that.

2938
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:11,110
- I think you should do it alone. - You should throw the dart pins.

2939
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,710
(The dart)

2940
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:13,410
- You should throw the dart pins. - I was so startled.

2941
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:16,150
- What's this? - I should rest my feet on them.

2942
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:17,450
Ah Young,

2943
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:19,390
- ours isn't half bad. - What? Right?

2944
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,890
I'll believe in you.

2945
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:22,520
We go there and come back...

2946
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,790
- on this bicycle, right? - That's right.

2947
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,660
I'll do this for real.

2948
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:29,460
It's custom-made.

2949
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,200
- I mean... - It suits your hairstyle.

2950
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,330
- It's custom-made. - Are you ready?

2951
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:37,910
(Will their bicycle go forward well?)

2952
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:35,470
We're ready.

2953
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:36,800
- All right. Stay still. - Get ready.

2954
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:37,840
Okay.

2955
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:41,840
(Start)

2956
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:41,980
- Let's go! - Stay still.

2957
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:44,910
- Let's go! - Why isn't it...

2958
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:45,910
You need to go.

2959
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:46,980
(Rattling)

2960
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:47,680
- Gosh, this... - Gently.

2961
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,920
- Gently. You're doing great. - Good.

2962
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:52,120
(The couple bicycle isn't easy to handle.)

2963
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,120
- Good. - Let's go.

2964
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:52,450
Stay still.

2965
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:56,790
(It's not easy for them also.)

2966
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:54,590
Stay still.

2967
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:56,820
- Gosh, this... - Gently.

2968
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:58,560
Good.

2969
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:01,430
Let's go. Come on.

2970
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:03,900
It won't go forward.

2971
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,670
(Trying to grab them)

2972
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,700
- Good. - There you go.

2973
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,940
- Let's go. Let's win. - Let's go.

2974
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:10,740
(The Mapo Siblings are doing well among the couples.)

2975
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,770
Let's go. Go.

2976
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,240
(And...)

2977
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:16,610
(The singleton's bicycle is super fast.)

2978
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:16,110
Let's go. Go.

2979
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:18,850
(Pedaling with her long legs)

2980
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,880
- Good. - Go.

2981
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:20,450
Keep going. I'll pick them up.

2982
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,380
- Hey. - Slowly.

2983
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,450
(She's the first to grab the darts.)

2984
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:23,880
No.

2985
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:25,450
- Let's go. - I'll pick them up.

2986
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,020
(Right then)

2987
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:29,520
There are no brakes.

2988
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,760
(They bump into each other.)

2989
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,260
- Come on. - For goodness' sake.

2990
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:32,960
- Don't do anything. - I got it.

2991
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:35,460
(It's time to return after taking the darts.)

2992
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:33,960
Let's go. I mean...

2993
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:37,060
- Just go. - Go.

2994
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:38,330
- Here I go. - Let's go.

2995
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:40,170
(Screaming)

2996
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:40,900
Just go.

2997
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:42,400
Just go.

2998
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,470
To go backward... What? How does it work?

2999
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:46,040
Just go.

3000
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,110
Just go.

3001
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:49,140
To go backward...

3002
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:51,610
(This bicycle can't go backward.)

3003
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:50,280
- What? How does it work? - I'll do it.

3004
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,480
I'll do it. Stay still.

3005
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,780
- Okay. - I can't believe you.

3006
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:56,480
(The one sitting at the back is a burden to the other.)

3007
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:53,910
How does it work?

3008
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:55,580
- I guess it doesn't work. - It won't go this way.

3009
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:56,780
- I'll pedal. - Okay.

3010
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,590
It doesn't go this way.

3011
01:16:58,590 --> 01:17:00,190
- Doesn't it work that way? - Only that side works.

3012
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:02,090
(Kim Muscles is the only one who can pedal.)

3013
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:01,590
- I... - Does it have to be this side?

3014
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:04,590
(Laughing)

3015
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:08,460
(Ddochi speeds up without any burden to carry.)

3016
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,800
(Singleton Ye Eun is the 1st to arrive in front of the balloons.)

3017
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,600
From here?

3018
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,040
(Missed)

3019
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:15,000
Darn it.

3020
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:17,670
(Pop)

3021
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:17,740
Why are you so bad at it?

3022
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:18,810
What?

3023
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:22,040
(Empty)

3024
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:21,070
- Why are you so bad at it? - What?

3025
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:22,510
- Do I need to bring them again? - What?

3026
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:24,980
The right side is empty. We need to hit the left side.

3027
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:25,910
(All the words are on the left side of the board.)

3028
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,010
- Yes. - All right.

3029
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:27,780
What? Do I need to bring them again?

3030
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:30,080
(The rest of the couples start throwing the darts.)

3031
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:28,820
- What? - Again.

3032
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,250
In.

3033
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:34,290
In.

3034
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:36,960
(A word appears for the first time.)

3035
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:37,820
I can't see it.

3036
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:39,630
- Name. It's a name. - It's over.

3037
01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:41,190
- I can't see it. - Name.

3038
01:17:39,690 --> 01:17:41,230
(Where)

3039
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:43,060
- It's a name. - It's over.

3040
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:43,000
(Unit)

3041
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:47,400
- Give it to me. - What should we do?

3042
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:47,200
(Missed)

3043
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:48,740
- What should we do? - Give me one.

3044
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:49,940
- There's only one. - Gosh.

3045
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,310
Hey. How...

3046
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,770
(Ah Young grabbed only 1 dart as it was hectic.)

3047
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:54,040
- One. - There's only one.

3048
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:56,380
- The brakes. - All right. Get off.

3049
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:57,410
(Right then, the couple on a backward bicycle arrived.)

3050
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,150
- Get off. Throw them. - Shall I get off?

3051
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:00,610
(The dart lover Seok Sam will throw the darts.)

3052
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:00,380
Over there.

3053
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:02,550
(Unit, where)

3054
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:03,220
- What? - "Are in..."

3055
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:04,150
(Belongs)

3056
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,250
- "Are in..." - Can you hit the balloons?

3057
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:05,320
Throw it.

3058
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:08,060
- What? Gosh. - Get on.

3059
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:08,120
(Covered by the balloon that popped)

3060
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,090
- Hold on. - Get on.

3061
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,990
(Getting on the bicycle again without any particular gain)

3062
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:11,660
Done?

3063
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,060
Did you get on?

3064
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:14,660
- This is nonsense. - Did you get on?

3065
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:18,430
(Right then, Singleton Ye Eun returns with darts.)

3066
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:16,400
What's this?

3067
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:21,130
(Belongs, where, unit)

3068
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:22,240
(What is...)

3069
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:22,340
Yes.

3070
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:23,900
For goodness' sake.

3071
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:27,710
(Belongs, where, unit)

3072
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:28,140
Good.

3073
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,210
Where...

3074
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:30,640
(Ben)

3075
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:31,180
- "Ben." "Lon." - "Ben." "Lon."

3076
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,510
(Lon)

3077
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:32,580
What's that?

3078
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,010
- Let's pop the first one. - No.

3079
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,480
(The marksman returns at an important moment.)

3080
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,250
(Missed)

3081
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,690
Gosh.

3082
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:40,350
Gosh.

3083
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,360
Seok Jin!

3084
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:45,660
Seok Jin!

3085
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:46,430
(He missed it again.)

3086
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:47,730
- For goodness' sake! - Gosh.

3087
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,230
(Frustrated)

3088
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,230
Hold on.

3089
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:52,070
(Seok Sam isn't so lucky with the darts today.)

3090
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:51,130
This is driving me crazy.

3091
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:52,200
- Get on. - This...

3092
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:53,830
Okay.

3093
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:56,970
- "Currency." "London Eye." - London?

3094
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,440
(Monetary unit)

3095
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,470
Okay. Currency.

3096
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,140
(Big Ben, London Eye, monetary unit)

3097
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:01,070
- Currency. London Eye. - London?

3098
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,140
London Eye.

3099
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:05,280
(Team KAI picked up keywords.)

3100
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:04,240
- The name of the currency. - "London Eye."

3101
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:06,280
What's the London Eye?

3102
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,380
- "Currency?" - "Currency."

3103
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:09,020
- What was the money called? - All right.

3104
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,680
- Currency. - What's the currency in Europe?

3105
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,020
- Euro. - No.

3106
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:13,320
(Wrong)

3107
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:14,150
- It isn't euro. - You need to move.

3108
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:17,860
(Couldn't think of Great Britain even after seeing London Eye)

3109
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,860
The currency in Europe.

3110
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:18,020
- Isn't it euro? Let me answer. - It isn't euro.

3111
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:19,830
I don't know. Why are the two of us a team?

3112
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:21,230
I don't know. What's the answer?

3113
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:22,530
- What was it? - Dollar? Franc?

3114
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:25,030
No, it isn't franc.

3115
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:27,830
We can say "Let me answer" after we throw it, right?

3116
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:27,970
(Right then)

3117
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:28,900
- I got it. - The United Kingdom.

3118
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:31,340
(Did Jae Seok figure out the answer?)

3119
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:30,570
All right. I got it.

3120
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:33,070
Throw it.

3121
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:34,540
(She throws the dart she brought.)

3122
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:37,810
Let me answer. Pound.

3123
01:19:38,410 --> 01:19:40,210
(Correct)

3124
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,210
Okay.

3125
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,520
Pound.

3126
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:46,090
(Jae Seok and Ah Young got it.)

3127
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,150
Okay.

3128
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:46,650
Jae Seok, you're the best.

3129
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:51,190
(Team KAI worked hard for nothing.)

3130
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:48,760
Did they get it right?

3131
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,760
Jae Seok is smart.

3132
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,160
- The Big Ben and London Eye. - Currency? Hey.

3133
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:55,460
- It's the name of the currency. - The name of the currency.

3134
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,830
- At the very bottom. - For goodness' sake.

3135
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:57,060
(Tottenham Hotspur FC, where Son Heung Min is signed with,)

3136
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:58,170
Then we would've gotten it right.

3137
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,130
(is in this country.)

3138
01:19:58,130 --> 01:19:59,170
(Big Ben and London Eye are also in this country.)

3139
01:19:58,170 --> 01:19:59,370
Pound.

3140
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:01,370
(What's the currency of this country?)

3141
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:00,800
We had euro.

3142
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,100
- We have the 1st place. - Okay. We placed 1st.

3143
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:05,970
(Jae Seok and Ah Young get 1 badge and make it out.)

3144
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:06,210
You're amazing. You're the best.

3145
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:08,810
You need to throw them better!

3146
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:12,080
- Why are you so bad at it? - It isn't like that.

3147
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:15,180
(Mr. Jee has the worst hit rate.)

3148
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:14,080
- Throw them like this. - It isn't easy.

3149
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,150
- It's like playing darts. - I'll throw them.

3150
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:17,980
You're amazing.

3151
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:19,820
Ye Eun.

3152
01:20:20,390 --> 01:20:23,960
- I don't know the answer. - I get lucky with the matches.

3153
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,390
- I don't know the answer. - I don't think you can do this.

3154
01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:28,600
(That's right.)

3155
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,230
I can't answer correctly.

3156
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,400
For goodness' sake.

3157
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,400
Hey, just now, Ah Young...

3158
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,370
aggravated Ye Eun again.

3159
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:37,800
(Ah Young gets under Ye Eun's skin again.)

3160
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:36,440
"I get lucky with the matches."

3161
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:38,970
- It's true. - You're so aggravating.

3162
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:40,540
It's true.

3163
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:42,740
It's time for the second round.

3164
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:44,340
(The second round commences.)

3165
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:43,780
Okay.

3166
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:45,350
- It's so funny... - Get ready.

3167
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:46,580
- to watch them. - Come on.

3168
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:47,950
(Start)

3169
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:47,910
- Look at Seok Jin. - It's so funny.

3170
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:49,680
- Just follow me. - It drives me crazy to go backward.

3171
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:52,790
(The backward riding makes him nauseous.)

3172
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:52,420
- Seok Jin. - Why did we pick this one?

3173
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:54,050
This is driving me crazy.

3174
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:57,090
What's that?

3175
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:58,290
That's so funny.

3176
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:03,060
(The young ones quickly take the darts.)

3177
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:02,430
- Okay. - He's fast.

3178
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,130
We're only good at going fast.

3179
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:08,200
I don't know the answer anyway.

3180
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:12,610
(The quick Empty Heads arrived.)

3181
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:12,870
Goodness.

3182
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:14,840
- Goodness. - I popped it.

3183
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:14,540
(Empty)

3184
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:16,380
(Grunting)

3185
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:16,940
There.

3186
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:21,150
(Bursting)

3187
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:21,250
Ye Eun is good at throwing.

3188
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:24,780
- Ye Eun is good at throwing. - Goodness.

3189
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,320
- This... - Aim for the lower ones.

3190
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,620
(Seok Sam gets ready to throw.)

3191
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:27,990
You should aim for the lower ones.

3192
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,260
Come on. Throw where there are many balloons.

3193
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,020
(He missed it again.)

3194
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,460
Come on, aim properly!

3195
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:37,000
Come on, aim properly!

3196
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,600
(He missed for the 5th time already.)

3197
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:39,470
- This... - The back...

3198
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:41,940
(Retreating without getting anything)

3199
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:41,740
You should hit the ones at the back. The front ones...

3200
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:46,040
- The bottom... - We should aim for the bottom.

3201
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:46,610
(The Mapo Siblings arrived.)

3202
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:48,940
They look like an old couple.

3203
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:50,680
What's this?

3204
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:51,910
- What's that? - That...

3205
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:54,150
What's that?

3206
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:56,480
(They finally see a word.)

3207
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:55,680
- "Perfect." - What?

3208
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:58,050
"Perfect." "Everything perfect..."

3209
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:00,850
(Perfect)

3210
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:01,390
"Exaggeration?"

3211
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:03,790
(Perfect, exaggeration)

3212
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:03,960
"Exaggeration?"

3213
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:07,130
(This isn't enough.)

3214
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:07,960
"Perfectly." "Perfect."

3215
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:09,200
"Perfect..."

3216
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,230
(Goodness)

3217
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,300
Goodness.

3218
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:17,140
(The anger came out from deep inside of her.)

3219
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:15,400
Goodness.

3220
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:19,440
- Don't curse. - Ye Eun.

3221
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,110
- Ye Eun. - Hold it in. Don't get angry.

3222
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:22,680
(Her personality is getting worse in real time.)

3223
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:23,910
What is going on?

3224
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:25,850
(Seok Sam returned again.)

3225
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:25,910
This side. Goodness.

3226
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,850
This side. Goodness. Why is it so hard?

3227
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:28,850
(Empty space)

3228
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:32,490
Aim for the ones on this side. That side has no words.

3229
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:33,490
That side has no words.

3230
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:35,360
There are no words there!

3231
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,760
There are no words there.

3232
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:38,020
(It's an empty space again.)

3233
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:41,090
You can see there are no words there. They're all here.

3234
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:41,700
(Infuriated)

3235
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:43,230
- Why isn't it getting hit? - Let's go quickly.

3236
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:46,600
(It's a talent to hit the empty spots too.)

3237
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,970
- How did this pair form? - Hurry and get on.

3238
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:46,970
Hurry and get on.

3239
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:49,200
- This is so funny. - I didn't hit it even once.

3240
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,670
- "Over." - "Over."

3241
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,740
(That moment)

3242
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:56,980
(Over)

3243
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:54,840
- "Over." - It looks like "over," right?

3244
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,710
I don't know the answer. Let's go.

3245
01:22:56,980 --> 01:23:00,310
(KAI and Se Chan use their bodies instead of their heads.)

3246
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:03,320
(He developed a new skill too.)

3247
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:04,820
Hurry up and throw.

3248
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:06,850
(The ace marksman returned again.)

3249
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:06,250
Wait. We don't need to rush.

3250
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,050
- Wait. We don't need to rush. - Yes.

3251
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:10,660
- You don't need to rush. - Others are saying the answer.

3252
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:12,960
Goodness.

3253
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:15,800
Goodness.

3254
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:17,000
(It brushed against the side of the balloon.)

3255
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,100
That was bold.

3256
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,100
Goodness.

3257
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,700
(He aims and throws again.)

3258
01:23:20,730 --> 01:23:21,840
This is funny.

3259
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,570
This is funny.

3260
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:25,910
Darn it.

3261
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,740
(It's a new record of 8 misses in a row.)

3262
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:28,780
Sorry. How is this possible?

3263
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,750
(It's the energetic young men's turn.)

3264
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:31,980
- We don't need, "What is this?" - Get going.

3265
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:35,120
We don't need, "What is this?" We should aim for the upper ones.

3266
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:36,020
(KAI suggests they aim for the balloons on top.)

3267
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:38,950
- Right. "Visual." - "Visual?"

3268
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:38,320
(Visual)

3269
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:42,920
It's "visual," right? Let me answer. "KAI."

3270
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,130
(Wrong)

3271
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:45,560
Are you serious?

3272
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:48,090
- The spirit and confidence. - You have a good spirit, KAI.

3273
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:50,260
(The high spirit of the man who got discharged two months ago)

3274
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,260
- Seriously. - Is it wrong?

3275
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,700
(Confident)

3276
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:54,030
Since you're all here, I'll give you a hint.

3277
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:54,900
(Providing a hint)

3278
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:56,670
It's a newly coined term, and it's in English.

3279
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,570
- A newly coined term? - Say it and leave.

3280
01:23:57,540 --> 01:24:01,140
(Visual, perfect, over, exaggeration)

3281
01:23:58,570 --> 01:23:59,640
"Perfect?"

3282
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:03,080
You have to know what the words on top are.

3283
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,680
What is it?

3284
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,050
(Food)

3285
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:09,050
"Food?" It's food.

3286
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:10,620
(Food, English, newly coined term?)

3287
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:10,450
- Food? - Food.

3288
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:12,750
"Food," "visual," and "perfect." Is it "sexy food?"

3289
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:14,450
Let me answer! "Sexy food."

3290
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:16,990
("Sexy food" is correct.)

3291
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,160
What?

3292
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,760
I got it right!

3293
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,560
- I got it right! Sexy food! - Sexy food!

3294
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,160
- What? - What is it?

3295
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:21,690
(Cheering)

3296
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:25,670
- Sexy food. - What is he doing?

3297
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:26,900
Let's do it.

3298
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:30,170
(The wild "Wait On Me" celebration)

3299
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:29,970
Sexy food.

3300
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:32,270
Sexy food.

3301
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,540
(KAI and Se Chan are in 2nd place.)

3302
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:34,270
- Sexy food. - Who made this?

3303
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:36,040
Seriously.

3304
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:36,980
(Crying)

3305
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,340
That was good!

3306
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:40,080
- What happened Ye Eun? - Yes?

3307
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,180
Ji Ye Eun.

3308
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:45,320
(Even with the bicycle, Ye Eun can't get a good result.)

3309
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:43,550
- Seriously. - I knew it. Go.

3310
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:45,150
- Go, Ye Eun. - It's there.

3311
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:47,050
Go, Ji Ye Eun!

3312
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:48,860
Ready, go!

3313
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:50,220
(The next round commences.)

3314
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,660
- Let's get this one right. - Hey.

3315
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:53,460
- Quickly go. - "Germany?"

3316
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,560
(The first word is "Germany.")

3317
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:54,630
Let's go.

3318
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:57,560
(Meat)

3319
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,960
"Meat."

3320
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,400
(Name of a place)

3321
01:24:58,900 --> 01:24:59,970
"Name of a place."

3322
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:02,770
(Germany, meat,)

3323
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:01,400
Honestly.

3324
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:02,570
- Good. - "Vegetables."

3325
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:04,040
"Meat and vegetables."

3326
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:04,400
(vegetable, Hamburg?)

3327
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,110
(It's one of the most popular fast foods made with meat...)

3328
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:05,970
It's a food.

3329
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:07,770
(and vegetables between buns. The name derives from Hamburg.)

3330
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:07,770
- Hamburger! - Hamburger!

3331
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:10,540
(The answer is hamburger.)

3332
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:10,810
- What is that? - Seriously?

3333
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,010
- I knew it. - What?

3334
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:14,580
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook are the third to escape!)

3335
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:13,650
- Hamburger. - They got it.

3336
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:19,050
This is the last question.

3337
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:19,250
(It's the last round.)

3338
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:20,520
Seriously.

3339
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:21,390
(The round to decide who will come in last)

3340
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,820
It's Ye Eun versus us two.

3341
01:25:21,390 --> 01:25:22,990
(Ji Hyo and Haha versus Ye Eun)

3342
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:25,090
I can't get the answer because I'm stupid.

3343
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,330
That's not true. We're stupid too.

3344
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:29,560
Don't give up, Ye Eun!

3345
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:32,800
- We'll give you 4 darts now. - You can take 4 darts.

3346
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,500
(For the last round, they're given four darts.)

3347
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:34,370
Ready.

3348
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:35,540
I'm tearing up.

3349
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,970
Go, Ye Eun.

3350
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,440
(Start)

3351
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:38,000
Darn it.

3352
01:25:38,670 --> 01:25:39,940
It has started now.

3353
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:42,010
- You should come from behind. - You have to take that.

3354
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,640
- Let's hit them at once. - Why are you being dragged?

3355
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:45,980
(Both teams are extremely tired.)

3356
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:45,610
- She's being dragged. - Slowly.

3357
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:47,250
- I'll go. - This is the start.

3358
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:48,110
(Haha goes first.)

3359
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:48,820
- Okay. - "For."

3360
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:50,980
(For)

3361
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:50,950
- Okay. - "For."

3362
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:53,450
- "Yeol." - Yeol Ramyeon.

3363
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:55,260
- "With yeol." - "Yeol." What?

3364
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:57,560
(Yeol)

3365
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:57,560
- What is it? - "Yeol."

3366
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,630
- Hurry up. - Throw.

3367
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:00,030
(It's Ddochi's turn.)

3368
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:00,630
- "Written." - "Written."

3369
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:03,900
(Written)

3370
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:02,060
- "Written." - You have to shout the answer.

3371
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,930
- Goodness. - "Written."

3372
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:05,670
There.

3373
01:26:06,570 --> 01:26:10,570
(For, yeol)

3374
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:09,770
- That was good. "For." - "For."

3375
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:11,910
- It's that one. - You have three seconds. Three...

3376
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:13,570
(For?)

3377
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:14,370
- "For." - Say it. It should have ended.

3378
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:16,080
- Two. - Let me answer! A toast.

3379
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,640
- "A toast." - A toast.

3380
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:18,080
(Wrong)

3381
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:20,310
- A toast? "For." - Let me answer!

3382
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:21,350
Let me answer!

3383
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:24,320
YIN. Youth is now!

3384
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,850
(Wrong)

3385
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:25,790
Goodness.

3386
01:26:26,190 --> 01:26:27,190
Let's go.

3387
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:32,990
(For, yeol, written)

3388
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,190
We might not know the answer even if we pop all the balloons.

3389
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:30,460
You might have an advantage.

3390
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,090
That's the answer.

3391
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:34,830
- What is it? - Seok Jin.

3392
01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:36,530
- "Fur Elise." - Let me answer.

3393
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:38,530
- It's "Fur Elise." - A toast.

3394
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:38,670
("Fur Elise")

3395
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:42,140
(Jong Kook noticed that the answer was "Fur Elise!")

3396
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:40,530
You can do it, Ye Eun.

3397
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:41,970
You have to hurry.

3398
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:44,270
- You have to hurry. - You might have an advantage.

3399
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:45,240
(It's a piano piece.)

3400
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:45,270
This...

3401
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:49,580
(Written, "Fur Elise")

3402
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:47,040
- What is it? - "Passion?"

3403
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,040
"Efforts?"

3404
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:52,110
(Ye Eun who won the piano contest also noticed what the answer is!)

3405
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,980
She would get it correct.

3406
01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:53,650
I think you can get it.

3407
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:55,110
I can get it.

3408
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:56,650
- You can get it. - It's very advantageous for you.

3409
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:59,920
Show us your power, Ye Eun.

3410
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,490
Do it well. Do it slowly.

3411
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:03,020
(Written, "Fur Elise")

3412
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:02,820
That's right.

3413
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:08,030
("Fur Elise" and "written?")

3414
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:06,030
- "Written." - "Written."

3415
01:27:06,030 --> 01:27:07,190
"Written."

3416
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,160
- There! - You should shout the answer.

3417
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,200
Let me answer!

3418
01:27:10,530 --> 01:27:13,970
(If Ye Eun gets it correct, she won't be the last anymore!)

3419
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:15,030
Let me answer! Beethoven.

3420
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:16,740
(The answer is Beethoven.)

3421
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:17,600
Beethoven.

3422
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:20,010
(Ji Ye Eun got it correct.)

3423
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:21,570
- How did you know? - She plays the piano.

3424
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:23,310
(Dejected)

3425
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:22,910
She plays the piano.

3426
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:25,040
- Really? - How did you know?

3427
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:26,880
(We're proud of her for not confusing it with Mozart.)

3428
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,780
Is it "Fur Elise?"

3429
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:29,420
(The old couple of Mapo is in last place.)

3430
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:28,650
- We're the last. - What is this?

3431
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:30,780
According to the current rank,

3432
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:37,360
(The result of the mission)

3433
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:32,850
Team Jae Seok and Ah Young in first place...

3434
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:34,650
- will get one each. - Okay!

3435
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:37,460
The last team will get five each.

3436
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:39,760
We'll set the final couples...

3437
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,200
and choose those who will get the reward and punishment.

3438
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,160
One basic badge will be in the ballot box.

3439
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,570
Write your name on the back of the badge you earned.

3440
01:27:48,570 --> 01:27:49,840
- Write our names. - We'll collect them together...

3441
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,270
- and drawing them one by one. - We'll be drawing.

3442
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:55,210
The couples will form in the order of the names drawn.

3443
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,870
(Couple 1: Jong Kook, Jae Seok, Couple 2: Ji Hyo, Seok Jin)

3444
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:56,580
(Couple 3: Ye Eun, KAI, Couple 4: Ah Young, Haha)

3445
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:57,410
- This is the last set of couples. - Being solo is amazing.

3446
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:57,710
(Singleton: Se Chan)

3447
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:59,950
The couple that gets matched sooner...

3448
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:01,680
will get a more severe penalty.

3449
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:04,550
- And the person whose name... - Doesn't get picked.

3450
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:06,220
doesn't get picked until the end will get a prize.

3451
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:07,950
- Just one person. - One person?

3452
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:09,090
- One person. - That's too hard.

3453
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:12,830
If you become the first couple, you will share jjajang ramyeon...

3454
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,290
- We will give it to them. - to the single people.

3455
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:17,560
The second couple will stamp your face with an ink sponge.

3456
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:18,900
The third will get splashed with water.

3457
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,230
- The water splashing is better. - The fourth...

3458
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:22,940
will get a finger flick.

3459
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:24,570
I think getting splashed with water is the best option.

3460
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:25,710
- Right. - It's simple.

3461
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,910
(A neat water slap for a rainy day)

3462
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:27,070
- The water splashing is better. - We should be the third.

3463
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:29,880
(The final number of badges)

3464
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:28,680
- Do we write our names? - You're not writing...

3465
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:29,880
other people's names, right?

3466
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,780
Mix it well, Jae Seok.

3467
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:32,850
(Haha and Ji Hyo: 7, Seok Sam and Ye Eun: 6)

3468
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:33,580
- I'll mix it well. - Okay.

3469
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:34,410
(Jong Kook and Se Chan: 5, KAI and Ah Young: 4)

3470
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:36,250
(Jae Seok: 3)

3471
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:36,380
The first person.

3472
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:38,650
(The penalty is the most bothersome one.)

3473
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:38,080
- Do it well. - Jjajang ramyeon.

3474
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:39,820
It's giving out jjajang ramyeon.

3475
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:42,820
(They have to give out jjajang ramyeon.)

3476
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:41,990
- Please. - Jjajang ramyeon.

3477
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:44,820
- I picked the first person. - Okay.

3478
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:46,630
- Is it bad? - Jjajang ramyeon.

3479
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:50,400
(Who will be giving out the jjajang ramyeon?)

3480
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:48,700
- It takes a long time. - Because of the long time?

3481
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:50,500
- Is it bad? - Hold on.

3482
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:51,960
- Who is it? - What's the matter?

3483
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:56,340
- Who is this? It's Se Chan. - Se Chan. It's bad, right?

3484
01:28:55,970 --> 01:29:00,670
(He has 5 badges, but he got the worst penalty.)

3485
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:57,970
Bye.

3486
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:59,270
- It's bothersome. - Se Chan.

3487
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:00,910
- What is this? - What?

3488
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:02,980
- What is this? - How many do you have? Five?

3489
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:05,080
- One more person will give it out. - One more.

3490
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:06,250
Isn't jjajang ramyeon good?

3491
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:08,550
Isn't it 1 person giving out the jjajang ramyeon? Is it 2?

3492
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:10,180
(Who will join Se Chan for the penalty?)

3493
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:10,320
- One couple. - One couple.

3494
01:29:11,450 --> 01:29:13,120
- Who is this? - Who is it?

3495
01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:14,890
- P? - Ji Hyo!

3496
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:16,920
- Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

3497
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:19,090
(The couple to give out jjajang ramyeon: Se Chan and Ji Hyo)

3498
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,860
- No! - Ji Hyo and Se Chan...

3499
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:20,190
- No. - are the first couple.

3500
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:23,300
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo got the most bothersome penalty.)

3501
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:21,530
- Ye Eun. - Is it bad?

3502
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,400
- It's Ji Hyo. - They'll be going home late.

3503
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,030
- The ink sponge is fine too. - The ink sponge.

3504
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:28,200
(The next couple will get ink sponge as a penalty.)

3505
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:28,430
- The next person. - Who is it?

3506
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:29,940
- Ji Ye Eun. - Ji Ye Eun.

3507
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:30,340
(The couple to give out jjajang ramyeon: Se Chan and Ji Hyo)

3508
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:31,070
Seok Jin.

3509
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:36,810
(The couple to get ink sponge: Seok Jin and Ye Eun)

3510
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:32,670
Jee and Ji.

3511
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:34,110
- Ink! - Ink.

3512
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:35,610
- Ah Young. - Ah Young.

3513
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:37,080
- Goodness. - Ah Young.

3514
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:40,350
(The couple to get a water slap: Ah Young and Jong Kook)

3515
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,180
- Jong Kook. - The water splashing is fine.

3516
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:39,310
- It's fine. - Is it good?

3517
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:40,550
- Really? - The water splashing is better.

3518
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:42,050
Who are the people left?

3519
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:43,380
(The remaining members are Jae Seok, Haha, and KAI.)

3520
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:43,280
Wait. That's me.

3521
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,790
One of you will be solo...

3522
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:46,850
(Two of them will get flicked, and one will win the prize.)

3523
01:29:45,790 --> 01:29:47,550
- and win the prize. - I have a chance.

3524
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:48,020
(The total number of badges)

3525
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:48,890
I have a chance.

3526
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:52,390
(Haha: 7, KAI: 4, Jae Seok: 3)

3527
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:50,290
If you're picked, you're a couple.

3528
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:53,060
- It's a finger flick now. - Finger flick.

3529
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:56,060
(The people who are picked now will get a finger flick.)

3530
01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:55,860
- It's a finger flick now. - Finger flick.

3531
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:57,600
- This is the worst. - Please.

3532
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,870
- It's me. - Yu!

3533
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:02,200
- We survived, Haha! - Yu!

3534
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:03,240
(Jae Seok gets a finger flick.)

3535
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:04,500
- We survived, Haha! - Yu!

3536
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,470
(The remaining members are KAI and Haha.)

3537
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,740
- It's the last one. - Yes!

3538
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,270
We don't know it yet.

3539
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:09,110
(Haha: 7, KAI: 4)

3540
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:10,240
- You win if you don't get picked. - My partner.

3541
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:10,810
(If they get picked, they'll be flicked.)

3542
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,210
- I have a chance. - It'll be amazing if it's not him.

3543
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:13,410
(If not, then they'll get the prize.)

3544
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,480
The beginning and the end.

3545
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,780
- This is my first time. - Who is it?

3546
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:17,750
(Who is the unfortunate man whose name is picked at the end?)

3547
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:17,250
This is my first time.

3548
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:18,480
Who is it?

3549
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,550
Haha.

3550
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,120
(Haha gets a finger flick.)

3551
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:25,630
(KAI is the last singleton.)

3552
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:23,690
- I'm single! - KAI.

3553
01:30:23,690 --> 01:30:24,890
Haha.

3554
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:26,760
- I'm single! - KAI.

3555
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:29,060
- It's unbelievable. - I'm single!

3556
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:30,960
- That's my spirit. - This is crazy.

3557
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,830
(Lucky KAI started as a singleton and ended as a singleton.)

3558
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,030
Jae Seok.

3559
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,930
- It's all about the spirit. - How did you do that?

3560
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:35,900
- What's happening to you? - I did it.

3561
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,970
- Your new song will be successful. - I think it will go well.

3562
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:39,310
- It will be successful. - It will be.

3563
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,010
(Happy)

3564
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:40,710
- Seriously. - You're lucky.

3565
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:42,840
We will bring in...

3566
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,440
- the prize first. - My gosh.

3567
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,680
KAI, who is confirmed to be the singleton,

3568
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,120
will get a box of jjajang ramyeon...

3569
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,580
- as a prize. - That's nice.

3570
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:51,880
- It's really nice. - I love it.

3571
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:55,760
(A prize befitting Black Day)

3572
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,290
- I love it. - It's perfect.

3573
01:30:53,290 --> 01:30:54,690
Isn't it nice?

3574
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:56,720
- How nice. - It must be delicious.

3575
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:59,860
(Time to get flicked.)

3576
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,390
We will start with the finger flick.

3577
01:30:58,390 --> 01:30:59,490
- Let's do that. - Okay.

3578
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:00,560
- Here I go. I'm weak. - Okay.

3579
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:03,830
(KAI gives Jae Seok a finger flick.)

3580
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:04,460
It was loud.

3581
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,930
(Ah Young gives Haha a finger flick.)

3582
01:31:07,030 --> 01:31:08,100
Three.

3583
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:11,070
(Se Chan gives Ah Young a water slap.)

3584
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,270
That's it.

3585
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,170
It hit her in the face.

3586
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:13,410
(Ttuk gives Kook a water slap.)

3587
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:13,440
- It went in my ear. - Oh, no.

3588
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,610
Start.

3589
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:15,780
- Rub it. - All right.

3590
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:17,740
(Seok Jin and Ye Eun paint each other's faces with ink.)

3591
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:17,540
Do you have to do that?

3592
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:18,980
- Oh, no. - Okay.

3593
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:22,780
(They're done putting on the ink makeup.)

3594
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,780
- That's it. - Good.

3595
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,650
That's nice.

3596
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:25,820
One, two.

3597
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:26,820
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3598
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,820
(Everyone gets off work except for Se Chan and Ji Hyo...)

3599
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:28,960
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

3600
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:29,720
(who must stay behind for extra work.)

3601
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,020
That was nice.

3602
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:31,060
Hello.

3603
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,230
Are you single?

3604
01:31:32,230 --> 01:31:34,190
We're giving out presents for Black Day. Are you single?

3605
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:36,030
I'm not single.

3606
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:37,430
I'm sorry.

3607
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,730
Please live happily.

3608
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,930
(Embarrassed)

3609
01:31:38,730 --> 01:31:40,930
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

3610
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:42,100
I can't give this to them.

3611
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:44,340
Why are there no people here?

3612
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:46,070
(Waiting in front of another TV station in Yeouido)

3613
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:45,610
Because it's raining.

3614
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:48,170
- Hello. - It can't be her.

3615
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:49,380
You should watch carefully.

3616
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:51,280
(Ji Hyo isn't prejudiced about age.)

3617
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:51,110
She can't be single. Ji Hyo.

3618
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:52,850
- Ma'am. - She probably has a grandchild.

3619
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:55,150
Ma'am, are you single?

3620
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:56,850
Is anyone here single?

3621
01:31:55,310 --> 01:31:59,950
