1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,440
It's raining.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,070
- It's raining.
- It's so cool and nice.

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,180
- This much rain isn't so bad.
- It's good.

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,380
Ye Eun, there's the coffee truck.

5
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,580
It's the coffee truck.

6
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,050
You ordered a coffee truck.

7
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,080
Where's the coffee truck?

8
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,550
- It's right there.
- Where?

9
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,750
- The coffee truck.
- Chungju Ji and Jee's coffee truck.

10
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,160
- It's the coffee truck.
- Okay. Good.

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,760
(Chungju Ji and Jee prepared
the coffee truck for the staff.)

12
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,760
(Why did Seok Jin and Ye Eun
call the coffee truck?)

13
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,060
- Good luck with "Milkshake."
- Good luck with "Milkshake."

14
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,330
(They accepted the members' opinion
about paying money for promotions.)

15
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,570
(For an entire song,
they have to order a coffee truck.)

16
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,710
(They desperately tried to avoid
ordering a coffee truck,)

17
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,480
(but the song stopped
right before the chorus part.)

18
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,680
(So they ordered a coffee truck
and performed the entire song.)

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,950
- Ye Eun! It must be delicious.
- My gosh.

20
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,150
- It's cute.
- My gosh.

21
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,690
- It looks cute.
- Hello.

22
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,120
It's so cute.

23
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,760
- Hello.
- It's so cute.

24
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,460
- The churro is good.
- Yes.

25
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,900
The latte tastes good.

26
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,030
Thank you for the food.

27
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,830
It looks like
Seok Jin is wearing a wig.

28
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,040
You're right. He looks so young
in the photo.

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,070
I know.

30
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,140
- It's creepy.
- Yes. It actually feels creepy.

31
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,540
I know.

32
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,040
- He looks too young.
- Seok Jin.

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,410
- Yes.
- The face is photoshopped too much.

34
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,250
- Seok Jin, Ye Eun...
- Actually, it's too much.

35
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,980
Are you Ye Eun's younger brother
or what?

36
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,490
This is too much.

37
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,550
You look like
Ye Eun's younger brother.

38
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,560
- What's this?
- This is too much.

39
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,660
- I just saw this.
- It is embarrassing.

40
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,890
The photo... They have the photo.

41
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,260
- The photo is too much.
- It's just...

42
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,800
He looks too young.

43
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,530
But I didn't do that.

44
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,600
Thank you anyway.
We lack in many ways, but...

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,140
- Thank you, Chungju Ji and Jee.
- Thank you.

46
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,170
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

47
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,870
- It's nice to have some food.
- Yes.

48
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,240
- You're right.
- Seok Jin, I heard...

49
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,710
- you went 50-50 on the bill...
- What?

50
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,740
- with Ye Eun.
- Did you go half and half?

51
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,780
Yes. We split the bill.

52
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,780
Isn't it the right thing to do?

53
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,580
- Come on, Seok Jin.
- My goodness.

54
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,320
- You split the bill?
- I mean...

55
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,520
- We split the bill.
- They did.

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,120
- Aren't you being too thorough?
- Ye Eun also...

57
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,020
- Are you okay, Ye Eun?
- Chungju Ji and Jee...

58
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,860
- Hey, you...
- She should have responsibility.

59
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,260
- We went half and half.
- Ye Eun also... She...

60
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,260
- The entire work...
- Hang on. Hey.

61
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,060
- Half of the cost...
- What is going on here?

62
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,170
- What?
- What did you just do?

63
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,970
- Seok Jin, I...
- Can I hang mine here?

64
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,970
Is she an umbrella stand?

65
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,040
- I saw she had it here.
- He thinks I'm an umbrella stand.

66
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,510
- But...
- I'm sorry, but...

67
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,410
- He did it so spontaneously.
- Ji Hyo, have you been...

68
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,640
eating Ye Eun's food lately?

69
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,650
Ji Hyo is getting bigger,
and Ye Eun is getting smaller.

70
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,050
It takes skills to bulk up.

71
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,180
- Is that so?
- Do you know that?

72
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,150
- Yes. You're right.
- You need skills.

73
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,550
She's just puffy.

74
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,150
- Okay.
- Because it's early in the morning.

75
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,390
- By the way, Ye Eun...
- We should put her at ease.

76
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,690
Ye Eun had her place redecorated.

77
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,760
- Aren't we going to her place?
- Isn't she having a housewarming?

78
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,260
- You can come to my place now.
- Can we go?

79
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,260
- You can come.
- Can we?

80
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,430
- Did you move?
- It's over now.

81
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,470
Are we going to her place
on Running Man?

82
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,530
Tell me if you're not.
I'll go on "Jeeseokjin World."

83
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,970
I'm joking.

84
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,770
We will plan something later.

85
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,470
It's not fun. Boo.

86
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,640
They weren't saying anything,

87
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,780
so he apologized
after bringing that up.

88
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,880
"Let's go there. I'm sorry."

89
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,050
It's not funny!

90
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,350
- Boo.
- What was that?

91
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,320
(He changed his words as fast
as a Chinese face change show.)

92
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,650
Jee Seok Sam is not funny.

93
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,960
- Jae Seok.
- Yes?

94
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,590
- These days...
- I saw on the news...

95
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,860
that you were recommended
as the Minister of Culture.

96
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,860
That's right!

97
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,760
- Jae Seok.
- No. It wasn't just me.

98
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,530
You were recommended
as the Minister of Culture.

99
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,230
- You were recommended.
- What?

100
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,770
- Are you a minister?
- Yes.

101
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,530
- Are you a minister?
- Are you a minister?

102
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,770
- No.
- The people recommended him.

103
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,170
There are people who recommended me.
- If things go well...
- Recommended by the people.

104
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,510
If things go well,
we will have a minister here.

105
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,810
(Surprised)

106
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,810
- We have a minister here.
- My gosh.

107
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,640
- Jae Seok, I'm at your service.
- We're at your service.

108
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,950
- We're at your service.
- I told you.

109
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,350
This is how
he will become the President.

110
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,650
- This is the beginning.
- Right.

111
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,020
- This is...
- Please don't get the wrong idea.

112
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,960
- It's not something anyone can do.
- What?

113
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,460
- It's...
- Why would you say that?

114
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,530
- You're not just anyone.
- You're not just anyone.

115
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,160
I should get ready to become
the head of the Mapo-gu Office.

116
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,700
You should get ready to become
the head of the Yongsan-gu Office.

117
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
You should win an election for that.

118
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,530
I'm really excited.

119
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,140
- My goodness.
- Seriously...

120
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,770
All right. It's 7:30 a.m. now.

121
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,540
We are gathered
earlier than usual today.

122
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,610
- Why?
- Why so early?

123
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,710
Did you guys have breakfast?

124
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,350
- No.
- Not yet.

125
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,880
- I'm hungry.
- I...

126
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,520
Did you two have breakfast?

127
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,820
- I...
- I had some.

128
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,250
I had something from Mc Drive Thru.

129
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,050
- What time did you get up?
- At this early hour,

130
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,460
- did you have breakfast?
- How is that possible?

131
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,620
- My gosh.
- How can you be so diligent?

132
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,330
- I can't skip breakfast.
- I had a churro.

133
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,660
What did you have, Jae Seok?

134
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,700
He eats grilled yellow croaker
for breakfast.

135
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,860
- He sounds like a spoiled child.
- What did you eat?

136
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,730
- Do you eat yellow croaker?
- I had a simple breakfast today.

137
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,670
- I heated up some chicken breast...
- I see.

138
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,070
- Really? You did?
- and brown rice.

139
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,470
- I ate them with a few side dishes.
- My gosh.

140
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,580
- Because he doesn't eat after 5 p.m.
- Right.

141
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,150
And he goes to bed at 8 p.m.

142
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,150
- He's a baby.
- At 10 p.m.

143
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,180
- I go to bed at 10 p.m.
- He's like a baby.

144
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,950
- I went to bed at 10 p.m. last night.
- I see.

145
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,520
I'm feeling great today.

146
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,850
You look good.

147
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,390
- I look good, right?
- Seriously?

148
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,020
He does look like a little kid.

149
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,390
- Right.
- He's a little kid.

150
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,690
Kids are energetic
after breakfast in the morning.

151
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,130
- After having some milk.
- He's like a five-year-old kid.

152
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,270
This is really nice.
Can we keep doing this?

153
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,670
We gathered early in the morning
for a reason.

154
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,040
- Why?
- For the members...

155
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,040
who skip breakfast
on the day of the shoot,

156
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,980
we've prepared
the Miracle Breakfast Morning Race.

157
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,880
- Miracle Breakfast Morning?
- Breakfast Morning?

158
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,480
- Yes.
- But I had breakfast.

159
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,280
You two are the only ones who ate.

160
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
- The rest didn't eat.
- We didn't eat.
- I didn't eat.
- They didn't.

161
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,650
Do you remember that I asked you
what kind of breakfast...

162
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,650
you wanted to eat
regardless of the price...

163
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,220
- before the shoot?
- Yes.

164
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,020
That's why she asked it.

165
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,590
(A few days ago)

166
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,660
- Hi, Hyung In.
- Hello, Jong Kook.

167
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,900
Yes.

168
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,230
I have something...

169
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,800
to ask you because of the shoot.

170
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,640
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Yes.

171
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,640
- Regardless of the price,
- Yes.

172
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,580
what do you want to eat
for breakfast?

173
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,310
- Please tell me.
- Breakfast?

174
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,050
It'd be nice to go to a buffet.

175
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,750
A breakfast buffet?

176
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,190
Sunwoo Yong Yeo often
goes to a buffet for breakfast.

177
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,460
(Sunwoo Yong Yeo became the talk
of the town with her lifestyle.)

178
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,760
After my husband passed away...

179
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Who should I live for?

180
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,430
(A hotel buffet is
an investment in myself.)

181
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,330
A buffet has a variety
of nutritious foods.

182
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,900
(The next person
to ask the question)

183
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Hi, Hyung In.

184
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,310
Hello, Se Chan.

185
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,640
Hello?

186
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,440
Hello.

187
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,810
(Laughing)

188
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,910
What is going on?
What's with that voice?

189
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,320
- Breakfast?
- Yes.

190
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,620
Do I have to say the same thing
with the other members?

191
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,160
For breakfast, I'd like to have
a kind of gukbap. Sundaeguk.

192
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,430
- Sundaeguk?
- Yes.

193
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,260
Well...

194
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,060
Eggs Benedict.

195
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,730
Eggs Benedict?

196
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,900
I'd like to have...

197
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,170
I like naengmyeon. Mul naengmyeon.

198
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,540
Hamheung mul naengmyeon. It's good.

199
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,640
I think I'll change my mind later.
But for now, I want gamjatang.

200
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,880
Gamjatang?

201
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,510
I want Pyongyang naengmyeon
or clear beef bone soup.

202
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,980
Clear beef bone soup?

203
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,310
Yes.

204
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,180
Jae Seok is here with me.
Do you want to talk to him?

205
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,020
- Yes. Let me talk to him.
- Okay.

206
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,260
- What? Hello?
- Hello?

207
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,920
Hello, Jae Seok.

208
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,360
- Who is this?
- This is Director Choi Hyung In.

209
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,800
I'm sorry, but call me on my phone.

210
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,400
(Being playful)

211
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,130
Can we just talk now?

212
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,600
Okay. Go ahead. What do you want?

213
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,070
I have a question to ask you.

214
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,770
I'd like...

215
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,780
to have a steak.

216
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,910
- A steak?
- Yes.

217
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,880
- For breakfast?
- Tenderloin steak.

218
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,180
Tenderloin steak?

219
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,950
I'd like to have it
medium well-done.

220
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,520
A decent breakfast.
You know what I mean, right?

221
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,160
With some dinner rolls,
butter, strawberry jam,

222
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,160
soybean milk, and a fried egg.

223
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,730
- Okay. That's very detailed.
- All right.

224
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,330
Yes. I know what I want.

225
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,870
For breakfast, I want a lobster.

226
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,970
For breakfast?

227
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,640
Yes. I don't mind. I can eat it.

228
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,970
We might have it for breakfast
on Monday.

229
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,170
- Right.
- Yes?

230
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,740
- I will look forward to it.
- Okay.

231
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,150
- This is it.
- You should've told me.

232
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,680
She just asked it quickly
and hung up.

233
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,950
Jae Seok, who would have
a tenderloin steak for breakfast?

234
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,690
A decent tenderloin steak,
medium well-done.

235
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,290
Dinner rolls, strawberry jam,

236
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,890
- Exactly.
- soy milk, and a fried egg?

237
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,360
- What?
- That's it.

238
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,030
- That's it!
- Anyway, why...

239
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,100
- They're all good.
- Who has lobster?

240
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,560
- Steak?
- It's too dry for breakfast.

241
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,800
- And steak isn't?
- Look at what Haha chose.

242
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,500
Jong Kook chose a breakfast buffet.

243
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,470
- I recently met Sunwoo Yong Nyeo.
- Right.

244
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,510
She said...

245
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,540
she always ate at a buffet...

246
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,980
- for breakfast.
- Exactly.

247
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,880
- Hamheung mul naengmyeon.
- Mul naengmyeon.

248
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,010
- I love it.
- Eggs Benedict?

249
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,080
- Do you even know what that is?
- Eggs Benedict?

250
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,180
Do you know what that is?

251
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,950
- Eggs Benedict.
- Unbelievable.

252
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,180
Did you see it from somewhere?

253
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,650
- This is a good one.
- I want lobster.

254
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,020
Like that,

255
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,360
you chose what you wanted
for breakfast.

256
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,360
- With these nine dishes,
- Will we get to eat them?

257
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,130
you'll play bingo.

258
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,160
- Do we have to eat them all?
- Play bingo?

259
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,670
At least we'll get to eat something.

260
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,940
You'll win by completing a line
on your bingo card...

261
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,100
- before lunch at 12:30 p.m.
- Just one line?

262
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,540
- We need to eat at least three.
- Three meals.

263
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,640
- We're playing bingo.
- We need to eat three dishes.

264
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,710
If you succeed,
you'll get to go home immediately.

265
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,080
If you don't,
you'll receive a penalty.

266
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,980
This is how you'll play the game.

267
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,120
To people you meet,

268
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,980
you will ask what they want...

269
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,820
- for breakfast.
- Oh, no. We're doomed.

270
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,420
You must hear the exact words...

271
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,190
to cross out a square on the board.

272
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,390
You have to finish each dish...

273
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,630
- before moving on to the next.
- Really?

274
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,700
No one would pick lobster
as the food they want...

275
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,000
- for breakfast.
- No one would say that.

276
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,930
No one will want steak.

277
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,600
Please note this. Jae Seok listed...

278
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,400
- several things.
- Right.

279
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,070
Even if someone
gives you tenderloin steak,

280
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,340
you must eat everything there
for it to count.

281
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,240
- A dinner roll, strawberry jam,
- A dinner roll and strawberry jam.

282
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,840
- soy milk, and a fried egg.
- Was this necessary?

283
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,710
- He got greedy.
- I was asked what I wanted.

284
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,120
- That's...
- Those came to mind.

285
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,150
Seriously.

286
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,090
Haha received a special privilege
as Mr. Free Meals,

287
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,790
and both dishes he requested
were put up on the board.

288
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,090
There are obviously some dishes
that will be hard to get.

289
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,690
That's why we're giving you...

290
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,830
- a chance to play a game,
- Eggs Benedict?

291
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,460
so you can swap one of the dishes...

292
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,400
- you mentioned.
- What a relief.

293
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,570
- A dish people won't mention.
- I mean...

294
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,540
- Like lobster.
- No one would say that.

295
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,540
- No one would say lobster.
- We should take that off the board.

296
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,140
- What's that?
- What's that?

297
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,740
They're laying out a tarp.

298
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,910
Are we going to get wet this soon?

299
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,210
I wonder what this is.

300
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,680
There's something on the gloves.

301
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,980
We must be catching water balloons
wearing those.

302
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,980
The game...

303
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,020
- is Safe Water Balloon Delivery.
- Okay!

304
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,160
For 100 seconds,
4 members of your choice...

305
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,260
will wear sandpaper gloves...

306
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,090
and deliver water balloons
by throwing them, like a relay.

307
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,860
- Like a relay?
- A relay?

308
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,500
- They'll burst for sure.
- These aren't meant for throwing.

309
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,130
You will be given three attempts.

310
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,300
In those three rounds,

311
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,670
you must get 15 or more to succeed.

312
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,770
- Fifteen or more?
- Yes.

313
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,770
If you succeed,

314
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,010
- you'll get to swap a dish.
- Okay.

315
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,340
Can we use the back of our hands?

316
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,310
- The back of our hands.
- No, catch them palm-side up.

317
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,350
- Like this.
- No,

318
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,910
- catch them palm-side up.
- This is allowed, right?

319
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,150
(Like cat paws)

320
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,520
Don't tell them that.

321
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,320
Curl your fingers
like when you're cutting food.

322
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,290
Please choose the first four members
to play the game.

323
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,560
Four members.
For starters, that should be...

324
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,860
Hold on. Ji Hyo and Ye Eun...

325
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,530
- Have them play.
- will play at least once.

326
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,230
How about Seok Jin
who's been killing it?

327
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,430
- Seok Sam and...
- Right.

328
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,600
- Niel.
- Me?

329
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,670
- Niel.
- Yes.

330
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,410
(The three of them?)

331
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,710
- Hold on.
- Are you forfeiting this round?

332
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,070
Let's just see how you do.

333
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,710
I get it. We're getting rid
of the weakest links.

334
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,280
And Haha will join them.

335
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,550
Come on.
Why would you put me with them?

336
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,820
- You released a song recently.
- This is wrong.

337
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,880
- "Sunny Day."
- Right, his song.

338
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,420
Yes, he released a new song too.

339
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,660
(A rainy, yet sunny day)

340
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,720
Despite the tears

341
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,260
The four of you, please stand...

342
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,490
where the stickers are in order.

343
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,830
- Where?
- The rest...

344
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,300
- will sit.
- Someone should stand here.

345
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Okay, give it a try.

346
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,930
This won't be so hard.

347
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,700
Seok Jin, soft hands.

348
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,500
- Lower your hands as you catch it.
- Okay, got it.

349
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,370
- Also, move at a fast pace.
- Exactly.

350
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,810
You're getting 100 seconds,
so keep the relay going.

351
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,870
Ye Eun, look.

352
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,910
Don't catch like this.

353
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,010
As the balloon drops,

354
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,080
drop your hands too.

355
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,280
I'll throw with cat paws if able.

356
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,880
- Is this possible?
- It is.

357
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,820
- Move your hands with the balloon.
- Soft hands.

358
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,550
- Like this.
- Not like this.

359
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,490
(Player 3: Paper doll, Ddochi)

360
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,690
Will the balloons easily pop
because of the sandpaper?

361
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,990
- They would.
- Really?

362
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,090
Place them gently in the basket.

363
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,960
Sure. Right, I get it now.

364
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,530
- Shall we?
- Let's go!

365
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,660
Get ready.

366
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,730
(How many will Team Doomed
be able to get?)

367
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,370
What on earth?

368
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,430
Oh, no!

369
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,040
(The balloons pop
the moment he touches them.)

370
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,210
What's wrong?

371
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,910
Why is it so hard to grab one
of those?

372
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,780
There you go.

373
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,440
- Darn.
- My gosh.

374
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,680
- What...
- What is this?

375
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,780
- Hey!
- Oh, no.

376
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,510
- What is this?
- Come on.

377
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,520
- Wait. Do they burst that easily?
- That duo...

378
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,790
Look. That duo's ruining it.

379
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,490
This isn't as easy as it looks.

380
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,220
- They can't move forward.
- Hey.

381
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,220
They're still at the first step.

382
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,290
- Why are you throwing water?
- Seriously?

383
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,960
What are you guys doing?

384
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,160
- What on earth is this?
- Come on.

385
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,460
- It's impossible.
- Seok Jin!

386
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,570
- Why are you throwing water?
- What are you doing?

387
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,700
- What on earth is this?
- Haha!

388
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,770
- What...
- This is really tough.

389
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,840
Haha.

390
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,910
- Not like this.
- They're already popped.

391
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,070
Soft hands!

392
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,010
Seriously?

393
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,280
Seok Jin, not like that.
Bring it into the body.

394
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,550
(The gallery erupts
with harsh criticism.)

395
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,580
- Seok Jin, come on.
- Come on.

396
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,350
- Daniel's just standing there.
- Hold on.

397
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,550
Seok Jin, come on.

398
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,090
- Seok Jin!
- I'm good but...

399
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,460
It's good
we got to see them try first.

400
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,560
Careful.

401
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,760
(One was thrown and caught
for the first time!)

402
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,990
- Take your time.
- Hold on.

403
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,030
- Don't throw it far.
- Soft hands.

404
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,360
- Don't throw it far. Like that.
- Soft hands.

405
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,130
- There you go.
- Good.

406
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,700
(Even Ddochi, the weakest link,
managed to catch it.)

407
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,930
No, not like that.

408
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,100
(If Daniel catches it,)

409
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,940
(it'll be
their first successful delivery.)

410
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,000
In the basket.

411
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,440
(Pop)

412
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,740
Niel, come on!

413
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,540
Daniel hasn't been able
to catch one.

414
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,710
- Seriously?
- Niel, come on!

415
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,810
These gloves are no joke.

416
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,850
(Grabbing it by the knot)

417
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,220
- Okay.
- That's how you do it.

418
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,450
- You know what to do.
- Sure.

419
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,520
(They've gotten the hang of it!)

420
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,490
- You shouldn't throw it like that.
- They're doing all right.

421
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,490
(Another balloon pops.)

422
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,020
(The Beanpole Delivery Man
ruins it for the team.)

423
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,320
- Unbelievable.
- Niel!

424
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,720
- Niel's...
- I didn't think it'd pop.

425
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,590
Why is Niel bad at everything?

426
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,660
- Ye Eun's doing a great job.
- Aren't I good at this?

427
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,300
Look at Ye Eun.

428
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,570
Ye Eun's good at this.

429
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,900
- Look at Ye Eun.
- She's good at this.

430
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,640
- No way.
- How is she good at this?

431
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,940
No way.

432
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,440
- Nice!
- You've got it.

433
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,810
- Aren't I good at this?
- You're on a roll.

434
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,680
- Yes, like that.
- How do I pick this up?

435
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,510
- It didn't pop.
- Finally.

436
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,810
- That's it.
- Nice.

437
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,650
- Ye Eun's doing great.
- That's it. Good job.

438
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,920
I'm finally on a roll.

439
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,550
- Sorry about that.
- Niel can't even catch them.

440
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,620
There.

441
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,790
It didn't pop.

442
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,060
Haha, you need to throw them faster.

443
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,090
- Haha's taking too long.
- Why...

444
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,460
Should I throw it like that then?

445
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,860
- Are you trying to make us lose?
- Leave the floor, guys.

446
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,500
(Team Doomed only managed to get
2 out of 15.)

447
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,470
- This is tough.
- You only got two.

448
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,540
- That was hard.
- Two.

449
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,500
- It pops the second you touch it.
- Right?

450
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,440
Move out of the way.

451
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,470
- This looks tough.
- Come on.

452
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,740
Se Chan, you throw.

453
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,080
Jae Seok will go second.

454
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,780
- I'll go third.
- This isn't easy.

455
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,180
- Okay.
- Where do we stand?

456
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,180
Like I'm producing water balloons
in a factory,

457
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,520
- Okay.
- I'll throw them at this speed.

458
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,690
- I won't stop.
- Right away...

459
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,420
(Player 2: The confident locust)

460
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,490
Try it and then talk.

461
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,020
- Let's go.
- Try it and then talk.

462
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,430
We know how this should be done.

463
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,890
- This isn't easy.
- Like this.

464
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,330
- It's really tough.
- It's a challenge.

465
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,760
Get ready.

466
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,630
- Try it and then talk.
- Let's go.

467
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,870
Seriously?

468
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,970
- Hey!
- Oh, my.

469
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,800
(Popping)

470
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,740
Take your time!

471
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,070
Seriously?

472
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,140
What did I tell you?

473
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,840
- Come on!
- They're impossible to grab.

474
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,950
Hey!

475
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,810
(He finally throws one.)

476
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,620
(Splash)

477
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,420
- Jae Seok, what are you doing?
- Hey!

478
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,090
Se Chan, do better.

479
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,120
Don't throw them with one hand.

480
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,560
Seriously?

481
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,690
Only with one hand...

482
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,760
(So much for all the nagging)

483
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,890
Come on!

484
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,530
- What are you doing?
- Throw with both hands.

485
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,560
Jae Seok, come on.

486
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,770
You're throwing them too high.

487
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,870
- Seriously?
- Throw with both hands, you idiot.

488
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,300
- Soft hands.
- That's it.

489
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,700
- Soft hands.
- Hey!

490
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,010
- You're throwing them too high.
- Soft hands!

491
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,140
- Right.
- That's it.

492
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,210
(He finally catches one.)

493
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,780
- Gently!
- Hey!

494
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,110
(He catches a balloon,)

495
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,150
(but throws water.)

496
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,750
You haven't even managed one.

497
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,250
What are you guys doing?

498
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,580
Is this a joke?

499
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,450
- Ji Hyo's just standing there.
- Throw it gently.

500
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,590
Throw it gently.

501
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,120
What's the matter with you?

502
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,590
- Use both hands.
- Throw it.

503
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,160
(Scraps from balloons
are piled up in front of Jae Seok.)

504
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Throw it.

505
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,270
He knows he's doomed.

506
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,370
He's doomed.

507
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,070
(The king of nagging has decided
just to have fun with it.)

508
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,410
So much for laughing at us.

509
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,240
See? They haven't even managed one.

510
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,380
- They haven't even managed one.
- Ji Hyo's just standing around.

511
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,510
Good, finally.

512
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,680
At least get one.

513
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,650
You should drag the hands back.

514
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,080
- Seriously?
- Come on.

515
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,180
Again.

516
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,450
Yes... Darn.

517
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,690
What are you guys doing?

518
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,260
We'd win...

519
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,260
- if this were a team event.
- There!
Look.

520
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,590
Catch while dragging the hands down.

521
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,630
Darn!

522
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,370
- Unbelievable.
- This sure is upsetting.

523
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,930
Throw it with more sincerity.

524
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,170
- That's what I've been doing.
- Just one.

525
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,870
Are you trying to make us lose?

526
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,670
Are you kidding me?

527
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,870
You can't even manage to get one?

528
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,940
- Is this on purpose?
- Is this deliberate?

529
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,080
What the...

530
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,910
Again. Let's do better.

531
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,180
(He's the only one who's serious.)

532
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,750
Please. Just get at least one.

533
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,920
Darn.

534
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,850
Jong Kook, throw it gently like so.

535
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,420
- Ji Hyo.
- Like so.

536
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,490
- Ji Hyo, drag the hands down.
- Make the impact softer.

537
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,660
- Make the impact softer.
- Nice.

538
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,890
- We can't do this.
- Good.

539
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,230
(Time's up.)

540
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,260
- They didn't even manage one.
- They didn't even manage one.

541
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,300
I was able to throw a few but...

542
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,270
(They only have 1 round left
and must get 13 to swap a dish.)

543
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,070
The best players should compete.

544
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,370
- Of course.
- This calls for the best players.

545
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,170
- The best players will play.
- The best players.

546
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,840
- I'll play.
- I caught a few.

547
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,370
At least 4. I threw 4 of them.

548
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,640
Jong Kook, not you.

549
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,380
I don't think you're one
of the best players.

550
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,510
- But I caught four of them.
- You...

551
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,010
I caught and threw four of them.

552
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,180
- Yes, him.
- I caught and threw four of them.

553
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,850
- Hold on.
- You popped about 20 balloons.

554
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,480
- I know I can do well.
- Try catching one.

555
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,020
- Unbelievable.
- Let's practice.

556
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,020
- There.
- Throw it to me.

557
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,220
- There.
- Haha, good.

558
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,320
Like this. Throw it to me.

559
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,320
- Haha.
- Se Chan, throw it to me.

560
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,290
- Throw me one.
- Bend your knees too.

561
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,930
We're doing it. Jong Kook, here.

562
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,000
Jong Kook, catch.

563
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,160
- See?
- That's it.

564
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,400
- Here.
- Throw me one.

565
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,570
- Here.
- Yes!

566
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,770
Seok Jin, here.

567
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,500
If you throw it like this...

568
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,070
- Okay.
- Looking good.

569
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,810
You can't throw it like that!

570
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,210
Good.

571
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,180
- Nice.
- Like this.

572
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,980
- We've got a rally going!
- We're rallying.

573
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,110
Look we're rallying.

574
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,980
Are you seeing this?

575
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,720
The two of us are on a roll.

576
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
(Meanwhile)

577
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,020
Ji Hyo, you can't hold it like that.

578
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,220
(Mr. Yu is having his own
private Water Bomb festival.)

579
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,460
The area... Wait.

580
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,400
- Jae Seok, what are you up to?
- Come on, Jae Seok.

581
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,300
- It's not a sensory play time!
- Jae Seok, what are you up to?

582
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,100
- It feels so good.
- Come on.

583
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,170
- That's not how you do it.
- It feels so good. Try it.

584
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,670
(Mission? Yu's too busy squishing)

585
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,470
- We got it.
- After you will pick four aces,

586
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,770
- we will start the last game.
- Right, the aces.

587
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,380
Ace. That's us.

588
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,510
- It was us all along.
- Should it be the four of us?

589
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,510
- The four of us practiced a lot.
- We succeeded every time.

590
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,150
- We are the aces.
- We succeeded every time.

591
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,480
- We constantly threw it around.
- Jong Kook.

592
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,220
- Ace, here.
- The four of us played constantly.

593
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,720
- We will show you.
- Okay.

594
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,790
- Seok Jin, get it.
- Go ahead.

595
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,490
(Look at this!)

596
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,790
- Okay.
- Yes!

597
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,960
Look, Seok Jin.

598
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,730
You stay out of it. I got this.

599
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,460
- You can't do it.
- Jae Seok's not cut out for it.

600
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,860
I don't think you can pull it off.

601
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,270
- Then...
- I got this.

602
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,370
- I would rather make Ye Eun do it.
- Here's why.

603
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,370
The ratings only go up
when I'm on screen.

604
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,610
- He's got a point.
- He's right about that.

605
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,440
- He's right.
- Do the commentary then.

606
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,010
- All right.
- Make sure you get his face.

607
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,280
- You go do the commentary.
- The commentary.

608
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,180
- Is Se Chan joining?
- Let's do this.

609
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,950
- No. You do it, Haha.
- Me?

610
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,380
I should be the one to throw.

611
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,880
- I can throw well.
- Ye Eun, you do it.

612
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,580
- You two switch positions.
- With who?

613
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,020
- With Jong Kook.
- Got it.

614
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,650
- This is the position.
- Like this?

615
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,890
I'm the last? Fine.

616
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,860
- You're really good.
- I'll do it with Se Chan.

617
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,960
(The unexpected all-star lineup)

618
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,060
(They have to successfully
toss 13 balloons!)

619
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,060
- Ready.
- Seok Jin, you got it, right?

620
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,630
- You tossed two so far.
- Yes.

621
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,760
- You have 13 to go.
- Okay.

622
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,800
Ready.

623
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,500
- Got it.
- That was great.

624
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,770
(Catching successfully)

625
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,810
Nice.

626
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,840
- Nice.
- They are good.

627
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,480
(They successfully tossed
1 in just 7 seconds)

628
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,880
(All that intense practice
is paying off!)

629
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,610
- You're good.
- You're doing great.

630
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,380
- They are good, aren't they?
- Got it!

631
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,290
- Nice.
- We are in the flow.

632
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,050
- This is great. I know.
- Why did they get so good?

633
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,620
They are good. Go, Milkshake!

634
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,530
You are good.

635
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,500
- Milkshake!
- Go, Milkshake!

636
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,030
You're amazing. Go, Milkshake!

637
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,100
- The fantastic...
- Go!

638
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,370
- Chungju Ji and...
- Jee!

639
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,400
- Okay.
- Fantastic.

640
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,500
- Chungju Ji and Jee are great.
- No kidding. They're great.

641
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,140
(Flimsy's got the groove,)

642
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,210
(and Soccer Kim's in the zone!)

643
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,640
Don't lose your cool.

644
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,740
It's a very close one.

645
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,080
(A crazy mix leading to
a shocking success!)

646
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,410
Slow down.

647
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,050
This is Running Man!

648
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,720
- We are Running Man!
- Great teamwork.

649
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,520
- Seok Jin is good at catching.
- Are you seeing this, idols?

650
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,720
This is Running Man!

651
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,860
That one.

652
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,820
Look.
Seok Jin is a textbook example.

653
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,390
We are great now.

654
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,360
Great. Idols can't do this.

655
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,130
- They are good.
- Great.

656
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,430
Fantastic.

657
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,470
(Even clumsy Flimsy
is moving smoothly!)

658
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,500
It's coming! Got it.

659
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,700
So smooth!

660
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,300
Did you see that? The speed?

661
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,710
Like so.

662
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,770
- Come on.
- So smooth!

663
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,510
Last one. Bring it on!

664
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,880
Every one of them is good.

665
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,950
- Incredible.
- Nice one.

666
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,480
- You're all mad. Speed up a little.
- Smooth.

667
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,020
Don't just stand and watch,
Seok Jin.

668
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,920
Turn back as soon as you toss.

669
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,720
- Seok Jin, here.
- That's it.

670
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,920
Again.

671
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,760
(Flustered)

672
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,960
- Seok Jin, here.
- How many did we do?

673
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,390
(Laughing nervously)

674
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,490
(Popping)

675
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,530
Wait.

676
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,600
One more!

677
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,230
- One more time. Calm down.
- Let's go.

678
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,370
Lat one. Go!

679
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,900
You have ten seconds.

680
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,240
- Ten.
- Hurry.

681
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,640
- Ten seconds.
- We got this.

682
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,740
- Eight.
- Let's go.

683
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,840
- Seven.
- We got this.

684
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
- Hurry.
- Six.

685
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,880
- Here, Seok Jin.
- Come on.

686
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,110
- You're too fast.
- Five.

687
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,380
- Four.
- Okay.

688
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,510
- Three.
- Just one more.

689
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,510
- Just 1.
- Two.

690
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,620
- Got it.
- Okay.

691
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,280
(Time's up.)

692
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,620
- We got it.
- All right.

693
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,790
How many did we do?

694
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,360
Including the 2 you did first,
you successfully tossed 15 balloons.

695
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,690
(They successfully
completed the mission.)

696
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,400
(It's unbelievable they pulled off 13
with this lineup!)

697
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,060
- This is incredible.
- They did so well.

698
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,260
- Did you see that?
- We did.

699
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,470
- That was great.
- Well done.

700
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,570
- We did really well.
- Seok Jin did a great job.

701
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,070
- Did you see this?
- You did so well, Ye Eun.

702
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,540
(Soccer Kim is now happy.)

703
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,140
- Well done.
- Go, Milkshake!

704
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,440
- Did you see that?
- Well done.

705
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,140
- Go, Milkshake!
- Go, Milkshake!

706
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,380
- Well done.
- Great!

707
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,480
(No expectations,
jaw-dropping outcome)

708
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,650
- You did great.
- We did an amazing job.

709
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,820
We are good.

710
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,490
- We are good.
- Even idols can't beat...

711
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,520
the teamwork we have.

712
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,560
- Idols can't pull this off.
- They can't.

713
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,220
Why do you keep
comparing yourselves with idols?

714
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,360
I don't know.

715
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,860
- Bring it on.
- Let us compete against them.

716
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,160
- That's how quick-witted we are.
- Right?

717
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,700
- We can beat them.
- We are athletic too.

718
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,230
We can beat idols.

719
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,500
- We've got know-hows.
- We can compete against eight.

720
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,840
- They can't beat us.
- This is nothing like dancing.

721
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,340
- Completely different.
- Completely different.

722
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,240
Since you completed
the mission successfully,

723
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,180
you get to choose one dish
and change to the one you like.

724
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,280
- All right.
- Great.

725
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,380
(They get to change 1 of these.)

726
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,820
Write down the name
of the dish you want...

727
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,350
and stick the names
of the other dishes.

728
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,020
- Should we change the lobster?
- Let's change the lobster.

729
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,660
There's clear beef bone soup.

730
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,130
- We never get the clear soup.
- Never.

731
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,330
- It's always the cloudy one.
- Right.

732
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,960
- But it's rarer to get the lobster.
- That's rarer.

733
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,260
- Much rarer.
- The lobster?

734
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,630
Are we okay with beef tenderloin?

735
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,830
- It's okay. Tenderloin is...
- It's okay.

736
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,270
- They might say it.
- They might.

737
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,670
It's never the tenderloin steak.

738
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,770
- Never.
- "Steak" is never...

739
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,840
Does it have to be a steak?

740
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,070
- Right.
- It has to be "tenderloin steak."

741
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,410
- "Tenderloin steak?"
- "Tender steak?"

742
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,010
Are you going to specify
that the price doesn't matter?

743
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,480
No, we will simply ask
what they would like for breakfast.

744
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,920
- For breakfast...
- When asked that,

745
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,150
people wouldn't mention
steak or lobster.

746
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,320
- They wouldn't.
- They wouldn't.

747
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,790
- Lobster should be ruled out.
- No.

748
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,250
We should rule out the lobster.

749
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,420
Lobster is a bit of a stretch.

750
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,790
Why don't we change
the lobster to bean sprout gukbap?

751
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,330
- No, not that. Breakfast...
- A hangover soup of some sort.

752
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,360
No hangover soup there?

753
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,730
Sandwich or gimbap.

754
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,970
- Gimbap.
- Gimbap is a popular choice.

755
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,530
- Gimbap.
- Ramyeon would be there too.

756
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,140
- Ramyeon and gimbap.
- Ramyeon and gimbap.

757
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,240
"What's good for breakfast?"

758
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,770
- Gimbap.
- Would people say gimbap?

759
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,270
It's what
they would like for breakfast.

760
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,010
- Right.
- "What they would like."

761
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,210
- Right.
- "Mom's food."

762
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,340
- "Mom's food."
- Right.

763
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,550
- Korean food.
- It's making me tear up.

764
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,880
- Home food or Korean food.
- Home food.

765
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,250
- Hangover soup.
- Kimchi jjigae.

766
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,550
Men would say stir-fried pork.

767
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,820
- Right, there's stir-fried pork.
- Stir-fried pork.

768
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,150
- Stir-fried pork.
- Tonkatsu.

769
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,620
- Stir-fried pork is men's favorite.
- Tonkatsu.

770
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,390
- How about cold buckwheat noodles?
- Something similar.

771
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,690
- It's not a breakfast menu.
- Cold buckwheat noodles? No.

772
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,160
- Cold soybean noodle soup.
- Cold soybean noodle soup.

773
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,800
- Not for breakfast.
- Not for breakfast.

774
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,030
Grandma's doenjang jjigae.

775
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,630
- Kimchi jjigae.
- Something that makes you cry.

776
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,230
- Pork belly is a no, right?
- Pork belly?

777
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,470
Pork belly isn't exactly
a breakfast dish.

778
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,640
- Jjamppong then.
- But it's for breakfast.

779
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,370
- It's not for breakfast.
- It's not for breakfast.

780
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,210
Just go
with Grandma's doenjang jjigae then.

781
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,810
What can we do?
We can't even pick a dish.

782
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,780
- Let's do this.
- Come to your senses.

783
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,210
- This is a matter of probability.
- Probability.

784
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,910
Let's ask some of the crew members.

785
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,150
- About five people.
- That's a great idea.

786
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,020
- They will be our survey samples.
- Samples, right.

787
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,290
- We will ask them.
- Right.

788
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,790
- Hangover soup will be there.
- I'm sure.

789
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,560
Let's ask them 1 by 1.

790
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,690
A lot of them
haven't eaten breakfast yet.

791
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,490
- You haven't eaten, have you?
- No.

792
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,630
What would you like for breakfast?

793
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
(Thinking hard)

794
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,700
- Kimchi jjigae.
- Kimchi jjigae.

795
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,260
- He chose jjigae.
- Kimchi jjigae is good.

796
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,670
- I knew it.
- Kimchi jjigae, it is.

797
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,770
How about you?

798
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,070
What would you like for breakfast?

799
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,410
- Sandwich.
- Sandwich.

800
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,840
- Sandwich.
- I knew it.

801
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,540
- Sandwich.
- It's just like we expected.

802
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,610
- Sandwich, kimchi jjigae...
- But...

803
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,950
- They are all popular picks.
- What would they like to eat?

804
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,910
But we also have to consider...

805
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,110
Let's ask a citizen.

806
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,520
- how we phrase the question.
- What would you like to eat?

807
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,820
- Am I the citizen?
- You are.

808
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,050
I've been on this show for 15 years.

809
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,220
- You are a citizen.
- Since when have I been...

810
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,820
- We are all citizens, you know.
- Am I the citizen?

811
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,960
Be honest.

812
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,760
- I'd like a sandwich.
- A sandwich.

813
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,390
- Let's ask 2 more people.
- Let's ask 2 more.

814
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,830
Ask him.

815
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,100
We need varied samples.

816
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,230
Excuse me, sir.

817
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,930
What would you like to eat?

818
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,130
Soy sauce marinated crab.

819
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
(Soy sauce marinated crab?)

820
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,640
- Say what?
- Soy sauce marinated crab?

821
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,370
- He said what?
- Soy sauce marinated crab.

822
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,210
- What did he say?
- That's frustrating.

823
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,210
- What?
- He's a weirdo.

824
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,310
- I...
- Soy sauce marinated crab?

825
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,820
- And the way he said it too.
- I knew it.

826
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,250
"Me? Soy sauce marinated crab."

827
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,590
He's got a high-pitched voice.

828
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,390
- "Soy sauce marinated crab."
- "Soy sauce marinated crab."

829
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,590
They're most likely
to choose the sandwich.

830
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,930
- Right. I think it's sandwich too.
- If we ask a lady.

831
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,160
Right. It's definitely sandwich.

832
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,960
- Sandwich.
- Sandwich.

833
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,330
Ladies would go
for something like sandwich.

834
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,330
We could do this too.

835
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,200
"You have a great body."

836
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,670
"Are you getting ready for summer?"

837
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,010
But Haha, the last time
you interviewed a citizen...

838
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,240
(The two reporters fight again.)

839
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,280
What's wrong?

840
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:43,310
(Last time
when he interviewed a citizen)

841
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,520
(I'd like to leave the ones
whose style don't align with mine.)

842
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,920
(Why did you interfere
with the interview?)

843
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,890
(You don't know how to interview
people on the street!)

844
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,790
(He's a professional.)

845
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,490
(They hate it when you ask them
to introduce themselves.)

846
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,700
(What's up, yo?
That's how you do it.)

847
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,830
"What's up, yo?"

848
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,600
Come on, Road Man.

849
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,600
He shouldn't interview people.

850
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,200
"Hello, there."

851
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,170
"Goodness, you've got a great body."

852
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,970
Road Man.

853
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,440
It seems like
sandwich has the highest chance.

854
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,480
- It does.
- Right.

855
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,310
- Sandwich will get a lot of votes.
- Let's go with the sandwich.

856
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,710
- It's breakfast, after all.
- Let's write it.

857
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,880
- Write it in the middle, Jae Seok.
- in the middle.

858
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,950
Should we write sandwich
in the middle then?

859
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,090
- Sandwich in the middle.
- Yes.

860
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,490
- Are you all sure about it?
- Sandwich here.

861
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,290
- Sandwich.
- I think it's an easy guess.

862
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,990
- You can eat it anytime.
- Clear beef bone soup...

863
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,430
- I trust him.
- This...

864
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,430
We are going
with the sandwich, right?

865
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,590
Let's do it.

866
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,330
I think we won't be
getting the sandwich.

867
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,970
- We will.
- Write it.

868
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,130
"Breakfast buffet."

869
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,400
We need it here.

870
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,900
We need to put
"breakfast buffet" here.

871
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,770
- You're right.
- We're putting in everything.

872
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,810
- Put it all in.
- Everything except for the lobster.

873
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,570
The placement matters.

874
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,540
We need about two rows that are
more likely to be chosen from.

875
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,810
- Right.
- These have the highest chances.

876
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,450
- Here.
- Should we put sundaeguk there?

877
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,020
- Sundaeguk here.
- After a while,

878
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,080
someone will say sundaeguk.

879
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,220
There?

880
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,850
- There's a chance.
- Sundaeguk there?

881
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,590
- Are you sure?
- Sundaeguk...

882
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,220
- Here?
- Either in the middle...

883
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,260
- Just put it there.
- It shouldn't be in the middle.

884
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,290
- Pyongyang naengmyeon here.
- Not there! Gosh.

885
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,460
- It's breakfast.
- Right here.

886
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,700
This is a nice combination.

887
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,400
- I nearly went deaf there.
- The chance of one picking this...

888
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,670
- We need one good dish on each row.
- Hey.

889
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,940
Someone will mention
Pyongyang naengmyeon.

890
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,040
Put gamjatang here.

891
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,040
- Okay, gamjatang there.
- Gamjatang shouldn't be there.

892
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,470
Move gamjatang to the end.

893
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,380
- Where?
- Put this in the corner.

894
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,540
- Here.
- No one will choose gamjatang.

895
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,680
- Gamjatang is...
- No one will choose it.

896
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
- Stick it next to sundaeguk.
- How about here?
- No!
- Mul naengmyeon.

897
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,610
This is the one that's
least likely to be chosen.

898
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,780
- The tenderloin steak.
- No one will choose it.

899
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,520
- None of those will be chosen!
- Put it here.

900
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,260
(8 captains for 1 bingo board)

901
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,660
Here.

902
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,860
- Sundaeguk.
- Goodness.

903
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,960
- It's done.
- It's done.

904
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,460
- We're betting on this.
- Can't we stick it straight?

905
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,100
Now, we will begin
the breakfast menu bingo...

906
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,130
with the completed bingo board.

907
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,400
- Great.
- Let's go...

908
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,100
- and ask people.
- Let's go!

909
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,040
- Pork belly is a good one.
- I like the Korean set meal.

910
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,940
- We will now go and ask people.
- Okay.

911
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,310
Here's the question.

912
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,010
"What would you like for breakfast?"

913
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,050
What they would like
to eat for breakfast.

914
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,520
- What they want for breakfast.
- What they want for breakfast.

915
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,390
- For breakfast.
- If you all go together,

916
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,990
- Right.
- they will be flustered.

917
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,260
We'll randomly select two people...

918
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,460
- who can ask the question.
- Oh, really?

919
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,960
- A couch...
- It wouldn't be the first answer.

920
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,530
(The more they get involved,
the more tricks they come up with.)

921
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,540
(They took extreme measures
to control the outlaws!)

922
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,510
We're not allowed to give any hints?

923
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,540
Things got tighter.

924
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,580
- We used to be able to ask...
- It got tighter.

925
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,280
Do I get to go at last?

926
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,680
I'm fine as long as
we can drop Haha.

927
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,750
- Let's drop Road Man.
- Is Road Man in?

928
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,750
- Haha.
- What?

929
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,290
- On the road...
- I shouldn't make a scene?

930
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,920
You're useless at random interviews.

931
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,960
No, I'm really...

932
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,160
Where did you learn what to do?

933
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,590
On Mnet. Channel number 27.

934
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,160
(Wow! What's up, yo!)

935
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
(Startled)

936
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:52,070
(Haha survived,
like a weed that never dies.)

937
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,870
- "Channel number 27."
- In Cheongdam-dong.

938
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,870
Opposite a bank.

939
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,210
- You're too...
- Channel number 27?

940
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,940
- Channel number 27?
- That's right.

941
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,010
- Yes.
- Mnet?

942
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,780
- I know that...
- You learned what you shouldn't.

943
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,010
With Jerome.

944
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,550
Through a random draw,

945
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,180
we'll pick two people
to ask the question.

946
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,590
It must not be Haha.

947
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,120
- Road Man!
- After a long time, Road Man...

948
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,320
Road Man!

949
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,560
- Haha and Jae Seok would be fun.
- It's Haha.

950
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,760
Yang Se Chan.

951
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
- That's not bad.
- Ssabssab.

952
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,330
- I'm pretty good.
- He has the wit.

953
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,660
He's witty, yes.

954
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,030
- He's witty.
- That's okay.

955
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,370
- That's okay.
- Don't you worry.

956
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,130
Se Chan's a sensible interviewer.

957
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,170
- I'll bring it out.
- It's me.

958
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,770
(Is it the Nation's Beloved Host
or the VJ from the streets?)

959
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,070
- It's me.
- I'll bring it out.

960
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,170
- It's me.
- Jee Seok Jin.

961
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,940
(Jee Seok Jin?)

962
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
(The wrong ball appeared.)

963
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,640
- Oh, come on.
- Seok Jin.

964
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,380
Hey, no, wait.

965
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,650
- What food?
- What do you want?

966
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,920
- What do you want? Sandwiches?
- Sandwiches?

967
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,280
- Sandwiches.
- I want mul naengmyeon.

968
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,690
- We should get a sandwich first.
- Don't go too far.

969
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,490
- A sandwich would be great.
- A sandwich.

970
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,290
- Look forward to it!
- Okay.

971
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,530
Sandwiches... Early on...

972
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,460
Let's set the tone...

973
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,960
Okay.

974
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,030
- A broadcasting station...
- Yes.

975
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,500
There's a crowd over there.

976
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:59,840
If we walk up, they get intimidated
and won't talk to us.

977
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,340
Why would they feel intimidated?
They love stuff like this.

978
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,380
- When I was in high school...
- Yes.

979
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,980
When I was in high school,

980
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,780
there was a program called
"From the Guest Room."

981
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,150
I did an interview in Myeongdong
and that was my official debut.

982
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,880
- I don't want to know.
- Okay.

983
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,590
Sorry about that.

984
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,350
Hey.

985
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,960
There are people like that
who like to be interviewed.

986
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,630
- Okay.
- Look around.

987
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,490
- How about that person?
- Who? Where?

988
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,930
The person walking this way
carrying a backpack.

989
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,870
I don't think he had breakfast.

990
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,070
- He didn't...
- Look.

991
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,040
- He's low on energy.
- Yes, his energy is low.

992
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,970
- I don't think he'll participate.
- No.

993
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,870
- Will you give it a go?
- Shall I try?

994
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,740
- The guy in purple...
- Wait here.

995
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,940
Hello.

996
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,840
- Watch what to do.
- Okay.

997
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,010
Hello.

998
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,250
- What?
- Hey. Seok Jin.

999
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,020
(Immediate fail)

1000
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,150
See, Seok Jin?

1001
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,490
- That makes people uncomfortable.
- Sorry!

1002
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,920
It gets too awkward.

1003
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,490
- Seok Jin. Make eye contact first.
- You try, then.

1004
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,160
- Say hi with a glance first.
- Look.

1005
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,600
Seok Jin. Across the road.

1006
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,860
How about someone crossing the road?

1007
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,670
- That's a good idea.
- If you say hi...

1008
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,700
Someone who makes
continuous eye contact.

1009
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,540
Hey, I reported
for "Entertainment Weekly" too.

1010
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,770
I didn't ask.

1011
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,840
"Entertainment Weekly,"
25 years ago.

1012
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,080
- They're here. Hello.
- Hello.

1013
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,020
- Good morning.
- Wait.

1014
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,950
Did you have breakfast?

1015
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,650
(Acting friendly)

1016
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,120
Did you have something to eat?
Could I interview you?

1017
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,960
(Will he succeed this time?)

1018
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,690
(Zooming away)

1019
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,400
Seok Jin.

1020
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,270
- That's not what to do. Come here.
- Okay, bye.

1021
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,270
- Hello.
- Come here. You don't do that.

1022
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,370
Interviewing is tough.

1023
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,770
- Act naturally...
- Over there.

1024
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,570
The ABS...

1025
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,580
- Where are you going?
- Home.

1026
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,380
- You're going home?
- Okay!

1027
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,850
Why are you going home this early?

1028
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,980
At this hour?

1029
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,350
What would you
like to eat for breakfast?

1030
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,350
(He rehearses
the interview naturally.)

1031
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,750
What food do you want?

1032
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,120
- Cold buckwheat noodles.
- That's what I said!

1033
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,660
- I said that.
- It came up.

1034
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,160
- Cold buckwheat noodles is nice.
- That's good.

1035
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,660
- Drive safely.
- Bye.

1036
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,060
- Goodbye.
- For breakfast.

1037
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,300
If you were to have breakfast now,
what would you like to eat?

1038
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,430
- What would you like?
- What do you want to eat?

1039
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,140
Stir-fried pork.

1040
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
- Jong Kook.
- See?

1041
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,170
- Stir-fried pork.
- Men's soul food.

1042
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,840
- Stir-fried pork.
- Thank you.

1043
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,110
- That actually came up.
- I mentioned that.

1044
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,150
- It's us men's soul food.
- It came up.

1045
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,650
They answered
with all the foods we thought of.

1046
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,280
- Our soul food...
- They still haven't asked anyone?

1047
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,320
- Hello. Seok Jin, over there.
- Hello.

1048
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,850
- Over there.
- Hello.

1049
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,590
Seok Jin,
I told you that's not what to do.

1050
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,660
Hello.

1051
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,930
No, you failed.

1052
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,560
This is really...

1053
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,770
Seok Sam lacks the necessary skills
to interview people.

1054
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,240
I need the focus to move to me.
They must focus on me.

1055
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,340
What are you doing?

1056
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,410
You keep quiet!

1057
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,840
Seok Jin, that's not what to do.

1058
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,940
- You're chasing people away.
- "Hello!"

1059
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,940
- It's like you're chasing pigeons.
- You can't do that!

1060
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,850
- Seok Jin.
- "Hello!" Of course they run away.

1061
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,680
- You don't do that.
- I haven't met anyone yet.

1062
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,750
- Just wait.
- Don't get in the way.

1063
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,220
- Take your time.
- They're coming.

1064
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,020
- We should stand to the side.
- Okay.

1065
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,220
Hello.
Would you like to do an interview?

1066
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,760
- Seok Jin!
- Seok Jin!

1067
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,660
- Seok Jin! Over here.
- Seok Jin!

1068
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,460
- Come over here.
- Seok Jin.

1069
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,700
We'll find you people.

1070
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,230
Hurry up. We got them for you.

1071
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,140
- Hello.
- Seok Jin!

1072
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,800
(In the meantime, he tries again.)

1073
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,040
- Seok Jin!
- Seok Jin!

1074
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,670
- Okay.
- Come this way.

1075
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,140
(He failed again.)

1076
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,480
- Hello.
- Hang on.

1077
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,550
- Thank you.
- They walk on as if it was planned.

1078
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,750
Am I being pranked?

1079
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,650
- Seok Jin. You're so bad at this.
- Is this a prank?

1080
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,150
Why do people ignore you?

1081
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,490
Am I being pranked?

1082
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,590
Interview them already.

1083
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,790
They think
it's your YouTube channel.

1084
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,530
Hello.

1085
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,260
(Seok Sam's Truman Show
comes to an end.)

1086
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:46,960
What's your name?

1087
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,660
- I'm Yang Ga Ram.
- Ga Ram.

1088
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,170
Seok Jin, Ga Ram will talk to us.

1089
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,170
- Hello.
- Ga Ram.

1090
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,570
I watched Running Man
ever since it started.

1091
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,170
Did you really? Stand in the middle.

1092
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,470
- So how...
- She was a fan since episode one.

1093
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,840
- Since elementary... Yes.
- Shall we take a selfie?

1094
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,540
- Oh, really?
- Why would you take a selfie?

1095
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,110
- Go ahead.
- My goodness.

1096
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,210
- Let's take one.
- It's fine.

1097
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,310
Let's break the ice.

1098
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,550
Did you have breakfast?

1099
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,250
- Yes.
- You ate?

1100
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,320
- So you watched from the start.
- Where do you work?

1101
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,490
I work at the Korea Arts
and Culture Education Service.

1102
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,490
You work at a great place.

1103
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:19,060
- You work at KACES.
- Yes.

1104
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,860
You can't shorten just anything.

1105
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,170
- That's silly.
- I shorten everything.

1106
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,970
- What's your name?
- I'm Yang Ga Ram.

1107
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,370
- Ga Ram.
- Ga Ram.

1108
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,770
- Ga Ram...
- That's a Korean name.

1109
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,640
- I use Chinese characters.
- I see.

1110
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,680
Seok Jin, please.
Don't say pointless stuff.

1111
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,380
- It's usually a pure Korean name.
- Yes.

1112
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,550
You're an unusual case.

1113
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,380
Your father put
a lot of thought into naming you.

1114
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,120
Do you eat breakfast at home
before you leave or...

1115
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,250
do you eat on the way?

1116
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,560
- I eat at work.
- At work.

1117
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,760
- I see.
- Then...

1118
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,760
you can't eat what you want.

1119
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,960
- You just eat whatever.
- It's the usual...

1120
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,360
- The same thing.
- Yes.

1121
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,670
We think that's a shame,
so we're here to ask you a question.

1122
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,900
- Yes.
- Okay.

1123
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,700
What do you want...

1124
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,640
- for breakfast?
- What you want to eat.

1125
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,940
Think carefully about it.

1126
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,840
- Think about it and...
- Name just one thing.

1127
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,240
- whatever...
- Are you hungry?

1128
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,350
- Us?
- Yes.

1129
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,050
- Us? We're hungry.
- We're hungry.

1130
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,750
- Early mornings...
- Aren't you? Did you eat?

1131
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,850
I'm hungry, but...

1132
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,950
Just say what you'd like
to have for breakfast.

1133
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,050
What you want for breakfast.

1134
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,160
Think carefully about it.

1135
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,890
One, two, three.

1136
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,130
Gukbap.

1137
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,830
(Breakfast Bingo)

1138
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,800
We have "gukbap."

1139
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,830
What kind?

1140
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,600
- Yes, what kind?
- There are different kinds.

1141
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,970
- There's this kind and that kind.
- You're doing well.

1142
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,300
One, two, three.

1143
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,670
(Can they fill in a square?)

1144
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,740
(Bean sprout gukbap)

1145
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,180
Bean sprout gukbap.

1146
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,250
I said that earlier.

1147
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,450
She said "bean sprout gukbap."

1148
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,120
We'll go and have
bean sprout gukbap.

1149
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,350
We eat that, thanks to you.

1150
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,750
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1151
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,850
- Thank you.
- Good job.

1152
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,390
Thanks a lot.
I'll remember this forever.

1153
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1154
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,390
- Bean sprout gukbap?
- That came up too.

1155
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,490
- Bean sprout gukbap.
- It came up.

1156
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,800
Who mentioned that?

1157
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,130
- We must go and eat.
- Was it you?

1158
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,000
Jae Seok. The first answer...

1159
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,830
The first thing she said was gukbap.

1160
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,840
- Also...
- But...

1161
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,640
- I knew it.
- We asked two people too.

1162
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,470
- Stir-fried pork...
- So...

1163
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,870
If Ye Eun had asked,

1164
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,380
- she might have said "a sandwich."
- If I'd asked.

1165
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,180
- Really?
- You must extract the answer.

1166
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,350
- That's why...
- You haven't talked to the public.

1167
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,850
We have no time.

1168
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:22,050
If someone says "breakfast buffet,"

1169
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,590
- there's a time limit.
- That's right.

1170
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,360
Breakfast buffets
aren't offered after a while.

1171
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,660
- You're right.
- We must hurry to eat that.

1172
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,560
- We'll never manage.
- Sundae gukbap nearby...

1173
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,500
Let's go and eat.

1174
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,360
- Let's quickly eat and...
- Let's get moving.

1175
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,670
Bean sprout gukbap
is a good breakfast.

1176
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,600
- It's great.
- It's not bad.

1177
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
Where do we go?

1178
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,500
There's a bean sprout
gukbap place nearby.

1179
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,940
We can't film inside,
so we'll do a takeaway...

1180
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,580
- and eat elsewhere.
- That's a good idea.

1181
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,880
We sent a team to get the food
and it won't be long,

1182
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,950
- so let's pick the next two...
- The next people.

1183
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,650
- Let's pick.
- Let's do the draw.

1184
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,350
Se Chan, you and I should pick.

1185
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,690
Are the two of us being left out?

1186
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,290
- No, you have to go again.
- No, we have to do it again.

1187
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,620
- We have to keep going.
- But our interview skills...

1188
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,620
were revealed.

1189
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,790
- We just can't do it.
- But really, I don't think...

1190
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,960
- Seok Sam can do it.
- I hope I get to go again.

1191
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,030
(Giggling)

1192
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,490
- It's me again.
- Yang Se Chan.

1193
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,260
And it's Jee Seok Jin again!

1194
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,130
(Se Chan and Seok Jin once more)

1195
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,130
- My gosh!
- Gosh, come on!

1196
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,470
- What is going on?
- Is it just your names in there?

1197
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,670
Is it just full of Yang Se Chan
and Jee Seok Jin's names?

1198
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,370
- There are other ones too.
- Are there?

1199
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,740
This doesn't count. Do it again.

1200
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,780
- It doesn't count.
- Do it again.

1201
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,080
Don't just choose us.
Choose someone else.

1202
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,350
- It's for the sake of the show.
- But how could this happen?

1203
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,080
- How did you choose each other?
- Ye Eun.

1204
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,950
But we can't help it
if we get chosen again this time.

1205
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,650
- We have to do it.
- But for the variety of the show...

1206
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,090
- Right, I agree.
- Yes.

1207
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,090
But if we get chosen again...

1208
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,360
- Yang Se Chan.
- Gosh, see?

1209
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,560
- Today must be my day today.
- It really must be.

1210
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,660
- I'll go today.
- Today's your day.

1211
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,460
- I drew it from the corner too.
- That's fascinating.

1212
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,800
- Today must be that kind of day.
- It's my day.

1213
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,400
Jee Seok Jin.

1214
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,630
Oh, it's Choi Daniel.

1215
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,730
- Okay, let's go.
- Nice.

1216
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,940
- Is that okay?
- Daniel will do well.

1217
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,800
- Nice. Not bad.
- Okay.

1218
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,670
- I think Se Chan will do well.
- Okay, sounds good.

1219
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,810
- Daniel, try it.
- Yes?

1220
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,040
You guys should practice.

1221
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,580
And I hope you get
the breakfast buffet as an answer.

1222
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,850
- I want to try going there. Yes.
- A breakfast buffet?

1223
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,350
- But if we want to get that answer,
- Yes.

1224
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,150
we have to ask young people
who would've seen that video.

1225
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,350
Seok Jin, by any chance...

1226
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,820
- You know,
- Do you think...

1227
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,350
- you have to do the interview...
- Young people.

1228
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,790
- like Sunwoo Yong Nyeo.
- There's no one in that age range.

1229
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,020
- "Oh, my."
- No, but...

1230
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,490
If you want to get
a breakfast buffet as an answer,

1231
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,490
you have to do a voice imitation.

1232
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,490
- Can we do this?
- "Oh, my."

1233
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,700
- You have to use that strategy.
- "I don't know! Breakfast..."

1234
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,500
"I don't know!
What do you want for breakfast?"

1235
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,530
Then, from the side, you should go,

1236
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,540
"Gosh,
why are you acting like this?"

1237
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,570
"I want to have gukbap."

1238
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,940
"Oh, I don't know! Do you want to
go to the buffet or not?"

1239
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,840
- Hey, that's good!
- "I want something expensive!"

1240
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,480
- Isn't that much okay?
- That much should be okay.

1241
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,410
- Hey, that's great. Let's do that.
- That much should be fine.

1242
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,220
You have to ask the question
like that and bring out the answer.

1243
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,080
- That sounds awesome.
- Amazing.

1244
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,150
Oh, it's here.

1245
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,250
- The gukbap is here.
- Our food is here.

1246
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,490
- Let's eat first.
- Let's eat.

1247
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,890
But if we eat too much...

1248
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,460
- Gosh, this is...
- I know. I won't be able to eat.

1249
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,990
- To be honest,
- Hey, in the morning...

1250
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,160
You guys are so mean.
When we wanted to eat,

1251
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,000
you said we should split a bowl
between us.

1252
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,630
- But today,
- Right, seriously.

1253
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,930
how many bowls are you giving us?

1254
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,630
- This part is a shame.
- Yes?

1255
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,800
We can't fill the Bingo board...

1256
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,100
- at all right now.
- That's right.

1257
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,070
Our stomachs are
going to burst today.

1258
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,610
- It does look good, though.
- It really does.

1259
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,180
It looks really good.

1260
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,340
No, but really. It looks so good.

1261
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,750
- This looks really great.
- Awesome.

1262
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,350
Gosh, this looks delicious.

1263
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,220
Hey,
I love the food from this place.

1264
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,450
The smell is insane!

1265
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,190
I'm sorry, but are we on a picnic?

1266
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,890
- But it's nice.
- Hey.

1267
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,990
- In the middle of Sangam...
- It is pretty funny.

1268
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,960
- But the weather today is...
- The weather is nice.

1269
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,160
- If not, it would've been so hot.
- Of course.

1270
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,570
(A relaxing breakfast
of bean sprout gukbap)

1271
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,570
- Gosh, this is...
- You have to add this in here.

1272
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,630
I'm not lying.

1273
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,500
This is my first time eating
bean sprout gukbap outdoors.

1274
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,670
This is nice. Something like this
in the morning, you know?

1275
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,310
- Don't you add the egg?
- No, you just scoop up the broth...

1276
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,810
- You add the broth to the egg.
- Gosh, this is so good.

1277
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,010
- Really?
- My gosh!

1278
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,280
(How to enjoy bean sprout gukbap:
Eat the egg with broth and laver.)

1279
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,480
- Can't I just add this in here?
- The smell is insane!

1280
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,180
- Well, you can.
- Let's do it, then.

1281
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,790
Let's go!

1282
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,120
(He doesn't care
and just plops the egg in.)

1283
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,060
They gave us an egg
in case it was lacking nutrition.

1284
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,890
They always give us a good meal
for breakfast.

1285
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,760
It's so good.

1286
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,260
- Hey, this was a good choice.
- Gosh, this is...

1287
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,600
Which restaurant is this from?

1288
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,530
- Hyundaeok.
- Hyundaeok.

1289
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,930
(He checks the name
of the restaurant.)

1290
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,970
(He looks as if he has tasted
a whole new world.)

1291
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,170
Hey, Jong Kook.

1292
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,340
Jong Kook's reaction is so sincere.

1293
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,410
- What?
- Hey, I thought you already ate.

1294
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,450
You must be hooked
even when you've already eaten.

1295
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:14,080
(As if this is
his first time eating,)

1296
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,920
(he keeps exclaiming out loud.)

1297
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,120
You must like this.

1298
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,690
It's so delicious.

1299
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,920
They always give us a good meal
for breakfast.

1300
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,660
- Put that in.
- On a day like this...

1301
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,290
Is it incredible?

1302
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,000
- Gosh, this looks so good.
- It's so nice.

1303
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,160
Has this happened before?

1304
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,570
My goodness.

1305
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,200
This is the soul food of Koreans.

1306
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,740
Gosh, the broth is no joke.

1307
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,470
(Food Fighter starts eating
in earnest.)

1308
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,410
Can I have some of your rice,
Ji Hyo?

1309
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,010
Can I have some?

1310
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,440
(She starts eyeing
Ji Hyo's rice too.)

1311
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,950
Ji Hyo,
can I have some of your laver?

1312
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,280
Gosh, I told you to add it.

1313
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,080
(Adding laver flakes)

1314
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,920
But you know, it feels special
to eat this outdoors.

1315
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,720
And the weather is perfect today.

1316
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,120
(The broth is even more refreshing
to eat outside in the cool air.)

1317
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,130
(She eats in earnest as she props
her leg up like a middle-aged lady.)

1318
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,130
This is nice.

1319
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,500
This is the soul food of Koreans.

1320
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,530
(They seem to have forgotten
about Bingo in no time.)

1321
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,340
- Gosh, this is...
- I didn't really have an appetite.

1322
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,000
(The members scarf down the food.)

1323
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,100
Doesn't this look good?

1324
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,170
Really, though, this is so good.

1325
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,110
It's so delicious.

1326
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,240
But we shouldn't eat too much,
Jae Seok.

1327
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,250
- What?
- You seem to be eating a lot.

1328
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,150
If we think about later on,
we shouldn't eat so much,

1329
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,420
but I can't do that.

1330
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,220
But you know, later on,

1331
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,290
we might have to eat
2 or 3 times more,

1332
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,620
- so pace yourselves.
- Don't eat so much. And...

1333
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,190
- since I ate this,
- Gosh, this is so good.

1334
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,960
I want to go to that buffet
and have some fried eggs...

1335
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,130
and sausages for some reason.

1336
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,300
This time, Niel and I will do
the voice imitation...

1337
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,300
for the breakfast buffet.

1338
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,500
- "I don't know."
- Yes, do that.

1339
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,900
Just letting you know,
you have to succeed before 12:30 p.m.

1340
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,910
- Okay.
- There are nine dishes now.

1341
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,070
Nine dishes?

1342
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,880
- Shall we go now?
- Gosh, this is so nice.

1343
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,180
- Now?
- Hey, just hurry up.

1344
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,310
Can the two of us go right now?

1345
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,180
- Do you want to go now?
- Yes, we're almost done eating.

1346
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,480
- Jae Seok, shall we go now?
- Yes, go ahead.

1347
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,480
- Let's go, Daniel.
- Go on.

1348
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,520
- Don't you need us there?
- I hope you succeed, Niel.

1349
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,620
Yes, I'll come back with a success.

1350
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,190
- We'll use that method.
- Okay.

1351
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,690
- Use the ultimate trick.
- Okay.

1352
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,690
- Try it.
- Oh, hang on.

1353
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,060
I learned that from Mnet.

1354
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,890
- That's so funny.
- From Mnet.

1355
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,790
Hey, what were we going to do?

1356
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,830
- The breakfast buffet?
- Go to the breakfast buffet.

1357
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,000
- Because the main dish there...
- But how are we supposed to...

1358
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,430
lead them to answer with
a breakfast buffet?

1359
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,170
But sitting here and looking out
after having breakfast...

1360
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,270
- It's nice.
- So nice.

1361
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,070
- It feels like watching TV.
- Yes.

1362
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,640
- Who is that?
- I mean...

1363
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,540
- Who is that tall guy?
- On Sunday evening...

1364
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,480
- Who is that tall guy?
- Hey!

1365
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,050
Can't you do the interview properly?

1366
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,350
- Daniel.
- Oh, gosh.

1367
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,820
(Groaning in pain)

1368
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,120
(The tall guy gets into
all sorts of trouble.)

1369
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,390
- Hey, people at crosswalks...
- Just...

1370
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,760
- Just wave first.
- At the crosswalk...

1371
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,120
Can you do an interview for a bit?

1372
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,630
Can you do an interview
for a minute?

1373
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,430
Okay.

1374
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,760
Okay. Just like that.

1375
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,230
- You can't pressure people.
- Great job.

1376
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,870
- Now, that person will come across.
- Se Chan, you're doing great.

1377
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,430
- We'll ease into it.
- Right.

1378
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,840
- Yes, waving is good.
- Goodness, you must be busy,

1379
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,370
- but can we do a short interview?
- Yes.

1380
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,070
- Just for a bit.
- It'll just take two minutes.

1381
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,610
Goodness, come this way.

1382
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,110
What's your name?
Come to the middle here.

1383
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,640
- Please come this way.
- My name is Kim Yeo Jung.

1384
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,640
Would you come this way, please?

1385
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,650
- Oh, Yeo Jung?
- Yes.

1386
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,580
- Have you had breakfast perhaps?
- No, not yet.

1387
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,650
- Why? Don't you usually eat...
- Oh, dear.

1388
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,990
- before coming to work?
- Do you normally not eat breakfast?

1389
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,390
- I slept in late today.
- Oh, really?

1390
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,820
What do you usually eat?

1391
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,790
Usually, I eat salads and...

1392
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,760
- Salads.
- Or...

1393
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,390
I have a shake...

1394
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,360
or something simple, like an omelet.

1395
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,330
No! Oh, I don't know!

1396
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,200
I don't know what might happen
to your health if you eat that!

1397
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,410
Hello, I'm Park Young Gyu.

1398
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,710
What are you saying?

1399
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,810
- "I don't know."
- He said it.

1400
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,010
- There it is.
- He said it.

1401
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,110
- The operation has begun.
- He's using the trick.

1402
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,880
- He has started.
- He used the trick.

1403
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,720
(He tries his best
to imitate her voice.)

1404
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,050
- What...
- Who am I imitating now?

1405
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,690
Oh, I don't know!

1406
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:40,990
Hello, I'm Park Young Gyu.

1407
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,190
Who do you think I sound like?

1408
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,690
Like Yang Se Chan.

1409
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,790
(Like Yang Se Chan.)

1410
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,300
How did I sound like...

1411
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,060
When did I ever go like this?
"Oh, I don't know!"

1412
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,930
- Don't you know who this is?
- I'm not sure.

1413
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,070
Oh, really?

1414
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,430
- It was Sunwoo Yong Nyeo.
- Oh, right.

1415
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,770
- I don't watch TV a lot.
- Oh, really?

1416
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,010
But you really shouldn't
skip breakfast...

1417
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,010
- and eat a lot of various foods.
- Yes.

1418
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,640
- A bit of everything.
- Yes, everything.

1419
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,380
You should have protein,
some of this and that,

1420
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,020
- and everything to be healthy.
- Have some bacon too.

1421
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,120
- Yes.
- Toast and cereal too.

1422
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,280
You should eat a lot and well.

1423
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,820
- A bit of everything.
- Everything, like this and that.

1424
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,720
- In the morning...
- Where you can eat various foods.

1425
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,460
So, we'll ask you a question.

1426
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,360
- Here's the question. You ask her.
- Okay, here it is.

1427
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,560
"What do you want for breakfast?"

1428
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,060
Oh, you can read it.

1429
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,930
- What do you want for breakfast?
- You can read it yourself.

1430
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,030
You can take your time to think.

1431
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,670
What do you want for breakfast?

1432
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,000
- Yes, so...
- A bit of everything.

1433
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,470
Yes, it's a bit of everything,

1434
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:32,670
- but what should you say?
- It's food,

1435
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,210
- but you don't have to name a dish.
- Yes.

1436
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:36,680
- It can be a type of food.
- A type of food?

1437
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,010
- Yes.
- Something like...

1438
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,110
Will we get to have coffee...

1439
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,250
- at the breakfast buffet?
- I think they'll succeed.

1440
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,720
That drip coffee.

1441
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,490
So, what do you want for breakfast?

1442
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:47,460
(What will her answer be?)

1443
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:50,090
- I want to go to a buffet.
- A buffet!

1444
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,230
(They successfully got
her to answer with "buffet.")

1445
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,900
Oh, I don't know!

1446
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,700
- Hello, I'm Park Young Gyu.
- Oh, I just don't know!

1447
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,230
I don't know what to eat
for breakfast!

1448
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,670
- She said buffet!
- Really?

1449
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,640
- How did she give that answer?
- No way.

1450
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,940
- Gosh, for real?
- Hey, you did it!

1451
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,240
How did she really say buffet?

1452
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,070
- No way.
- That's amazing!

1453
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,340
- Hey, how did they do that?
- I'm so impressed.

1454
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,310
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Have a safe trip.

1455
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,150
Oh, I don't know!

1456
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,650
- "I don't know!" It worked, right?
- It didn't work.

1457
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,520
- It didn't work?
- She didn't know what that was.

1458
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,820
- How did you get her to say it?
- She didn't know that.

1459
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,750
- Did she see the YouTube video?
- No, and I went like,

1460
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,450
- "Oh, I don't know! Who is this?"
- She hadn't seen the video.

1461
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,920
- She said it was Yang Se Chan.
- "Isn't it Yang Se Chan?"

1462
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,190
She didn't know.

1463
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,490
- She didn't know,
- But she somehow said buffet?

1464
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:23,630
- but she said buffet?
- Yes, she did.

1465
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:24,660
- No way.
- I just kept going...

1466
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,960
- Let's hurry up.
- There isn't much time.

1467
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,400
- Right. Good job.
- Yes, thank you.

1468
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,470
- Come on.
- This way!

1469
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,470
- Thank you!
- I've wanted to go to a buffet.

1470
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:34,270
- Then, we should hurry over there.
- Okay!

1471
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,270
- I'm going to eat something tasty!
- A breakfast buffet is the best.

1472
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,810
- This is a nice car.
- Hey, we are...

1473
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:40,240
- Gosh, this is a nice car.
- Oh, my. The bus has been upgraded.

1474
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,240
- This is a nice car.
- Hey, but you know,

1475
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,210
Niel couldn't do voice imitations
at all.

1476
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:47,280
But she didn't answer correctly
because of your voice imitation.

1477
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,380
- She just did it?
- Yes, she just did.

1478
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,020
Well, we kind of led her to it.

1479
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,890
- She seems pretty sensible.
- Yes, she was.

1480
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:53,920
- Some people still don't get it.
- That's true.

1481
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,190
Gosh, I'm full.

1482
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,230
- I'm so full.
- But the buffet sounds good.

1483
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:58,330
If you're too full,

1484
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:00,500
we can play a game
and only have a few of you eat.

1485
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,300
- No, it's fine.
- No, wait.

1486
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,370
- We're fine.
- Come on.

1487
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,530
- I have to go to the buffet.
- I haven't been there in a while.

1488
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,140
- Yes, we have to go.
- It's been so long.

1489
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,910
- We can eat as much as we want.
- That's right.

1490
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:10,940
- So,
- Short ribs.

1491
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,240
- we don't have to cut people out.
- They don't serve that.

1492
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,980
Which breakfast buffet
are we going to?

1493
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,610
Hey, your voice sounds so excited.

1494
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,150
- "Which buffet are we going to?"
- "Which one?"

1495
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:26,360
- We'll go to the hotel in Yeouido.
- Oh, I see.

1496
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,290
- That place is nice.
- When did it open?

1497
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,930
I thought Ji Hyo was so funny.

1498
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,830
Earlier, she was eating
her churro so slowly,

1499
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,360
- so I was wondering why.
- Yes.

1500
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:36,100
She ate three.

1501
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,200
(But the thing is...)

1502
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,870
Really?

1503
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,170
Three.

1504
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,700
- Ji Hyo.
- But I thought...

1505
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,910
- One food fighter went on a diet,
- The new food fighter.

1506
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,310
- and a new one has appeared.
- A new food fighter.

1507
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,950
- Ji Hyo is filling the void.
- The old food fighter.

1508
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:51,810
Why did you say that?

1509
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,420
- The new and old food fighters.
- It's embarrassing.

1510
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,420
So funny.

1511
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,350
- There's a lot of traffic today.
- I know. The roads are packed.

1512
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,120
- Okay!
- We're stuck on the road.

1513
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,260
It's only open until 10:30 a.m.
We need to hurry.

1514
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,520
There's too much traffic.

1515
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,630
- That's usual around this time.
- There's a lot of traffic.

1516
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,230
- We're finally in Yeouido.
- We're in Yeouido.

1517
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,100
There are about 30 minutes left
until the buffet closes.

1518
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,400
We need to eat quickly.

1519
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,940
Hold on. We won't be able
to enjoy a lot of it.

1520
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,000
- Only 15 minutes.
- It's 10:07 a.m.

1521
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,710
- Can you let us walk from here?
- Eat quickly, guys.

1522
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,780
- We could walk up there.
- We don't have a lot of time.

1523
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,180
That would be hilarious.

1524
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,980
Imagine going in there but...

1525
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,410
You failed!

1526
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,920
This is a challenge of its own.

1527
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,120
After we eat at the buffet,

1528
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,320
we need to get sandwich
as our next answer.

1529
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,650
We need to hurry.

1530
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,260
(Will they be able to enjoy the buffet
within their time frame?)

1531
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,920
- Hello.
- No way.

1532
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,230
It smells incredible.

1533
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,560
(Luxury interiors
they rarely get to see)

1534
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,360
- This is so cool.
- There are other people eating.

1535
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,530
(Current time, 10:10 a.m.)

1536
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:41,660
- How is this possible?
- This is insane.

1537
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,800
- Quiet, everyone.
- Keep it down.

1538
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,330
Don't be so loud.

1539
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,700
I can't wait.

1540
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,870
(Though busy,
they follow hotel etiquette.)

1541
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:49,400
- I'm nervous.
- This is amazing.

1542
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,140
- No way.
- I'm beyond excited.

1543
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,210
- Hello.
- Can you believe it?

1544
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:57,210
(Starting at the entrance,
it feels luxurious.)

1545
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,010
This isn't
some makeshift catering buffet.

1546
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,220
I should have that.

1547
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,320
- That looks so good.
- What should we have?

1548
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,590
Guys, this is a luxurious meal.

1549
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,020
(Savory seaweed soup
and steamed white rice)

1550
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,760
Everything looks expensive.

1551
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:09,830
I've never been here before.

1552
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:10,960
- It's a first for me too.
- Really?

1553
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,400
(What Jong Kook would love,
Salmon packed with protein)

1554
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:14,560
Check this out.

1555
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,400
- What's this?
- This is getting me excited.

1556
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:18,600
- This is so nice.
- I'm excited too.

1557
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:20,900
There's udon too.

1558
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,340
- Where do we sit?
- Our seats...

1559
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,340
- Do we eat?
- Yes, let's eat.

1560
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,640
(With little time left,
they take what they want to eat.)

1561
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,980
There's lobster here.

1562
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,510
(With little time left,
they take what they want to eat.)

1563
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,350
- No way.
- Hello.

1564
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,520
There are so many options,
and I can't choose.

1565
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,850
There's salmon.

1566
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,320
It's served with dried laver.

1567
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,790
(The kind that only goes
for protein-rich food)

1568
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:42,960
- Salmon
- It's served with dried laver.

1569
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,660
Protein

1570
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,800
Protein, my protein

1571
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,930
The highlight of a breakfast buffet
is the omelet.

1572
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,430
I used too many plates.
What a waste.

1573
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,000
- Should I move that for you?
- Would you?

1574
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,440
This is a protein-packed breakfast.

1575
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,310
Protein, my protein

1576
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,640
It's meat! Peking duck.

1577
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,950
Is there the skin?

1578
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:05,210
(He spots Peking duck
at the breakfast buffet.)

1579
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,580
- What breakfast buffet has this?
- No way.

1580
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,580
(The type
that only seeks out fancy food)

1581
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,820
This is the fanciest.

1582
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:15,460
(He's already helped himself
to some lobster.)

1583
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,830
Wait. They have crab.

1584
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:23,670
(Ssaebssaeb gets excited
over the expensive lobster.)

1585
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,530
Is this Peking duck?

1586
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,470
(The three filled their plates
with fancy food.)

1587
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:29,070
I can't believe it.

1588
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,870
- This is amazing.
- I'm stunned.

1589
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,380
There's so much to eat.

1590
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,010
(Despite many options,
he chooses jjajangmyeon.)

1591
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,450
There's even nasi goreng.

1592
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:41,420
(Someone who eats what he wants,
regardless of getting the best deal)

1593
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,520
This... I can't help it.
I need to have this.

1594
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,150
This...

1595
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:48,920
The Oreo cereal.

1596
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:51,130
This is so good.

1597
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,930
I should have Fruit Rings as well.

1598
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,360
(He's even worse than Jae Seok.)

1599
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,270
I love Peking duck wraps.

1600
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:01,570
You need to have green onions
with Peking duck.

1601
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,510
(Eating a bit of everything,
Truly a food fighter)

1602
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,810
Should I take this?

1603
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,080
There's yogurt.

1604
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,850
(Humming involuntarily)

1605
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:16,590
Yogurt.

1606
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,950
(Unlike others, Food Fighter
doesn't skip on dessert.)

1607
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,050
Mangoes.

1608
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,590
(Unlike others, Food Fighter
doesn't skip on dessert.)

1609
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:21,720
Mangoes.

1610
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,930
I want some ice cream too.

1611
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,260
I love ketchup.

1612
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,830
(New Food Fighter
is just as intense as Food Fighter.)

1613
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,200
- Is my pho ready?
- Yes, here you go.

1614
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,270
- Thank you.
- Please enjoy.

1615
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,340
(She even ordered a bowl of pho.)

1616
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,470
That must be coffee, right?

1617
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:40,940
Yes, coffee. There it is.

1618
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,110
Will we get to drink coffee
at the breakfast buffet?

1619
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,650
One from the espresso machine.

1620
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,320
Wait. It's not automatically served.

1621
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,680
Espresso. Americano...

1622
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,420
Oh, here it is.

1623
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,150
(Pressing)

1624
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,430
(Nothing's coming out.)

1625
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,460
- We should have some.
- That we should.

1626
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,860
- Of course, we should have some.
- Coffee?

1627
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,900
(Eager to drink coffee,
not realizing it's not coming out)

1628
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,600
Where's my Americano?
I already pressed the button.

1629
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,700
But I pressed the button.

1630
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,340
- Extract.
- The milk's too hot?

1631
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,440
"Replace with colder milk."

1632
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,570
That's not what I want.

1633
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,080
Oh, I'm to pull down the lever.

1634
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,040
I see.

1635
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,510
You need to press the button first.

1636
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:19,950
Come on, Jong Kook.

1637
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,280
- What?
- After pulling it down.

1638
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,820
Put that in and then pull down.

1639
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,350
- Why can't you operate this?
- Unbelievable.

1640
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,360
So much for all those trips
to the US.

1641
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,190
- Why can't you do this?
- I've never seen this before.

1642
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:30,330
It's a first for me.

1643
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:31,690
Put one in and press the button.

1644
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:32,960
It needs more time.

1645
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,200
Come on. Why won't it come out?

1646
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,000
- What can I get you?
- Oh, good.

1647
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:39,130
I'd like a cup of Americano.

1648
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,300
Which one?

1649
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,970
This one seems good. This one.

1650
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:45,110
I want to enjoy the lingering aroma
of roasted beans.

1651
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,240
Why couldn't you do this?

1652
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,610
- He pulled it down. An Americano.
- You just do it.

1653
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,910
That's what I also did.

1654
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,550
Then why did you say
it wasn't working?

1655
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,080
Bread pudding.

1656
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,250
(Food Fighter is already filling
another plate.)

1657
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,990
You know there's more to eat, right?

1658
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,550
Where? Oh, of course.

1659
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,090
Yes.

1660
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,330
(She said she understood
but still got herself some waffles.)

1661
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:04,460
Chocolate.

1662
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,260
(She said she understood
but still got herself some waffles.)

1663
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,830
(She needs to eat much more
to complete the bingo board.)

1664
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:08,960
Whipped cream.

1665
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,730
(She needs to eat much more
to complete the bingo board.)

1666
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,170
Let's eat and think later.

1667
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,070
I should have a fried egg.

1668
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:17,110
Hello.

1669
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:18,270
(They grab lots of food
without thinking about what comes next.)

1670
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:21,110
There is so much delicious food.

1671
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,110
They're all going crazy.

1672
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,210
That looks so good.

1673
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,250
(Breakfast Bingo)

1674
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:30,120
(What to eat to complete the bingo:
Gamjatang and clear beef bone soup)

1675
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,650
(What to eat to complete the bingo:
Sundaeguk and sandwich)

1676
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,830
Everyone's walking around
really fast out there.

1677
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,800
- Is this the only empty seat?
- Why did you bring so much?

1678
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,200
What? Of course,
we should eat a lot.

1679
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,370
Please remember that you need...

1680
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:48,070
- to keep eating today.
- That slipped my mind.

1681
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,710
- This...
- Is that pho?

1682
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,010
Yes.

1683
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,880
This is Peking duck.

1684
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:05,350
(They forget about what's to come
and elegantly enjoy the buffet.)

1685
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:06,620
The Peking duck is so good.

1686
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,060
- Seok Jin, the duck is really good.
- I'm ready.

1687
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,860
We don't have a lot of time
and should hurry.

1688
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,860
- The Peking duck is good.
- Right?

1689
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,500
- The Peking duck is amazing.
- I can't believe it.

1690
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:19,800
Seok Jin, there's lobster.

1691
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:21,900
How many minutes do we have left?

1692
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:25,670
The breakfast buffet stays open
until 10:30 a.m.

1693
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,340
You have 7 minutes left.
It's 10:23 a.m.

1694
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,350
(Current time, 10:23 a.m.)

1695
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:32,750
(They can't eat
once the time is up!)

1696
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,920
(Gobbling)

1697
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,720
Everyone's having a field day
in there.

1698
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,720
What did you get?

1699
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,560
Jong Kook couldn't
operate the machine...

1700
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,490
and had to call for help
to get some coffee.

1701
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:51,030
(Noodle-lover Jae Seok eats
jjajangmyeon first.)

1702
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,500
You...

1703
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,540
- Enjoy your meal.
- I got a bowl of cereal.

1704
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,570
- You're having cereal?
- I love cereal.

1705
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,880
No way. The pho!

1706
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,480
- Is the pho good?
- The smell of cilantro.

1707
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,310
- I don't really like cilantro.
- I love cilantro.

1708
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:06,920
- Really?
- So that's what I'm smelling.

1709
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,220
I love cilantro.

1710
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,220
(Food Fighter arrived with noodles
loaded with cilantro.)

1711
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,890
- Can't you sit far away?
- I can't.

1712
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:13,520
- Maybe over there...
- Cilantro is the best.

1713
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,320
- Isn't that also cilantro?
- I love cilantro.

1714
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,530
- Gosh, cilantro.
- Do you like it?

1715
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:18,730
- From both sides...
- Try some.

1716
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:19,860
I can't eat it.

1717
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:21,260
Even the smell is off-putting.

1718
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,570
Is cilantro that good?

1719
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:24,970
- I love it.
- I love it too.

1720
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,470
The smell of cilantro
is overwhelming.

1721
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:27,840
I have cilantro on its own.

1722
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:29,800
It's really good.

1723
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:34,880
(Food Fighter doesn't care
and continues to eat.)

1724
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,940
It's good.

1725
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,250
This place...

1726
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,450
(Fueling up with grapefruit juice)

1727
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:39,480
Even the breakfast...

1728
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,580
- is good.
- They serve amazing food.

1729
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,750
It's now my favorite place.

1730
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,490
It's so good.

1731
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,150
I need to get some dessert.

1732
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:49,860
(Yes, they already had a bowl
of bean sprout gukbap each.)

1733
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,760
- No way!
- I already brought my dessert.

1734
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,930
No way.

1735
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:55,260
Gosh, the jjajangmyeon.

1736
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,600
The jjajangmyeon is so good.

1737
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,630
I get why Sunwoo Yong Nyeo
has a breakfast buffet every day.

1738
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,700
(The others are eating,
but one seat remains empty.)

1739
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,040
(My gosh)

1740
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,010
This is a proper breakfast.

1741
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,110
(He just finished getting
his coffee.)

1742
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,710
Protein

1743
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:13,480
(The relaxed Jong Kook joins them.)

1744
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,480
(Starting with protein)

1745
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,580
Gosh, this.

1746
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:20,820
(After soothing his insides
with gukbap,)

1747
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:24,660
(he fills his stomach with protein.)

1748
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,800
Sunwoo Yong Nyeo knew
what she was talking about.

1749
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,960
This is so good.

1750
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,030
I'm glad we came here.

1751
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,400
(The food is so good
that they eat until they're full.)

1752
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,840
- Is that cheese?
- Yes.

1753
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,770
(The food is so good
that they eat until they're full.)

1754
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:40,380
The problem is this.

1755
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,640
How are we supposed
to eat the next meal?

1756
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,650
Right, there's more.

1757
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:46,010
We need to eat
the next dish as well.

1758
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,480
- I forgot about today's race.
- You're on your first square.

1759
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,290
I got so caught up eating
that I forgot about the race.

1760
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:53,020
- Just one?
- Yes, you only occupied one square.

1761
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,220
- What do we do?
- I wasn't thinking straight.

1762
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,260
What was I doing?

1763
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,630
(The well-known light eaters didn't
think about the rest of the day.)

1764
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,160
There is only one minute left.

1765
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,130
I need a beverage.

1766
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:04,400
- Are we down to a minute?
- Yes.

1767
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,870
- I want more grapefruit juice.
- Hold on.

1768
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:07,900
(Daniel leaves with 1 minute left
to grab a palate cleanser.)

1769
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,500
How do you use this?

1770
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,840
Let me help.

1771
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,840
- Does that go in?
- Yes.

1772
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,180
I see.

1773
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,780
And then... Right.

1774
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,280
I don't have the time
to wait for this.

1775
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,780
Stop, please.

1776
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:23,650
Stop.

1777
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,590
(Enjoying the food
down to the last mouthful)

1778
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:27,890
It's so good.

1779
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:29,960
(Enjoying the food
down to the last mouthful)

1780
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:35,800
It's now 10:30 a.m.

1781
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,730
- Your meal is over.
- Wait.

1782
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:38,870
We'll clear the table.

1783
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,270
Sure.

1784
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,440
- Let me have the dried laver.
- Hold on.

1785
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,470
(The plates are cleared
to keep the buffet on schedule.)

1786
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,870
I'd love another beverage.

1787
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:45,970
- Wait.
- Grapefruit juice.

1788
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:48,310
- Hold on.
- Why are you taking it away?

1789
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:49,940
(Trembling)

1790
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,380
- How can you be so cruel?
- Come on.

1791
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,220
How long does this take?

1792
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,250
- What?
- It overflows if you don't push it.

1793
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,360
Oh, really? I see. Thank you.

1794
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,260
(Taking a sip)

1795
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:05,460
It's 10:30 a.m. now,
so you can't have your coffee.

1796
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,600
You have to leave it here.

1797
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,700
(He has to return his coffee
after a single sip.)

1798
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,800
But I just got it.

1799
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,400
Excuse me. Wait.

1800
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,500
You can go back now.

1801
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,370
Gosh, I'm full now.
Oh, do we have to do that again?

1802
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:18,370
I guess we do.

1803
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:20,480
You succeeded in eating
at the breakfast buffet,

1804
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,510
- so you can put a sticker on that.
- Put the sticker on it.

1805
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:25,750
But we're in trouble now.

1806
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,320
- Gosh, I'm full, though.
- Hey, she's...

1807
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,950
We're in trouble now.

1808
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,120
Hey, how will we eat
the next meal now?

1809
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,160
- So, the sandwich.
- The nicest thing would be...

1810
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,160
to go like this.

1811
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,530
- That's right.
- Up to the sundaeguk.

1812
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:38,660
- Yes, that way.
- But you know,

1813
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,930
the gamjatang
and clear beef bone soup...

1814
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:41,160
The clear beef bone soup
will be hard.

1815
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,830
That's going to kill us.
This is the only way to go.

1816
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:44,330
- Right. Sundaeguk and sandwiches.
- We should go with sandwiches.

1817
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,500
All right.

1818
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,400
Okay, let's draw a name
for who gets to ask.

1819
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,700
- Hey, Se Chan.
- We'll pick the next people.

1820
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,740
You and I are getting picked
quite a lot today.

1821
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:52,140
- Yes, I know.
- Your luck changes each day.

1822
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,080
- It'll be us again. Just watch.
- I'm sure it won't be me anymore.

1823
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,240
I'll make it a success for you guys.

1824
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:57,880
- Who is it?
- It's just random.

1825
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,150
- You have to go if it's you.
- It's Haha.

1826
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,420
- Okay!
- Come on.

1827
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,020
(Road Man is chosen.)

1828
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,520
- Finally.
- You wanted to go so badly.

1829
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,950
- Don't you worry.
- What's up, yo?

1830
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:07,290
- Hey, Road Man.
- What's up, yo?

1831
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,490
- So, after this,
- Let's see how Road Man does.

1832
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:10,890
it'll be fine
as long as it's not Jae Seok.

1833
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:13,760
If it's Jae Seok,
you two will be polar opposites.

1834
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,130
I think it'll be Jae Seok.

1835
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:17,730
Who is it?

1836
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,830
- It's Kim Jong Kook.
- Okay!

1837
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,970
(Jong Kook is chosen.)

1838
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,940
- We're good.
- So,

1839
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,740
you will go to ask the question
right away.

1840
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,380
- Since you have to go outside,
- We do.

1841
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,010
- we'll move locations first.
- Okay.

1842
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,410
- I'm nervous.
- I'm so full.

1843
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:31,810
Gosh, that was delicious.

1844
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:32,880
I had such a great meal.

1845
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:34,880
- But we're in trouble.
- Those people...

1846
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,120
- Just now, we had...
- We ate too much.

1847
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,690
- We all ate so much at the buffet.
- Right.

1848
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:42,320
And you can only ask the question
and nothing else.

1849
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,590
But we can break the ice a bit,
can't we?

1850
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:46,060
We need to try a variety of stuff...

1851
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,330
- for the Road Man to shine.
- That's right.

1852
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:50,630
But if that's the case,
you need to get rid of this guy.

1853
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:51,630
What's up, yo?

1854
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,330
What's up, yo?

1855
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,370
- Mr. What's Up.
- What's up, yo?

1856
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,140
"What's up, yo" is
such an old phrase.

1857
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:01,380
Jong Kook is one thing,
but that guy does whatever he wants.

1858
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,750
- Haha is so...
- We should leave him out.

1859
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:06,410
Then, I'll walk around a bit.

1860
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:07,920
- Now...
- But we could get sundaeguk.

1861
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,250
It'll be more comfortable
if we get sandwich first for now.

1862
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,590
That's right.

1863
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:16,220
Gosh, MBC has disappeared
like it was never there before.

1864
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,660
That's right.
Our memories have disappeared.

1865
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,830
There is no trace of it left.

1866
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:22,630
- We did so much there.
- Right.

1867
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,430
(Footage provided by MBC)

1868
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,330
- The fountain was here.
- Right.

1869
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,600
- That's where the fountain was.
- That's right.

1870
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,770
(A high-rise building now stands
where their memories used to be.)

1871
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:33,040
The people with memories in Yeouido
are taking the lead.

1872
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,040
Do you guys have your portraits
at the photo studio here?

1873
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,010
- We all do.
- Yes, we do.

1874
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,050
- We had our photos taken there.
- It was around here.

1875
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:39,410
- You couldn't skip that.
- Right.

1876
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,750
- Yes.
- We all had our photos taken there.

1877
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,520
- This way?
- Oh, nice!

1878
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,890
- They seem all right.
- A hundred percent.

1879
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:48,060
- They're good. So energetic.
- Yes, 100 percent.

1880
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,560
- Shall we try it here?
- Here?

1881
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,060
- Shall we try it?
- Go for it? What do you say?

1882
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

1883
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,230
- Were you going to cross?
- Be careful.

1884
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:55,530
Go ahead and cross.

1885
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:57,730
- You must like Haha.
- Let's go across.

1886
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:59,430
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Is that right?

1887
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:01,240
- Seok Jin!
- What is he doing there?

1888
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,710
- You have such great reactions.
- Mister!

1889
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,010
- Seok Jin!
- You're making us feel good too.

1890
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:06,210
- Seok Sam!
- We're huge fans!

1891
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,880
- Seok Sam.
- Come on. Those two have to do it.

1892
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,680
- Why are you following them?
- I couldn't help myself.

1893
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,010
(The citizens spot Saint Yu.)

1894
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:14,220
- I love you!
- My goodness.

1895
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,920
- Where are you going?
- We're going to eat.

1896
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,150
Already? It's a bit early.

1897
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:20,490
Oh, we can't get caught.

1898
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:22,520
(Laughing)

1899
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,030
Could we ask you for
a quick interview, perhaps?

1900
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:27,030
- Oh, my.
- Cover my eyes like this.

1901
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:29,230
- Yes, should we do that?
- All right, then.

1902
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:30,630
Should we make you look like
you're in the movie, "Parasite?"

1903
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:32,430
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

1904
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:33,900
- Excuse me.
- What?

1905
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,540
It's not your turn.

1906
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,270
This is just breaking the ice.
Let's hear what they have to say.

1907
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:40,880
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yes, nice to meet you.

1908
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,410
- Where were you headed?
- To eat.

1909
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,210
- Oh, to eat.
- Haven't you eaten yet?

1910
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:45,310
- No.
- What will you eat?

1911
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:47,120
- What will you eat?
- Soybean noodle soup.

1912
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,120
- Soybean noodle soup.
- Soybean noodle soup.

1913
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,050
- Soybean noodle soup is good too.
- Of course it is.

1914
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:52,950
- But that's good for lunch.
- You do crave it.

1915
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,420
- That's right.
- Yes.

1916
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,520
Well, that's good too, but...

1917
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,230
- Yes, well, anyway...
- What should I say?

1918
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:00,230
- If we ask you a question,
- Yes?

1919
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:02,430
- you can answer it for us.
- Okay.

1920
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:03,900
- This morning...
- Yes, it's still morning.

1921
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,770
- It is morning. Yes.
- The morning.

1922
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:07,770
- Right. We should emphasize that.
- It's still morning.

1923
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:09,140
In the morning.

1924
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,210
You're going to eat
soybean noodle soup now.

1925
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:13,210
- You're going to have lunch, right?
- It's for lunch, right?

1926
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:15,140
But our question is...
It's still morning, right?

1927
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,740
- Right, it's the morning.
- Morning.

1928
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,650
- I'll give you a simple question.
- Okay.

1929
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:21,320
- Answer comfortably.
- Yes, comfortably.

1930
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,120
- No pressure and no right answers.
- Really, feel free.

1931
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,620
- There's no right answer.
- Okay.

1932
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,820
- All right.
- Breakfast.

1933
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:27,920
What do you want...

1934
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,560
for breakfast?

1935
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,260
- Breakfast.
- Let's go.

1936
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:35,660
Sandwiches or sundaeguk.

1937
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,070
- Sandwiches or sundaeguk.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1938
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,670
(Will they get sandwiches
or sundaeguk like they want?)

1939
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:39,670
- Do I have to answer?
- Yes.

1940
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:41,500
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1941
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:44,240
Pork belly!

1942
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,510
Pork belly in the morning?

1943
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:50,340
- What?
- She says she wants pork belly.

1944
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,850
So, we will move to
a pork belly restaurant.

1945
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:54,580
- But in the morning?
- Pork belly for breakfast?

1946
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:55,750
Do you eat pork belly for breakfast?

1947
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:56,780
- I wanted you to have it.
- Oh, you wanted us to have it?

1948
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,120
- Yes.
- Oh, you wanted us to have it.

1949
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,020
- Oh, no.
- That's what I thought.

1950
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,660
- I see.
- You were thinking about us.

1951
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,160
- You were being considerate.
- Of course.

1952
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,260
- We thought too much about it.
- That's right.

1953
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,030
She was trying to be considerate
of us.

1954
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,270
- It's okay. Pork belly is great.
- Of course.

1955
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,670
- Yes, it's great.
- We've been wanting to have some.

1956
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:13,900
Our bellies are about to burst,
but...

1957
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,470
Well, anyway,
you gave us such a sensible answer.

1958
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:19,040
- Is that okay?
- Yes, thank you.

1959
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,210
- Yes, please enjoy the food.
- Thank you.

1960
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:21,410
- We'll enjoy it.
- Thank you.

1961
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:22,840
- Soybean noodle soup!
- Thank you.

1962
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,750
- You can do it!
- Yes!

1963
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:25,850
You're so cool!

1964
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,780
- I love you guys!
- Thank you.

1965
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,380
Thank you. Bye.

1966
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,320
- We should've made it easier.
- This is hard.

1967
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,660
- Then, through a mission...
- A mission?

1968
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,890
Since you must be full,
only four of you...

1969
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:38,460
- will have to eat.
- Only four?

1970
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:41,430
- This was because you two...
- We're so grateful to her. Yes?

1971
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:43,660
run a barbecue restaurant.
That's why...

1972
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:44,700
- I see.
- Oh, right.

1973
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,970
- Oh, right.
- That's why...

1974
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,140
- We do have that image.
- I told you. It has an effect.

1975
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,170
- That's true.
- We need to pick people well.

1976
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:51,970
We can't pick people like this guy.

1977
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:52,970
Gosh, seriously.

1978
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,710
- People like this guy?
- Like this guy.

1979
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,650
- Mnet is going to rise up now.
- Are we really eating pork belly?

1980
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:59,150
Weren't you strongly advocating...

1981
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,820
- for sandwiches earlier?
- That's why, mister.

1982
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:01,950
You were the strongest advocate...
- That's right.
- for sandwiches.

1983
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,790
- It depends, though.
- How will you take responsibility?

1984
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:07,160
- My gosh. Seriously.
- You should carry the panel.

1985
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,960
Also, mister,
you have to make it simple.

1986
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,430
- It was simple.
- The explanation was too long.

1987
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:14,060
That's what made her think too much.

1988
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,330
You should've said,
"Imagine that it's 7 a.m. right now."

1989
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:17,800
- They have sandwiches here.
- Hello.

1990
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:21,340
Imagine that it's 7 a.m. right now.

1991
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,070
- What do you want for breakfast?
- We have to go now.

1992
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:24,670
- Sandwiches.
- I want gukbap.

1993
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:25,710
Sandwiches.

1994
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:28,610
- Sandwiches! See? She said it.
- What was that?

1995
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:31,050
- "Imagine that it's 7 a.m.?"
- Isn't that right?

1996
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,010
- At 7 a.m.?
- This is what you have to do.

1997
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,580
- Sandwiches, right?
- For real?

1998
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:35,750
How immediate and natural was that?

1999
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,350
- This is so...
- Thank you!

2000
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:39,520
- Your interview skills are...
- You can't do that.

2001
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,660
Your interview skills are...

2002
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:41,860
- Sandwiches.
- What?

2003
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,230
- Right away. Oh, hello.
- Oh, boy.

2004
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:46,330
By chance, for breakfast...
Imagine that it's 7 a.m. now.

2005
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,860
It's 7 a.m. You have to hurry up
and get to work.

2006
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:48,900
- Yes.
- If you had to eat,

2007
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,930
what would it be?
Sandwiches. In 1, 2, 3.

2008
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,970
- Sandwiches.
- Like that.

2009
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:54,700
(Amazingly,
sandwiches pop up again.)

2010
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,170
- You told him.
- You just told him.

2011
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,170
- Jae Seok!
- You told him!

2012
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:58,870
(They get the answer they want
when the nation's MC asks.)

2013
01:03:58,870 --> 01:03:59,870
- Didn't you tell him?
- Jae Seok!

2014
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,910
- Hey, I...
- Jae Seok, you're a total cheater.

2015
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:03,840
- You're an interview cheater!
- You couldn't hear it.

2016
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,950
- The interview cheater.
- You could barely hear it.

2017
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:08,680
- You couldn't tell!
- See that?

2018
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,750
- It was hard to tell.
- You need a bit of technique.

2019
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:11,790
You could barely hear it.

2020
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:14,120
- You need to use that technique.
- You were like a card shark.

2021
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,760
- Right.
- Like switching out a card.

2022
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:18,530
That's what I call interview skills.

2023
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,700
- Is this it?
- This one?

2024
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,260
We should do well in this game.

2025
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,570
- Seriously.
- Our bellies might burst.

2026
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:25,930
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

2027
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,670
You must be feeling pretty full
by now.

2028
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:31,370
Through a simple mission,
the winners...

2029
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:32,970
will be exempt from this meal.

2030
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,240
- Sounds good.
- I'm full.

2031
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,010
This mission is called
The Cactus Is Listening.

2032
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:40,150
Two people will form a team,

2033
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:43,250
and you will pass an item
back and forth...

2034
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:45,750
over a cactus doll
that's sensitive to sound.

2035
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:48,920
The team's record will be
the number of times...

2036
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,960
that the cactus doesn't move.

2037
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,290
Each team will play for 30 seconds,

2038
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,600
and the two teams that make...

2039
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,170
the cactus move the least
will be exempt from the meal.

2040
01:04:58,170 --> 01:04:59,170
- Okay.
- Okay.

2041
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:01,700
Please get into teams of two.

2042
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,270
Shall we just pair up
with the person next to us?

2043
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:04,270
- As we're sitting now?
- Us two...

2044
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:05,970
- Each pair in order.
- Just like this?

2045
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:08,380
- The Chungju Ji and Jee.
- Yes, the Chungju Ji and Jee.

2046
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,040
- You and me.
- Okay, you and me.

2047
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,410
(Teams: Seok Jin and Ye Eun,
Ji Hyo and Daniel, Jong Kook and Se Chan)

2048
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,650
Mister, let's do that.

2049
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:15,250
- Okay, then.
- Fine.

2050
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:18,590
This is really sensitive to sound.

2051
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:20,690
Everyone,
please don't make any noise.

2052
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,590
- Really?
- Gosh, why is it doing that?

2053
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,330
- It's cute.
- This thing is kind of annoying.

2054
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,800
- Hey.
- Let's turn it off.

2055
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,030
Hey.

2056
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:32,500
Like so, even with a bit of sound,

2057
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,340
it reacts right away.

2058
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,870
Everyone must stay quiet.

2059
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:40,070
Please decide which team
will go first.

2060
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:41,510
- Shall we go first?
- Okay.

2061
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:43,840
(Jae Seok and Haha go first!)

2062
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,450
(The others must remain silent.)

2063
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:48,820
Ready.

2064
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,090
(Start)

2065
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:53,890
(Jae Seok and Haha)

2066
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:56,960
(You can't win a point
if there is a sound.)

2067
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,900
(Quiet)

2068
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,900
(Jae Seok and Haha: 1)

2069
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:09,340
(Be careful, please!)

2070
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,570
(Dancing)

2071
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,610
(Dancing)

2072
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:19,410
(Dancing away)

2073
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:24,190
(The cactus dances like crazy.)

2074
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,830
(They keep failing
after winning 1 point.)

2075
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,860
Time's up. You succeeded in it once.

2076
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:37,930
(Jae Seok and Haha won 1 point.)

2077
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:40,270
- Let's succeed in it twice.
- Okay.

2078
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:41,840
They did badly.

2079
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,000
- All right.
- All right.

2080
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,840
(Next comes
Team Chungju Ji and Jee.)

2081
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,970
Okay. We won't say a word.

2082
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:48,180
(Seok Jin and Ye Eun)

2083
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:49,440
(Moving)

2084
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,450
(Moving)

2085
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,180
(Dancing)

2086
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,350
(Dancing)

2087
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:02,290
(It already looks like
they're ruined.)

2088
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:09,230
(The cactus continues to do
the popping dance.)

2089
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:14,640
(Will they be able to win
1 point at the very least?)

2090
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:17,540
Time's up.

2091
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:19,340
- Did they win zero points?
- You didn't succeed in it once.

2092
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:21,010
How did you guys succeed in it once?

2093
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:22,180
We'll show you.

2094
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,350
- Good.
- We might be able to win.

2095
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:25,380
We'll show you.

2096
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:28,550
(Jong Kook and Se Chan go next.)

2097
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:31,520
(Jong Kook and Se Chan)

2098
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,850
(Quiet)

2099
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:35,860
(They won 1 point from the start.)

2100
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:38,130
(Jong Kook and Se Chan: 1)

2101
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:40,960
(It stays quiet again.)

2102
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:41,960
(Jong Kook and Se Chan: 2)

2103
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,160
How do they do that?

2104
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:47,970
(Throw it to the front!)

2105
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,840
(They get 1 more point!)

2106
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,110
(Jong Kook and Se Chan: 3)

2107
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:58,810
(Even with 3 points,
they're currently in 1st place.)

2108
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:04,390
(They win another point!)

2109
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,590
(Jong Kook and Se Chan: 4)

2110
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,560
(They win yet another point!)

2111
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,290
Time's up.
You succeeded in it five times.

2112
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:14,430
Let's go.

2113
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:15,730
- We did it.
- Well done.

2114
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,260
- It was great.
- They did so well.

2115
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,630
- To the front.
- You need to catch it like this.

2116
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,000
(Ji Hyo and Daniel go next.)

2117
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,070
- Okay.
- Are we next?

2118
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:23,170
- Yes.
- Ji Hyo and...

2119
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:24,340
We'll show you.

2120
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:26,070
We'll show you.

2121
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,240
(Ji Hyo and Daniel will be exempt
if they win 2 points!)

2122
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,340
Get ready.

2123
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,850
(Ji Hyo and Daniel will be exempt
if they win 2 points!)

2124
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:32,780
(Ji Hyo and Daniel)

2125
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,780
(Dropping)

2126
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:42,960
(Crushing)

2127
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,030
(It doesn't look like
they'll do well.)

2128
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:49,000
(He drops it again.)

2129
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:53,430
(Enthusiastic body roll)

2130
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,540
(They need to win 2 points
in order to get ahead.)

2131
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:01,480
(These two players have good forms.)

2132
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:04,150
(Crushing)

2133
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,410
(Crushing)

2134
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:08,820
Throw it upward.

2135
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:11,290
(They can hear the ramyeon
getting crushed.)

2136
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:14,120
(Will Haha and Jae Seok win?)

2137
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:16,960
- Time's up.
- Hey.

2138
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:19,330
- Time's up.
- Hey.

2139
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:21,030
- Seriously.
- It's hard.

2140
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:22,300
You should've eliminated the noises.

2141
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,400
You should've caught it like this.

2142
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:25,700
- The four members who failed...
- All right.

2143
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,070
- to win a point will eat.
- Okay.

2144
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,440
How will we eat?

2145
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,670
- Let's hurry up and eat.
- Okay, Seok Jin.

2146
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:32,840
- Let's grill the meat.
- Let's grill it right away.

2147
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,380
Let's hurry up and eat.

2148
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:35,610
Shall we only grill two strips?

2149
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,850
- You need to eat all four servings.
- Thank you.

2150
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,050
Do we need to eat all the food?

2151
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:40,280
Do we need to eat all the food?

2152
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,480
- Let's hurry up and grill it.
- Food Fighter.

2153
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,550
New Food Fighter
and Old Food Fighter.

2154
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:43,780
- I can eat.
- Let's do it.

2155
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,550
- But there's so much food.
- There's so much food.

2156
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:46,690
What are we going to do?

2157
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,990
- We told you repeatedly to eat...
- It's one strip per person.

2158
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:50,220
- What?
- a small amount of food.

2159
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,630
Seriously.

2160
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:53,960
(Right before eating at the buffet)

2161
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,330
We can play a game and pick
a few people to eat at the buffet.

2162
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:57,970
- No, thank you.
- All of us should eat.

2163
01:09:57,970 --> 01:09:59,000
- Come on.
- It's okay.

2164
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
- It's a buffet.
- It's a buffet.

2165
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,800
- All of us should eat.
- I haven't been to one in a while.

2166
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,900
- It has been a while.
- Seriously.

2167
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:06,370
(They had their fill
despite the crew members' worries.)

2168
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:08,310
You know that you need to eat
the next food, right?

2169
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:12,680
(They swallowed the advice
along with the food.)

2170
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:14,620
- It was a good meal.
- I was so excited...

2171
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,120
- that I didn't think.
- At the buffet,

2172
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,520
I got three plates of food.

2173
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,450
- Now that things have come to this,
- I don't know what to do.

2174
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:20,890
- let's just eat.
- You need to make an effort.

2175
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:22,960
Food Fighter, you can't stop here.

2176
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,660
- We're depending on you.
- Food Fighter.

2177
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:25,830
Food Fighter, you can't be weak.

2178
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:26,990
- Seriously.
- We need to make an effort.

2179
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,860
I'll cut the meat into big pieces.

2180
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,160
- If I cut them...
- Meat.

2181
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,470
into small pieces,
we'll need to chew a lot.

2182
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:32,670
- Okay. Cut them into big pieces.
- I'll cut them, Ji Hyo.

2183
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:34,440
- Ji Hyo, I'll do it.
- I'll cut them.

2184
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:36,340
Don't even think...

2185
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:39,340
about not eating.

2186
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,210
- Don't do that.
- It'll be a disaster.

2187
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,280
- Eat.
- Okay.

2188
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,580
- Eat diligently.
- Let's eat diligently.

2189
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,680
- Don't keep chewing on one piece.
- Let's eat diligently.

2190
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:47,510
Don't chew on the meat
as if it's gum.

2191
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:48,680
- Okay.
- Don't do that.

2192
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,250
Seriously, I'll be watching.

2193
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:51,650
I think we can eat it now.

2194
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:53,090
- Let's hurry. We don't have time.
- Eat.

2195
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:54,390
- We need to eat fast.
- Seriously.

2196
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:56,120
- Enjoy the food.
- Enjoy the food.

2197
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,560
My zipper...

2198
01:10:58,660 --> 01:10:59,760
(Ji Hyo opens
the zipper of her pants.)

2199
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,930
Ji Hyo.

2200
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:02,130
- Seriously.
- Ji Hyo.

2201
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:04,060
- Don't open the zipper.
- Did you open the zipper?

2202
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,270
Do you know what's amazing?

2203
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:06,670
I opened it a while ago.

2204
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,070
- I opened it a while ago. Yes.
- Really?

2205
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:10,470
- There's a problem with the zipper.
- When did you open it?

2206
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:12,410
I did it when we ate gukbap.

2207
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,740
- It's tasty.
- Old and New Food Fighters...

2208
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:17,080
(Meanwhile,
Daniel takes the first bite.)

2209
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,110
- I opened it a while ago. Yes.
- Really?

2210
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,550
- Is it tasty?
- It's tasty.

2211
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:22,680
- Eat.
- Really?

2212
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,090
Eat it with kimchi.

2213
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:26,290
(Ji Hyo eats it at a wrap.)

2214
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,490
- It's so tasty.
- Hey.

2215
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:29,960
(The YouTuber eats it
with grilled kimchi.)

2216
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,130
I saw it.

2217
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:35,100
- It's good.
- Can't we drink Coca-Cola?

2218
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,000
- You can drink it.
- Really?

2219
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
(They order a soft drink
as a digestive medicine.)

2220
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:41,900
- Gosh!
- You know, it's tasty.

2221
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,140
It's tasty!

2222
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:45,210
(The penalty is like a reward.)

2223
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,340
It's tasty when I eat it.

2224
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:47,980
- It's tasty when I eat it.
- It's tasty.

2225
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,910
Who wants Coca-Cola?

2226
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:52,550
(The digestive medicine enters.)

2227
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:53,980
Food keeps going in.

2228
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,080
It's tasty when I eat it.

2229
01:11:56,350 --> 01:11:57,450
It's tasty.

2230
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:58,850
- I'll drink from the bottle.
- Okay.

2231
01:11:58,950 --> 01:11:59,990
Hey, we...

2232
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:02,320
She has her own boundaries.

2233
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,890
(Ddochi drinks from the bottle.)

2234
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:09,630
- It's tasty.
- You can shove in food.

2235
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:11,230
It's hot.

2236
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:12,830
This is like my fifth piece.

2237
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,810
(Groaning and grunting)

2238
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:20,340
Why does she keep losing weight
when she eats so well?

2239
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:22,840
Doesn't your mom call you
and tell you that you're too skinny?

2240
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,310
- Yesterday, my mom...
- Okay.

2241
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:25,780
I can't believe it.

2242
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:27,280
Doesn't she say
that you've lost too much weight?

2243
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,450
It wasn't anything like that.

2244
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:31,090
- Something annoying happened.
- What?

2245
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,460
"Ye Eun, you should read
a book on common sense..."

2246
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:35,920
"when you have time."

2247
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,060
(She was startled upon watching
the Empty Head Quiz.)

2248
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:40,490
I can't believe it.
She's serious about it.

2249
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:41,660
Ye Eun, let me see it.

2250
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:44,470
I left her on read.

2251
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:48,140
Your mom should see it
as your character.

2252
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:49,940
I know. Why doesn't my mom know me?

2253
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,110
That's right.

2254
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:52,940
It's your character.

2255
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,040
It's acting.

2256
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:56,210
- It's acting indeed.
- You know those things.

2257
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:59,410
(Eating)

2258
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:02,980
(Meanwhile, the two of them
destroy the pork belly.)

2259
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,020
It was 6:40 a.m.

2260
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:06,250
(A tiny piece)

2261
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:08,190
Gosh, Seok Jin. What's that?

2262
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:09,720
Seok Jin, you should eat this.

2263
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,020
Seriously.

2264
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:12,890
- Seriously. You should eat this.
- At this point,

2265
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:15,060
I want to eat doenjang stew.
I can smell it.

2266
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,260
- I want to eat doenjang stew.
- You really are a Food Fighter.

2267
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,530
- You're something else.
- You really are a Food Fighter.

2268
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:20,300
- Shall we order doenjang stew?
- Go ahead.

2269
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,670
- Yes. May we eat it?
- Yes.

2270
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,740
Doenjang stew smells so nice.

2271
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,340
Why are you ordering doenjang stew
when we need to leave?

2272
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,140
I'm craving some soup.

2273
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,610
- You dummy.
- Doenjang stew is a must...

2274
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:32,210
- when you eat pork belly.
- Hey.

2275
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:34,980
Hey, do you have a hidden mission?

2276
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:37,480
Hey, do you have a hidden mission?

2277
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,550
- You're an X-man, right?
- You're an X-man, right?

2278
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:40,620
Are you an X-man?

2279
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,420
She must have a mission.

2280
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:43,860
- An X-man.
- Did you receive...

2281
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,490
- a mission?
- Perhaps she did ahead of time.

2282
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:47,760
- I have an incoming call.
- Answer it.

2283
01:13:48,230 --> 01:13:49,600
I think we'll finish it.

2284
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,730
Hey.

2285
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:57,910
Why aren't you eating?

2286
01:13:57,910 --> 01:14:00,070
(The members on standby heard
that he was picking at his food.)

2287
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:02,480
You shouldn't ruminate
like a cow that's eating fodder.

2288
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,680
- It's tasty.
- Jae Seok,

2289
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,180
- Seok Jin isn't eating much.
- Jae Seok.

2290
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:06,610
- Hurry up and eat.
- Hurry up and eat.

2291
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:07,980
Hurry up and eat.

2292
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,980
Thankfully,
Old and New Food Fighters...

2293
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:13,190
are eating with gusto. Look at this.

2294
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:16,090
I'll show you
New Food Fighter's eating show.

2295
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:17,860
Seok Jin.

2296
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:20,430
You need to eat.

2297
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:21,800
(Pork belly show)

2298
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,930
- Two pieces.
- Old Food Fighter.

2299
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:25,330
It looks tasty.

2300
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:26,600
It's tasty.

2301
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,040
- It looks tasty.
- It's really tasty.

2302
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,970
- Seok Jin.
- Yes?

2303
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,510
You need to eat.

2304
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:32,510
(They've been eating pork belly
for over 20 minutes.)

2305
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,040
- Hurry up and eat.
- Eat.

2306
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,040
Okay.

2307
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,850
I can't eat more.

2308
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,450
It has been a while
since I had pork belly like this.

2309
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,320
Seok Jin, eat it like this.

2310
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,750
I ate all the pieces like this.

2311
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:49,990
(New Food Fighter shoves in a wrap
that's the size of a baseball.)

2312
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:51,830
Why does she keep losing weight
when she eats so well?

2313
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:53,460
You need to eat kimchi.

2314
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:54,600
Food Fighters don't disappoint.

2315
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:01,170
(Old Food Fighter chews
and proves that she deserves the title.)

2316
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,040
You know,

2317
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,410
Food Fighters are doing so well.

2318
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:08,540
I think we'll finish it.

2319
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,310
I think we'll finish it.

2320
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,980
- We don't have much time.
- We're almost done.

2321
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:14,920
Food Fighters are amazing.

2322
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,580
- What's that?
- Are you eating rice as well?

2323
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:19,350
- Isn't that tteokbokki?
- What's that?

2324
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:21,320
- Tteokbokki?
- Is it tteokbokki?

2325
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,320
Do you want tteokbokki?

2326
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,760
- Yes.
- Do you want tteokbokki as well?

2327
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,290
I just want a bite.

2328
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:26,730
Will you eat tteokbokki?

2329
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:27,960
(Food Fighter even wants
some tteokbokki.)

2330
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,230
- Ye Eun.
- Food Fighter, why are you so...

2331
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:30,760
- She's incredible.
- May I eat some tteokbokki?

2332
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,130
- To be honest,
- She's incredible.

2333
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:33,830
I thought I was
the original food fighter.

2334
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:35,300
- But I can't beat her.
- You can't beat her.

2335
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:37,840
- I'm amazed that she can eat more.
- It's amazing.

2336
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:40,340
(Straight face)

2337
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:41,980
Since the meat is greasy,

2338
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,780
- she's craving spicy food.
- I'm craving it too, but...

2339
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:45,110
- This is great. There's tteokbokki.
- I get the mechanism.

2340
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:46,150
Still... Hey.

2341
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:48,650
- You should eat free tteokbokki.
- You...

2342
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:51,450
- It's only courteous.
- We don't have much time.

2343
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:53,620
We need to eat sandwiches
and sundaeguk.

2344
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,490
We don't have much time.

2345
01:15:58,290 --> 01:15:59,290
(Flinching)

2346
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:00,490
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

2347
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:02,600
- It must be very tasty.
- It's tasty.

2348
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:05,470
Ye Eun ordered tteokbokki as well.

2349
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:06,830
- For goodness' sake.
- Tteokbokki?

2350
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:08,600
- What's wrong with her?
- Are they boiling it now?

2351
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,900
What's wrong with Ye Eun?

2352
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,540
Tell them to hurry up
and get on the bus.

2353
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:14,840
Tell them to please come
to their senses.

2354
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,110
We only have one hour left.

2355
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,550
Gosh, I feel so anxious.

2356
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:21,320
The rice cake is so tasty.

2357
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:23,380
(The tteokbokki enthusiast
is just happy.)

2358
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:24,890
She's eating it
because she likes it.

2359
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:27,590
This rice cake is the real deal.

2360
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:29,590
I think it has been cooked
for a long time.

2361
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:33,560
Let's eat one piece each.

2362
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:36,030
(Only 4 pieces of meat remain.)

2363
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:37,630
- We ate all the food.
- All done.

2364
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:39,900
- Ye Eun, this is yours.
- All done.

2365
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:42,340
All done.

2366
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,170
Everyone, we've cleared the food.

2367
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:45,710
- We finished it.
- Cleared.

2368
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:47,740
- We ate four servings.
- My goodness.

2369
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:49,180
We ate it.

2370
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,840
- Doenjang stew is here.
- Okay.

2371
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:52,480
- Thank you.
- Okay.

2372
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,650
(The dish they forgot about,
doenjang stew appears.)

2373
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:55,250
It's tasty doenjang stew.

2374
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:57,120
It does look tasty.

2375
01:16:58,550 --> 01:17:00,290
I really can't eat more.

2376
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:04,290
Gosh, you know that expression.

2377
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:05,530
I'd rather raise a cow at home...

2378
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:07,030
- than raise her.
- Same here.

2379
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:09,300
- Gosh.
- It looks tasty.

2380
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:10,600
(She attacks the stew right away.)

2381
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:12,570
Is it good?

2382
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,170
What's this?

2383
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,870
It's like a seafood stew.

2384
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,340
Let me try it. I'm curious.

2385
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:19,610
- I can't eat it.
- Let me try it.

2386
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:22,210
Seok Jin, it seriously tastes like
seafood stew.

2387
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:24,650
It pushes down the oily taste.

2388
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:26,180
My goodness.

2389
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,850
There's shrimp inside.

2390
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,080
(She's holding rice
with one hand...)

2391
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,790
(and stew with the other hand.)

2392
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:32,990
Seok Jin, is it tasty?

2393
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:35,120
- It's tasty, right?
- My goodness.

2394
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,860
It's tasty, right?

2395
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,390
(Even after eating all the meat,
they spend time eating the stew.)

2396
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:40,460
- It's tasty, right?
- I won't be able to eat more.

2397
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:41,630
- It's refreshing.
- It's tasty, right?

2398
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:42,760
I'm completely done.

2399
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:44,600
- It's tasty.
- Let's go.

2400
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:46,630
Let me drink the soup.

2401
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,970
Let's go outside.

2402
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:49,470
- Stop now.
- Let me drink the soup.

2403
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:50,840
- Stop eating.
- Stop now.

2404
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,070
It's a waste.

2405
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:54,810
- Stop now.
- It's hot.

2406
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,110
You guys need to eat more food.

2407
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,310
- I'm full.
- I'm full.

2408
01:17:59,310 --> 01:18:00,450
Let's hurry up and go.

2409
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:01,650
I'm full.

2410
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:03,580
- I'm full.
- I'm so full.

2411
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:04,890
I can't eat more.

2412
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,420
- I can't eat more.
- I'm full.

2413
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:08,660
Food Fighter even has Coca-Cola
in her hands.

2414
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:09,990
- Hey.
- My stomach is about to burst.

2415
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:11,430
- Did you drink Coca-Cola too?
- Stop it already.

2416
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:12,730
- Hey, Food Fighter.
- What's wrong with you?

2417
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:14,360
- Food Fighter is incredible.
- My stomach is about to burst.

2418
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,400
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2419
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,770
She ate tteokbokki,
doenjang stew, and rice.

2420
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:20,030
- Really?
- Gosh.

2421
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:22,470
Let's pick the next people
to ask the question.

2422
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,310
(Struggling)

2423
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:27,270
- Jae Seok, it should be you.
- My stomach is about to burst.

2424
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:30,580
Let's pick the next people
to ask the question.

2425
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:31,980
Please let it be Jae Seok.

2426
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:33,980
- It should be me.
- Let Jae Seok do it.

2427
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:35,980
- Jae Seok, it should be you.
- He's confident.

2428
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:38,050
- It should be me.
- Let Jae Seok do it.

2429
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:39,990
- Jae Seok, it should be you.
- He's confident.

2430
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:41,860
- It's Jae Seok.
- My goodness.

2431
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:43,420
Did you get my name?

2432
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,630
It needed to be me.

2433
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:47,130
(Who will ask the question
with Jae Seok?)

2434
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:48,760
- Please let it be me.
- Ji Ye Eun.

2435
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,730
- Haha.
- My goodness.

2436
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,200
The opposites met.

2437
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,140
It'll be entertaining.

2438
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,500
- The opposites met.
- It's fate.

2439
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,500
It'll be fun.

2440
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,740
- What's up, yo?
- This is fun.

2441
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:01,880
Since there are two people,
divide up the comments equally.

2442
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,440
- That sounds good.
- That sounds good.

2443
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,250
Which dish strikes your fancy
in the morning?

2444
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:10,120
- What? What did he say?
- That's too lousy.

2445
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,750
- Come on.
- That's too lousy.

2446
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:13,620
Yo, where are you going?

2447
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,460
Let's get a song request!

2448
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,560
(Will the two of them have
an interview without fighting?)

2449
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,290
- Seriously.
- What are you doing without me?

2450
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:20,930
Okay.

2451
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:22,500
We're here.

2452
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:25,770
There was nothing
when this place used to be a square.

2453
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:27,500
We need to do this in an hour.

2454
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,470
- Hello.
- Hello.

2455
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:31,340
Jae Seok, let's go to a cafe.

2456
01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:33,540
Let's yell "Sandwich and sundaeguk"
as we walk around.

2457
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:34,540
Cafe.

2458
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,740
"Sandwich and sundaeguk."

2459
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:37,610
- We have...
- This neighborhood is nice.

2460
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:39,050
an emcee from a major channel...

2461
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:41,080
- All right.
- An emcee from MBC...

2462
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,550
- and an emcee from a cable channel.
- Work together.

2463
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:44,450
- That sounds good.
- Let's see a collaboration.

2464
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:45,720
- We want to see it.
- I have that energy.

2465
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,050
Please make an interviewee
recommend a sandwich or sundaeguk.

2466
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:49,920
An emcee from the streets...

2467
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,630
- and an emcee from recruitment.
- Yes.

2468
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:53,960
I got hired through recruitment,
but I didn't get to shine.

2469
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,330
- Okay.
- Official and Unofficial, let's go.

2470
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,300
- Unofficial?
- Official and Unofficial.

2471
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,770
- Unofficial, let's go.
- Unofficial.

2472
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:01,370
- Official and Unofficial.
- Official and Unofficial.

2473
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:03,240
We don't have much time,
so we need to hurry up.

2474
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:04,970
We don't have much time.

2475
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:08,010
We have to make the interviewee say
a sandwich...

2476
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,440
- Sundaeguk.
- or sundaeguk.

2477
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:12,680
It'll be hard to get a sandwich.

2478
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,050
We don't have much time.

2479
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:15,580
- We don't have much time.
- Seriously.

2480
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:17,520
Don't get intimidated. Just go.

2481
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,320
- That's right.
- They're intimidated, right?

2482
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,390
They're intimidated.

2483
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,160
Hold on. Sandwich.

2484
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:23,920
Over there.

2485
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,090
I'm getting the vibe of a sandwich.

2486
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:27,430
- I think they'll say it.
- The two of them...

2487
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:32,270
(It's a group with an employee card
that has the vibe of a sandwich.)

2488
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:35,040
I think they'll have a simple meal.

2489
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:36,470
A simple meal.

2490
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:37,470
(Hoping for a sandwich,
they approach the women.)

2491
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:38,510
Are you going to lunch?

2492
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:40,540
- Yes.
- Did you have lunch yet?

2493
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:42,340
- You're on your way, right?
- Yes.

2494
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:44,340
They met some people.

2495
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,780
- They met some people.
- Please come this way.

2496
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:46,850
Please hold on.

2497
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:48,080
- I...
- What's up, yo?

2498
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:52,150
(Road Man suddenly enters.)

2499
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:53,420
"What's up, yo?"

2500
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:55,590
(My goodness)

2501
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:57,860
- They laughed at that.
- "What's up, yo?"

2502
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:58,860
(They turn on the polite mode
and give a generous reaction.)

2503
01:20:58,860 --> 01:20:59,930
(Proud)

2504
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:01,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

2505
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,060
Are the two of you on your way
to eat lunch?

2506
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:04,330
- Yes.
- I see.

2507
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:06,400
Please introduce yourself.

2508
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:07,600
I'm Yu Gyeong Min.

2509
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,940
Gyeong Min. How about you?

2510
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:10,540
- I'm Kim Su Yeon.
- Su Yeon.

2511
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,910
- It's nice to meet you.
- I see.

2512
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:14,710
We'd like to ask you
a simple question before lunch.

2513
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:16,580
Lunchtime just began, right?

2514
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,650
- You have an hour.
- Yes.

2515
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,850
- You'll have a simple meal.
- Yes.

2516
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,380
- We...
- Did you have breakfast?

2517
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,120
(Rest suddenly butts in.)

2518
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,290
I ate a bit of food.

2519
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:26,650
- I see.
- What did you have for breakfast?

2520
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,720
I had salad and soymilk.

2521
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:29,960
What did you have?

2522
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,220
- Su Yeon.
- I had a latte.

2523
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,430
- Latte.
- Then you must be hungry.

2524
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:34,590
Then lunch will be very tasty.

2525
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:37,030
The thing is, it's lunchtime.

2526
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,770
Our mission is...

2527
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:41,030
- about breakfast.
- Good luck!

2528
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:43,370
(Mr. Milkshake suddenly butts in.)

2529
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:44,940
Be quiet.

2530
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:46,340
Good luck!

2531
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:48,910
I don't know if you remember this.

2532
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:51,510
There are many origin stories...

2533
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,410
regarding food.

2534
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:56,280
(Origin stories regarding food?)

2535
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,890
- That story about an earl?
- Yes.

2536
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:02,420
In any case,
there are many such stories...

2537
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:04,860
regarding food.

2538
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:06,390
- But...
- We can't get into them.

2539
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,130
You're a Gen Zer, right?

2540
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,560
- What?
- A Gen Zer.

2541
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:11,160
- Well...
- Are you younger than that?

2542
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,000
- Gen Alpha?
- I'm a Gen Zer.

2543
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,570
- I'm a Gen Zer.
- I'm jealous.

2544
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,100
I'm between two generations.

2545
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:19,110
I need to take care
of my parents and children.

2546
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:21,110
- Why are you bringing that up?
- I'm between two generations.

2547
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,240
- But...
- I'm stuck.

2548
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:24,340
(It seems like
he wants to describe a sandwich.)

2549
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,110
- What?
- Please ask the question.

2550
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:29,080
- We had to get to know Su Yeon.
- Yes.

2551
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:31,350
- Your generation is a good one.
- The thing is,

2552
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:33,320
you don't have time
to eat a proper meal...

2553
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,220
- before going to work.
- You don't have time.

2554
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:36,960
Please keep that in mind.

2555
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,130
We'll now ask
Gyeong Min and Su Yeon...

2556
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:40,430
a question.

2557
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:43,560
- All right. It's 7am. It's early.
- It's 7am.

2558
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,200
- What if it's pizza?
- Let's go.

2559
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,470
- Good luck!
- Pizza.

2560
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:49,240
What do you want to eat
for breakfast? One, two, three.

2561
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:53,010
(Sandwich is the answer they want.)

2562
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:56,140
(What will be their answer?)

2563
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:59,310
- Soymilk.
- Sandwich.

2564
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:01,310
(Sandwich)

2565
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:02,420
Sandwich.

2566
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,220
(We got a sandwich!)

2567
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:05,220
We did it.

2568
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:07,590
- I think they got it.
- Did you get it?

2569
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:08,920
- Did they get it?
- They got it.

2570
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,260
- I think they got it.
- Did they get it?

2571
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:13,330
(Official and Unofficial did it!)

2572
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:15,200
- Su Yeon.
- This is incredible.

2573
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:17,430
- Did you get it?
- This is incredible.

2574
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,230
- Thank you so much.
- You're a genius.

2575
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:20,330
- Thank you.
- You're a genius.

2576
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:21,400
Gyeong Min, thank you.

2577
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,700
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2578
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,070
(Thanks to the quick-witted ones,
they get the center block.)

2579
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:26,070
- Let's go and buy sandwiches.
- Sandwiches.

2580
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:27,170
Where do they sell it?

2581
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:29,410
It's over there.
I saw a cafe on our way here.

2582
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,210
We just need to get sundaeguk now.

2583
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:32,550
(Sundaeguk)

2584
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:34,550
- We don't have much time.
- We need to go fast.

2585
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:36,420
- We need to eat fast.
- We need to go fast.

2586
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:37,880
Let's take care of this.

2587
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,550
Ye Eun unzipped everything.

2588
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:43,060
I did it for the top too.

2589
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,260
- Ye Eun.
- Do you see my stomach?

2590
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:45,660
My goodness.

2591
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:47,290
- I can see it.
- Can you see it?

2592
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,930
Ye Eun is so funny.

2593
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:50,060
- Be careful.
- It isn't just the zipper.

2594
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,530
- I opened the button too.
- Hey.

2595
01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:53,230
- Be careful.
- Really?

2596
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:55,240
- What's holding the pants together?
- Be careful.

2597
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,070
My stomach is holding
the pants together.

2598
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,940
- Is this the place?
- Nice.

2599
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:00,310
Do they sell sandwiches here?

2600
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,040
- This is great.
- There must be sandwiches.

2601
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,780
- It's pretty.
- Let's hurry. We don't have time.

2602
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,650
Let's hurry. We don't have time.

2603
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:08,880
- Let's hurry.
- We need to move on to sundaeguk.

2604
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:09,980
- Let's hurry.
- When we get sundaeguk...

2605
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:11,220
Food Fighter, can you eat more?

2606
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,050
- Seriously.
- Ye Eun's...

2607
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,060
- Ye Eun's belly is protruding.
- Her belly is protruding.

2608
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,290
- Look at her belly.
- It's like a tadpole's belly.

2609
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:19,060
- Ye Eun.
- It's cute.

2610
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:21,230
- It's cute.
- It's very nice.

2611
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:22,700
Ye Eun, it's nice.

2612
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:26,700
- The mission for the sandwich is...
- Let's hurry.

2613
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,840
- the Growing Chopsticks.
- What's that?

2614
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,270
After breaking one chopstick,

2615
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:33,040
the four members that get...

2616
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,180
- the longest connecting parts...
- They should be sharp.

2617
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:36,310
will be exempt from eating.

2618
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:38,310
- They should be thin.
- It's about speed.

2619
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:39,910
- It's over.
- Okay.

2620
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:41,380
- It came out well.
- All right.

2621
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:42,450
- It came out well.
- It came out well.

2622
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:44,220
- Not bad.
- Go along the grain.

2623
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:46,420
(Seok Jin, Ji Hyo, and Jong Kook
got similar lengths.)

2624
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:48,920
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

2625
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:51,830
- Gosh, I'm in 1st place.
- He's in 1st place.

2626
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:54,230
- He's ruined.
- My goodness.

2627
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:55,500
(These 3 members are bad at it.)

2628
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:56,730
- Oh, no.
- He'll definitely eat.

2629
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:58,700
He's intimidated.

2630
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:00,230
(Jae Seok gets nervous
about playing the game.)

2631
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:01,670
- Lengthen it.
- It's short.

2632
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:03,740
- Are you done?
- It didn't work well.

2633
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:05,410
- Okay!
- Yes.

2634
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:07,770
(Food Fighter has eaten
4 meals for breakfast.)

2635
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:09,240
Ye Eun will eat again.

2636
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,410
We made toothpicks.
Ye Eun will eat again.

2637
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:14,180
Her face looks better
when she eats a lot.

2638
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:17,220
- Ye Eun, your face looks better.
- My stomach is about to burst.

2639
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:20,250
If the members
who are exempt want coffee,

2640
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:21,420
- we can order it.
- Coffee.

2641
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,220
- Coffee is nice.
- The members who aren't eating.

2642
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:24,290
- Coffee.
- Coffee is nice.

2643
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:26,490
- Thank you.
- Iced Americano.

2644
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:28,230
Their coffee is tasty.

2645
01:25:28,230 --> 01:25:29,500
I want coffee too.

2646
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:31,500
The sandwiches are here.

2647
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,500
- Eat the sandwiches.
- They're thick.

2648
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,900
Why is there so much to eat?

2649
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,070
They're thick.

2650
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:38,570
- There's so much to eat.
- You know...

2651
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:39,740
You need to finish it.

2652
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:42,510
- Nice. That's right!
- Once you eat it, it'll be good.

2653
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:44,640
- Okay. Nice. That's right!
- But...

2654
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,310
(Jae Seok and Haha can eat
once they begin.)

2655
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:48,550
I usually don't take big bites.

2656
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:50,220
(Eating)

2657
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:51,480
(Chewing)

2658
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:53,990
(It's torture for Niel
who just ate pork belly.)

2659
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:56,090
(Laughing)

2660
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,020
Eat it. Take a big bite.

2661
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:00,490
- That's right.
- Let's eat. That's right.

2662
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:02,400
Look at Food Fighter.

2663
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,500
She eats well.

2664
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
- You also look for the taste.
- She's eating again.

2665
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,270
- Since Food Fighter eats,
- Does it taste good as well?

2666
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:10,470
- It's coming.
- why does it...

2667
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:13,470
Food Fighter. You're like
Jun Ji Hyun when you eat.

2668
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:15,240
- Of course.
- That's right.

2669
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,380
Right.

2670
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,510
That's right.

2671
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,480
(To me, this person
is Kim Tae Hee and Jeon Do Yeon.)

2672
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,920
(I'm a huge fan of Gil Ra Im.)

2673
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:28,050
(This person is Jun Ji Hyun
when she eats.)

2674
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:30,920
(I'm a huge fan of Food Fighter.)

2675
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:32,630
Food Fighter...

2676
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:34,230
(A treat for the fan)

2677
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:35,930
(Unnecessary reaction
to a hard-earned compliment)

2678
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:37,260
- Look at Jong Kook.
- I'm the audience.

2679
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:38,930
- You're a fan.
- I'm her fan.

2680
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,030
You're Ko Hyun Jung
when you eat this.

2681
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:42,540
- You're Ko Hyun Jung.
- You're Ko Hyun Jung.

2682
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,040
You're Kim Hee Seon.

2683
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,200
Kim Hee Seon.

2684
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:46,770
She's eating another bite.
Food Fighter.

2685
01:26:46,770 --> 01:26:47,770
Food Fighter.

2686
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:48,810
(The beautiful lady
forgot she was full.)

2687
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:51,210
- She really eats well.
- She really is Ko So Young.

2688
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,510
- She eats well.
- How nice.

2689
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:55,280
- The coffee tastes great.
- Right?

2690
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,520
- It's tasty, right?
- It's good.

2691
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:57,720
You're already done?

2692
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,390
- The ones that taste bad...
- Ji Hyo.

2693
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:00,720
- You're done.
- taste like...

2694
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,490
She drank it all already.

2695
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:03,720
- She's the new food fighter.
- Wait.

2696
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,090
- This...
- How did you...

2697
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:07,360
- I drank this much.
- I drank this much.

2698
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,460
- Hold on.
- While I drank this much.

2699
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:11,230
I drank it because the pork belly
was greasy.

2700
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:13,530
Our Sherlock Holmes...

2701
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:15,130
- was thirsty.
- But this...

2702
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:17,640
- I ate greasy food, so...
- But this...

2703
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,240
- Seriously.
- I was craving something like this.

2704
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,070
I thank the female members
for working hard...

2705
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:22,110
- as food fighters.
- Seriously.

2706
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:23,240
They ate so much.

2707
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,610
- They really eat so well.
- She's the best at drinking.

2708
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:26,610
That's right.

2709
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:28,680
Until when is it?

2710
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:29,820
Until 12:30 p.m.

2711
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,620
We have to quickly finish this...

2712
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:34,190
- and go for the sundaeguk.
- That's right.

2713
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:36,260
- We just need sundaeguk.
- We have one left.

2714
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:37,590
Sundaeguk.

2715
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:39,360
You don't have much time left.

2716
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,260
- It's the last attempt.
- So this time, you'll decide...

2717
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:44,730
- the people who will ask.
- Do we decide?

2718
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:45,900
Our new members can decide.

2719
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:46,930
- Should we?
- Okay.

2720
01:27:46,930 --> 01:27:48,370
- Daniel and Ye Eun.
- Daniel and Ye Eun.

2721
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:50,840
- Then Daniel and Ye Eun...
- Gosh...

2722
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,540
will go and ask.

2723
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:54,470
- Go, Ye Eun.
- Let's go.

2724
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:55,610
- Go and succeed.
- How should I do it?

2725
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:56,910
- It's sundaeguk.
- We'll go.

2726
01:27:56,910 --> 01:27:57,910
Go. You can do it.

2727
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:59,510
- It's sundaeguk.
- But if...

2728
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:02,080
If this doesn't work,
we'd be failing today.

2729
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,480
We'd be failing.
We have to get this one.

2730
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,820
- For the first time...
- It has to get done at once.

2731
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:06,320
Then should we...

2732
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:08,450
ask people who are old?

2733
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,560
- I think...
- An elderly man?

2734
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,660
- A man. But even women...
- A man.

2735
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:15,130
- Even women...
- But it's more likely for men...

2736
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:16,530
- than women.
- Is that so?

2737
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:18,130
- The probability.
- Or...

2738
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:19,500
Should we interview them?

2739
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,900
Could we interview you?

2740
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:24,340
(Did she find an elderly man?)

2741
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,810
- Could we interview you?
- Ye Eun.

2742
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:27,510
- Could we interview you?
- Could we interview you?

2743
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:28,510
Yes.

2744
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:31,480
(She goes straight to a man
who is clearly young.)

2745
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,010
I think...

2746
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,980
I had some drinks yesterday.

2747
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:37,650
Why did you approach
a good-looking person?

2748
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:38,750
I didn't.

2749
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:40,520
- There were many other people.
- I need to sober up.

2750
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,920
(Why is she
tucking her hair behind her ear?)

2751
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,120
I need to sober up.
In the morning...

2752
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:46,230
Is this about finding Ye Eun's type?

2753
01:28:46,230 --> 01:28:47,260
Ye Eun.

2754
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:48,760
She's doing it
for personal interest.

2755
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,560
She's clearly doing it
for personal interest.

2756
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,030
You drink, right?

2757
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:53,300
I like drinking.

2758
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:56,570
- Your stomach hurts the next day.
- Yes.

2759
01:28:56,570 --> 01:28:58,870
Then...

2760
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,640
You have to...

2761
01:29:01,870 --> 01:29:04,010
You have to eat and...

2762
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:05,210
(The tough woman in her comes out
to hear the word "sundaeguk.")

2763
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:06,310
Is it okay to do that?

2764
01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:08,610
You shouldn't do it like that.
You need to do more.

2765
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:11,220
(Breakfast Bingo)

2766
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:13,920
- Gukbap.
- Gukbap.

2767
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,090
(He said gukbap!)

2768
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:16,920
- Gukbap is really nice.
- You need the exact answer.

2769
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,030
But which gukbap would be nice?

2770
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:20,930
(There are so many types of gukbap.)

2771
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:22,330
It won't be easy.

2772
01:29:22,330 --> 01:29:23,730
We have to get it this time.

2773
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:25,770
We might get hangover soup
if things don't go well.

2774
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:27,130
- I have a feeling. Right?
- We might get hangover soup.

2775
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:29,740
What do you want for breakfast?

2776
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:30,740
(What do you want for breakfast?)

2777
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:34,270
(They have no hope
if they fail this time.)

2778
01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:37,740
(What will the charming guy say?)

2779
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,250
(They want to hear sundaeguk.
What will the citizen say?)

2780
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:41,010
Sundaegukbap.

2781
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,820
(Sundaegukbap)

2782
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:46,190
(Ji Ye Eun did it!)

2783
01:29:46,190 --> 01:29:47,550
(Hitting)

2784
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:49,790
(Breakfast Bingo)

2785
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:51,660
- Really?
- He really said it?

2786
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:52,660
(That worked?)
- He said it.
- He really said it?

2787
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:55,260
- Really?
- No way.

2788
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:56,600
- I'm good.
- He said it?

2789
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,200
I'm good.

2790
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:59,200
"I'm good."

2791
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,700
It's 12:16 p.m. now.

2792
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:04,240
You have to eat sundaegukbap
before 12:30 p.m...

2793
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,610
- Let's go quickly.
- Let's hurry.

2794
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:07,310
- Thank you.
- It's right across the street.

2795
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:09,240
What is she doing?

2796
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:10,940
Ji Ye Eun!

2797
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:12,580
- What are you doing?
- Thank you so much.

2798
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:14,310
- Thank you.
- Why did you take a picture?

2799
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:15,310
- Let's go. It worked.
- Bye.

2800
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:16,980
- We don't have time.
- Hey.

2801
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:18,120
- Let's go quickly.
- You can do that.

2802
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,150
Let's go.

2803
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:21,020
- Let's hurry.
- Why did you take a picture?

2804
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:22,560
I succeeded.

2805
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,760
- Move.
- Where is the sundaegukbap?

2806
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:25,890
- Let's hurry.
- I succeeded.

2807
01:30:25,890 --> 01:30:27,190
- Where should we go?
- That's what matters.

2808
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:28,690
- Let's hurry. We have no time.
- Hurry. We should eat quickly...

2809
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:30,400
to succeed.
Or else, even if we eat it,

2810
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,960
- We have no time.
- we'd fail.

2811
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,300
- Hurry, Se Chan.
- Hurry.

2812
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:34,600
We have to eat it on time.

2813
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,970
We don't have time.

2814
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,700
It's here. Sticky rice sundae.

2815
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:39,640
- Let's go. Let's sit outside.
- Let's sit here.

2816
01:30:39,670 --> 01:30:41,340
- Let's sit here.
- Move.

2817
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:43,410
Could we quickly have sundaeguk?

2818
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:47,080
Hello. Could we have four bowls
of sundaeguk?

2819
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,310
I can definitely eat.

2820
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:49,480
- Move.
- Is it here?

2821
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:50,880
(Seok Jin, Ji Hyo, Ye Eun,
and Jong Kook will eat.)

2822
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,420
My stomach is about to burst.

2823
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:54,090
- My stomach is about to burst.
- The fourth.

2824
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:56,920
She acts like she can't eat,

2825
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:57,960
but she digs right in.

2826
01:30:58,490 --> 01:30:59,860
The new food fighter.

2827
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:03,400
Let's go! Soup is the best!

2828
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,200
- It's not easy.
- The sundaeguk.

2829
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,170
- The ordinary sundaeguk.
- The ordinary sundaeguk.

2830
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:08,230
- Here.
- We have to finish them quickly.

2831
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:10,200
- We have to eat them quickly.
- The spoons.

2832
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:15,070
Let's go, Jong Kook. It's sundaeguk.

2833
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:16,410
You love sundaeguk the most.

2834
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:18,640
Could I have some seasoning?

2835
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:20,650
(New Food Fighter eats properly
even in a rush.)

2836
01:31:20,650 --> 01:31:23,780
New Food Fighter has a great spirit.

2837
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:25,790
- It's strong.
- There's not so much.

2838
01:31:25,790 --> 01:31:26,990
- It's strong.
- It looks delicious.

2839
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:28,290
- It's nice.
- Right?

2840
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,590
- You have to eat quickly.
- Right.

2841
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:32,560
Isn't it so much, Ji Hyo?

2842
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,590
(They're all eating the food
with strong energy.)

2843
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:37,600
You're like a hero, Ye Eun.

2844
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,800
Ye Eun really...

2845
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,330
- This...
- How is the seasoning?

2846
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:41,430
- Do you need some salt?
- I ate everything...

2847
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:42,570
- except the sandwich.
- Do you need it?

2848
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:43,570
(Seok Sam just mixes the soup
and doesn't eat it.)

2849
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,710
You should eat quickly, Seok Jin.

2850
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:47,770
It's almost time. You have to eat.

2851
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:49,180
You have to eat quickly.
There's no time to waste.

2852
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:50,810
- We can succeed in the mission.
- All right.

2853
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:52,750
What are you going to do
if we fail because of you?

2854
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:54,280
Hurry and eat, Seok Jin.

2855
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:55,850
(The whistle blows.)

2856
01:31:55,850 --> 01:31:58,180
You have failed...

2857
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,320
the Miracle Breakfast Morning Race.

2858
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,560
- I told you to hurry.
- But...

2859
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:05,560
- But...
- Seok Jin. Why...

2860
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:08,060
Why did you eat so much
at the buffet?

2861
01:32:08,490 --> 01:32:09,800
- Even dessert.
- He...

2862
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,960
- He ate so much at the hotel.
- So much.

2863
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,600
There's a penalty.

2864
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,240
As a penalty,
in next week's recording,

2865
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,600
No.

2866
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,910
you have to make
a handmade breakfast...

2867
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:22,010
- to share with the members.
- That's so bothersome.

2868
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:23,710
- It's the worst.
- The menu doesn't matter.

2869
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:26,410
- It's the worst penalty.
- Producer.

2870
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:27,410
- We can't buy it, right?
- We can't buy it, right?

2871
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:28,680
- You can't buy it.
- Why?

2872
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,280
You have to send us...

2873
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:32,390
a picture to prove
you made the food...

2874
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:33,790
- at home.
- It's the worst.

2875
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:35,150
You can select two people.

2876
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:37,290
- I want to pick Seok Jin.
- Of course.

2877
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:38,760
- Seok Jin should do it.
- Hey.

2878
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:39,760
Why are you picking?

2879
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:40,860
They gave it to me.

2880
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:42,930
- You have an unlucky hand.
- I'm not looking.

2881
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,930
I have one. This one refused
to leave my hand.

2882
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:48,700
I think it's going to be me.
I usually get these sorts of things.

2883
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:50,640
- Please.
- It's the worst.

2884
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:52,340
- Pick it.
- Please.

2885
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:53,340
Haha!

2886
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:55,470
Haha!

2887
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:00,780
- What's up!
- What's up!

2888
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:01,780
Prepare a packed breakfast.

2889
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:03,580
- Mnet.
- Prepare a packed breakfast.

2890
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:05,480
- Pack the breakfast.
- I'll pick.

2891
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,920
- Mnet.
- Mnet packs breakfast.

2892
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,090
- You shouldn't look.
- As long as it's not me.

2893
01:33:09,090 --> 01:33:10,220
I'll pick another one.

2894
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:11,390
I really hate this.

2895
01:33:11,390 --> 01:33:13,230
- Haha cooks well.
- He's good.

2896
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:14,390
It's nice.

2897
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:15,800
(Who will be the second person
to receive the penalty with Haha?)

2898
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:18,500
That...

2899
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,030
This is final.

2900
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:21,500
- Please.
- It's final.

2901
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:22,940
Please. Let it be Yu Jae Seok.

2902
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:24,500
- Please.
- Yu Jae Seok.

2903
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:25,870
- Song Ji Hyo.
- Let's go with "How Do You Play?"

2904
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:27,610
- Please.
- Yu Jae Seok.

2905
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:28,670
- Please.
- Song Ji Hyo.

2906
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:29,940
Let's go with "How Do You Play?"

2907
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:32,180
Yu Jae Seok!

2908
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:34,080
- Song Ji Hyo.
- Let's go with "How Do You Play?"

2909
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,780
(Yu Jae Seok was chosen!)

2910
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:38,180
What's up!

2911
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:40,020
What's up!

2912
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:41,590
Official and Unofficial.

2913
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:42,860
There you go!

2914
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:45,660
Official and Unofficial.

2915
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:47,690
I said I would pick,
but he said he would do it.

2916
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,560
It wouldn't have been you
if he had picked.

2917
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,870
Official and Unofficial is the worst.

2918
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:54,230
The two people who will carry out...

2919
01:33:54,230 --> 01:33:55,770
- the penalty next week...
- How did this happen?

2920
01:33:55,770 --> 01:33:57,170
are Haha and Yu Jae Seok.

2921
01:33:57,170 --> 01:33:58,470
- You can make for four,
- We'll look forward...

2922
01:33:58,470 --> 01:33:59,770
- and I'll make for four.
- to a tasty breakfast.

2923
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:00,870
Okay. Let's do that.

2924
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:02,510
- Thank you.
- But it really is the worst.

2925
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:03,540
Nice.

2926
01:34:03,710 --> 01:34:05,040
Why is it like this today?

2927
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:06,780
(A hot summer day)

2928
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:08,580
(A guest came to enjoy a vacation.)

2929
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:10,250
(Hyun Young, who is family now)

2930
01:34:10,650 --> 01:34:12,050
(You're dressed so lightly!)

2931
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:14,120
(She exposes her back.)

2932
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:16,320
(Other guests joining the vacation)

2933
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,120
(BABYMONSTER Asa and Ahyeon)

2934
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:20,290
(Their dance makes it feel
like a vacation.)

2935
01:34:20,290 --> 01:34:21,790
(A creepy 3-stage vacation
awaits the excited members.)

2936
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:23,030
(A creepy vacation thriller?)

2937
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:24,800
(If you volunteer,
you get the middle course!)

2938
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:26,800
(Safety-first Jong Kook
always volunteers.)

2939
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,200
(The thrill-seeking people
have no intention of volunteering.)

2940
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:29,500
(He's confident.)

2941
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:30,870
(With a 50-50 chance,)

2942
01:34:30,870 --> 01:34:32,170
(they aim for the easiest course.)

2943
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:33,810
(But the unlucky hand
doesn't go anywhere.)

2944
01:34:33,810 --> 01:34:35,910
(Overcome it with missions!)

2945
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:37,310
(They work hard to avoid
the extreme vacation course.)

2946
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:38,640
(Even with the Lamaze
breathing technique!)

2947
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,080
(But what awaits them...)

2948
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:42,280
(is the creepy vacation course
at the end.)

2949
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:43,950
(There's something underneath!)

2950
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:45,750
(Volunteers versus random choices,
how will the Vacation Thriller go?)

2951
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:47,550
(A Creepy Vacation Thriller)
