1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,870
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,610
We're meeting Dosan Ahn Chang Ho
again after a long time.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,980
- It suddenly got really cold.
- It's crazy.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,279
- I heard this week would be cold.
- It was fine yesterday.

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,320
I know.

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,320
Ji Ye Eun, you've become prettier.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,550
Your face is so round.

8
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,190
You can't call her Ji Ye Eun.

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,489
- She's a food fighter.
- A food fighter.

10
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:19,390
Super knuckle.
She's the original Mr. Free Meals.

11
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,660
I mean, Ms. Free Meals.

12
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,030
Mr. Free Meals?

13
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:24,660
Seriously, you have your meals
during the shoot.

14
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,129
And she eats wherever she goes.

15
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:27,800
- She just eats wherever she likes.
- Yes.

16
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,269
- She just eats wherever.
- I eat wherever I like.

17
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:31,140
- Whatever.
- But she eats more than I do.

18
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,200
Right. She eats more.

19
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,670
So, Ye Eun, you should ask
your family when you get home.

20
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,570
I'm sure you're from a family
that's physically strong.

21
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,039
- That's for sure.
- Definitely.

22
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,439
- They can even tip a cow.
- I'm sure.

23
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,250
She was born with a strong build.

24
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,310
Jong Kook is big
because he works out hard.

25
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,380
That's true. I try.

26
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,950
- And she was born that way.
- She was born with it.

27
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,549
You should ask your mom or dad.

28
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,189
I'm sure there is a family member
who was a wrestling champion.

29
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:52,359
It could be your grandpa
or someone from an earlier generation.

30
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,359
I'm sure about that.

31
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,490
- What's going on?
- That's right.

32
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,460
- Hello.
- You're here.

33
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,960
Why did you start so early?

34
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,729
- Hello, Ji Hyo.
- All right.

35
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,170
Seok Jin was coming with me,
but he went to the restroom.

36
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,040
Okay. He should go to the restroom
before coming here.

37
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,840
The thing is,
Seok Jin can't control it well.

38
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,969
(Starting a rumor)

39
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,680
He says he feels good
after peeing just a little.

40
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,980
- After peeing a little.
- After just a little.

41
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,379
- "This feels so good."
- Hey.

42
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:18,079
Don't say that.

43
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,750
He hates talking about it.

44
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:21,920
Why did they start so early?

45
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,659
(At that moment, Seok Jin
comes running while grumbling.)

46
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,019
- Really.
- So that's what we're doing.

47
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,959
- One, two...
- Let's say we got a mission.

48
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,329
- Let's start the mission then.
- One, two, three.

49
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,930
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

50
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,969
- All right then.
- Let's do that. I'll go.

51
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,969
- Okay.
- Three.

52
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:37,500
- Two.
- What?

53
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,140
- One.
- We can go now.

54
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,939
Guys, why did you start so early?

55
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,069
- By the way, Seok Jin...
- That's enough.

56
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,480
- What's enough?
- We had the appointed time.

57
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,180
We got a mission,
so we had no choice.

58
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,510
- Did they give us a mission?
- It's not like that.

59
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,510
- Seok Jin.
- What?

60
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,150
It looks like
the hat is too tight for you.

61
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,650
- No.
- No?

62
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,590
- It looks too tight.
- No.

63
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,549
- This is in style now.
- It's tight.

64
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,290
- It's too tight.
- It's in style now.

65
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,959
- It's like a kindergartener's hat.
- No.

66
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,290
Your hats are too big.

67
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,230
- No. Yours is too small.
- No.

68
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,560
All right. We have
two pleasant guests today.

69
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
We have guests?

70
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,370
Yes. Please come on out.

71
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,430
We're having one comedian.

72
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,770
That's right.

73
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,400
- Is it Kwang Soo?
- I heard that.

74
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,240
- Who's that?
- Kwang Soo!

75
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,110
(Is Kwang Soo finally here?)

76
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,909
- Is it Kwang Soo?
- Kwang Soo!

77
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,039
Jae Seok!

78
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,780
(He does run like the longlegs.)

79
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,349
He's Kwang Soo with glasses on.

80
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,650
- Hello.
- Hello.

81
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:28,849
(Tripping on the raised spot)

82
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,860
- Hello.
- It's Daniel.

83
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,490
- Is it Ah Young?
- Okay.

84
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,129
- Ah Young.
- It's Ah Young.

85
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,289
Ah Young.

86
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,729
- Hello.
- My gosh.

87
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,060
Here's a comedian. Ah Young.

88
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,659
- Hello.
- Daniel.

89
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,229
(So Bal recently brought Choi Daniel
as her friend.)

90
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,469
(His athletic activity doesn't
match his outward appearance.)

91
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,210
(He had the strong vibes
of Kwang Soo.)

92
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,879
(Kwang Daniel even enjoyed
the penalty until the end.)

93
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:00,490
(Ah Young was here
as Crazy Eyes for the first time.)

94
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,319
I think I'm drawn to Se Chan.

95
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,719
- Right?
- Ah Young.

96
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,259
(On her second time here,
she flirted with Se Chan.)

97
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,259
(Kim Ah Young set fire
to Ssaebssaeb's mind.)

98
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,259
- Come here.
- Jae Seok.

99
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,830
- He's a comedian.
- Have you been doing well?

100
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,870
Hello.

101
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,340
- Hi, Ah Young.
- How are you?

102
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,340
Se Chan's girlfriend.

103
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,169
- Se Chan's girlfriend.
- Se Chan's girlfriend.

104
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,409
Se Chan's girlfriend should be here.

105
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:23,939
- Se Chan's girlfriend.
- By the way...

106
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:26,639
- She's Se Chan's girlfriend.
- No. By the way...

107
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,949
- Put on the gloves.
- Thank you.

108
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,479
Put these on.

109
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,780
Okay.

110
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,250
- Put on my gloves.
- They look good together.

111
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,819
- Thank you.
- Sure.

112
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,650
My gosh. Aren't they expensive?

113
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,020
- No.
- You guys...

114
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,120
(Hyun Woo's dad is so happy.)

115
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,289
So are these two together?

116
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,560
Gosh, Ye Eun.

117
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,129
You're still really tall.

118
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,669
Hello, Jong Kook.

119
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:51,569
- How tall are you?
- Stop it.

120
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:52,840
(He's obsessed
with her height again.)

121
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,310
- "How tall are you?"
- "How tall are you?"

122
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,569
She looks even taller today.

123
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,009
She's 2m tall.

124
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,680
(When he first came, he was
surprised by Ye Eun's height.)

125
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,650
(He kept talking
about Ye Eun's height all day.)

126
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,219
The first thing he says is,
"How tall are you?"

127
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:10,460
(He's obsessed
with her height again today.)

128
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,060
- She's 2m.
- She's 2m?

129
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,960
- She's from a strong family.
- Strong?

130
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,330
- Yes, strong.
- What's your strength?

131
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,589
- I'm wearing heels.
- What?

132
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,860
Not her strength.
I mean, she's from a strong family.

133
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,029
Is your father a wrestler?

134
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,569
No. That's not it.

135
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:25,769
- He asks if her dad was a wrestler.
- Her dad is a wrestler?

136
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:27,970
- Her family is strong, so...
- Right.

137
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,339
- Daniel.
- He's Lee Bong Geol.

138
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:30,579
- Lee Bong Geol?
- Yes.

139
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:32,079
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

140
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,910
- No.
- No?

141
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,209
Wait. Did I zip up my pants?
Oh, I did.

142
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,720
(He is even more unkempt
than Kwang Soo.)

143
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,620
- By the way, the thing is...
- Okay.

144
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,319
I didn't know
Daniel was coming today.

145
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,129
- I really liked him.
- Really?

146
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:48,589
She told me that on the phone.

147
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,259
- I really liked him.
- Really?

148
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:51,930
She told me that on the phone.

149
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,259
- I know, right?
- When we talked on the phone...

150
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,300
But I'm in serious trouble.

151
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,329
- What's with Se Chan? Come here.
- Se Chan.

152
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,470
- Get your gloves back.
- I was excited to see him again.

153
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,509
No, wait. Just take one.

154
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,370
- Just one. Okay.
- Let's share them.

155
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,680
- Thank you so much.
- All right.

156
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Do you want gloves?

157
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,910
Gloves? Are they gloves?

158
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,410
Hey, tell her to take off the glove.

159
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:10,649
Tell her to take it off.

160
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:11,720
Come here, Daniel.

161
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,889
By the way, Ah Young,
you lost a lot of weight.

162
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,819
- You've become so prettier.
- She lost a lot of weight.

163
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:17,220
Yes. I lost weight.

164
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,259
You did?

165
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,290
(Tapping)

166
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,360
(As she taps him gently,
he shows his upper teeth.)

167
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,629
What was that?

168
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:26,029
- What did she just do?
- What?

169
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:28,129
- Stop giving him a hard time.
- Are you flirting with him?

170
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,829
- Stop giving him a hard time.
- She's suddenly flirting.

171
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,939
- What's with her?
- Right.

172
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,269
- That was a good one.
- I did lose some weight.

173
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:34,470
After you shake Se Chan up
like that,

174
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,569
- Right.
- you won't even call him.

175
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,910
But when I saw him on TV,
to Ye Eun...

176
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,509
- No.
- He was like, "I love you, Ye Eun."

177
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:40,709
It was crazy.

178
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,709
(His date ended up watching
the "I love you" incident.)

179
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,350
It's just business.

180
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,879
You're his girlfriend.

181
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:47,550
You're his girlfriend.

182
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,850
Se Chan's girlfriend.

183
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:49,949
This is so funny.

184
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,689
- By the way, Jong Kook,
- Yes.

185
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:53,160
when this episode goes on air,

186
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,959
- it would've been out already.
- It went out already.

187
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,589
But your life with the trash...

188
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,730
- A lot of people are worried.
- It's crazy.

189
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,959
Is your mother all right?

190
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,199
Actually, she called me
and swore at me yesterday.

191
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,500
She doesn't understand
why you did that?

192
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,870
She doesn't understand
why I let you come.

193
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,939
(The production crew
apologizes to his mother.)

194
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,439
Jong Kook, I have some silica gel.

195
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,839
- Do you want it?
- No.

196
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,879
- It's useless.
- Hey.

197
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,740
Jong Kook likes plastic bags.

198
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,009
He's Mr. Kim Bag.

199
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:16,180
- He likes plastic bags.
- Plastic bags.

200
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,720
You should collect some
and give them to him.

201
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:19,819
- He will use them someday.
- He will use them someday.

202
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:20,990
I'll use them someday.

203
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,689
They say that
the economy is shrinking these days,

204
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:26,060
consumption is freezing,

205
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,189
- That's true.
- and people's livelihoods...

206
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:29,129
- are continuing to suffer.
- Right.

207
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:32,100
Consumer confidence has shrunk
greatly since the end of last year.

208
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,939
(The consumer slump is the worst
in 21 years.)

209
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:42,339
So the race we prepared for today
is My Perfect Spending.

210
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,839
We will give you enough money
to spend as much as you please.

211
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,610
- Seriously?
- Why? You're making me nervous.

212
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,779
- Are you serious?
- We will...

213
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:50,879
- give you 3,000 dollars.
- My goodness.

214
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,920
(They get an allowance
of 3,000 dollars)

215
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:55,250
(It's a chance to splurge,
which they couldn't imagine here.)

216
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,620
- Yes!
- This is amazing!

217
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,620
- Awesome!
- Yes!

218
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,189
(They're excited
to get such a big amount.)

219
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:02,560
- It's 3,000 dollars.
- I'm so lucky.

220
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,259
- Feeling!
- Victory!

221
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,399
What?

222
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,300
- It's Feeling, Intuition, Cross.
- Intuition.

223
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,300
- Feeling!
- Intuition!

224
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,470
- Cross!
- Cross!

225
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,569
What is this though?

226
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:11,769
- What is that?
- It's a thing.

227
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,399
- You should just do it.
- Okay.

228
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:14,709
(Glancing)

229
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,410
By the way, Seok Jin,
your head is...

230
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,439
Jae Seok.

231
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,209
Isn't the hat too tight?

232
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,310
- The hat is too tight.
- It's too tight.

233
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,149
- The hat is too small.
- He works at a pizza place.

234
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,949
It's not just his head.
His glasses...

235
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:26,850
- and nose are too big.
- What?

236
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,949
His glasses and nose are too big,
not his head.

237
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,660
- So his hat looks too tight.
- That's true.

238
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,360
- Don't point that out.
- Hey.

239
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,430
- That's the truth.
- He's hurt.

240
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,930
- Do you want to get in trouble?
- I'm sorry.

241
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,259
- His nostrils are uneven.
- I'm sorry.

242
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,430
- Glasses with a Big Nose.
- His nostrils are uneven.

243
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,470
- Are they uneven?
- Yes.

244
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,930
Is one is bigger than the other one?

245
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,600
Hey, come here.

246
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,439
- Is he upset?
- Hey! Choi Daniel...

247
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,569
Choi Da, come here!

248
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,209
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.
- Come here!

249
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:53,240
Choi Da.

250
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,910
- Hey, Choi Da.
- Choi Da!

251
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,180
- It's his nostrils.
- I see. His nostrils.

252
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,920
The 3,000 dollars is...

253
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,649
divided into six envelopes.

254
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,889
For every Spending Chance,
you will pick one envelope...

255
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:06,459
- and spend the selected money.
- That sounds great.

256
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:07,930
- So we should pick one.
- For your information,

257
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,930
there will be four chances.

258
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,529
You will have to spend
the whole amount you pick.

259
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:14,029
- We have to use it up?
- That's easy.

260
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,769
- If you have some money left,
- Spending money is easy.

261
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:18,439
- it will be the penalty money.
- Come on.

262
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,740
- We won't leave any money.
- Don't worry about it.

263
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,910
- We can spend it all.
- Spending is easy.

264
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,709
- Spending is easy.
- We'll need more money.

265
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:26,709
Why would you worry
about spending it?

266
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:29,410
The street with luxury shops
is near here.

267
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,750
- There's Hermes.
- Right.

268
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,879
- Hermes.
- We need more money.

269
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,950
- Let's buy a hat for Ah Young.
- Yes.

270
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,789
- Really?
- And there's a nice burger place.

271
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,259
- That's right.
- We can eat burgers there.

272
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:40,519
So the number of members
to get the penalty changes...

273
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,529
depending on the final
accumulated amount.

274
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:44,559
- The more money you have left,
- Why can't we spend it all?

275
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,059
- the more members get the penalty.
- Why?

276
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,100
- We can spend it all.
- You will start...

277
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,429
- one penalty ball each.
- Maybe they won't let me spend it.

278
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:51,299
And the place
where you can spend money is...

279
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,399
What?

280
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,940
I bet there's something.

281
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,870
You will ask citizens
the questions...

282
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,340
the production crew prepared...

283
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,539
(You will ask citizens the questions
the production crew prepared.)

284
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,350
and spend the money
only at the places...

285
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,919
that the citizens suggest.

286
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,049
(They can spend the money
only at the mentioned places!)

287
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:08,950
They won't let us spend the money.

288
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,190
I knew it.
They wouldn't give away the money.

289
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,159
They're not just giving it away.

290
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,059
You must spend all of the money...

291
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,490
within one hour after hearing
the answers to the questions.

292
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,960
If you fail to finish
all four questions by 4 p.m.,

293
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,600
- all of you will get the penalty.
- Really?

294
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,539
Now, I will reveal
the first spending question.

295
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:27,100
- What is it?
- No. Please be easy.

296
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,509
What do we do after the exam?

297
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:30,879
- What do we do to have fun?
- Karaoke?

298
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,509
I go shopping with friends
after the exam.

299
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,179
- Shopping sounds good.
- Shopping.

300
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:35,950
- Shopping with friends?
- Shopping.

301
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,850
- Shopping is easy.
- We should hear that.

302
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,149
Things will be easy
if someone says shopping.

303
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,350
All right then. You will now...

304
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,620
pick the amount to spend
with this question here.

305
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,490
- You should pick one.
- One?

306
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,490
- Who will do that?
- Then...

307
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,529
- Ah Young.
- Ah Young, you do it.

308
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:51,799
Should I go first? Okay.

309
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,029
Good luck, Se Chan's girlfriend.

310
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:55,299
- Se Chan's girlfriend?
- For your information,

311
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:56,570
- Pick a good one.
- the lowest is 30 dollars,

312
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,500
and the highest is 1,000 dollars.

313
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,100
I'll pick a good one.

314
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,710
We should pick a medium amount.

315
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,340
- We should pick a small amount.
- A small one.

316
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,740
- A medium amount for now.
- Medium.

317
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,639
For now... Still.

318
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,480
- Medium.
- A medium one.

319
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,279
- What?
- Yes!

320
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,149
- How much is it?
- It's 1,000 dollars.

321
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:13,250
(She picked 1,000 dollars.)

322
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,289
- That's not good.
- No.

323
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:15,590
- We can't spend it all.
- It's hard to use it up.

324
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,649
- What?
- We don't know it yet.

325
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,620
Ah Young, we should spend it all.

326
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,919
- It's not good.
- We could go shopping.

327
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,190
- We'll go shopping. It's okay.
- But the thing is...

328
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,330
- We should ask teenagers.
- It's good, Ah Young.

329
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,100
Are we supposed to spend the amount?

330
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,600
It's actually 1,000 dollars.

331
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,070
(They get 1,000 dollars in cash.)

332
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,200
- We got 1,000 dollars in cash.
- It's 1,000 dollars.

333
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,740
- Seriously...
- You could give us 50-dollar bills.

334
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,110
They're all 10-dollar bills.

335
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,769
- It looks a lot.
- This feels so good.

336
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,039
So the amount you have to spend
with the first question...

337
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,649
- is 1,000 dollars.
- Gosh, it's 1,000 dollars.

338
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:42,879
Let's move.

339
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,480
If we leave money,
we will get the penalty.

340
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,580
- It will be the penalty money.
- Right.

341
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,250
- Shopping.
- It could be shopping.

342
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,590
Please. Someone should say shopping.

343
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,820
- Ah Young's ideal type.
- Right.

344
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,889
- Really?
- Are you serious?

345
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:53,090
- I called her.
- This is what she said.

346
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,759
"I like Choi Daniel these days."

347
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,759
- When he was here last time.
- Really?

348
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,960
I was really surprised.

349
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,230
You should exchange phone numbers.

350
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,559
- Stop it.
- Go ahead and do it.

351
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,169
- Exchange numbers.
- My gosh.

352
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,769
You're not doing this
for the show, right?

353
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:05,799
- They might edit this out.
- This isn't about the show.

354
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:09,039
- My goodness.
- Oh, no.

355
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,509
I'm so excited. What do I do?

356
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,080
(Staring)

357
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,950
- She's giving you her number.
- I'm Kim Ah Young.

358
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,649
What's going on?
Why are you being like this?

359
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:20,679
- Her number?
- Seriously?

360
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,889
- She says she's excited.
- I don't know her number.

361
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,059
(I don't know her number.)

362
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,259
She's now...

363
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,460
- Gosh, Se Chan...
- Hey.

364
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,289
- She got gloves from me,
- Ah Young.

365
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,929
- but she gave him her number.
- What are you doing?

366
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:31,100
- You don't have her number?
- No.

367
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,600
How does this work?

368
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,830
Is this how I save it?

369
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,100
I can't believe he's here today.

370
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,799
- I know. Isn't this amazing?
- Is it destiny?

371
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,269
By the way,
do you like a beanpole like him?

372
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:40,570
(Do you like a beanpole like him?)

373
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,740
I'm just asking.

374
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:42,940
He's not a beanpole.

375
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,409
What do you see in him?

376
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,580
He's just cool.

377
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,450
- He's attractive.
- Is he?

378
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,679
- You're attractive too.
- What did you save it as?

379
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,309
- Really?
- He's happy.

380
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,419
- What did you save it as?
- Hang on.

381
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,580
Let me see what it says.

382
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,149
- Wait. Ah Young.
- What does it say?

383
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:56,190
I'll see what he saved your name as.

384
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,019
Running Man, SNS...

385
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,559
Oh, right. It's SNL.

386
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,360
It's SNL.

387
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,100
(Putting in Running Man is strange,
and he wrote SNS at that.)

388
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,429
- SNS.
- It's SNL.

389
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,970
Running Man and SNS.

390
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,269
- How unfriendly.
- It's SNL.

391
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:12,740
- It says SNS.
- Hey.

392
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,370
- It's SNL.
- SNS.

393
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:17,210
What is SNS?

394
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,940
- It's SNL.
- SNS.

395
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,909
- That sounds so unfriendly.
- I'm sorry, Ah Young.

396
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:23,110
- S...
- It's over for you.

397
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,750
- I'll change it later.
- Okay.

398
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,919
- Let's move.
- Let's go.

399
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:27,549
- I hope we will go shopping.
- Let's move.

400
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:28,889
- Yes!
- Let's go.

401
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:30,750
- One, two.
- You're a big fan.

402
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,690
- A real fan.
- I had no idea.

403
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,230
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

404
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,500
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

405
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,330
(He's really something.)

406
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,600
- You should be careful.
- By the way...

407
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,000
- He's so clumsy.
- It was so close.

408
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,340
By the way, he's a little strange.

409
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,340
- He is.
- You think he's strange?

410
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,639
You said he was your ideal type.

411
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,409
This is my first time
meeting him in person.

412
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:51,509
- He's like a countryman.
- Right.

413
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,340
I'm quite conventional.

414
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:55,480
- Please be careful.
- Okay.

415
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,309
- I'm conventional.
- I'm...

416
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,019
- By the way...
- His personality...

417
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:00,850
Why do you keep pretending
to be ordinary?

418
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,620
- Jae Seok.
- You're not ordinary at all.

419
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,659
- Right.
- I'm totally ordinary.

420
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,159
I don't think he's ordinary.

421
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,590
And I'm very shy.

422
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,659
- Daniel.
- You're unique.

423
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:11,100
- You have a text neck.
- Oh, right.

424
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,200
You should tuck your chin in.

425
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,730
- Is there a treatment for that?
- You should...

426
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,799
join Gym Jong Kook someday.

427
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,799
- Of course, there is.
- There is?

428
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,100
- You should work out your back.
- You should go to Gym Jong Kook.

429
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,070
I was born this way.

430
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,370
- I was hunched like this.
- I see. But it can be better.

431
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,840
My nickname was Hunchback.

432
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,440
(My nickname was Hunchback.)

433
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:27,179
- Like a hunched back?
- Yes.

434
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:29,379
- Your nickname was Hunchback?
- Yes.

435
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,320
Ah Young seems
to be getting disappointed.

436
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,320
No, I'm not disappointed.

437
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
- Hey.
- Good.

438
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,750
(They take a seat on the bus.)

439
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,789
Choi Da.

440
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:38,820
- Choi Da!
- Sit in the back.

441
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,960
- Okay.
- Ah Young, sit in the back.

442
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:43,659
Ah Young, sit in the back.

443
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:45,059
To be honest, Ah Young...

444
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:47,029
- I'll sit...
- Sit here.

445
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:48,769
- Se Chan, come here.
- Se Chan.

446
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,039
- Dumpling.
- Yes, our Dumpling.

447
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,200
- Go.
- Dumpling.

448
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,740
- Se Chan should be here.
- Shouldn't Se Chan be here?

449
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,440
- No. You can sit.
- It's okay.

450
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,039
- Just sit.
- Se Chan.

451
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,009
Ye Eun has very long legs.

452
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,149
- You're the best, seriously.
- Ssaebssaeb, here.

453
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:03,909
- He says you're the best.
- You're very tall.

454
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,320
Do you like me?

455
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,149
Well, you're not a bad catch.

456
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,850
Hey, are you...

457
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,259
You just exchanged
the numbers with Ah Young.

458
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,090
- Read the room.
- Why?

459
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,929
But I can't say
that I don't like her.

460
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:18,230
- Do you not like me?
- That's not true.

461
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,129
I watched the episode where
you got acupunctured on your face.

462
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:22,629
It hurts.

463
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,830
- It hurts.
- It was fun.

464
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,570
You looked nice
with the costume and makeup.

465
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,070
(He's glad after praising her
in a strange way.)

466
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,370
First...

467
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,879
Since there aren't many teenagers
in this neighborhood,

468
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,850
- we will move to another town.
- Okay.

469
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,950
All right.

470
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,379
It's true that people don't spend
a lot of money these days.

471
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,549
- Even I stay at home more.
- Same here.

472
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:43,350
Back in the day,
I used to go to Apgujeong...

473
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,220
- at least five times a week.
- Goodness.

474
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,289
- That's a lot.
- Now, I never come here.

475
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,129
- Spend some money...
- Of course.

476
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,360
instead of collecting plastic bags.

477
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,730
How can I spend money
when there's nothing to buy?

478
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,000
Just spend some, will you?

479
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,299
All I do is sleep at home.

480
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:57,870
Unbelievable.

481
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,440
- Ah Young, watch out for him.
- What's your MBTI personality?

482
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,470
- What's your MBTI personality?
- My MBTI personality?

483
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,740
It's ENTP.

484
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,070
(Right then, a separate talk show
begins in the back row.)

485
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,940
- What is it?
- They're talking among themselves.

486
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,440
- You're right.
- They're filming on their own.

487
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,179
She asked
what my MBTI personality was.

488
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:10,509
- It was unexpected.
- What's yours?

489
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,620
Se Chan's is "I love you."

490
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,350
(Se Chan's is "I love you.")

491
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,190
(The romance addict pushes them
together out of the blue.)

492
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,190
- Did you see him just now?
- Come on.

493
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,919
He's having a blast.

494
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,090
(What do you think?
Didn't I do great?)

495
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,629
- He only ruins things.
- You make everyone uncomfortable.

496
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,460
- He meant it.
- He's the worst.

497
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
- Se Chan, do you have a tissue?
- Why?

498
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,340
I have a runny nose.
Don't you have one?

499
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,639
Why ask him of all people?

500
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,009
(Why are you asking me, though?)

501
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,769
I can't believe him.
He's killing me.

502
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:38,480
Hey, Kwang Soo!

503
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,710
- I have a runny nose.
- I can't believe him.

504
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,740
- Don't you have one?
- He's killing me.

505
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,210
(He must look like
he carries tissue around.)

506
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,210
Hey, Kwang Soo!

507
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,919
- Feeling!
- Intuition!

508
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,049
- Cross!
- Cross!

509
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:48,789
- Why did he ask Se Chan...
- Thank you.

510
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:49,820
for a tissue?

511
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,360
- He's hilarious.
- Thanks.

512
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,120
- He's another Kwang Soo.
- I admit he's funny.

513
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,360
- He's hilarious.
- I know.

514
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
He called him another Kwang Soo.

515
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,460
- Daniel.
- Yes?

516
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,629
Who would be your ideal woman?

517
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:00,730
- Me?
- Go ahead.

518
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:03,200
I like someone
who's humorous and cute.

519
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,539
(I like someone
who's humorous and cute.)

520
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,710
- That's Ah Young.
- That's Ah Young.

521
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,139
Ah Young, who would be
your ideal guy?

522
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,580
I'm curious, that's all.

523
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:15,279
(Se Chan secretly expects
to hear his name.)

524
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,549
It's an innocent question.

525
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:18,980
- If I'm being honest,
- Yes, be honest.

526
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,120
the one who I like...

527
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,289
in terms of appearances is...

528
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,990
(Say that it's Se Chan.)

529
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:28,159
In terms of appearances,
my ideal man would be Daniel.

530
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,789
- Me? Really?
- I mean that.

531
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,559
(In terms of appearances,
her ideal man is Daniel.)

532
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,000
- Me? Really?
- I mean that.

533
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,070
- You're being open with it?
- Because...

534
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,669
- In terms of his appearance.
- No way.

535
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:39,299
(Heart-shattering news)

536
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,970
- No way.
- I like someone who's like my dad,

537
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,240
- and my dad is tall...
- Is he like your dad?

538
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,480
Yes, he reminds me of my dad.

539
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,139
(Whispering)

540
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,409
- I'll tell her.
- Yes, he reminds me of my dad.

541
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,210
- He's tall.
- Your dad must be tall.

542
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,519
- Yes, he's tall.
- Ah Young.

543
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,580
- But your dad...
- Yes?

544
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,789
He can't say it to your face,
but he wants his gloves back.

545
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,860
She needs to return them.
It's that annoying.

546
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,190
I mean it.

547
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,789
But remember what I said.

548
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,360
- Just his appearance.
- Only his appearance.

549
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,359
Besides, you never get to date
your ideal man or woman.

550
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,130
- Is that so?
- So just his appearance.

551
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,400
What else?

552
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,529
- However...
- What about personalities?

553
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:12,140
I didn't know Choi Daniel
would be on the show.

554
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,140
It's fascinating.

555
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,640
- We're here.
- We're here.

556
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,839
It's Gangnam Station.

557
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,039
- It's been so long for me.
- Same here.

558
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,710
- There's no reason to come here.
- Here,

559
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,349
let's do well on our mission...

560
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,809
- You're right.
- and spend all 1,000 dollars.

561
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:24,819
- Sounds good.
- Let's spend it all.

562
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,880
Let's not receive any penalties.

563
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,619
We only need to spend
about 100 dollars each.

564
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,750
- That'd be perfect.
- Exactly.

565
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,750
That place will do the trick.
The patch shop.

566
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,720
- They sell accessories.
- Accessories are a great choice.

567
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
I'm actually hungry.

568
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,089
We need to be wise
about the delivery of the question.

569
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,490
That's Jae Seok's specialty.

570
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,029
- But...
- You can't cheat.

571
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:41,829
- That'll ruin us.
- It should be asked by an expert.

572
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:42,829
Teens?

573
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,900
We could spend all 1,000 dollars
at a family-style restaurant.

574
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,099
(Can they get the answer they want
from someone in their teens?)

575
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,269
Then...

576
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:48,269
(They arrive at the first location
to ask the question.)

577
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:50,140
We need to ask the question...

578
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,180
- to a student in their teens.
- That's right.

579
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,839
- We need to be smart about it.
- Ask it wisely.

580
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,349
I doubt students these days...

581
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:57,710
- will say they'll have tteokbokki.
- They won't.

582
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,279
- Ask what they would do.
- We only need to hear "shopping."

583
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,220
- Shopping will do it.
- Yes, shopping.

584
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,519
We won't have enough money
if shopping is said.

585
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,119
How about this?
Isn't four-cut photos also good?

586
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:07,190
- That's only 4 dollars.
- To spend 1,000 dollars on?

587
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,490
- That won't work.
- No way.

588
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,599
Karaoke will be
the first on the list.

589
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,200
- Not just any karaoke room.
- Yes, that.

590
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,470
- One that's also a diner.
- One that serves food.

591
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,829
- One that serves food.
- Yes, food.

592
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,869
It'd be great to hear
that they want something delicious.

593
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:18,940
(Spending 1,000 dollars isn't easy.)

594
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,200
- I smell something delicious.
- We'll spend it in no time.

595
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,609
- Free access passes are pricey.
- Come here.

596
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,440
- Sure.
- Where is it?

597
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:26,039
- Our food fighter.
- She has a sensor.

598
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,410
- Over here?
- What do you smell?

599
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,549
I smell dakgalbi.

600
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,619
- She knows.
- You're precise.

601
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:33,420
- Let's go, then.
- All right.

602
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,690
"What do you do to have fun
on the final day of exams?"

603
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,819
- After exams.
- Got it.

604
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:38,220
- Hey.
- What do you do to have fun?

605
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,089
- Look.
- It's dakgalbi!

606
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,259
- It's dakgalbi.
- It really was dakgalbi.

607
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,529
It's dakgalbi...

608
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:45,230
- like she said.
- She guessed it right.

609
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,759
- I'm amazed.
- You're amazing.

610
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,130
I had no idea, though.

611
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,599
- I didn't know it was here.
- How did you know that?

612
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,299
- It really was dakgalbi.
- I'd love some!

613
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,400
I can't believe it.

614
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:54,539
- This looks good.
- This looks good.

615
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,309
I don't see any teens.

616
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,670
What if they say Internet cafe?

617
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,779
Jae Seok, don't ask boys.

618
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:02,549
- They'll say Internet cafe.
- Internet cafe.

619
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,779
Yes, the boys. We should ask...

620
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:06,279
young ladies instead.

621
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:09,549
- Are they here at this hour?
- Are there any teens?

622
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:10,619
(So they walk for a while.)

623
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,390
- Teens...
- Sundaeguk.

624
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,759
Are teens out and about
at this hour?

625
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,490
(Current time: Monday, 11 a.m.)

626
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,690
(No teenagers are to be seen.)

627
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,960
- Schools are on breaks.
- That looks tasty.

628
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,569
- Is that so?
- Are schools on breaks?

629
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,970
Who here is a teenager?

630
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:25,740
- A teenager.
- A teenager.

631
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,269
- I doubt there are any teenagers.
- Not at this hour.

632
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:30,470
- Aren't schools on breaks?
- Not at this hour.

633
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,980
Elementary schools are on breaks.

634
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,279
It needs to be at least 2 to 3 p.m.

635
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,410
(Early in the morning,
all they see are office workers.)

636
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,509
- Wait.
- Over there.

637
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,549
There? I see a child.

638
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,420
Don't you think he's too young?

639
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,819
- We couldn't spend 1,000 dollars.
- We couldn't.

640
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:43,019
Are you a teenager?

641
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:44,220
- No?
- What if he says something off?

642
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,660
You're not in your teens? Got it.

643
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,059
- You know...
- There aren't many people.

644
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:48,490
It's tough to find a student here.

645
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,630
Why would students be here
at this hour?

646
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,059
- It wouldn't be easy.
- Teenagers...

647
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,460
Let's hit the main street.

648
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,529
- Se Chan.
- Did you see that?

649
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:56,500
- What's this?
- A hand warmer.

650
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,069
It's in the shape of a bungeoppang.

651
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,769
(Out of the blue,
Ah Young hands him a hand warmer.)

652
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:01,509
She gave me hand warmer.
What does this mean?

653
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,839
It doesn't mean anything.

654
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,039
- Ah Young.
- Yes?

655
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:09,150
Men like him are the real deal.

656
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,180
- Ah Young, don't listen to him.
- But...

657
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:12,920
Why are you telling me...

658
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,220
- Well...
- not to listen to him?

659
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,220
He used to date a K-pop artist.

660
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,690
No, they broke up.

661
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,759
- They're broken up now but...
- They broke up.

662
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,819
(While Ok Soon of Running Man
is confusing Se Chan)

663
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,259
The students.

664
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,430
Do students usually walk
on this main street?

665
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,900
- Hold on.
- Wait. Wouldn't there...

666
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,329
be students at the arcade?

667
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:30,329
- The arcade.
- Not this early in the morning.

668
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,140
- It's empty.
- If anyone said...

669
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,869
they'd go to an arcade...

670
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:35,809
- That would've worked.
- We'd have fun at an arcade.

671
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:38,410
- We could spend it all there.
- We couldn't.

672
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,609
- We could.
- We definitely could.

673
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:41,549
- Seok Jin.
- On the claw machine,

674
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:43,079
- you'd spend 200 dollars.
- Really?

675
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,349
On a dart game,

676
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:45,549
- we'd spend it easily.
- At least 100 dollars per person?

677
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:46,819
There are about ten of us.

678
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:47,849
- We'd spend it in no time.
- That'd be easy.

679
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:48,990
Students...

680
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,519
Who here is a teenager?

681
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:52,119
- It's hard to find students.
- There are no teenagers.

682
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,619
- This is tough.
- Any teenagers?

683
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,329
- Aren't you a teenager?
- Hello, there.

684
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:57,390
- Hi, how old are you?
- Are you in your 20s?

685
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,160
- That's obvious.
- Are you in your 20s?

686
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,259
On the nose?

687
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,369
- That wouldn't work.
- Right.

688
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,269
Hello.

689
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:07,170
- May I ask your age?
- He looks young.

690
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,769
- Are you a teenager?
- I'll be a high school freshman.

691
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,309
- You'll start high school?
- A high school freshman?

692
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:13,009
He'll start high school.

693
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:14,380
- But...
- He'll start high school.

694
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,779
We can't ask this question
to boys, though.

695
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:18,720
- Pass up on the boys.
- Don't ask boys.

696
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,279
- They'll say Internet cafe.
- Don't ask boys.

697
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,220
- Actually, come here.
- Don't ask boys.

698
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:23,819
They'll say Internet cafe.

699
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:25,460
- No, don't.
- They'll say Internet cafe.

700
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,519
- Don't ask boys.
- Are you going to ask him?

701
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,990
- I know.
- Are you in high school?

702
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,200
- Yes.
- Can you please introduce yourself?

703
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,799
I'm Lee Do Gyeong
who'll be a freshman...

704
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,400
- at Youngdongil High School.
- A foreign language high school?

705
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,900
- No, Youngdongil High School.
- I was forced...

706
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,000
to go to Eonnam High School,

707
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,440
so I gave up my spot
and am waiting to be reallocated.

708
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,039
- You're waiting to debut?
- No, to be reallocated.

709
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,240
- Reallocation?
- Reallocation?

710
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,839
- He heard it as "debut."
- Debut.

711
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,950
You thought he was debuting.

712
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,309
Why would he be waiting to debut?

713
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,619
- He looks like the type.
- Who knows?

714
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:52,750
- He's handsome.
- There's something to him.

715
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,950
- Right?
- He's handsome.

716
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,190
- Are you starting high school?
- Yes.

717
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,849
- They're really young.
- But you're so tall.

718
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,019
- You're tall.
- They're so young.

719
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:00,289
They're both super tall.

720
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:01,559
- Ye Eun.
- Yes?

721
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,490
Are they taller than you? They are.

722
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,759
- Because she's really tall.
- Of course they're taller.

723
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,400
It's so out of the blue.

724
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:11,599
In Won, Do Gyeong,
where were you two headed?

725
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:14,599
We were on our way to buy clothes.

726
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,910
(They were actually shopping!)

727
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,980
- Really?
- Shopping?

728
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,849
(Shopping is a nice way
to spend large sums of money.)

729
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:23,079
(They respond to it loudly
to show it's the answer they want.)

730
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,450
- Nice.
- I love it.

731
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,180
- Okay.
- All right.

732
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,680
- We've got this.
- I love to go shopping.

733
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,519
- I love to go shopping.
- You're out here shopping?

734
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,960
- Then, I'll ask them the question.
- Go ahead.

735
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,559
Please answer this question.

736
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,130
What do you do with friends
after an exam?

737
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,529
(The teenagers
who were out shopping)

738
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,369
(They gave them
all the signals they could.)

739
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:43,400
(What will their answer be?)

740
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,640
Well, I'd either go to Lotte World.

741
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:48,670
I usually go to Internet cafes.

742
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:51,240
- Lotte World and Internet cafes.
- What did I tell you?

743
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,640
- You said you were out shopping.
- You're out shopping!

744
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,180
We cheered when you said it.

745
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,750
- Exactly.
- One said an amusement park,

746
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,009
while one said an Internet cafe.

747
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,880
- Oh, no.
- Give them one collective answer.

748
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,980
- Together?
- Give us one together.

749
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,920
- Decide on one.
- Yes, discuss.

750
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:04,250
You can say something else.

751
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,859
(They get a chance to answer
what they know nothing about.)

752
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:09,230
Just so you know, an amusement park
and an Internet cafe combined...

753
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,500
- would be an arcade.
- Yes, an arcade.

754
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,259
There's one right here.

755
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,299
Ask them again.

756
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,569
An arcade.

757
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:18,599
- I doubt they like such games.
- I think it'll be an arcade.

758
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,869
- Don't you go to arcades?
- This...

759
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,369
Don't you go to arcades?

760
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:24,240
Kids our age
don't go to arcades a lot.

761
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,910
They go to Internet cafes instead.

762
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:27,940
- Hey, you. Come here.
- Are your ears stuffed up?

763
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,279
- Your ears are blocked.
- Be more open-minded.

764
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,380
- Let's go to an arcade.
- Okay.

765
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,589
If you merge an amusement park
with an Internet cafe,

766
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:37,490
- you get an arcade.
- That's an arcade.

767
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,359
- But...
- Just say it.

768
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,920
- What?
- Haha...

769
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,230
What did you say to him?

770
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,529
What did Haha say?

771
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:45,529
He said he'd hit me.

772
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:47,730
- When did I say that?
- You fool!

773
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,369
- Hey! Can you swear to that?
- I apologize.

774
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:52,240
- How could he?
- You'd hit a kid?

775
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,200
- I swear!
- He's an innocent citizen.

776
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,470
- I swear.
- Why would you threaten kids?

777
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,109
- This is hilarious.
- I feel so wronged.

778
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,250
- We'll ask you once more.
- Okay.

779
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,480
Where are you headed?

780
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,450
What do you do with friends
after an exam? One, two, three.

781
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,319
(Will they give the answer
the members want?)

782
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,720
- Go to an arcade.
- Go to an arcade.

783
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,359
- Go to an arcade.
- Go to an arcade.

784
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,829
(They were forced
to give this answer.)

785
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,789
- Well done.
- Go to an arcade!

786
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,799
- Thanks.
- Go to an arcade!

787
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,230
- Thank you.
- Well done.

788
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,230
Let's take one.

789
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,230
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

790
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,700
(They take a souvenir snapshot.)

791
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,200
- Okay!
- Okay!

792
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,440
- Thank you.
- Bye.

793
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,039
- That was a good one.
- Thank you.

794
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,539
- Let's go to an arcade!
- Study hard!

795
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,950
- He could debut as an idol.
- Yes.

796
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,450
- He could be a celebrity.
- He's handsome.

797
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,109
Let's go to an arcade.

798
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,849
- To an arcade.
- Sounds good.

799
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:41,049
- Hey.
- To an arcade.

800
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:43,390
We must play
the claw machines or darts.

801
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,359
The claw machine.

802
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,720
- The claw machine.
- That's a good bet.

803
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,730
Hey, this is an arcade.

804
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,390
- Where?
- We found one.

805
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,329
- This place?
- This is an arcade.

806
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:53,630
(Their first stop this morning
is an arcade.)

807
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,970
Okay!

808
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,069
This is paradise!

809
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,839
- Claw machines.
- Claw machines.

810
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,440
These are easy to spend on.

811
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,039
Hey, there's a basketball game too.

812
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,079
I want to play this!

813
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,839
The Gen Z should sing.

814
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,710
- A shooting game.
- What's this?

815
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,750
Can we use this?

816
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,150
- Jae Seok, give me 100 dollars.
- Okay!

817
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,549
(It's a Monday morning,
and the arcade is empty.)

818
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:17,549
- Hey.
- Hey, everyone!

819
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,490
- Okay.
- Take 100 dollars each.

820
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,559
- A hundred dollars!
- A hundred dollars.

821
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:22,730
Here you go.

822
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,529
- He's handing out the allowance.
- Okay.

823
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,359
- Here's 100 dollars.
- Thank you.

824
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,559
Hand out the rest too.

825
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,329
Another ten dollars each? Okay.

826
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,569
- Thank you.
- That's ten, right?

827
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:35,339
My gosh. I'd always wished for this.

828
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:37,339
(Dongducheon Boy's lifelong wish
was to flex at an arcade.)

829
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:38,579
Count your bills first.

830
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,079
(Giggling)

831
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,710
Okay, 100 dollars.

832
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,279
Play the claw machine,
and you'll be out in no time.

833
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,849
- I'll play the claw machine.
- I'll play that game.

834
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:50,190
It's this arcade owner's lucky day.

835
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,660
Can we really spend all this here?

836
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,859
- We have to spend it all.
- That's the mission.

837
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:55,960
This will get the economy moving.

838
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,259
Let's get the economy...

839
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,730
- moving!
- Moving!

840
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,829
Let's go and...

841
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:01,059
- spend!
- Spend!

842
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,369
- Let's go.
- Let's get some dollar bills!

843
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:04,799
How does this work?

844
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,039
Where is it?

845
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:08,440
Doesn't the bill go in here?
If I put in a ten-dollar bill...

846
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,710
A ten-dollar bill...
We must break it.

847
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,450
This machine accepts
10 and 50-dollar bills.

848
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,079
- Don't they take a ten-dollar bill?
- Let's exchange these.

849
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,220
- He hasn't been here before.
- They work.

850
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,250
They work?

851
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,890
Do you exchange bills for coins?

852
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:22,950
There's a machine for that.

853
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,759
Do the games accept dollar bills?

854
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,460
- They take fifty-cent coins.
- Fifty cent coins...

855
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:30,789
Let's get some dollar bills here!

856
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,200
Okay. These ten-dollar bills...

857
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,170
It can't give me these.

858
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:38,740
(Two five-dollar bills)

859
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:42,710
What's this? Do the machines
take five-dollar bills too?

860
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,079
- That's for credit cards.
- I think so.

861
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,109
(The dollar-bill machine)

862
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:51,279
It'll take a whole hour
to get the coins we need!

863
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,950
I know. The time is...

864
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,089
(His mouth is drying with anxiety.)

865
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:57,250
Look. Getting the dollar bills...

866
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,759
We don't have the whole day.

867
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,359
We were never allowed to spend.

868
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,460
Having to spend
is nerve-racking too.

869
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,799
This machine is broken.

870
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:08,799
- What?
- It says "error."

871
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,799
Is there no owner or manager?

872
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,369
Is it out of dollar bills?

873
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,009
- It could be out of bills.
- That's possible.

874
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,240
We took too many.

875
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,809
I'll look for the owner
and see if they're here.

876
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,309
There is someone.

877
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:22,309
(Feeding more bills immediately)

878
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:23,549
(Claw machine: 1 dollar per game)

879
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:24,579
Let's have a go.

880
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:26,720
(Jae Seok gets started
with a claw machine.)

881
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:32,960
(The Claw King
attempts to win back his honor.)

882
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,230
I got one.

883
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,289
(The claw grabbed a duck's bottom.)

884
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,470
(Flop)

885
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:48,039
(Sighing)

886
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,269
Shoot.

887
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:51,740
I swear I'll get one.

888
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,339
(Today, the Claw King
has unlimited ammo.)

889
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,049
(Keep going)

890
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:00,849
(But he failed.)

891
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:04,750
(It's an odd situation where
he can't even blame lack of funds.)

892
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,019
Darn it.

893
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,730
(Fail)

894
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,059
(And another fail)

895
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:13,930
(He's succeeded to spend money,
but his ego is getting bruised.)

896
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,099
(He spent all his coins.)

897
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:16,569
I want that goose.

898
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,769
This is a weird experience.
Having to spend money.

899
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,369
It's something from a movie.
You're forced to spend.

900
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:24,470
Click to the side to reload.

901
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,839
(Shooting game: 50 cents per game)

902
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,839
We're saving the civilians!

903
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,910
Dong Hoon!

904
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,410
(Civilian lives depend on
the barbecue restaurant owners.)

905
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,180
Are you scared?

906
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,119
- Where is it?
- I'm not scared!

907
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,950
- How dare you? Die.
- It's coming down a slide.

908
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,490
Okay.

909
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,460
(The two heroes kept Seoul safe.)

910
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,589
Okay.

911
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,359
Okay!

912
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,559
We're too good at this.

913
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,569
We need to spend, but we can't.

914
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,329
Jong Kook, don't play too well.

915
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,170
Hey, look.

916
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,440
- I should've shot that. My bad.
- Yes.

917
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
(Why aren't they usually this good?)

918
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,140
We shouldn't be too competitive.
We must do poorly.

919
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:04,349
It's okay. It's fine!

920
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,450
(Stage 1 is complete
without added funds needed.)

921
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,420
- I'm scared by how good I am.
- My shoulder cramped up.

922
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,490
There's no time.

923
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,720
(These two spent
just one dollar so far!)

924
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:16,359
Who wants to sing with me?

925
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,730
I'll go to the karaoke.

926
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,630
- Yes, me!
- Hey. Are you okay?

927
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,900
Let's go, then.

928
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,329
(She intercepted
the karaoke duet spot.)

929
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,539
- Let's spend.
- Okay. This booth?

930
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:28,200
- This booth?
- Yes, this one.

931
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,470
- Okay.
- The Gen Z-ers should sing.

932
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,740
(It's just 50 cents per song!)

933
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,779
You need to sing alone
if you want to spend.

934
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,349
How much did you insert?
You didn't insert anything yet?

935
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:39,380
- I put in fifty cents.
- Fifty cents?

936
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,880
Is it 50 cents per song?

937
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,319
- "Nagging?"
- Yes.

938
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,930
I'm not sure
if I can hit the high notes.

939
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,230
Okay.

940
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,359
- Why is the mic... The echo...
- One, two, three.

941
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,400
"Mic volume."

942
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,430
(There's no music?)

943
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,430
Is it working?

944
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:58,329
<i>Don't be out too late</i>

945
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,740
We need to put these on.

946
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:01,539
- I get it.
- Oh, okay.

947
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,640
- I like this.
- This is great.

948
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,140
(The music only comes through
the headsets.)

949
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:07,579
<i>I can only laugh</i>

950
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:10,309
(Yang Seul Ong revs up
his nasal voice.)

951
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:14,279
(Singing through his nose)

952
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,019
<i>You don't get</i>

953
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:18,589
(Ah Young-IU can't sing too well
early in the morning.)

954
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:20,720
<i>You don't get why I only want to</i>

955
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,230
(The high notes are coming up.)

956
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,730
(From one...)

957
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:32,440
(Even if you complain)

958
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,240
(Switching to rap)

959
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,039
<i>- Let's stop</i>
<i>- Let's stop</i>

960
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,740
(It feels like they should stop.)

961
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,480
<i>I can only hear</i>

962
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,849
(Yang Seul Ong and Ah Young-IU
struggled to spend 50 cents.)

963
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:45,849
- Okay.
- How about "All For You..."

964
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:47,019
or something lower?

965
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:49,119
"Love is..." "Hello."

966
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,319
- "Hello?" Okay.
- I can ace that song.

967
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,759
<i>- I love you, but I mustn't love you</i>
- Yes, that one.

968
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,490
That's what we're like now.

969
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,930
Okay. Is that what we're like?

970
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,930
I got it.

971
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,460
- I can sing this one well.
- Okay.

972
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,900
(How will
Mr. Bucktooth's "Hello" sound?)

973
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
Skip the intro.

974
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,009
<i>Is it for real this time?</i>

975
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:11,980
Can someone get her expression?

976
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,109
(We'd broken up a few times)

977
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:17,180
(Getting into it)

978
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,319
(Eventually, again)

979
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:22,119
(Big Eyes isn't joking around.)

980
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,349
This is my POV.

981
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:25,460
(She's really into it now.)

982
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,430
(You know now)

983
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,430
You can sing.

984
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:37,730
(Blinded by love?)

985
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:41,170
(Zooming in)

986
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:47,079
(Filming a music video
without pressing "record")

987
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:51,450
<i>Forgetting it all</i>

988
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,579
(Singing his heart out)

989
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:59,490
(In our next lives)

990
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,559
(Let's meet very early on)

991
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,099
To before the time
I meet Choi Daniel.

992
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:08,430
(Laughing)

993
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,339
(Ah Young and Se Chan
meet again after a long time.)

994
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:13,940
(Wear these gloves.)

995
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:18,910
(A shadow gets in the way.)

996
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,210
(I liked him a lot.)

997
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,109
(Se Chan can do nothing but watch.)

998
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,319
Hey, tell her to remove her gloves.

999
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,750
(To when Daniel didn't exist...)

1000
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,849
(so we don't have to break up.)

1001
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,490
(Now...)

1002
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:38,759
<i>- I love you</i>
<i>- But I mustn't love you</i>

1003
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:42,000
(Emotions explode)

1004
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:46,740
(We're sure they forgot
the mission is to spend money.)

1005
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,940
(A dissonance of their own)

1006
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:54,140
(This is how it sounds
from the outside.)

1007
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,950
<i>If we happen to</i>

1008
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,549
(Although the harmony
is a disaster,)

1009
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:01,849
(they're definitely
perfect comic match.)

1010
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:10,390
(The conclusion is that
they should just meet and say hi.)

1011
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:20,000
(The silly show ends.)

1012
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,640
- That was good.
- We tore it up.

1013
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:25,140
- This is fun.
- Isn't it great?

1014
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,809
(Singing her heart out
in a room by herself)

1015
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:37,190
(What's the use in saying)

1016
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,019
(Singing with her double chin)

1017
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,430
Oh, this is sad.

1018
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,500
(Oh, this is sad.)

1019
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,940
(Right when she's about to start
the 2nd verse,)

1020
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,069
(her friend and her former fling
come in after growing closer.)

1021
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,680
Sing with her.

1022
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,710
(He goes ahead and plops down.)

1023
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,389
You're so good.

1024
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,590
- Where is Daniel?
<i>- Let's be sure to break up today</i>

1025
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,500
(She leaves to find Daniel.)

1026
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,760
(She leaves to find Daniel.)

1027
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:27,599
Se Chan, do you want to sing
"Hello" together?

1028
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,869
Do you want to sing "Hello?"

1029
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:31,110
- "Hello."
- Oh, that sounds good.

1030
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,440
You have to insert 50 cents.

1031
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,610
Put it in right there.

1032
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,739
("Hello" happens to be the song
that he sang with Ah Young.)

1033
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
"Hello."

1034
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,280
- You know "Hello," right?
- I do.

1035
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,079
(Se Chan keeps checking outside
for some reason.)

1036
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,320
Start.

1037
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,489
Let's sing it seriously, okay?

1038
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:46,019
- I'm not lying. I'm really...
- Let's really be serious.

1039
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:47,719
- I've already practiced this too.
- Seriously. Okay.

1040
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,929
(The goat starts singing seriously.)

1041
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:01,699
(Mixed feelings)

1042
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,639
(Right then)

1043
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,679
(His former duet partner
comes back as she heard the song.)

1044
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,579
We just sang this together.

1045
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,760
Hey, you're good.

1046
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,989
- Hey, you're good.
- He's even better this time.

1047
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,159
(He has definitely gotten better
since it's his second time.)

1048
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,760
He's doing better than last time.

1049
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:30,199
- Oh, what's going on?
- Daniel!

1050
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,630
(Daniel appears right on time.)

1051
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,739
Karaoke?

1052
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:34,639
(And she links arms with him
as if to show everyone.)

1053
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:39,380
(Will you still not look at me?)

1054
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,380
(Now)

1055
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,949
<i>- I love you</i>
<i>- I love you</i>

1056
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:47,949
<i>But I mustn't love you</i>

1057
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:49,119
This is my song.

1058
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,750
<i>I miss you</i>

1059
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,820
<i>But I mustn't see you</i>

00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:57,360
(The battle of two women over
Mr. Bucktooth)

1061
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,099
(In the end, all three of them
harmonize together.)

1062
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,570
(It turns out
there were four of them.)

1063
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,440
<i>- If we happen to</i>
<i>- Run into each other</i>

1064
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,039
<i>Let's hide</i>

1065
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,039
(Our love...)

1066
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,440
<i>Like friends</i>

1067
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:14,309
(Turning around)

1068
00:36:14,309 --> 00:36:18,480
<i>- Let's smile and say hello</i>
<i>- Let's smile and say hello</i>

(It goes from "Single's Inferno...")

1070
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,449
(to "EXchange" in the end.)

1071
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,960
This is so sad.

1072
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,530
(Just like that, Ah Young leaves.)

1073
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,730
You two should sing.

1074
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:35,199
<i>To forget about everything</i>

1075
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:36,869
Ah Young!

1076
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:38,000
(Se Chan sets off to find Ah Young.)

1077
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:44,110
(In the end,
these two finish singing "Hello.")

1078
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,280
- It's over.
- My gosh.

1079
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,909
Oh, thank you.

1080
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,079
- Hey, Ye Eun.
- Yes?

1081
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
- I mean...
- Me?

1082
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,119
You're tall, so your eyes
are on the same level as me.

1083
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,650
- Eye level.
- Eye level.

1084
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,590
- I haven't felt this before either.
- Seriously.

1085
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,719
That's why I have a hunched back.

1086
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,530
- I'm kind of hunched over too.
- My eye level didn't match up.

1087
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,289
- Since you had to go like this?
- I can stand tall now. Yes.

1088
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,659
- We'll move in ten minutes.
- I should go play games now.

1089
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,469
- We'll move in ten minutes.
- This takes way too long.

1090
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:11,130
Gosh, where did all that money go?

1091
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:13,039
If I went outside with this money...

1092
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,769
and just bought a doll,
I would've bought several of them.

1093
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,239
(Jae Seok still hasn't given up.)

1094
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,550
(He really doesn't win one
and gives up.)

1095
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,780
Gosh, that's so infuriating.

1096
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,050
(Ji Hyo takes his spot...)

1097
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,750
(and wins a doll in a single try.)

1098
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,250
I got one!

1099
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,519
Okay. Pick how many you want,
and it's 20 dollars.

1100
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,559
Let's do a good job.

1101
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,030
With a dollar,
I can just shoot however I want.

1102
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,969
- Booster!
- Boost!

1103
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,530
Hey, this costs a lot of money.

1104
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:46,369
(With one hand, he whacks moles.
With the other, he shoots a gun.)

1105
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:47,400
Okay!

1106
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,769
(Muscles tries everything
that requires smashing things.)

1107
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,510
Hey, are you two on a date
or something?

1108
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,769
(As the Longlegs duo play
Pump It Up,)

1109
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,280
(Mr. Bucktooth plays
the claw machine by himself.)

1110
00:37:56,449 --> 00:37:57,710
Mister!

1111
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,880
Mister, I should get this!

1112
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:01,849
Time is up.

1113
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:03,889
Please gather around.

1114
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:06,519
The amount you've spent...

1115
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:08,719
- We gave you 1,000 dollars.
- Yes.

1116
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,230
- Did we spend about 500?
- Please.

1117
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,389
(There won't be more penalty takers
if they spent 1,000 dollars.)

1118
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,829
You didn't even spend half of it.

1119
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:15,869
- Goodness.
- You have 687 dollars left.

1120
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,369
(Remaining balance: 687 dollars)

1121
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:19,239
- After all that?
- Oh, 687 dollars?

1122
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,469
I think I spent about 55 dollars.

1123
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:23,440
(Unlike the members who spent about
half of the 110 dollars they got...)

1124
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,909
Why do I have 100 dollars?

1125
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:26,639
I didn't even spend ten dollars.

1126
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:28,909
- How much do you have?
- I still have 100 dollars.

1127
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,809
- What did you do?
- Hey, what were you doing?

1128
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,420
(Daniel only spent 1.5 dollars.)

1129
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,920
- How can you bring back 100?
- But 100 dollars...

1130
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,989
But we started out with 110 dollars.

1131
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:38,019
By the way, Daniel,

1132
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:40,320
how could you bring back 100 dollars
when we gave you 110?

1133
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,219
Jae Seok, you spent 680 dollars?
You spent a lot!

1134
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,659
- No, you...
- I just...

1135
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:45,559
- Didn't we have 680 dollars left?
- We did.

1136
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:46,800
- That's what we have left.
- Oh, it's what we have left.

1137
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,630
Still, we spent about 400 dollars.

1138
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,530
- You're so positive.
- So, now,

1139
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,900
according to the rules
of how many get the penalty,

1140
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,269
- you're up to three people already.
- Oh, my.

1141
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:55,539
- It's already three people?
- Gosh, then...

1142
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:58,469
- So, 3 out of 9 will get it.
- That's decided already.

1143
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,480
It's decided?

1144
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,940
We couldn't spend money before,

1145
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,409
- I know.
- so we were always saving.

1146
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:03,510
But when they said we could spend,
it was hard to do so.

1147
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,880
- It was hard.
- The time was...

1148
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,480
The members who will be penalized...

1149
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,119
will be chosen
through a penalty ball draw.

1150
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,289
We'll decide which members
will write their names...

1151
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:14,190
- on the balls through missions.
- Got it.

1152
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,829
The first mission is called...

1153
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:18,059
How to Avoid the Sword.

1154
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:19,800
- It's an individual game...
- An individual game.

1155
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,530
where three players
sit on a chair...

1156
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,769
and try to stand up as they dodge...

1157
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:25,739
the swinging sword behind them.

1158
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,199
The person who stands up
the most times wins,

1159
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,210
and that person doesn't get
their name in a penalty ball.

1160
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:32,170
Second place gets their name
in one penalty ball,

1161
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,079
and last place gets
two penalty balls added.

1162
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,949
Also, the attacker...

1163
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:40,820
can just swing the sword 20 times
at any time they want.

1164
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,690
It's an individual game.

1165
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,789
- Come in.
- An individual game?

1166
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:45,219
- Yes, let's go.
- I'll sit down.

1167
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,159
Who will swing the sword?

1168
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,690
- Anyone can volunteer to do it.
- Oh, anyone can volunteer?

1169
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,489
- Let's recommend someone.
- This doesn't affect the score.

1170
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,030
Anyone who seems like
they'd swing it well...

1171
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,260
Shall we go with Jong Kook?

1172
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,360
- Okay.
- All right.

1173
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:56,670
- I will...
- Then, Daniel should sit.

1174
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,699
- Should I sit?
- It's fine.

1175
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,099
(They hand him a soft sponge sword.)

1176
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:01,900
- Let's have one of the women.
- Right.

1177
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,510
Ah Young, you should go. Here.

1178
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,909
- Ah Young should go.
- Will you sit there?

1179
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:06,579
- Me too.
- Ah Young should sit in the middle.

1180
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:08,010
- In the middle.
- We all have to go anyway.

1181
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,980
My goodness.

1182
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,619
- What was that?
- Hey, this combination...

1183
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,179
- What is this?
- By coincidence?

1184
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,650
- What is this?
- What does this mean?

1185
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,789
(Catfish and Hairtail)

1186
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,289
Gosh, that scared me.

1187
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,000
(The executioner shatters the mood.)

1188
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,099
Like that.

1189
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,530
- Ready.
- That's scary.

1190
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,800
I shouldn't have tied my hair
in a bun.

1191
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,940
It's just like playing Whac-A-Mole.

1192
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,110
- Ready.
- Here I go.

1193
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,039
(The game starts!)

1194
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,110
(They were hit.)

1195
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:46,880
Hang on. Gosh, that hurt.

1196
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,019
(Executioner Kim is ruthless.)

1197
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:00,530
(Big Eyes and Se Chan are
dodging the sword quite well.)

1198
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,829
It's so scary!

1199
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,199
(Moaning in pain)

1200
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,239
(He gets whacked again as soon as
he gets back in his seat.)

1201
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:12,909
(Daniel has no skills
and keeps getting hit.)

1202
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,579
He's swinging so low.

1203
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,150
Wait a minute. This is...

1204
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,780
What is this? Hang on.

1205
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,380
- He's getting hit every time.
- What is this?

1206
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,719
He's just getting hit
the whole time.

1207
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:25,750
- What is this?
- It's too low.

1208
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,190
- What is this?
- It's too low.

1209
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:28,420
I swung all 20 times, right?

1210
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:30,389
- Daniel, why did you...
- Daniel and Ah Young got hit a lot.

1211
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:31,860
The number of times
you successfully stood was...

1212
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,460
five times for Se Chan,

1213
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,260
- four times for Ah Young,
- That was a lot.

1214
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,730
and once for Daniel.

1215
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,369
- What? Just once?
- Yes.

1216
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:40,800
- You kept getting hit.
- He was...

1217
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,809
- being hit the whole time.
- So, you get two penalty balls.

1218
00:41:42,809 --> 00:41:44,969
- Ah Young 1, and Se Chan 0.
- I don't get any?

1219
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:47,179
- I don't get any!
- Wait a minute.

1220
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:49,510
- I stood up a lot. Why is it once?
- You got hit every time.

1221
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,110
- You got hit.
- You were being hit the whole time.

1222
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,019
- Oh, we can't get hit?
- You can't get hit.

1223
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:55,719
- How do you dodge that?
- You have to dodge it.

1224
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:56,750
But how?

1225
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,820
All right, then. I'll go.

1226
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,119
(The players for Round 2
are Jae Seok...)

1227
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,989
- You should go.
- Me?

1228
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:03,789
- Food fighter.
- Nice, food fighter.

1229
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:04,989
- The middle seat is the best.
- This is...

1230
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,059
- Oh, really?
- We're being considerate, you know?

1231
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:07,900
- You don't get hit a lot here.
- Thank you.

1232
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,730
- Ready.
- Is Jong Kook attacking again?

1233
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,940
- It's Jong Kook again.
- All right. Let's go.

1234
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:14,469
Jae Seok,
you have to stand up with force.

1235
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:16,309
(The game starts!)

1236
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,610
(Screaming)

1237
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,679
(The moles start getting whacked.)

1238
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:26,750
You're all getting hit.

1239
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:29,420
(Simply cheerful)

1240
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,889
(He hits someone
with every swing again.)

1241
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:34,389
- That must hurt.
- Don't fall backward.

1242
00:42:34,389 --> 00:42:36,760
(Mole Yu is still standing up
without getting hit half the time.)

1243
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,230
She got hit every time.

1244
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:42,030
(Meanwhile,
Mole Ye Eun keeps getting whacked.)

1245
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,469
- You can't bow down.
- Don't bow down.

1246
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,599
That's hilarious.

1247
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:46,369
- That hurts so much.
- Please.

1248
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,369
(Mole Seok Sam is doing
unexpectedly well.)

1249
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:51,510
You're doing well.

1250
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,510
(Mole Seok Sam is
doing unexpectedly well.)

1251
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,579
- You can't bow down.
- Don't bow down.

1252
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:54,940
- Don't bow down.
- Okay.

1253
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:56,750
Gosh, I'm scared.

1254
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,710
(Groaning)

1255
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,019
(Hitting Ye Eun right in the temple)

1256
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,889
Gosh, I'm scared.

1257
00:43:04,889 --> 00:43:06,159
(The game is over.)

1258
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,590
- I think I did pretty well.
- Okay.

1259
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:11,090
- Jae Seok stood up seven times.
- That was a lot.

1260
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,130
Really?

1261
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,099
- Ye Eun stood up five times.
- What?

1262
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,730
- And Seok Jin...
- Yes?

1263
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:20,300
You stood up 11 times.

1264
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,469
(The old mole successfully stood up
a whopping 11 times.)

1265
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:23,440
- You won't get any penalty balls.
- Yes!

1266
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,869
- But how...
- She gets two...

1267
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,239
- and you get one.
- No way.

1268
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,780
He got hit a lot.

1269
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,849
He got hit.

1270
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:31,780
Ye Eun got hit first...

1271
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,050
- and that blocked the sword...
- Right.

1272
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,079
and that blocked the sword
from getting to him.

1273
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,880
- I see.
- Yes, Ye Eun got hit for me.

1274
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,590
You protected him in that game.

1275
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,389
Seok Jin, she says I protected you.

1276
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,860
I know. Thanks for that.

1277
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:44,489
(Final round:
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Haha)

1278
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:45,630
Look at him do squats.

1279
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,300
He's thinking of this
as a squat session.

1280
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,329
(Mole Kook is already worked up.)

1281
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,599
- So...
- Go, Daniel.

1282
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:51,030
- Are they around here?
- Yes.

1283
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,800
Get ready...

1284
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:59,309
(The clumsy man
is swinging aimlessly.)

1285
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:01,039
Daniel.

1286
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:02,280
(Swinging without
making any contact)

1287
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,250
Daniel, you impress me.

1288
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:08,750
(His swinging is nothing like
Executioner Kim's.)

1289
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,389
(Thanks to that,
Mole Song easily scored points.)

1290
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,030
Haha isn't getting hit
thanks to being short.

1291
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:19,699
A bit more.

1292
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:21,230
(Mole Ha is benefiting
from his short legs.)

1293
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,230
Check out Jong Kook.

1294
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,300
- Bring it!
- He's focused.

1295
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:29,409
(Even the camera can't keep up.)

1296
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:31,940
- Oh, dear.
- Check out Jong Kook.

1297
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:34,980
(Fast-paced squats)

1298
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,980
What is that?

1299
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,780
(Groaning!)

1300
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,650
Haha got hit really hard.

1301
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:44,389
(Game over)

1302
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:45,489
I couldn't see a thing.

1303
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:46,889
- I was hit right in the face.
- No way.

1304
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,889
Are you all right?

1305
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,090
Hey.

1306
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,059
- Eleven times for Ji Hyo.
- No way.

1307
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:54,559
Fifteen times for Haha.

1308
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:55,900
And Jong Kook...

1309
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,929
- stood up 26 times.
- What?

1310
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,039
No way.

1311
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:03,110
The members who received
two additional penalty balls...

1312
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:05,940
were Daniel, Ye Eun, and Ji Hyo.

1313
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,940
Ah Young, Jae Seok, and Haha
received one each.

1314
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,949
Got it.

1315
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:11,449
- Okay, that was hilarious.
- Right.

1316
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:12,610
Zero. We got none.

1317
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,449
The next question will be...

1318
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,050
for men and women in their 30s.

1319
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,489
- In their 30s?
- I like that age group.

1320
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:21,260
- Men and women in their 30s.
- That'll be easy.

1321
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,360
Here's the question.
"What do you want to do..."

1322
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,260
"to change the mood in spring?"

1323
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,400
Shopping!

1324
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,670
- We'll get shopping.
- Actually...

1325
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,500
They'll want a haircut for sure.

1326
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,139
They'll want a haircut or a dye job.

1327
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:37,010
- We need to ask it wisely.
- For a change of pace.

1328
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,010
- They might want to eat something.
- That's right.

1329
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,280
- To be in a better mood?
- He's right.

1330
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,539
This is a great place
to ask the question...

1331
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:43,309
- because it's lunch hour.
- Exactly.

1332
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:45,150
There are many things
to eat around here.

1333
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,119
We need to pick an adequate amount.

1334
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,320
- Let it be a small amount.
- Daniel should do it.

1335
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,050
- Should I do it?
- It can't be a large amount.

1336
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,050
I'll pick.

1337
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,719
- It can't be too much.
- How much do you want?

1338
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:55,719
- A smaller amount?
- The smallest amount is 30 dollars.

1339
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:56,730
- The smallest is 30 dollars?
- The largest is 1,000 dollars.

1340
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,230
- We can't have 30 dollars.
- The largest is 1,000 dollars.

1341
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,599
- Around 200 dollars.
- So 200 or 300 dollars.

1342
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:02,300
- Let it be 300.
- Did you say 300 dollars?

1343
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,300
- Good.
- Got it.

1344
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,699
(Allowance Envelope Status:
1,000, 700, 200, 70, 30 dollars)

1345
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:05,969
- Okay.
- Let's see.

1346
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,469
- Please.
- That's the one he picked?

1347
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,170
- No way.
- Really?

1348
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,639
- How much is it?
- How much is it?

1349
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,880
We got 700 dollars.

1350
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,610
- Shopping will do the trick.
- That's a lot.

1351
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,280
- The amount you must spend...
- That's not too bad.

1352
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,050
is 700 dollars.

1353
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,550
That's a lot.

1354
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:23,190
- Did we get 700 dollars?
- I think it'll be okay...

1355
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,550
since we're spending money
on what'll change the mood.

1356
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,820
Well, 700 dollars is a lot.

1357
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,420
- Here you go.
- Someone is likely to say shopping.

1358
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,360
That could happen
since it's about changing the mood.

1359
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,559
This is to change the mood.

1360
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,960
Do we have to go to a salon
if that's what they say?

1361
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,099
Haha, dye your hair.

1362
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:39,500
But I already dyed my hair.

1363
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,699
Please take us to Apgujeong.

1364
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:42,369
- Okay, Apgujeong.
- Apgujeong?

1365
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:43,409
- Nice.
- Goodness.

1366
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:45,309
Check that out.
That looks delicious.

1367
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,380
- That looks good.
- A master of 30 years...

1368
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,510
poured his soul into his jjamppong.

1369
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,250
- Gosh.
- I'd love to have some.

1370
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,909
- Jjamppong.
- I'm hungry.

1371
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,219
It would be nice to ask this
to a customer leaving.

1372
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:57,619
"What would be good to eat
on a day like this?"

1373
00:46:57,619 --> 00:46:59,420
- Since it's spring.
- Ah Young, what's your favorite?

1374
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,690
- I'd love some jjamppong.
- Me?

1375
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,929
I like dishes with a broth.

1376
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:04,289
- A broth?
- That has changed for me.

1377
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:06,059
Which do you like more?
Korean or Western cuisine?

1378
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:07,760
- I'm more into Korean food.
- Korean?

1379
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,400
(Next to Big Eyes and Beanpole)

1380
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,570
Fish or meat?

1381
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:13,570
(The supporting male lead
can only look at them.)

1382
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:15,800
- Meat.
- Meat? Me too.

1383
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,309
- What do you like the most?
- Me?

1384
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:19,070
Ah Young is done with Se Chan.

1385
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,280
- That's not it.
- I know.

1386
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,309
- Daniel keeps flirting with her.
- The two...

1387
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:24,050
are engaging in a lot of small talk.

1388
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,949
- But...
- He keeps flirting with her.

1389
00:47:25,949 --> 00:47:28,219
- He keeps flirting with her.
- I didn't think...

1390
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:31,119
- I'd get this lucky on Running Man.
- That's not it.

1391
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,360
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

1392
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:35,190
You can't miss out
on the talk we do on the bus.

1393
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,360
- Daniel keeps flirting with her,
- No way.

1394
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,260
- and there's no room for me.
- It's not that.

1395
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,760
- He's asking what she likes.
- What else do you want to know?

1396
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,570
- We're curious too.
- I asked her everything.

1397
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,130
- She likes meat.
- And?

1398
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,070
- Yes, I like meat.
- She has an older brother.

1399
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,099
- She's the youngest.
- That's right.

1400
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:49,340
What do you prefer?
The mountain or the sea?

1401
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:52,110
- One, two, three. The sea.
- One, two, three. The sea.

1402
00:47:52,809 --> 00:47:53,880
- The sea.
- The sea.

1403
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:55,809
- What about you?
- I like the mountain.

1404
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:56,880
Do you both like the sea?

1405
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,949
- Do you prefer the mountain?
- Yes.

1406
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,079
Those who said "sea"
should hold hands.

1407
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:02,780
(Haha isn't hiding
his status as a wingman.)

1408
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,789
- Is he kidding me?
- I can't believe him.

1409
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,059
Why would you even suggest that?

1410
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:10,030
- This is Running Man.
- Actually, he must be bored.

1411
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,289
You know what happens
when he butts in.

1412
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,400
- He ruins the romance.
- It ends right there.

1413
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,460
It's over.

1414
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,030
After that episode aired,
my friends said this.

1415
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,070
- Go on.
- Even my brother said it.

1416
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:21,469
They were like,
"Se Chan seems decent."

1417
00:48:21,469 --> 00:48:22,699
- Exactly.
- That's right.

1418
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,409
They were like,
"Se Chan seems decent."

1419
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:26,340
- He's great.
- Men vouch for him.

1420
00:48:26,409 --> 00:48:27,610
My friends said that too.

1421
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,309
- Even my friends.
- Guys know how great he is.

1422
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,280
From the side, she looks like IU.

1423
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,719
- What?
- Gosh, no.

1424
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:34,780
From the side, she looks like IU.

1425
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,590
- What?
- Gosh, no.

1426
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:37,849
Come on!

1427
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:40,889
- You look like IU from the side.
- That's hardly the case.

1428
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:43,659
- Daniel, you're a player.
- She looks like IU from the side.

1429
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,559
He won't stop flirting with her.

1430
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:48,159
- That's nonstop flirting.
- Do you like IU's music?

1431
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:49,159
You should flirt with her too.

1432
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,929
- From this angle, you're No-U.
- You're No-U.

1433
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:53,539
- You're a no.
- That's who she resembles.

1434
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:54,570
It's not just Ah Young...

1435
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,000
- who looks like IU.
- Exactly.

1436
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,039
Hey, Aebong.

1437
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:59,010
- That's right.
- She looks like Aebong.

1438
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,039
- She looks like Aebong.
- She's Jang Won Young.

1439
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:02,579
- I'm Jang Won Young of SNL.
- Jang Won Young?

1440
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:03,610
- Jang Won Young.
- Jang Won Young?

1441
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,179
- That's who you resemble?
- Only on SNL.

1442
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:06,880
- Right.
- You mean Seo Jang Hoon, right?

1443
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:08,980
(Oh, Seo Jang Hoon!)

1444
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,449
- Seo Jang Hoon of SNL.
- I see.

1445
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:12,349
- No wonder she's tall.
- Seo Jang Hoon.

1446
00:49:12,889 --> 00:49:14,019
Seo Jang Hoon?

1447
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:16,590
I was
on "Men on a Mission" recently.

1448
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,429
You won't believe
how tall Jang Hoon is.

1449
00:49:18,429 --> 00:49:19,960
- Of course. Theirs are similar.
- What's with him and height?

1450
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,199
He's as tall as a bus.

1451
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:22,760
Ye Eun is just as tall.

1452
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,130
They're both big eaters too.

1453
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,400
Show him how you eat this.

1454
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:28,369
(Asking her to eat gloves)

1455
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:29,840
You're messing with me again.

1456
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,409
- Go ahead.
- You're messing with me.

1457
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:34,010
- Did you hear that?
- You should know...

1458
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:36,139
- that Ye Eun used to be skinny.
- I mean...

1459
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,880
- Hey!
- Sorry about that.

1460
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:40,480
You're only saying that
because you lost weight.

1461
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,320
- Don't forget how you were a frog.
- A frog?

1462
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:45,750
(Don't forget how you were a frog.)

1463
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,320
- It's tadpole.
- Isn't it tadpole?

1464
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,460
It's tadpole!

1465
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,730
- Tadpole.
- Tadpole.

1466
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,059
It's not frog.

1467
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:53,030
- Frog?
- Don't forget how you were a frog.

1468
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:55,230
So much for sounding charismatic
for the first time.

1469
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,900
You're hilarious.

1470
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,900
- You're hilarious.
- Ye Eun, come on.

1471
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,099
- I can't believe you.
- It's tadpole.

1472
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:02,440
"Don't forget how you were a frog."

1473
00:50:02,739 --> 00:50:04,239
Take your own advice.

1474
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:06,809
- Don't forget how you were a frog.
- I should really lose some weight.

1475
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,380
I haven't been
to Apgujeong in a while.

1476
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,809
- Those in their 30s, right?
- Yes, in their 30s.

1477
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,250
Men or women.

1478
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,550
A mood changer for spring.

1479
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:14,880
What do you want to do
to change the mood in spring?

1480
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,989
- What do you want to do?
- Spring is the keyword.

1481
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:18,349
- I think...
- It'll definitely be shopping.

1482
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,719
- But...
- Someone will say shopping.

1483
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:21,289
Someone will say shopping.

1484
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:23,289
A woman would answer
a change in hair color.

1485
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,590
- Exactly. Dying hair.
- Hair dyeing.

1486
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:26,900
What about a sauna?

1487
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,630
- What then?
- Do we have to go to one?

1488
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,170
- We have to.
- We'll go to a dry sauna.

1489
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:32,730
We can buy things to eat
at a dry sauna.

1490
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,039
- Of course.
- Exactly.

1491
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:35,440
- A dry sauna isn't so bad.
- Isn't it good?

1492
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,809
Let's see.

1493
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:38,469
We need to trust our instincts.

1494
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,210
(Ah Young has a duck
for some reason.)

1495
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:45,250
- Isn't it taking up a hand?
- It's going on my shoulder.

1496
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:47,949
(The plushie Se Chan gave to her
that he won from a claw machine)

1497
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:49,320
- What's this?
- I won it.

1498
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,550
Goodness.

1499
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,489
- What's going on?
- Is this romance...

1500
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:53,619
- that's blooming?
- He gave it to me.

1501
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:54,789
(Gum Guy found an opening
to make a move.)

1502
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,989
It was a gift from you.

1503
00:50:57,059 --> 00:50:58,889
(That's why Ah Young's carrying
around a duck as big as her.)

1504
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,929
It's so cute.

1505
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,760
- Is it your real name?
- It is.

1506
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,570
- Is Ji Ye Eun your real name?
- Yes.

1507
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,269
I can't believe you two.

1508
00:51:07,269 --> 00:51:09,769
These two are filming
"Single's Inferno."

1509
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:11,239
You've got to be kidding me.

1510
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,510
- They don't care about the game.
- That's not it.

1511
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,809
- Are you kidding me?
- Stop it with that.

1512
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:18,949
- Daniel, you...
- He's unbelievable.

1513
00:51:18,949 --> 00:51:20,750
That's not it.
It's a misunderstanding.

1514
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,480
(Mr. Choi Daniel is making
things weird on Running Man.)

1515
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,719
It's a misunderstanding.

1516
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:25,750
He's Mr. Catfish.

1517
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,059
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Mr. Catfish?

1518
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:28,289
He's Mr. Catfish.

1519
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:30,230
- He's trouble.
- Mr. Catfish.

1520
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,260
Actually...

1521
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,329
Can't we take a group photo here?

1522
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:35,329
Let's gather around.

1523
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,170
One, two, three.

1524
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:41,840
This is inferno.

1525
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,409
Yes, this is inferno.

1526
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,210
Paradise and inferno.

1527
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,409
They remodeled the place.

1528
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:49,340
Check out those
nice clothes up there.

1529
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,380
They look expensive.

1530
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,349
We can buy one each.

1531
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:54,050
We could spend all our money there.

1532
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,420
I'd love to eat something.

1533
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,349
There's a place
with delicious salted butter rolls.

1534
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:59,289
- I...
- They all want something different.

1535
00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:00,559
Someone in their 30s.

1536
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:01,690
- Wait.
- Look.

1537
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:04,059
(Jae Seok spots a couple.)

1538
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:05,059
Are you in your 30s?

1539
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:07,030
- Who is it?
- Hello.

1540
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,300
- They're in their 30s.
- Hello.

1541
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,460
- What was that?
- Wait, churros?

1542
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:10,869
- What was that?
- Wait, churros?

1543
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,800
- Do you know them?
- Ask for a bite.

1544
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,340
- Ask for a bite.
- Just one bite.

1545
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,000
- Can we have a bite?
- Can we have a bite?

1546
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,710
- Just a bite.
- Just a bite.

1547
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,369
I'd love some.

1548
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:20,679
(Being hungry
is driving Ji Bajie crazy.)

1549
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,139
- Where are you headed?
- Are you on a date?

1550
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:24,710
(They were on a date.)

1551
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,750
- Are you on a date?
- Yes.

1552
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,550
Are you perhaps in your 30s?

1553
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,550
- Yes.
- Hey, we're on point.

1554
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,489
- This is great. Are you on a date?
- Yes.

1555
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,659
We'd like to ask you
a simple question.

1556
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:38,559
- It's cold today.
- I know.

1557
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,400
- Is this all right?
- Yes, this is fine.

1558
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,059
- Can you be on camera?
- Yes.

1559
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,329
- The two of you...
- Yes?

1560
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,800
We're sorry to interrupt your date.

1561
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,440
- It's all right.
- It's early in the day.

1562
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,170
- Are you going to finish that?
- Yes.

1563
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,239
Would you like one?

1564
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,039
Would you like one?

1565
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:55,039
Ye Eun would like a bite.

1566
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:56,780
Ye Eun says it's delicious
and would like one.

1567
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,210
- Just a bite!
- Stop. You're embarrassing us.

1568
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,420
- Ye Eun.
- Just a bite.

1569
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,679
- I'm sorry about this.
- Go ahead.

1570
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,849
- I'm only joking.
- We're sorry.

1571
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:04,989
- I was kidding.
- Have one.

1572
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:06,449
- Ye Eun, have one.
- Go ahead.

1573
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,590
- Have one.
- You can have one.

1574
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:08,760
- Go ahead.
- Are you sure I can have it?

1575
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,789
- Of course.
- Here.

1576
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:10,960
Would you like to take a photo?

1577
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:12,559
"Would you like to take a photo?"

1578
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,159
What do you have planned
for your date today?

1579
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,030
We're off to Songdo Central Park.

1580
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,500
- Are you off to Songdo?
- Central Park?

1581
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,800
- For a pick-me-up?
- Lucky you.

1582
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,300
- Songdo?
- Shopping is the best.

1583
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,769
- Songdo Central Park.
- Are you sure I can have this?

1584
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:25,010
Yes, go ahead.

1585
00:53:25,409 --> 00:53:26,409
(Dipping it in chocolate sauce)

1586
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:27,980
- Hey, what are you...
- Why?

1587
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,139
(Thief Food Fighter even takes
chocolate while she's at it.)

1588
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,150
- Hey, what are you...
- Why?

1589
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:32,349
- Stop dipping!
- Hey, that's enough!

1590
00:53:32,349 --> 00:53:34,179
She keeps dipping it in there.

1591
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:35,780
(Munching)

1592
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,489
- Food Fighter.
- She's seriously...

1593
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:40,059
- Stop dipping!
- Hey, that's enough!

1594
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,789
- You're going to Songdo today.
- Yes.

1595
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:44,130
What are you planning to do there?

1596
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,289
- We'll walk around Central Park...
- Yes.

1597
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:48,099
- and after that, we don't...
- We might go to an outlet mall.

1598
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,929
- An outlet!
- An outlet mall!

1599
00:53:49,929 --> 00:53:52,599
- We might go to an outlet mall.
- An outlet mall!

1600
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:54,699
- Nice!
- That would lift your mood.

1601
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:56,500
- Shopping sounds great.
- Shopping. Nice.

1602
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,969
- Outlet malls are great.
- Nice.

1603
00:53:57,969 --> 00:54:00,179
- There's a big mall in Songdo.
- All right.

1604
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:01,440
- Then, let's...
- That would be so great.

1605
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,809
- Let me ask you this.
- Ask them.

1606
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:05,309
"What would you like to do
to lift your mood this spring?"

1607
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:06,719
(To men and women in their 30s)

1608
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:08,980
(What would you like to do
to lift your mood this spring?)

1609
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,820
- Anything is fine.
- Don't pressure them.

1610
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,920
- Where would you like to go?
- Anything is fine.

1611
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,059
(What would you like to do
to lift your mood this spring?)

1612
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:17,860
I'd like to put a picnic mat down
at the Han River Park...

1613
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,260
(The Han River Park?)

1614
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,829
- The Han River...
- Oh, go to the Han River...

1615
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:23,800
Hey, how will we go to the Han River
in this cold weather?

1616
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,900
- What are you talking about?
- How will that lift your mood?

1617
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,869
When we actually ask the question...

1618
00:54:27,869 --> 00:54:29,039
No.

1619
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:30,369
That makes no sense.

1620
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:32,010
We have 700 dollars.

1621
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,780
- Be happy.
- Have a fun date.

1622
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,480
- Thank you for the churros.
- Thank you.

1623
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,079
- We can do it there too.
- Bye!

1624
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:40,150
Then, are we going to the Han River?

1625
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,849
- But we could go to the Han River...
- Yes?

1626
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:44,519
- Ramyeon?
- and eat ramyeon.

1627
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:46,519
- How will we spend 700 dollars?
- How can we spend all 700?

1628
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:49,320
Jae Seok, let's go to
the convenience store there...

1629
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,860
and buy all the batteries
and tissues they have.

1630
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,789
- Let's get going first.
- Batteries, tissues,

1631
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,800
- Right.
- and box cutters. Buy everything.

1632
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,559
- All the daily essentials.
- At the convenience store,

1633
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:57,829
buy everything you'd need at home.

1634
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:59,630
Hey, let's fly kites.
Everybody should fly a kite.

1635
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:01,800
When it's this cold...

1636
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,909
Okay, let's go spend money
at the Han River.

1637
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:06,980
I mean, I like the Han River,
but it's too cold now.

1638
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,579
- It's way too cold.
- It's so cold.

1639
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:10,309
- My nose is running.
- It's so cold.

1640
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:12,449
I hear the wind chill is minus 10°C.

1641
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,420
It got so cold today.

1642
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,880
There's a convenience store!

1643
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,920
We have to raid
the convenience store. We can do it.

1644
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,650
- Gosh, it's so cold.
- It's so windy.

1645
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,219
- It'll be so cold.
- Hey, what will we do?

1646
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:23,889
We're in trouble. If he had just
not mentioned the picnic mat...

1647
00:55:23,889 --> 00:55:25,059
"Just not mentioned."

1648
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:26,860
- It's so cold, right? Are you okay?
- It is, right?

1649
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,260
No, it's too windy.

1650
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,400
- Right?
- Yes.

1651
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,369
- Hey, this is...
- We have to put down...

1652
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,500
- a picnic mat here.
- What will we do?

1653
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,639
Put it down right in front of
the convenience store.

1654
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:34,769
- We don't have time.
- Right.

1655
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:35,969
We should buy mats.

1656
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,369
We should put it down quickly
and eat fast.

1657
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:39,110
- All right. Let's go.
- Gosh, it's cold.

1658
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,940
That's the place.
They have good food.

1659
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,409
- First, the money. Who has it?
- Buy all the expensive stuff.

1660
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:44,679
Who received the money earlier?

1661
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:46,349
- Hello.
- We have to hurry.

1662
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,019
- Hey, I will...
- Let's revive...

1663
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:49,519
- the economy!
- The economy!

1664
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:50,920
- Hello.
- We could recharge our phones.

1665
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,019
Hello.

1666
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,150
- One moment.
- Recharge.

1667
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:54,360
- Hello.
- I want one of those.

1668
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,190
Oh, I should have a snack.

1669
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:57,659
Who will cook the ramyeon?

1670
00:55:57,659 --> 00:55:59,260
Gosh, this looks tasty.

1671
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,360
Nice. Oh, yes!

1672
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,500
Ferrero Rocher. I'll buy that one.

1673
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,699
This is insane. This is so good.

1674
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:07,769
- What is it?
- It's so tasty.

1675
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,469
Yakgwa is good too.

1676
00:56:10,269 --> 00:56:13,269
Chicken breast. Barbecue flavor.

1677
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:15,579
(Kim Muscles doesn't veer far
from expectations.)

1678
00:56:15,579 --> 00:56:17,110
Chicken breast.

1679
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:20,849
- Oh, what? Black? Squid!
- We should buy some milk too.

1680
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,820
- Hey, this squid... My gosh.
- Why would you buy milk?

1681
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,849
(The reason why Kim Bag is
so excited is...)

1682
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:31,559
(The staff didn't allow him to buy
a single chicken breast easily.)

1683
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:36,130
(He ate a cold chicken breast
even as he took a penalty.)

1684
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:39,900
(They must buy a lot of stuff
in order to avoid the penalty!)

1685
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,739
(Kim Bag is happy.)

1686
00:56:42,739 --> 00:56:44,670
All right. What else is there?

1687
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:47,579
Keep your stuff in your baskets.

1688
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:48,579
(Meanwhile,
Jae Seok is totally focused.)

1689
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,480
- Yes, get it if you want to eat it.
- Chicken!

1690
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,280
Which ramyeon should I get?
At the Han River, you must have...

1691
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,619
Should I have Ansungtangmyeon
or Neoguri?

1692
00:56:57,619 --> 00:56:59,019
I'll have Shin Ramyeon...

1693
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:00,519
- because it's cold outside.
- Okay.

1694
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:02,090
Hey, we should each
have some ramyeon.

1695
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,190
- The ramyeon is over there.
- A serving each.

1696
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:04,289
Go ahead. We can do that.

1697
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:05,730
- Hey, this is...
- Hurry up. Ramyeon.

1698
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,829
Which ramyeon should I have?

1699
00:57:06,829 --> 00:57:08,829
- I'll just have the original.
- I like the spicy one.

1700
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:11,000
- I want Ansungtangmyeon.
- I'll have Neoguri.

1701
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:13,269
- I should buy hangover drinks.
- Chargers.

1702
00:57:13,269 --> 00:57:15,199
- I really need this stuff.
- You need this.

1703
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:16,300
- Do you drink a lot?
- Yes.

1704
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,469
- I'm soaked in alcohol these days.
- Hey, get some gimbap.

1705
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:20,579
- What will you buy?
- Me?

1706
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:22,380
- I'm soaked in alcohol these days?
- Really?

1707
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:24,050
Can I buy two of these?

1708
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:25,750
- Hangover drinks.
- Hey, Ye Eun.

1709
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:26,750
Gosh, I drink...

1710
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:27,849
How many hangover drinks...

1711
00:57:27,849 --> 00:57:29,380
These only cost about three dollars.

1712
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,719
These days,
I'm just soaked in alcohol.

1713
00:57:34,059 --> 00:57:35,690
I can't live without alcohol
these days.

1714
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,590
Gosh, you're really something.

1715
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:40,929
Short-sleeved T-shirts.
I'll wear these someday.

1716
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:43,400
- What is it?
- Short-sleeved T-shirts.

1717
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,099
- I should keep some in the car.
- What is it? T-shirts?

1718
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:46,230
Yes.

1719
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:50,239
(Se Chan, the daily essentials
maniac, was always being scolded.)

1720
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:53,369
(Even for a toilet brush
that cost 2 dollars...)

1721
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:56,010
(You're going to pee standing up
anyway. Why are you sensitive?)

1722
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,750
You're going to pee standing up anyway.
Why are you sensitive?

1723
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:01,820
(He became upset
for being scolded left and right.)

1724
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,050
- An inner shirt.
- Short-sleeved shirts are nice.

1725
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:05,820
- Yes, you should get one.
- Let's buy one.

1726
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,320
- This is the best section.
- It is.

1727
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,690
- I should get one of these.
- Waterproof bandages. Seok Jin.

1728
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,190
- What?
- It's good to keep these at home.

1729
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:12,230
- What is it?
- Waterproof bandages.

1730
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,699
- I want one too.
- They're really good.

1731
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,000
- They're useful if you have them.
- No, they're really great.

1732
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,699
- You never know what might happen.
- Right.

1733
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,269
This is nice. How nice is this?

1734
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,800
Batteries.

1735
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,869
- I need some hair wax too.
- Did you buy gimbap?

1736
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,070
Oh, nice.

1737
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:26,070
- Oh, double zipper bags.
- Who wants chicken?

1738
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:27,510
- We should pay at once.
- I'll take this.

1739
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:30,079
Even if you buy this,
it won't be enough.

1740
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,909
It won't be enough
even after you buy all of this.

1741
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:33,280
- We should try...
- The first round of payments.

1742
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,480
No, you should still try.

1743
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,119
Eating will also be included
in the given time.

1744
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,949
- All right.
- Hey, let's get going.

1745
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:40,889
- Let's hurry. We don't have time.
- Buy some bread too.

1746
00:58:40,889 --> 00:58:43,489
Then, we should hurry up.

1747
00:58:43,489 --> 00:58:45,289
Shouldn't we buy
about two picnic mats?

1748
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:47,500
- Oh, nice.
- Right? We should take two.

1749
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,829
These are egg-shaped jellies.
I love these so much.

1750
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:51,000
(They hurry to buy
the essentials for a picnic.)

1751
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,230
This is tasty.

1752
00:58:52,469 --> 00:58:54,099
Should we have some gimbap too?

1753
00:58:54,099 --> 00:58:56,099
- Gimbap will be good with ramyeon.
- Shall we do that?

1754
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,039
- We should hurry up and check out.
- Okay.

1755
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:00,610
- We should pay.
- If you're done, go and check out.

1756
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:03,309
I'll pay for these first...
No, I mean...

1757
00:59:03,309 --> 00:59:04,710
- Could you ring these up?
- And these too.

1758
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:07,280
- We need them bagged separately.
- Oh, okay.

1759
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,380
I was very conscientious
as I chose things to buy.

1760
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:10,690
I was being conscientious.

1761
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,190
I got things that I need at home.

1762
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:14,059
- These double zipper bags.
- Oh, zipper bags? My gosh.

1763
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:15,119
- Gloves.
- Rubber gloves.

1764
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,659
But where are the bowls
for the ramyeon?

1765
00:59:16,659 --> 00:59:17,829
They give them to us here.

1766
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:19,190
- They'll give them to us here.
- If we just pick the ramyeon...

1767
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:20,559
You can make it yourself.

1768
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:26,599
Gosh, mala newjin noodles...
This tteokbokki looks good.

1769
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,000
Oh, my. I have to go.

1770
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:32,070
The malatang looks good.

1771
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:35,309
(Ye Eun and Ah Young
are still shopping.)

1772
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:37,010
- Snacks? Oh, Homerun Balls.
- Hey.

1773
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:38,750
This one is too big.

1774
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,320
We have to eat it all
if we buy it, right?

1775
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,880
No, you can take it home.

1776
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,579
- Oh, really?
- You can take it. Look at this.

1777
00:59:44,389 --> 00:59:45,820
Ye Eun, you bought so much stuff.

1778
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,190
- Gosh, Concho.
- Sweet potato chips are good.

1779
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,460
Hey.

1780
00:59:50,659 --> 00:59:51,690
How many bowls...

1781
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:52,789
- of malatang did you get?
- Gosh, Ye Eun...

1782
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,860
- Ye Eun has two baskets.
- She is...

1783
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,000
What happened?

1784
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,300
- No, I was just trying to...
- Okay, I had 62.58 dollars.

1785
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,300
- succeed in the mission.
- Okay, good job.

1786
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,400
But what if we go over our budget?

1787
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,300
If you go over budget,
you have to pay out of pocket.

1788
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,409
We won't go over the budget.

1789
01:00:04,409 --> 01:00:05,469
We might.

1790
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:06,610
- No.
- I don't think I'll go over.

1791
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:09,079
- Gosh, Ye Eun. You have two?
- But you bought so much stuff.

1792
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:13,010
If our budget is 700 dollars,
each person gets about 80 each.

1793
01:00:13,449 --> 01:00:16,019
(How much did they spend?)

1794
01:00:16,019 --> 01:00:17,250
- Gosh, this is madness.
- You have about...

1795
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:20,460
Hey, look.
I think I went over 50 dollars.

1796
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:21,659
Did you go over 50?

1797
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,820
(Snack hunter Haha's total is...)

1798
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:25,190
Okay, I had 62.58 dollars.

1799
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,190
Okay, good job.

1800
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:29,900
We won't go over the budget.
I doubt it. At a convenience store?

1801
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,269
- Each person should spend about...
- Around 100 dollars?

1802
01:00:32,269 --> 01:00:33,500
About 50 or 60 dollars...

1803
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,900
(Next, the cashier
rings up Ssaebssaeb.)

1804
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:39,570
(They're all daily essentials.)

1805
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,840
Three people have checked out.
The total is 292.19 dollars...

1806
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,210
- so far.
- That's not bad.

1807
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:45,809
(Above 290 dollars between 3 people)

1808
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:48,579
- My gosh. No.
- No, there are nine of us.

1809
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:49,719
Oh, there are nine of us.

1810
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:52,019
- All right.
- Hey, but...

1811
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:53,489
I'm glad we came
to a convenience store.

1812
01:00:53,489 --> 01:00:55,289
- I'll eat it now since I'm hungry.
- Oh, okay.

1813
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:57,789
Those 3 had over 290?
I think we should be fine.

1814
01:00:57,789 --> 01:00:59,590
- We might succeed. Let's see.
- Yes.

1815
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,559
Gosh,
I've gained another plastic bag.

1816
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:02,630
(Bag Man Jong Kook, 75.58 dollars)

1817
01:01:03,099 --> 01:01:04,099
Chestnuts.

1818
01:01:04,099 --> 01:01:06,469
(The last two
finally finish shopping.)

1819
01:01:07,469 --> 01:01:10,199
(They have three baskets
between them.)

1820
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:12,309
Ye Eun, perhaps... What?

1821
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:14,380
- We only have 100 dollars left.
- There's only 100 dollars left.

1822
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,780
- Oh, really?
- What?

1823
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:18,809
(There are only 100 dollars left
until they hit 700 dollars.)

1824
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:20,380
- What do I do?
- You have 100 left for both of you.

1825
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:22,250
I should take stuff out.
Should I take this out?

1826
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:26,789
- Take one out.
- Yes, one.

1827
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:29,989
- You got two hangover drinks?
- You're already...

1828
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:31,690
Oh, I'll take this out too.

1829
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:33,289
- About this much. Yes.
- You're leaving all of these?

1830
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:34,900
- You're taking all of those out?
- Yes, I'll take them out.

1831
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,670
But will this be 40 dollars?
You gave up malatang?

1832
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:40,199
- Yes. Really?
- Ye Eun, I gave up mala tteokbokki.

1833
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:41,900
- How about these? We have snacks.
- Yes, take these out.

1834
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,039
This one and ramyeon.

1835
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,409
- I have to eat this.
- I'll take these out.

1836
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,670
- All of these.
- Can I take these out too?

1837
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:47,409
Yes, I'm so hungry.

1838
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:51,050
- My hunger made me grab everything.
- Just the Neoguri and Chapaghetti.

1839
01:01:51,579 --> 01:01:53,480
Spending 700 dollars at
a convenience store isn't easy.

1840
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,750
No, it's not easy.

1841
01:01:56,019 --> 01:01:57,019
(Flapping)

1842
01:01:57,019 --> 01:01:59,719
- Hurry up and cook the ramyeon!
- I forgot to buy that.

1843
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:02,519
(A picnic at the Han River
in the middle of winter)

1844
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:04,190
Can all six of us sit on this?

1845
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,429
Kook Jong, just put it down
and open your ramyeon.

1846
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:08,460
- And just choose...
- Is there water here too?

1847
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,360
- Just choose the time and it works.
- It adds the water too?

1848
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,030
How does the water work?

1849
01:02:12,469 --> 01:02:13,469
Here.

1850
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:14,599
If we go there,
everything will be solved.

1851
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:15,739
No way.

1852
01:02:15,739 --> 01:02:17,210
- It even adds water?
- Is this your first time?

1853
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:20,409
- It's the new world to Jong Kook.
- He's like a caveman or something.

1854
01:02:20,409 --> 01:02:21,809
It even adds water.

1855
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:23,480
- We don't need to do it ourselves.
- No.

1856
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,710
- It's really tasty.
- It's intense.

1857
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,380
It even adds
the right amount of water.

1858
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:31,320
Seriously,
this machine is incredible.

1859
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,460
(He's eating cup noodles
by himself.)

1860
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,559
I'm glad I bought the packed lunch.
Let's eat it together.

1861
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:38,730
What's this?

1862
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:39,929
(What's this?)

1863
01:02:39,929 --> 01:02:41,829
Jjamppong? I see.

1864
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,760
It's the seasoned oil.

1865
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,500
Why did you buy cup noodles?

1866
01:02:45,699 --> 01:02:49,940
(A real caveman who doesn't even consider
using the machine)

1867
01:02:50,139 --> 01:02:52,170
- It looks so tasty.
- Mine is done.

1868
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:53,539
(Meanwhile,
the Han River ramyeon is done.)

1869
01:02:53,539 --> 01:02:55,110
- I'll go.
- Go.

1870
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,880
- I'll go.
- Gosh, it's cold.

1871
01:02:58,309 --> 01:02:59,880
My ears are freezing.

1872
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,349
(Flying over)

1873
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:05,420
Eat some gimbap too.

1874
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,090
- Jae Seok, the pigeons...
- It's so cold.

1875
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:08,119
are gathering. Hurry up.

1876
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:09,360
- Gosh, it's cold.
- The pigeons are gathering.

1877
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,860
The pigeons are coming.

1878
01:03:10,929 --> 01:03:13,030
(With the Han River's residents,
they begin the picnic.)

1879
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:14,130
Gosh, it's cold.

1880
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:16,300
- It's so cold.
- It's so cold.

1881
01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:19,269
For goodness' sake.

1882
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,539
What's this mess?

1883
01:03:21,539 --> 01:03:22,800
- It's cold.
- My goodness.

1884
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:24,210
- It's so cold.
- It's cold.

1885
01:03:24,469 --> 01:03:26,039
- It's cold.
- Gosh, it's cold.

1886
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,639
- The weather is no joke today.
- It's cold.

1887
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,949
- It's cold.
- I think it's minus 10°C.

1888
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:33,079
It's so cold.

1889
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:34,750
You can lay a picnic blanket
at the Hangang Park and...

1890
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,750
(Proud)

1891
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,219
- It's cold.
- It's cold.

1892
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:40,559
(He finally managed to have
a sip of the soup.)

1893
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:41,719
For goodness' sake.

1894
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,820
Gosh, it's so tasty.

1895
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:45,559
I'm hungry right now.

1896
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:48,230
(The soup tastes amazing.)

1897
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:49,659
It's so cold today.

1898
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,900
(It's so cold today.)

1899
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:54,269
It's cold.

1900
01:03:54,269 --> 01:03:56,500
(The cold weather
becomes their accompaniment.)

1901
01:03:56,969 --> 01:03:58,039
It's so cold.

1902
01:03:58,039 --> 01:03:59,409
(Without a word,)

1903
01:03:59,409 --> 01:04:03,239
(they inhale the ramyeon hurriedly.)

1904
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,280
- For goodness' sake.
- My goodness.

1905
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:08,880
(Laughing)

1906
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,889
Do you guys need to eat hurriedly
and get your order right away?

1907
01:04:11,219 --> 01:04:12,619
- Yes.
- I see.

1908
01:04:12,989 --> 01:04:14,159
Take a seat!

1909
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:15,590
(Take a seat!)

1910
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:16,619
(It's like a wholesale market
early in the morning.)

1911
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:17,789
The ramyeon is tasty here.

1912
01:04:18,289 --> 01:04:19,429
Welcome.

1913
01:04:19,429 --> 01:04:20,730
I don't know
where the exact location is,

1914
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:23,260
but we're like people
who came to buy things as a group.

1915
01:04:23,969 --> 01:04:25,429
The Merchant Association.

1916
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:27,340
We're like people...

1917
01:04:27,369 --> 01:04:29,869
- who came to buy products.
- We came from the countryside.

1918
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:32,239
- We came to buy products.
- We're rough people.

1919
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:33,940
We're waiting
because a reservation went wrong.

1920
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,539
I'm from Masan.

1921
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:36,710
(The Merchant Association members
take a break after buying products.)

1922
01:04:37,179 --> 01:04:38,409
(They begin inhaling
until the next truck comes.)

1923
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:39,610
It's so tasty.

1924
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,949
I could eat another ramyeon.

1925
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:45,019
(The firm noodles taste amazing
in the cold wind.)

1926
01:04:45,019 --> 01:04:46,219
It's tasty.

1927
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,519
You know, ramyeon...

1928
01:04:48,519 --> 01:04:50,760
The ramyeon tastes amazing here.

1929
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:53,489
It's insane. It's so tasty.

1930
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:54,929
(Adding refrigerated chicken breast)

1931
01:04:54,929 --> 01:04:57,500
Look at Jong Kook.
He's adding a chicken breast...

1932
01:04:58,070 --> 01:04:59,500
to the ramyeon.

1933
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,469
Look at the way he eats
a chicken breast.

1934
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,110
- Gosh.
- It's so tasty.

1935
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:06,809
You know, it was so cold earlier.
It's better since I ate the ramyeon.

1936
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:08,039
(The man who got cup noodles
is highly satisfied as well.)

1937
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:10,210
- It's much better since I'm full.
- That's right.

1938
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:12,780
- Ramyeon tastes so good.
- Ramyeon.

1939
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:14,750
It's so tasty.

1940
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:16,480
Ramyeon tastes so good.

1941
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,619
Let's add rice.

1942
01:05:18,489 --> 01:05:19,519
(Eating with gusto)

1943
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:21,059
Han River ramyeon is amazing.

1944
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:23,059
It's so tasty.

1945
01:05:23,059 --> 01:05:25,460
I don't think
I've had tastier ramyeon.

1946
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:29,730
You have ten minutes left
to enjoy yourselves here.

1947
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:31,199
You only have ten minutes. Hurry up.

1948
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:32,769
Who has the 700 dollars?

1949
01:05:33,099 --> 01:05:34,639
Isn't it one of the seniors?

1950
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,239
Which one has it?

1951
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:37,440
(Which one has the wallet?)

1952
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,070
- Jong Kook.
- What is it?

1953
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:40,239
Do you have the money?

1954
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:41,309
- What is it?
- Money.

1955
01:05:41,309 --> 01:05:44,280
- Did it go over?
- No. I need 700 dollars to pay.

1956
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:47,880
Did I receive the money?
No, I didn't receive the money.

1957
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,420
Who received the money earlier?

1958
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:52,019
I didn't receive it.

1959
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:53,690
- Who received 700 dollars earlier?
- No one received it.

1960
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,090
Who has the money?

1961
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:57,429
- Who received it?
- Jong Kook, didn't you receive it?

1962
01:05:57,429 --> 01:05:58,789
No, I didn't.

1963
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:00,900
- Someone received it earlier.
- Who was it?

1964
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,659
Who received 700 dollars earlier?

1965
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:03,960
- What?
- Se Chan.

1966
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,630
It isn't me.

1967
01:06:05,699 --> 01:06:06,869
- Who has the money?
- Daniel,

1968
01:06:06,869 --> 01:06:08,469
you received 700 dollars.

1969
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:09,900
I didn't receive the money.

1970
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,269
I got a card and gave it to them.

1971
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:13,309
I didn't receive the money.

1972
01:06:13,309 --> 01:06:14,579
Maybe the production crew forgot...

1973
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:16,440
- to give it to us.
- They didn't give us the money.

1974
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,679
Who has it?

1975
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:20,050
- No one received the money.
- What? I gave it earlier...

1976
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:21,880
- to Jong Kook.
- Earlier, the 1,000 dollars...

1977
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,880
He said he didn't receive it.

1978
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,920
I withdrew 700 dollars at the cafe
and gave it to him.

1979
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,949
Really?

1980
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:27,960
(The director gave the money
to Jong Kook.)

1981
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,119
Jong Kook,

1982
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:30,989
- she gave you 700 dollars.
- To me?

1983
01:06:30,989 --> 01:06:32,760
- Yes.
- No, I didn't receive it.

1984
01:06:32,829 --> 01:06:35,030
- Check your bag.
- My bag?

1985
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,429
A celebrity shouldn't be like that.

1986
01:06:37,429 --> 01:06:38,500
It really isn't me.

1987
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,769
Se Chan.

1988
01:06:39,769 --> 01:06:41,969
- It isn't me. I never saw it today.
- It isn't me.

1989
01:06:41,969 --> 01:06:43,639
It isn't me.
I didn't receive any money.

1990
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:45,309
Did she say that it was me?
She didn't give me money.

1991
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:47,340
- I received this earlier.
- Did you leave it on the bus?

1992
01:06:47,539 --> 01:06:49,010
I received this earlier.

1993
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:50,679
- Ah Young.
- I... Yes?

1994
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:52,349
- Hurry up and cook ramyeon.
- What?

1995
01:06:52,349 --> 01:06:54,349
- We should cook it first.
- Hurry up and cook it.

1996
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,219
- Ah Young, hold on.
- Money?

1997
01:06:56,619 --> 01:06:58,989
- We'll pay. Let us cook this first.
- Okay.

1998
01:06:58,989 --> 01:07:00,150
(Wary)

1999
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:01,619
We'll pay.

2000
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:02,690
(We'll pay.)

2001
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,059
I think they lost 700 dollars.

2002
01:07:05,059 --> 01:07:06,489
- They lost 700 dollars?
- Yes.

2003
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:07,960
- They lost cash?
- Yes.

2004
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,360
- No way. They're lying.
- They're serious.

2005
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,829
We'll pay.

2006
01:07:11,829 --> 01:07:14,369
- Thank you for waiting.
- Thank you.

2007
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:16,570
- Come.
- Did you find the money?

2008
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:17,840
No.

2009
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:18,969
Where is the money?

2010
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:20,010
It isn't in the cafe.

2011
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:21,909
I gave it to you in the cafe.

2012
01:07:21,909 --> 01:07:23,980
Jae Seok received 1,000 dollars...

2013
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:26,179
and gave it to me in the beginning.

2014
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,019
- I didn't get the second one.
- I didn't receive it.

2015
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:30,280
I just received the card.

2016
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,889
I said, "Should I give the card?"

2017
01:07:31,889 --> 01:07:33,389
- Daniel.
- I gave the blue card.

2018
01:07:33,389 --> 01:07:34,989
You'll get the appearance fee.

2019
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,460
- I expected better from you.
- It isn't like that.

2020
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:39,360
- What's wrong with you?
- I...

2021
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:41,230
- Is it Daniel?
- I think so.

2022
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:43,360
Had I received it, I would've gone,

2023
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,469
"Gosh, it's real money."

2024
01:07:45,469 --> 01:07:47,539
But I didn't do that.
It doesn't suit my personality.

2025
01:07:47,869 --> 01:07:51,010
Can't you check the camera and see
who received it?

2026
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:52,510
Use VAR to figure it out.

2027
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,780
(The production crew
checks the camera in the end.)

2028
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,610
- Check this.
- Okay.

2029
01:07:57,949 --> 01:08:01,150
(The culprit is in here.)

2030
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:03,019
Haven't you found
the 700 dollars yet?

2031
01:08:03,449 --> 01:08:05,389
- Where did it go?
- We're checking the video.

2032
01:08:05,389 --> 01:08:06,750
The culprit will be caught soon.

2033
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:08,690
Who took the 700 dollars?

2034
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:11,590
- Whoever stole the 700 dollars...
- I mean...

2035
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,829
In any case,
that thief will be caught.

2036
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:16,260
It isn't too late
to turn yourself in.

2037
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,199
- Hurry up!
- To whom did they give it?

2038
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,130
It isn't me. It really isn't me.

2039
01:08:20,199 --> 01:08:23,140
In five minutes,
we'll have the culprit.

2040
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,840
Come clean if you took the money.

2041
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,180
- It isn't me.
- The results will be out soon.

2042
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:32,250
(The production crew found
the exact moment.)

2043
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:33,909
Hold on...

2044
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:35,579
- This is...
- It's Jong Kook.

2045
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:36,979
(It's Jong Kook.)

2046
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:40,119
(After the first mission,)

2047
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:43,720
(the question was delivered.)

2048
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:48,300
(Daniel picked an envelope.)

2049
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:51,369
(3 minutes later,)

2050
01:08:51,369 --> 01:08:54,239
(the production handed over
a wallet.)

2051
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:56,770
(Jong Kook took it.)

2052
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:58,710
(Double-checking
in a different angle)

2053
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:00,909
(It was definitely Jong Kook.)

2054
01:09:00,909 --> 01:09:06,949
(It was in Jong Kook's hand
until they clapped the slate.)

2055
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:08,720
Is the VAR result out?

2056
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,720
(The members hear
that the results are out.)

2057
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,720
- Who is it?
- Do you know who the culprit is?

2058
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,619
- Who is it?
- I'll end this person.

2059
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:15,420
- Let's punish the culprit.
- I'll end this person.

2060
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:17,729
- I want to clear my name.
- Who is it?

2061
01:09:17,729 --> 01:09:19,989
Jong Kook definitely received it.

2062
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,159
- What?
- Hey, Jong Kook.

2063
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,569
(The culprit gets revealed.)

2064
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:28,399
Jong Kook definitely received it.

2065
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:29,699
- What?
- Hey, Jong Kook.

2066
01:09:30,069 --> 01:09:31,069
Jong Kook, what happened?

2067
01:09:31,069 --> 01:09:32,909
Why aren't you saying anything
to Jong Kook?

2068
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:35,510
- What?
- You said that you'd end him.

2069
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:37,579
- You said that you'd end him.
- But I don't have it.

2070
01:09:37,579 --> 01:09:39,010
Are you thinking,
"There must be a reason?"

2071
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,710
Jong Kook, take your time
and think about it.

2072
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:42,319
- It's okay.
- But I don't have it.

2073
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:43,720
I don't have it.

2074
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,819
- Hey.
- You received it...

2075
01:09:45,819 --> 01:09:47,319
and put it away.

2076
01:09:47,619 --> 01:09:49,689
You had it in your hand
until we clapped the slate.

2077
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:50,760
- Really?
- Yes.

2078
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,460
- You must've put it somewhere.
- Did I do that?

2079
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:54,500
You must've put it somewhere.
Did you leave it in the restroom?

2080
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:56,100
- The restroom.
- Did I leave it there?

2081
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:58,069
- You should check the restroom.
- Isn't it on the bus?

2082
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:00,100
We searched the bus,
but it wasn't there.

2083
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,270
I don't think I left it on the bus.

2084
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:02,640
What are we going to do?

2085
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,939
(Meanwhile, the two eat diligently.)

2086
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:06,770
- What now? Will Jong Kook pay?
- I must've left it somewhere.

2087
01:10:08,109 --> 01:10:09,439
All right. I'll pay myself.

2088
01:10:09,779 --> 01:10:11,180
Just a moment ago,

2089
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,609
you acted like
you'd crush the culprit.

2090
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:13,649
He agreed to pay.

2091
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:15,779
He agreed to pay.

2092
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:16,819
Why are you so intimidated?

2093
01:10:16,819 --> 01:10:18,149
He agreed to pay.

2094
01:10:18,149 --> 01:10:19,489
I'll pay.

2095
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:21,720
- Why are you coddling him?
- What's the problem?

2096
01:10:21,789 --> 01:10:23,989
He must be upset about
losing the money.

2097
01:10:23,989 --> 01:10:25,560
- You should scold him.
- I mean...

2098
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,460
- Hey.
- How would he feel?

2099
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:28,529
What's up with everyone?

2100
01:10:28,529 --> 01:10:31,170
Who took the money
from Jong Kook's pocket?

2101
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,369
Who took it?

2102
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:35,270
The only explanation is
that someone stole it.

2103
01:10:35,369 --> 01:10:37,470
Where could it be? Is it on the bus?

2104
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:39,170
- Maybe.
- Se Chan should come clean...

2105
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:40,640
even if it's scary.

2106
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:42,479
I want him to pluck up his courage.

2107
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:44,079
- It isn't me.
- Everyone, close your eyes!

2108
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:45,550
(Everyone, close your eyes!)

2109
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:47,649
- It isn't me.
- Close your eyes.

2110
01:10:47,649 --> 01:10:49,680
- Daniel, you too.
- Daniel.

2111
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,489
It'll be okay
if you return the money now.

2112
01:10:52,189 --> 01:10:53,890
I never received it.

2113
01:10:54,489 --> 01:10:56,619
I just received the envelope.

2114
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,159
I wanted to receive the money,
but you didn't give it to me.

2115
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:03,029
I thought, "I guess I haven't built
enough trust for it yet."

2116
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,270
"I guess they're still unsure."

2117
01:11:05,569 --> 01:11:08,369
- I don't have it.
- Perhaps it was taken by mistake.

2118
01:11:08,369 --> 01:11:12,310
For your information,
you completed the second question.

2119
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:15,840
This time,
you could use 700 dollars.

2120
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,380
- You used 699.74 dollars.
- Well done.

2121
01:11:20,449 --> 01:11:22,920
- We succeeded in it.
- The change was 26 cents.

2122
01:11:22,949 --> 01:11:25,850
It got added to the balance
from the previous round.

2123
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:27,289
The number of people
who'll receive the penalty...

2124
01:11:27,289 --> 01:11:28,590
- is still three.
- Nice.

2125
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:29,590
- Okay.
- Thank goodness.

2126
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:31,489
Nice. Three is a lot too.

2127
01:11:31,489 --> 01:11:34,659
- Now comes the third question.
- Okay.

2128
01:11:34,659 --> 01:11:36,630
The question should be asked...

2129
01:11:36,699 --> 01:11:38,869
to an office worker
who has finished eating lunch.

2130
01:11:38,869 --> 01:11:42,239
Please ask,
"What did you have for lunch today?"

2131
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:43,770
What are you doing?

2132
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:46,369
- We ate ramyeon and other things.
- My stomach is about to burst.

2133
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:49,539
- We just ate.
- That's just wrong.

2134
01:11:49,579 --> 01:11:51,850
- Stop it.
- We should've asked that first.

2135
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:53,510
- The order was predetermined.
- What?

2136
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,619
- We can show you the script.
- But we had lunch.

2137
01:11:55,619 --> 01:11:57,750
- I ate enough to puke.
- We should've asked that first.

2138
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,250
We had dessert too.

2139
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,590
I hope it's bread.

2140
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,619
I hope they answer
that they had bread.

2141
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:04,859
The options range
from 30 dollars to 1,000 dollars.

2142
01:12:04,859 --> 01:12:06,930
- You could get 30 dollars.
- That's right.

2143
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:08,960
- If you pick well...
- We need to pick 30 dollars.

2144
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,960
- Don't pick 1,000 dollars.
- Go for a small amount.

2145
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:12,869
Four envelopes remain.

2146
01:12:12,869 --> 01:12:14,170
- Jae Seok, you pick.
- There used to be six.

2147
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:15,199
Okay.

2148
01:12:15,369 --> 01:12:16,640
I'll aim for 30 dollars.

2149
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,609
- Thirty dollars.
- Thirty dollars.

2150
01:12:19,369 --> 01:12:21,840
(Their stomachs are full,
so he needs a small amount.)

2151
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,409
- All right.
- All right.

2152
01:12:23,779 --> 01:12:24,850
- Let's see it.
- Keep it low.

2153
01:12:24,979 --> 01:12:27,279
(He checks the amount.)

2154
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:32,119
What's wrong?
His facial expression is strange.

2155
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:33,489
- No.
- What did you do?

2156
01:12:33,489 --> 01:12:35,420
- Why did you pick it?
- Hey.

2157
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,720
- Why did I pick it?
- Why did you pick it?

2158
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,489
- Why am I the representative?
- Is he the leader? No, he isn't.

2159
01:12:38,489 --> 01:12:39,489
Why...

2160
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:40,560
Why did you pick it?

2161
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,029
- You should've done better.
- We didn't agree upon it.

2162
01:12:42,199 --> 01:12:43,560
- I'm not the representative.
- How much is it?

2163
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,970
- How much is it?
- How much is it?

2164
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:46,000
- Is it 500 dollars?
- I'm not the representative.

2165
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:47,699
- How much is it? Tell us!
- I'm not the representative.

2166
01:12:47,699 --> 01:12:49,140
- It must be 1,000 dollars.
- Grasshopper!

2167
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,140
- The thickness is telling.
- What have you done?

2168
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:53,369
- How will we eat lunch with this?
- What?

2169
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,609
We'll die.

2170
01:12:55,109 --> 01:12:56,279
- I...
- It's 500 dollars, right?

2171
01:12:56,279 --> 01:12:58,109
- It's 1,000 dollars?
- Is it 1,000 dollars?

2172
01:12:58,109 --> 01:12:59,279
- What?
- See.

2173
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:00,350
- Is it 1,000 dollars again?
- For goodness' sake.

2174
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:01,420
Why did you make me do it?

2175
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:04,420
- Why did you make me do it?
- Why did you pick 1,000 dollars?

2176
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:06,189
Why did you do that?

2177
01:13:06,189 --> 01:13:08,159
Why did you have to pick
the highest amount?

2178
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,090
Why did you make me do it?

2179
01:13:10,289 --> 01:13:11,960
Who will hold on to this?

2180
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:15,659
Shall I leave it with the bank?

2181
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,869
- Seriously. Don't give it to us.
- I...

2182
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:19,600
- Yes. We'll get suspected...
- I'll do it.

2183
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,069
- again.
- I'll do it.

2184
01:13:21,869 --> 01:13:23,369
- It wasn't me.
- What?

2185
01:13:23,369 --> 01:13:26,739
Jong Kook just knows
how to collect the envelopes.

2186
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,609
What else can he do?

2187
01:13:28,609 --> 01:13:29,680
He's clumsy.

2188
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:33,149
Gosh, this is...
Hey, where did the 700 dollars go?

2189
01:13:33,149 --> 01:13:35,020
I can't believe
the 700 dollars disappeared.

2190
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:36,520
- I'll look for it on the bus.
- Oh, no.

2191
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:37,750
- No.
- So...

2192
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,020
- Let's get on the bus.
- Let's see.

2193
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:40,989
For goodness' sake.
This is driving me crazy.

2194
01:13:40,989 --> 01:13:42,590
Do you think I took it?

2195
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:43,989
- Where did it go?
- Check the crevices.

2196
01:13:43,989 --> 01:13:45,859
(Checking the crevices)

2197
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:47,689
(He looks everywhere.)

2198
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:48,729
All right.

2199
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,430
It isn't here.

2200
01:13:51,029 --> 01:13:52,729
- It isn't here.
- Jong Kook, isn't it there?

2201
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:54,899
- No.
- It's driving me crazy.

2202
01:13:55,239 --> 01:13:56,270
It isn't here.

2203
01:13:56,399 --> 01:13:57,640
- It isn't here, right?
- Right.

2204
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:01,109
Do we need to eat lunch again?

2205
01:14:01,579 --> 01:14:02,739
- Ah Young.
- Yes?

2206
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:05,409
Be honest with us.
It has been a while...

2207
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:07,609
- since Ye Eun joined Running Man.
- Yes.

2208
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:09,079
- Has she badmouthed us?
- That's right.

2209
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:10,279
- She has, right?
- Let's ask.

2210
01:14:10,649 --> 01:14:11,689
- Has she badmouthed you guys?
- Be honest.

2211
01:14:11,689 --> 01:14:13,890
- Perhaps she didn't swear, but...
- Did she talk behind our backs?

2212
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:15,619
- Did she complain?
- Did she talk behind our backs?

2213
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:19,430
- Did she talk about Haha?
- She didn't do that.

2214
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,300
But these days,

2215
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,500
she's tired of the repetitive days.

2216
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,270
That's why I drink.

2217
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:27,029
- Is that so?
- Are you burned out?

2218
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:28,170
- You aren't, are you?
- Am I burned out?

2219
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:31,140
- Life isn't fun.
- She said that.

2220
01:14:31,239 --> 01:14:33,010
- You need a boyfriend.
- Is that so?

2221
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:34,239
- You need a boyfriend.
- No.

2222
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:37,579
I know the best solution...

2223
01:14:37,579 --> 01:14:39,380
when you're feeling that way.

2224
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:40,649
You need to lose all the work.

2225
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,279
That way...

2226
01:14:42,279 --> 01:14:44,079
(You need to lose all the work.)

2227
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:45,119
That way...

2228
01:14:45,289 --> 01:14:46,789
"Okay! I'll do that!"

2229
01:14:47,189 --> 01:14:48,789
- "I'll head out right away!"
- That's precise.

2230
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,260
(A spicy piece of advice
from experience)

2231
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,430
"Loyalty!"

2232
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:53,829
- "Okay!"
- I mean...

2233
01:14:53,829 --> 01:14:55,899
- Work...
- "I prepared a specialty!"

2234
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,100
- I mean...
- "I'll put it on my chin!"

2235
01:14:58,229 --> 01:14:59,329
When you lose work one at a time,
you'll go, "Yes!"

2236
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:01,640
(Everyone is serious about
resolving Ye Eun's worry.)

2237
01:15:01,739 --> 01:15:04,970
(But this man can't laugh loudly.)

2238
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,039
(I received 700 dollars.)

2239
01:15:08,039 --> 01:15:10,840
(Where could it be?)

2240
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:12,850
Going around today,

2241
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:14,850
I feel so bad for Jong Kook.

2242
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:16,050
How did you lose the money?

2243
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:18,489
I don't know.
Why don't I remember it?

2244
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:21,359
As time goes on, I feel more full.

2245
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:22,890
I don't know about the mission.

2246
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:24,060
- This time,
- Let's hurry up.

2247
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,729
I can't eat lunch.

2248
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:26,890
"What did you have for lunch?"

2249
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:29,630
If it's a steak,
we'll have a chance.

2250
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:31,770
- We'll have a chance.
- Who eats steak for lunch?

2251
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:33,600
- In that case,
- Who eats steak for lunch?

2252
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,899
we should pick someone
who looks like...

2253
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,340
he or she would've gone
to a nice place.

2254
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:39,470
- In terms of the outfit?
- Yes.

2255
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:40,840
- If we go to a sushi place...
- It looks like...

2256
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,609
we'll receive a penalty.

2257
01:15:42,979 --> 01:15:44,909
We should ask the question
as soon as we get off...

2258
01:15:44,909 --> 01:15:46,649
- in order to use 1,000 dollars.
- We don't have much time.

2259
01:15:46,649 --> 01:15:47,810
It's so troublesome.

2260
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:49,380
Ji Hyo has it the hardest.

2261
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:51,420
- It's so troublesome.
- This is driving me crazy.

2262
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,119
Gosh, this is...

2263
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:54,520
- Thank you.
- Seriously.

2264
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,789
We're holding a bag each
like a tourist.

2265
01:15:56,789 --> 01:15:58,529
- We seem like tourists.
- I mean...

2266
01:15:58,529 --> 01:16:00,359
- we're a group of tourists.
- Look at Ji Hyo.

2267
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:01,859
- Shopping..
- This is driving me crazy.

2268
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:04,430
- Get off the bus.
- Don't throw away the plastic bag.

2269
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,270
Gather all of them
and give them to Jong Kook.

2270
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:09,369
- Okay.
- Don't throw away the plastic bag.

2271
01:16:09,369 --> 01:16:10,600
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

2272
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,140
Hurry up and think about
the 700 dollars you lost.

2273
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:13,140
- The next place...
- What?

2274
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,710
Think about where you lost it.

2275
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:16,640
I don't know.
I think I left it in the restroom.

2276
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,810
- For goodness' sake.
- That's the only place.

2277
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:19,250
We don't have much time.
Let's hurry up and eat lunch.

2278
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,279
That sounds good.

2279
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:21,850
It's fun to tour around Seoul.

2280
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:22,920
(Carrying luggage, they look
for someone to ask a question.)

2281
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,250
We're really touring around Seoul.

2282
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:27,119
Gosh, it's Ji Ye Eun!
You're so pretty!

2283
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,289
- I'm a fan.
- Thank you.

2284
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,529
She loves it.

2285
01:16:31,529 --> 01:16:33,260
- Ye Eun is popular.
- Thank you.

2286
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,560
Ye Eun, good luck.

2287
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,399
Thank you.

2288
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,659
How touching.

2289
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:39,770
Ye Eun is so popular.

2290
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:40,770
Thank you.

2291
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:43,000
Ye Eun, you have a lot of fans.

2292
01:16:43,239 --> 01:16:44,710
It's thanks to Running Man.

2293
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,670
- We don't have much time.
- We need to hurry up and do it.

2294
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:48,810
We need to hurry up and do it.

2295
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:50,310
We don't have much time.
We need to eat fast and go.

2296
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:52,449
Whom should we ask?

2297
01:16:52,449 --> 01:16:55,079
- Where...
- The weather is cold today.

2298
01:16:55,079 --> 01:16:56,250
We need to ask the question.

2299
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:58,649
- That's right.
- In Apgujeong-dong...

2300
01:16:58,750 --> 01:16:59,920
Shouldn't we ask now?

2301
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,390
- To be honest, I... What?
- Seriously.

2302
01:17:01,859 --> 01:17:03,720
- Where are you going?
- Hello.

2303
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,930
- Come on.
- It's Gucci.

2304
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,130
It's Gucci.

2305
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:09,359
(The human Gucci walks over
from the opposite side.)

2306
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:11,770
Who looks like he or she
would've gone to a nice place.

2307
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:13,699
(His outfit looks expensive.)

2308
01:17:13,699 --> 01:17:14,699
I'm on my way to get coffee.

2309
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:16,569
- Is that so? Did you have lunch?
- Hold on.

2310
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,800
Yes.

2311
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,869
- Is that so?
- May we ask a question?

2312
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:22,109
- You're quite fashionable.
- Do you work here?

2313
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,079
- I work here.
- He runs his own business.

2314
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:25,079
- Yes.
- Right?

2315
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:26,109
- I see.
- I could tell.

2316
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:27,109
- He runs his own business.
- His own business.

2317
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:30,550
(He runs his own business
in Apgujeong.)

2318
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:32,489
(They found the right person
to ask a question.)

2319
01:17:32,489 --> 01:17:34,149
- We'll ask you a question.
- Okay.

2320
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,560
What did you have for lunch today?

2321
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:37,720
(To a citizen who had lunch)

2322
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:40,930
(They need to use 1,000 dollars
for lunch.)

2323
01:17:41,029 --> 01:17:44,970
(They need expensive food
that isn't filling.)

2324
01:17:45,069 --> 01:17:47,970
(What did the business owner
in Apgujeong eat for lunch?)

2325
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,039
Sundaegukbap.

2326
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:52,109
(Sundaegukbap)

2327
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:55,739
(Sundaegukbap is the most
inexpensive and hearty dish!)

2328
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:58,510
(He doesn't know how to react.)

2329
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:00,149
Thank you for the information.

2330
01:18:00,149 --> 01:18:01,649
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2331
01:18:01,649 --> 01:18:02,680
- Thank you.
- It's tasty.

2332
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,819
- Thank you.
- Bye.

2333
01:18:03,819 --> 01:18:05,220
Thank you. Happy Lunar New Year.

2334
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,250
- This is bad.
- Sundaegukbap?

2335
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,520
We can't spend 1,000 dollars
with that menu.

2336
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,819
- Seriously.
- What should we do?

2337
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:11,319
We don't have time.

2338
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:13,560
- We don't have time.
- We don't have time.

2339
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,960
- We don't have time.
- I should've asked.

2340
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,029
Are you serious?

2341
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:17,529
Where's
an expensive sundaegukbap place?

2342
01:18:17,529 --> 01:18:20,270
- We can't eat 1,000 dollars' worth.
- Even if it's expensive,

2343
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:22,199
it's only 12 to 13 dollars.

2344
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:24,270
I'm full.

2345
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:27,039
Where's a sundaegukbap place
around here?

2346
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:28,810
I think that alley might have
something.

2347
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,779
Hey, you can eat a bowl, right?

2348
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:32,180
A bowl?

2349
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,680
- I think I can manage.
- Okay.

2350
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,649
- Can you eat boiled pork slices?
- We should eat them.

2351
01:18:35,649 --> 01:18:36,979
There's a sundaegukbap place.

2352
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:39,149
- That place.
- Boseung Hall.

2353
01:18:39,149 --> 01:18:40,590
- Okay.
- They sell sundaegukbap.

2354
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,489
- All right.
- Boiled pork slices.

2355
01:18:42,489 --> 01:18:44,689
- The Merchant Association, hurry.
- Hold on.

2356
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,560
The Merchant Association, hurry.

2357
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,260
Assorted boiled pork slices
sound nice.

2358
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:49,630
- Today,
- Seriously.

2359
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:52,270
we need to take the tour bus
back to the countryside.

2360
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:53,899
- Hey.
- We need to be done by 4 p.m.

2361
01:18:53,899 --> 01:18:55,800
Mister, we'll miss the bus.
Let's get this over with.

2362
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,199
We need to be done by 4 p.m.

2363
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,470
- We'll miss the bus.
- Boiled pork slices.

2364
01:18:58,569 --> 01:19:00,470
- The Merchant Association, enter.
- Okay.

2365
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:01,479
Let's revive the economy.

2366
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:02,579
- Let's revive the economy.
- Let's go.

2367
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:04,710
We need to spend 300 dollars
at the very least.

2368
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:06,510
We have a food fighter.

2369
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:12,390
Currently, the remaining balance
is 687.26 dollars.

2370
01:19:12,449 --> 01:19:14,350
If you leave behind
more than 13 dollars,

2371
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:15,920
- more people will get the penalty.
- We need to eat a lot.

2372
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,960
It depends on the condition
of the food fighter.

2373
01:19:19,329 --> 01:19:21,029
We need to order gukbap.

2374
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:22,300
Gukbap.

2375
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,460
Daniel, have gukbap.

2376
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,729
Okay. Gukbap.

2377
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:25,930
I want pork gukbap.

2378
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:27,470
Pork gukbap.

2379
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:29,500
We don't have much time,
so hurry up and order.

2380
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:31,340
Two assorted boiled pork slices,
please.

2381
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,170
Each table should order.

2382
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:34,670
- I want pork gukbap.
- Same here.

2383
01:19:34,779 --> 01:19:36,609
- Boiled dumplings?
- Boiled dumplings?

2384
01:19:36,609 --> 01:19:38,149
Shall we order two seasoned pollack?

2385
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:39,250
- Seasoned pollack?
- Seasoned pollack?

2386
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:40,750
- I want a soda.
- Take it home.

2387
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,020
Seok Jin, I want samgyetang.

2388
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,149
- What?
- Samgyetang.

2389
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:45,289
- Samgyetang?
- Yes.

2390
01:19:45,289 --> 01:19:46,289
- Did you order a soda?
- What else?

2391
01:19:46,289 --> 01:19:47,590
- Something expensive.
- Let's order a soda.

2392
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:48,859
- Soda.
- Order a soda.

2393
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,119
- Drinks.
- That way...

2394
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,260
That way, we can eat a lot.

2395
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:53,260
(While the food fighter
commands the group)

2396
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:55,260
(Se Chan's table: Soda)

2397
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:57,199
(Se Chan orders all the soda.)

2398
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:58,600
We can take sodas, right?

2399
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,270
Yes. You can take them
if you can carry them.

2400
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:02,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

2401
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,739
Can you take ten home?

2402
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:05,270
Okay.

2403
01:20:05,369 --> 01:20:06,939
We're taking 20 sodas home.

2404
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,380
We need to make an effort.

2405
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,039
- We're doing this for the economy.
- That's right.

2406
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:12,380
There's nothing more...

2407
01:20:12,449 --> 01:20:13,449
What?

2408
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:15,550
- What?
- What is it?

2409
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:16,579
It's the 700 dollars.

2410
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:19,220
(He found the 700 dollars!)

2411
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,619
- It's the 700 dollars.
- Did you say 700 dollars? What?

2412
01:20:21,619 --> 01:20:23,359
- He found it.
- I...

2413
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:26,529
put it here because
I had nowhere else to put it.

2414
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,000
(Right after receiving 700 dollars)

2415
01:20:29,029 --> 01:20:32,430
(He put his arm inside
with the wallet.)

2416
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:35,039
(Jong Kook put it in a sleeve
and forgot about it.)

2417
01:20:35,869 --> 01:20:36,869
It was here.

2418
01:20:37,069 --> 01:20:38,270
No way.

2419
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:40,170
- It came out.
- Jong Kook.

2420
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:41,680
- It was here.
- He found it.

2421
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,680
- I held it in my hand.
- For goodness' sake.

2422
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,680
- Gosh.
- You put it inside the sleeve.

2423
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,319
I put it inside the sleeve
like this.

2424
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,649
No, Jong Kook.

2425
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:50,949
Se Chan put it there.

2426
01:20:51,149 --> 01:20:53,550
No, I didn't do it.
He's setting me up until the end.

2427
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,319
- Seriously.
- Jong Kook.

2428
01:20:55,319 --> 01:20:56,720
Se Chan put it there.

2429
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,329
Why didn't you know
that it was there?

2430
01:20:58,329 --> 01:21:00,029
- Couldn't you feel it?
- I couldn't feel it.

2431
01:21:00,029 --> 01:21:01,390
- Really?
- My goodness.

2432
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:04,159
He just knows how to exercise.

2433
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:05,430
- Here you go.
- Seriously.

2434
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:07,329
- Thank goodness.
- Thank goodness.

2435
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,699
- Thank goodness.
- It was here.

2436
01:21:09,939 --> 01:21:11,970
- Thank you.
- Take it home.

2437
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:13,970
Gosh, it looks tasty.

2438
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:15,840
Boiled pork slices look tasty.

2439
01:21:16,409 --> 01:21:18,039
We shouldn't have come here
after eating ramyeon.

2440
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,079
(Boiled pork slices and gukbap
look hearty.)

2441
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,850
Just one.

2442
01:21:20,949 --> 01:21:22,180
(Most food fighters
don't even drink water.)

2443
01:21:22,279 --> 01:21:23,720
The food fighter is drinking
Coca-Cola again.

2444
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,289
- That's right.
- She's warming up.

2445
01:21:26,289 --> 01:21:27,289
I'm warming up.

2446
01:21:27,289 --> 01:21:28,689
- Cleanse your stomach.
- I need to push down the food.

2447
01:21:28,689 --> 01:21:29,720
It's like the windshield
washer fluid.

2448
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,359
- She resets her stomach.
- Yes.

2449
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:33,390
- I need to push down the food.
- Push down the food.

2450
01:21:33,729 --> 01:21:36,000
What would we have done without her?

2451
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,460
(After resetting her stomach,
she tries the soup first.)

2452
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:39,630
(Gosh)

2453
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:40,630
What's this?

2454
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:42,239
Pork gukbap.

2455
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:43,470
(She adds rice.)

2456
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:47,069
(It tastes good!)

2457
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:49,880
Food fighter, please cheer for us.

2458
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,180
Everyone, you can do it.

2459
01:21:53,449 --> 01:21:54,810
(Food fighter)

2460
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,680
(Solemn)

2461
01:21:56,779 --> 01:21:57,850
What?

2462
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,619
She's so cute.

2463
01:22:00,819 --> 01:22:01,920
She's cute.

2464
01:22:01,989 --> 01:22:03,460
(Thanks to the food fighter's
encouragement,)

2465
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:06,659
(the members begin to eat.)

2466
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,500
(My goodness)

2467
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,100
It's so tasty.

2468
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:14,100
Goodness.

2469
01:22:14,869 --> 01:22:15,970
It's going in.

2470
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:17,970
Goodness.

2471
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:19,170
(Exclaiming)

2472
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:22,739
(It warms their frozen bodies
from the strong wind.)

2473
01:22:22,739 --> 01:22:24,380
- I...
- Goodness.

2474
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:25,649
It's going in.

2475
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:27,350
- It's going in.
- Goodness.

2476
01:22:28,949 --> 01:22:30,579
- It's delicious.
- Gosh.

2477
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:33,550
The food fighter is doing
really well here.

2478
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:35,390
She can only eat three bowls.

2479
01:22:35,989 --> 01:22:37,859
I'm really a fan
of the food fighter.

2480
01:22:37,859 --> 01:22:39,229
It's going in.

2481
01:22:39,229 --> 01:22:40,789
(She's eating
as if it's the first meal.)

2482
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:42,729
Here's the samgyetang.

2483
01:22:42,729 --> 01:22:45,770
She's the new food fighter.

2484
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:48,069
- Ah Young?
- Ah Young. She's passionate.

2485
01:22:48,069 --> 01:22:50,670
She ordered 2 meals.
She ordered 2 ramyeon earlier too.

2486
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:53,069
- She always orders many.
- She's the food fighter's friend.

2487
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:54,869
Se Chan likes samgyetang.

2488
01:22:55,579 --> 01:22:57,640
- Really?
- Give him some.

2489
01:22:58,449 --> 01:23:01,079
- Who are you going to give?
- Hold on.

2490
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:04,119
- Daniel.
- Pass it on to Se Chan.

2491
01:23:04,119 --> 01:23:07,920
(Pass it on to Se Chan.)

2492
01:23:08,619 --> 01:23:10,590
- I heard you liked chicken.
- It's from Ah Young.

2493
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:12,560
- Try some samgyetang.
- This is from Ah Young.

2494
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:14,930
It somehow looks like a heart.

2495
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:17,829
- This is for Daniel.
- It's...

2496
01:23:18,329 --> 01:23:20,170
- What?
- This is for Daniel.

2497
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:23,000
(She gives the whole bowl
to Daniel.)

2498
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,439
(The love line mania is happy.)

2499
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:27,369
Thank you.

2500
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:28,380
Right.

2501
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:30,210
(The unwanted love triangle
keeps on going.)

2502
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:32,079
- She's smart.
- I have more.

2503
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:33,250
(The unwanted love triangle
keeps on going.)

2504
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:34,479
(She's making sure
to get enough screen time.)

2505
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:36,479
- She's smart.
- I'll eat a lot.

2506
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:39,020
- This is what Se Chan does.
- Really?

2507
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:41,090
I'll keep watching
future episodes...

2508
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:43,460
to see if you have a thing
for other people.

2509
01:23:44,489 --> 01:23:45,529
- What?
- I'll be watching.

2510
01:23:45,529 --> 01:23:47,229
She's a fox.

2511
01:23:47,229 --> 01:23:49,630
- She's good with games.
- She's no joke.

2512
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:51,199
In the end, Ye Eun loses everyone.

2513
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:54,600
Ye Eun is losing Se Chan.
What a shame.

2514
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:56,840
I have Hoon.

2515
01:23:57,739 --> 01:23:59,810
Hey.

2516
01:24:00,109 --> 01:24:03,109
Daniel said there was something
you didn't lose.

2517
01:24:03,109 --> 01:24:05,109
- What is it?
- You still don't lose any food.

2518
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:08,380
(She kept holding the meat
while saying the flirtatious line.)

2519
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:10,079
(Watching)

2520
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:12,189
She still doesn't lose any food.

2521
01:24:12,189 --> 01:24:13,189
(Amazed)

2522
01:24:14,689 --> 01:24:16,420
- Good.
- She eats well.

2523
01:24:16,989 --> 01:24:18,529
- "She eats well."
- She's tall too.

2524
01:24:18,529 --> 01:24:20,560
- It's funny since it continues.
- "She's tall too."

2525
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,699
- She's tall too.
- It's more this time.

2526
01:24:22,699 --> 01:24:25,430
(The members are speeding up.)

2527
01:24:26,329 --> 01:24:27,329
Hey.

2528
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,800
(He finishes the soup too.)

2529
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:31,600
I ate it all.

2530
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,609
- The soup goes in, doesn't it?
- It's good.

2531
01:24:33,609 --> 01:24:35,069
The soup keeps going in.

2532
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:38,779
- I should take away the pork.
- Right.

2533
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:40,779
Please pack the boiled pork
to take home.

2534
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:44,979
Okay, everyone.
The amount you used here...

2535
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:46,619
(Remaining balance: 687.26 dollars)

2536
01:24:46,619 --> 01:24:47,819
- you used here...
- Please.

2537
01:24:47,819 --> 01:24:48,859
(The amount they used here
out of the 1,000 dollars)

2538
01:24:48,859 --> 01:24:49,890
Please.

2539
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:51,520
(The amount they used here
out of the 1,000 dollars)

2540
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,359
(260 dollars)

2541
01:24:53,659 --> 01:24:56,430
It's 260 dollars.

2542
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:58,869
- We're in trouble.
- This...

2543
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,329
It's only 260 dollars?

2544
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:04,840
The remaining 740 dollars
will accumulate.

2545
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:08,369
Your remaining balance
is 1,427 dollars.

2546
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,380
So two more people will be added.

2547
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:12,180
(The number of people
receiving the penalty is 5.)

2548
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:13,710
We should hurry.

2549
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:15,880
This is the last question.

2550
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,479
(What do you want to give for your
child's graduation or admission?)

2551
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:19,020
- That's nice.
- Right.

2552
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:20,189
It would be nice
to withdraw a large amount.

2553
01:25:20,189 --> 01:25:21,890
We should have had
1,000 dollars for this.

2554
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:23,020
I know.

2555
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:24,319
- That's right.
- We don't have 1,000 dollars.

2556
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:26,189
- What if it's 30 dollars?
- You give something huge...

2557
01:25:26,189 --> 01:25:27,430
as a graduation or admission gift.

2558
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:29,729
- That's right.
- Right. You give something big.

2559
01:25:29,729 --> 01:25:31,460
Hurry up. We don't have time.

2560
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:34,369
We don't have time now.
Shouldn't we ask from nearby?

2561
01:25:34,369 --> 01:25:36,970
- We should.
- Hurry up, tourists.

2562
01:25:37,569 --> 01:25:39,310
- Here.
- Come here, tourists.

2563
01:25:39,310 --> 01:25:41,979
- Hurry up, or we'll be late.
- Come.

2564
01:25:41,979 --> 01:25:46,479
The remaining amounts are
30, 70, and 200 dollars.

2565
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:47,909
- It's 30, 70, and 200 dollars?
- Yes.

2566
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:49,380
We've been picking
the big amounts so far.

2567
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:50,920
Let's have Seok Sam pick it.

2568
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,920
Me? What if I pick 30 dollars?

2569
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,850
- It's okay. We won't blame you.
- We need a large amount.

2570
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:56,689
- I think you'll pick 30 dollars.
- Let's go, guide!

2571
01:25:56,689 --> 01:25:57,760
- We won't blame.
- Okay.

2572
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,689
- Everyone! Fight until the end.
- He wouldn't pick 30.

2573
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:04,359
(They've been picking
large amounts so far.)

2574
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:05,970
- It's 700 dollars.
- It's 700 dollars?

2575
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,369
(They've had a hard time
using up the money.)

2576
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:15,739
(It's a good question to use
the large amount.)

2577
01:26:15,939 --> 01:26:17,739
- That's right.
- We have 30 dollars left too.

2578
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:22,550
(They have to pick 200 dollars
no matter what.)

2579
01:26:22,619 --> 01:26:25,489
(What amount did Seok Jin pick?)

2580
01:26:25,489 --> 01:26:28,920
- I'm sorry.
- How much is it?

2581
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:32,560
- It wouldn't be 30 dollars.
- It would be the worst.

2582
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:35,060
- Come on.
- Seriously.

2583
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,859
- Seriously.
- What's wrong with you?

2584
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:39,529
I'm sorry.
I didn't do it on purpose.

2585
01:26:39,529 --> 01:26:41,369
We can't revive anything with that.

2586
01:26:41,369 --> 01:26:42,739
We weren't going to blame him.

2587
01:26:42,869 --> 01:26:44,869
- It's hard not to blame you.
- What did you do?

2588
01:26:44,869 --> 01:26:46,770
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- We can't revive the economy.

2589
01:26:46,770 --> 01:26:49,539
- You picked 1,000 dollars before.
- We can't revive it with that.

2590
01:26:49,539 --> 01:26:51,279
How are we going to revive
the economy with 30 dollars?

2591
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:52,979
It wasn't like I wanted this.

2592
01:26:52,979 --> 01:26:55,279
You read the question earlier.

2593
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:57,079
What do you want to give...

2594
01:26:57,079 --> 01:26:59,220
- for your child's graduation...
- I'm sorry.

2595
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:00,989
- or admission?
- Thirty dollars is too little.

2596
01:27:00,989 --> 01:27:02,920
- What will we do with 30 dollars?
- I know.

2597
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,289
- This is crazy.
- Why did you pick that?

2598
01:27:04,289 --> 01:27:06,289
You gave us 1,000 dollars
when we had sundaeguk.

2599
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:08,600
You're giving us 30 dollars
to buy a gift?

2600
01:27:08,699 --> 01:27:10,300
That's not nice.

2601
01:27:10,699 --> 01:27:13,369
You have 22 minutes left.

2602
01:27:13,369 --> 01:27:15,539
- Your hands are full.
- Our hands are full.

2603
01:27:15,539 --> 01:27:18,840
It's so heavy.
Someone should eat it.

2604
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:21,170
- We're a Merchant Association.
- It's heavy.

2605
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:23,039
This is crazy.

2606
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:24,579
You should have at least picked
70 dollars.

2607
01:27:24,579 --> 01:27:27,079
- You should have picked 70 dollars.
- I know.

2608
01:27:27,479 --> 01:27:28,850
It's suddenly cold again
now that we're outside.

2609
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:31,050
- Right?
- It's cold outside.

2610
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,090
There's a lot of wind.

2611
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:34,390
It's cold.

2612
01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:35,590
- It's cold.
- It's cold.

2613
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:37,789
- It's cold.
- Okay.

2614
01:27:37,789 --> 01:27:40,260
This is so bothersome.
It's so heavy.

2615
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,960
It's possible.

2616
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,659
- Jong Kook, hello.
- What?

2617
01:27:43,659 --> 01:27:46,600
- CHANYEOL.
- Hello.

2618
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,569
(EXO's CHANYEOL?)

2619
01:27:49,569 --> 01:27:50,640
- CHANYEOL.
- Amazing.

2620
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,069
It's CHANYEOL.

2621
01:27:52,069 --> 01:27:53,970
- It's CHANYEOL.
- CHANYEOL.

2622
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:55,779
It's been a while, CHANYEOL

2623
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,079
Where are you going, CHANYEOL?

2624
01:27:57,079 --> 01:27:58,310
- Hello.
- CHANYEOL.

2625
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:59,810
Where are you going?

2626
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:01,279
- I'm going to get coffee.
- You're going to get coffee?

2627
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:03,119
- Have a soft drink.
- Thank you.

2628
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:05,390
CHANYEOL. Have you been well?

2629
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:06,550
Let's give CHANYEOL some presents.

2630
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:08,489
- Take this, CHANYEOL.
- How are you?

2631
01:28:08,489 --> 01:28:10,890
How many cans are you giving him?

2632
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:12,859
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, I have.

2633
01:28:12,859 --> 01:28:13,930
- CHANYEOL.
- Take this, CHANYEOL.

2634
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:14,989
Take some of these drinks.

2635
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:16,329
- He has no hands.
- Hold on.

2636
01:28:16,329 --> 01:28:18,260
- He's so cute.
- Goodness.

2637
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:19,600
- You came out for a walk.
- How cute.

2638
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,630
When are you going to work out?

2639
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:22,899
- Today.
- You'll go? See you later then.

2640
01:28:22,899 --> 01:28:24,970
- Okay. You can get going.
- Right. Get going, CHANYEOL.

2641
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:26,510
- Bye, CHANYEOL.
- Bye.

2642
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:27,739
Bye.

2643
01:28:27,739 --> 01:28:29,109
- Be careful.
- Right.

2644
01:28:29,109 --> 01:28:30,340
- Apgujeong...
- There are many celebrities.

2645
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:31,579
has many celebrities.

2646
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:33,810
- We're seeing celebrities here.
- It's amazing.

2647
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:35,779
- It's so nice.
- We don't have time. Hurry.

2648
01:28:35,779 --> 01:28:36,819
- We don't have time.
- Hurry.

2649
01:28:36,819 --> 01:28:37,850
- Let's hurry.
- We need to hurry.

2650
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:39,989
- We need to hurry.
- It's not easy.

2651
01:28:39,989 --> 01:28:40,989
Goodness.

2652
01:28:40,989 --> 01:28:42,689
Let's hurry. We don't have time.

2653
01:28:42,689 --> 01:28:44,390
- No.
- Let's do it.

2654
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:46,029
- We have to do it now.
- We don't have time.

2655
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,689
(Will they spend
the 30 dollars in time?)

2656
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:50,159
- It was so funny.
- The Merchant Association members.

2657
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,560
- We carried this around.
- It's a long day.

2658
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,829
- It's not ending.
- The race has ended.

2659
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:58,369
The total remaining balance
after the final question...

2660
01:28:58,369 --> 01:29:00,609
(The final remaining balance decides
the number of penalty receivers.)

2661
01:29:00,609 --> 01:29:03,039
The final amount
which was 30 dollars...

2662
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:06,350
(The final amount
which was 30 dollars...)

2663
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:07,680
- was used up.
- Right.

2664
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:09,319
So the last consumption
was successful.

2665
01:29:09,319 --> 01:29:10,350
That's a relief.

2666
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:14,119
Do you have children? Jae Seok.

2667
01:29:14,119 --> 01:29:18,989
If you were to give your child
a graduation or an admission gift...

2668
01:29:19,689 --> 01:29:20,729
Stationery?

2669
01:29:20,729 --> 01:29:22,529
- Stationery?
- Stationery?

2670
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:23,600
(Stationery can be bought
using 30 dollars.)

2671
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,100
- What else?
- Pencil case.

2672
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:26,369
- Pencil case.
- Pencil case!

2673
01:29:26,369 --> 01:29:28,069
- Pencil case!
- Thank you.

2674
01:29:28,069 --> 01:29:29,369
It's here.

2675
01:29:29,369 --> 01:29:31,199
It's been here for a long time.

2676
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:32,869
It says it's five dollars.

2677
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:34,470
It's going smoothly.

2678
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:36,880
The remaining balance...

2679
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:41,350
is 1,697.26 dollars.

2680
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:43,350
- Okay.
- If it was 1,700 dollars...

2681
01:29:43,449 --> 01:29:47,050
There will be five
penalty receivers.

2682
01:29:47,189 --> 01:29:49,359
As for the penalty balls,

2683
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:50,920
the person with the most number
of balls...

2684
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,460
is Song Ji Hyo with 6 balls
because of the 369 game earlier.

2685
01:29:53,689 --> 01:29:55,829
- Daniel has four balls.
- Me?

2686
01:29:55,829 --> 01:29:57,729
- Yes.
- Why do I have so many?

2687
01:29:57,729 --> 01:30:00,270
- Ye Eun and Haha have three.
- Ye Eun.

2688
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:03,899
Jae Seok, Seok Jin,
and Ah Young have two each.

2689
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:04,899
Ah Young...

2690
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:07,739
Jong Kook and Se Chan have one each.

2691
01:30:07,739 --> 01:30:09,279
- Nice.
- That's so nice.

2692
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:10,279
- You never know.
- It's crazy.

2693
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:11,609
- Right.
- You never know.

2694
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:16,079
We will now pick
the five penalty receivers.

2695
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:19,390
By the way,
it will be a very annoying penalty.

2696
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:21,489
- No way...
- An annoying penalty?

2697
01:30:21,489 --> 01:30:23,390
- Getting beaten is better.
- Right.

2698
01:30:23,489 --> 01:30:26,260
These are the penalty balls.
Pick five balls from here.

2699
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:28,430
- Those with many balls can pick.
- Okay.

2700
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:29,829
- Ji Hyo has the most.
- Ji Hyo can pick one.

2701
01:30:29,829 --> 01:30:31,260
I could pick myself.

2702
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:32,600
Pick one ball.

2703
01:30:33,369 --> 01:30:34,899
Please.

2704
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:37,170
(Who will be the first person
to receive the annoying penalty?)

2705
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:38,670
Did you get it?

2706
01:30:38,869 --> 01:30:41,170
She picked one. Show it to us.

2707
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:43,739
(Song Ji Hyo)

2708
01:30:44,609 --> 01:30:45,649
(The Golden Hand Ji Hyo
surprisingly picked her name.)

2709
01:30:45,649 --> 01:30:47,779
Song Ji Hyo will receive
the penalty.

2710
01:30:47,779 --> 01:30:48,979
- She picked herself.
- She had the most number of balls.

2711
01:30:48,979 --> 01:30:50,850
- You picked yourself.
- I had too many.

2712
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:51,850
- She picked herself.
- Next is Daniel.

2713
01:30:51,850 --> 01:30:52,850
- Okay.
- Okay.

2714
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:54,119
- Since her balls are out,
- It's Daniel.

2715
01:30:54,119 --> 01:30:55,319
- we have a chance to get picked.
- We do.

2716
01:30:55,319 --> 01:30:56,359
- Even with one ball.
- Please.

2717
01:30:56,359 --> 01:30:58,220
- Five people will be picked anyway.
- Daniel.

2718
01:30:58,220 --> 01:30:59,590
There's a chance.

2719
01:30:59,859 --> 01:31:01,859
- I think I'll get it.
- Please.

2720
01:31:01,859 --> 01:31:03,229
It won't make sense if Jong Kook
and I get picked.

2721
01:31:03,229 --> 01:31:06,000
- One.
- One, two, three. Here.

2722
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:07,869
Jee Seok Jin.

2723
01:31:07,869 --> 01:31:09,270
(Jee Seok Sam)

2724
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:11,270
(1 of Seok Jin's 2 balls
got picked.)

2725
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:12,270
What?

2726
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:14,439
(Laughing)

2727
01:31:14,909 --> 01:31:15,979
Look at his face.

2728
01:31:15,979 --> 01:31:17,380
That's genuine.

2729
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:20,180
Is that something to be happy about?

2730
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:22,319
There were only two balls.

2731
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:23,619
Jee Seok Jin.

2732
01:31:23,619 --> 01:31:24,850
- Next is Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun.

2733
01:31:24,850 --> 01:31:26,689
- Ye Eun.
- Pick yours, Ye Eun.

2734
01:31:26,689 --> 01:31:28,250
- Okay.
- Aebong.

2735
01:31:28,619 --> 01:31:29,890
I hope Aebong picks herself.

2736
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:31,119
One, two, three.

2737
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:32,460
- What?
- What?

2738
01:31:32,489 --> 01:31:36,000
(Ddochi picked her own name.)

2739
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,159
I knew it.

2740
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:40,329
- Now we have two people left.
- Two? Oh, no.

2741
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:41,770
- Seriously...
- Two? Oh, no.

2742
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:43,100
It's all right.

2743
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:44,840
- How annoying will it be?
- Gosh, Ye Eun.

2744
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:45,840
There are two people left?

2745
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,039
Daniel, join me.

2746
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:48,810
No, Seok Jin.

2747
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:50,880
One, two, three. Daniel!

2748
01:31:50,979 --> 01:31:52,109
- Haha.
- Haha.

2749
01:31:52,109 --> 01:31:53,409
(Haha)

2750
01:31:54,949 --> 01:31:57,149
(Daniel with 4 balls
survived again.)

2751
01:31:57,149 --> 01:31:58,779
- Now we have one person left.
- Ah Young!

2752
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:01,720
Please.

2753
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,920
Ah Young!

2754
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,460
- Please.
- Pick Ah Young.

2755
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:06,189
- Haha, you pick it.
- It should be Ah Young.

2756
01:32:06,189 --> 01:32:07,659
- It's okay to pick me.
