1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,310
Hello.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,410
Hi.

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,410
Hello.

4
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,910
- It's been a while.
- Hello.

5
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,650
Min Hee is drawing
on Seok Jin's face.

6
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,950
Min Hee is drawing.

7
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,920
- Celebrities...
- Hey, what are you talking about?

8
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,490
- You're here.
- What do you mean she's drawing?

9
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,750
- Seok Jin.
- I just did makeup.

10
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,590
- Seok Jin, your hair grew a lot.
- Last week,

11
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,760
- you went through a lot.
- Right.

12
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,920
- Why?
- Why do you look so good today?

13
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,920
What were you waiting for?

14
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,360
- You look better with long hair.
- You look cool.

15
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,690
- Really?
- You look great.

16
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,700
- Good.
- Should I grow my hair?

17
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,360
- It should be this long.
- You look great today.

18
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,460
You should grow your back hair.

19
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,400
You don't lie.

20
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,030
- It will look good. I'm serious.
- Okay.

21
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,240
- Are you serious?
- You should try.

22
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,810
- Thanks.
- You look younger.

23
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,040
- Hey, Daniel.
- Hey.

24
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,510
- Daniel.
- Why did you start already?

25
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,010
- I went to the restroom.
- Because of you...

26
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,580
- It's okay.
- I was in the restroom.

27
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,050
- Hey.
- He was out.

28
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,750
- You bought a house.
- Enough.

29
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,390
- Yes.
- There were articles about it.

30
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,260
Jong Kook bought a house
with the plastic bags he collected.

31
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,890
- What? Is it a greenhouse?
- Plastic bags?

32
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,830
- The plastic bags he collected...
- Jae Seok.

33
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,400
- That's what all the comments said.
- What did they say?

34
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,630
"He bought a house
after collecting all the bags."

35
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,830
- Right.
- Everyone says that.

36
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,700
- "Will he bring the bags?"
- Really?

37
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,100
- "Will the bags have their room?"
- Bags.

38
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,940
The thing is...

39
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,670
- Jong Kook.
- The bags will have their own room?

40
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,110
Everyone said you should give
the bags a big room.

41
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,380
- Bags...
- The main room goes to the bags.

42
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,880
I got rid of the disease
after that day.

43
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,620
- Good.
- I keep thinking of that day.

44
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,790
Was it a disease?

45
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,860
- I got over it.
- So it was a disease.

46
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,860
He's aware of that.

47
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,020
I got over it.

48
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,290
- See?
- When I go to the balcony now...

49
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,960
and I have a plastic bag,
I turn around, saying, "Darn it."

50
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,800
I throw it away like this.

51
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,370
- You should.
- I really do.

52
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,670
Into the recycling bin.

53
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,140
I can get over the disease.

54
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,470
- That's cool.
- I completely overcame it.

55
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,140
Last week,
we had a small team dinner.

56
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,270
- Yes.
- I heard.

57
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,940
We talked about looking
for Ye Eun's boyfriend.

58
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,380
And we did this thing
where we clasped...

59
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,110
- each other's hand last week.
- Right.

60
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,820
It turns out it's been years
since she held a man's hand.

61
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,490
It'd been years, so she felt awkward
holding someone's hand.

62
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,290
It'd been a long time
since I held a man's hand.

63
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,920
That's right. I remember that.

64
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,360
This is how you hold someone's hand.

65
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,660
- Try holding mine.
- I'm holding it.

66
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,190
So this is how you hold hands.

67
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,190
Let's say I'm Ye Eun.

68
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,500
- Try holding my hand now.
- Okay.

69
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,700
(Stiff)

70
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,330
- What?
- That's true.

71
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,830
- It was like...
- Why?

72
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,770
- It was like holding a doll's hand.
- Is she a princess?

73
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,270
- Like this?
- I think she did that.

74
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,410
Ye Eun is being funny...

75
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,510
(She was too shy
to hold Ho Jun's hand.)

76
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,010
(She was feeling awkward...)

77
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,650
(holding hands
even with Se Chan and Daniel.)

78
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,120
- What did I do?
- I could feel it.

79
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,890
I thought she didn't want
to hold my hand.

80
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,490
Please don't get me wrong.
It's just...

81
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,830
It's been a long time
since I held a man's hand.

82
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,190
(Praying for Ye Eun
to escape from being single)

83
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,100
- That's why.
- Today,

84
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,000
we have guests
who will join our show.

85
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,670
- We do?
- I didn't know.

86
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,900
- There they are.
- My gosh.

87
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,740
- Hey.
- My goodness.

88
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,470
(SOYEON and MIYEON of i-dle)

89
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,110
- Hello.
- SOYEON.

90
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,840
- MIYEON.
- Is she SOYEON?

91
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,880
What are you doing?

92
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,280
(They suddenly start dancing.)

93
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,450
What are you doing?

94
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,620
- All of a sudden?
- Without saying hello?

95
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,990
Just say hello first.

96
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,590
- My goodness.
- They didn't even say hi.

97
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,960
- Without saying hi...
- What's going on?

98
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,490
("They Are Coming Back
After Renewing Their Contract")

99
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,590
("With G Removed From Their Name,
They’re Rebranded as I-dle")

100
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,300
(The main vocalist, MIYEON,
the leader if i-dle, SOYEON)

101
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,900
(They are back with "Good Thing"
after 1 year!)

102
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,470
- Hello.
- You guys are so cool.

103
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,830
- SOYEON, I didn't recognize you.
- Hello.

104
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,940
- It's me.
- Your hair...

105
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,470
- It's me.
- You cut your hair short.

106
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,870
- Hello.
- You look great with your new hair.

107
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,410
- Thank you.
- This is the hairstyle I want.

108
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,580
(Jumping in abruptly)

109
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,650
- Don't do it.
- This is the hairstyle...

110
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,210
- I want to try.
- Really?

111
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,420
- Yes.
- Don't follow what she did.

112
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,880
- Don't do it.
- This is what I want.

113
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,720
- That's why I got a haircut before.
- Four years ago?

114
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,490
- You know what I did.
- No.

115
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,560
- Just don't do it.
- People would think...

116
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
you had a change of heart.

117
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,990
- Don't do it.
- No.

118
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,790
- Seriously, don't do it.
- No.

119
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,300
We have SOYEON and MIYEON today.

120
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,600
- Welcome.
- Hello.

121
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,100
- You both look like dolls.
- Thank you.

122
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,800
- You look great.
- MIYEON was here before,

123
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,570
- but this is your first time
- Right.

124
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,570
This is my first time here.

125
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,210
- Your first time?
- Yes.

126
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,770
- Right.
- This is my first time being here.

127
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,280
- Why didn't she come sooner?
- I'm really excited now.

128
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,780
SOYEON is known...

129
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,510
- as the copyright queen...
- Right.

130
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,410
- in the idol world.
- That's true.

131
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,050
- Yes. She's famous.
- She wrote many songs.

132
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,850
- I watched a video of her saying,
- Right.

133
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,550
- "Sometimes I get one million."
- No!

134
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,190
- That's not true.
- Seriously?

135
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,820
- Yes.
- She makes one million dollars?

136
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,730
- And sometimes...
- SOYEON.

137
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,600
- Does that put you in trouble?
- There are a lot of articles.

138
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,500
You should buy us a meal.

139
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,870
- Buy us food.
- That's not true.

140
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,370
That's because
she gets the royalties all at once.

141
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,100
Nice to meet you. I'm Choi Daniel.

142
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,100
What?

143
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,610
- Nice to meet you.
- What are you doing?

144
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,610
You're being like this
after hearing about one million.

145
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,610
What was that?

146
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,150
- He's quite ambitious.
- Right.

147
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,280
- I need to introduce myself.
- I see.

148
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,520
By the way, don't idols
like her a lot these days?

149
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,590
- I'm a big fan.
- She's so popular.

150
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,820
How can your skin be so good?

151
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,990
- It's really.
- Stop it.

152
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,190
Your skin looks
like white rice cake.

153
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,330
Why are you saying that?

154
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,090
- She's so pleased.
- What are you doing?

155
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,900
- What was that?
- She really likes it.

156
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
- She's feeling great already.
- What are you doing?

157
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,300
She's so happy.

158
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,400
- She's feeling happy already.
- What's wrong with her?

159
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,770
- She's really...
- Seriously...

160
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,600
- Daniel just said this to Ye Eun.
- What did he say?

161
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,010
"What is she doing?"

162
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,240
(Daniel said, "What is she doing?")

163
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,740
MIYEON did this thing
last time she was here.

164
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,010
- "I don't want to hear it."
- Right.

165
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,310
Do you want to hear
about Chow Yun Fat or not?

166
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,580
That's enough. Stop saying that.

167
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,290
- Stop it.
- I don't want to hear it.

168
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,260
(She came up with the magical phrase
that made old people stay quiet.)

169
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,890
- That's right.
- I don't want to hear it.

170
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,090
- She did.
- "I don't want to hear it."

171
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,600
- Right. "I don't want to hear it."
- She said that a lot.

172
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,030
- You look very hip today.
- I know. Today...

173
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,400
- I'm always hip.
- What...

174
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,200
Seok Jin, why are you being
like this to a young girl?

175
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,000
- Hey.
- You don't know that...

176
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,840
- because you're not interested.
- He's become young.

177
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,270
Your pants are very hip.

178
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,010
- I know, right? I'm always hip.
- Yes.

179
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,840
- The pants...
- They're hip.

180
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,810
I don't know how you feel about me,

181
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,650
but I've always been hip
my whole life.

182
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,880
- Why can't you talk properly?
- Oh, no.

183
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,850
- He can't pronounce it properly.
- Hey.

184
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,120
- I'm...
- "I've always been hip."

185
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,220
Do you think my pants are pretty?

186
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,560
They're not pretty. They're hip.

187
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,030
(The chick's cold-headed evaluation)

188
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,100
(Laughing)

189
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,100
- Right.
- SOYEON.

190
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,430
- Seok Sam doesn't...
- SOYEON is...

191
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,770
- get along with i-dle.
- No.

192
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,640
- I'm sorry.
- I don't get along with i-dle.

193
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,670
Right.

194
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,640
- Both MIYEON and SOYEON.
- They don't get along.

195
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,640
You have Seo Taiji and Boys for you.

196
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,610
Today is Children's Day.

197
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,610
We'll have the Family Month Special
with MIYEON and SOYEON of i-dle.

198
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,820
The race we prepared is
Running Family with Quick Wits.

199
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,720
Today is May 5, Children's Day.

200
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,920
- Right.
- Yes.

201
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,820
- May.
- There's Parents' Day.

202
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,460
And May 15 is Teacher's Day.

203
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,930
At a place that's good
for Family Month,

204
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,200
the members who perform
required actions with quick wits...

205
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,270
- will be given benefits.
- With quick wits?

206
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,600
(The members who perform required actions
will be given benefits.)

207
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,710
And the members who fail to do so
will get a penalty.

208
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,310
- Quick wits?
- First, we will give you a hint...

209
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,510
about the first secret gesture
through a mission.

210
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,150
- What is it?
- Okay.

211
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,480
- There's a mission?
- I see. What would it be?

212
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,120
- The first mission is Wink Mafia.
- What?

213
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,550
While you talk about a given topic,

214
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,620
if you receive a wink
from the mafia, you're out.

215
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,460
Once you're eliminated,
you must wear a mask.

216
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,360
After the mafia eliminates
three citizens,

217
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,000
you can try arresting the mafia.

218
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,470
- If the mafia is arrested,
- It will be fun.

219
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,900
the surviving citizens
receive one point each.

220
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,140
If the arrest fails,
only the mafia receives two points.

221
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,640
During the mission,

222
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,110
you are not allowed to talk
about who the mafia is.

223
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,350
- You can only talk about the topic.
- I see.

224
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,010
The five members
with the highest points...

225
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,720
will get hints on a sliding scale
based on the points.

226
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,880
We should do something...

227
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,950
- about Haha's glasses.
- It's against the rules.

228
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,120
What will you do?

229
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,350
- The glasses...
- What can you do?

230
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,990
- We can't see his eyes.
- The glasses cover his eyes.

231
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,020
- Daniel.
- Yes.

232
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,960
You look good
only with your glasses on.

233
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,990
- That's true.
- Don't you agree?

234
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,460
- The glasses do all the work.
- Your glasses...

235
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,560
You look better when you smile.

236
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,730
Put them back on.

237
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,300
- Put them on.
- Right?

238
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,670
- It's really bad.
- Daniel, it's really bad.

239
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,670
- Put them on.
- My gosh.

240
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,800
He, Pororo, and I
are the top three...

241
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,270
- who look bad without glasses on.
- Right.

242
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,340
And there's Lee Seok Hoon
of SG Wannabe.

243
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,480
- That's right.
- It's not like that.

244
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,780
When I don't wear my glasses,

245
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,210
I look like a baby.

246
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,810
- Come on.
- Baby, my foot.

247
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,020
- You're insulting babies.
- Don't be ridiculous.

248
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,220
- His eyes are very small.
- His eyes... You...

249
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,650
- Jong Kook, your eyes are bigger.
- I think...

250
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,190
- my eyes are bigger.
- Right.

251
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,590
- Right?
- You're right.

252
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,160
- Hey.
- I'm smiling now, and you are...

253
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,830
- keeping a straight face.
- No.

254
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,860
My eyes are bigger
when I keep a straight face.

255
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,930
You're not doing it.

256
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,030
(The two with razor-thin eyes
are comparing their eyes.)

257
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,170
Jong Kook, your eyes are bigger.

258
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,600
You're not doing it.

259
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,900
- You have big eyes.
- I thought I had small eyes.

260
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,270
Does this work?

261
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,440
- That's a wink.
- Did I do it?

262
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,940
- You did it.
- You're at an advantage.

263
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,680
- It's hard to tell.
- I know. It's hard, right?

264
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,810
Daniel, you should try it.

265
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,110
- He's at an advantage.
- He is.

266
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,680
It's hard to tell.

267
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,320
- Right.
- This is really easy for you.

268
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,220
- More than me...
- Hang on.

269
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,220
- Really easy for me?
- It's easy for you.

270
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,650
- Ye Eun, you should try.
- How should I wink?

271
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,690
Try winking at me.

272
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,690
- Her cheeks are twitching.
- Why are you...

273
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,130
- You look a little...
- What?

274
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,730
- You look clumsy.
- You look silly.

275
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,060
- What?
- What was that?

276
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,530
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

277
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
Can't you wink?

278
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,370
MIYEON, how do you...
Show us how you wink.

279
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,700
I'm not good at winking.

280
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,800
- Go ahead.
- Try it.

281
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,310
- That's not bad.
- Good.

282
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,070
(A wink that's been trained
through her idol career)

283
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,210
- It's not bad.
- SOYEON, try it.

284
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,180
(A wink that's been trained
through her idol career)

285
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,910
- That's good.
- You're good.

286
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,250
As expected.

287
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,280
Let's start the game.

288
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,850
We will randomly select the mafia.

289
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,820
Close your eyes and make noises
by tapping your lap.

290
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,490
Someone from the production crew
will poke the back of the mafia.

291
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,730
- The one who gets poked.
- Yes.

292
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,330
- Get poked?
- Close your eyes.

293
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,760
The first mafia. It's difficult.

294
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,830
(Ji Ye Eun)

295
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,070
- All right.
- No.

296
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,870
- Is it done?
- No.

297
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,140
No.

298
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,110
Open your eyes now.

299
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,440
- Is it over?
- It's done.

300
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,840
If the mafia kills three citizens
without getting caught,

301
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,380
- the mafia wins.
- Good.

302
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,650
(Will the wink-fool Ye Eun
be able to kill 3 citizens?)

303
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,780
(They study each other's faces
in the beginning.)

304
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,850
Good.

305
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,550
What? Seok Jin seems nervous.

306
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,620
- The mafia wins with three kills.
- Good.

307
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,020
We have to look
at each other's faces.

308
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,260
- Right.
- We should see each other.

309
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,090
Ji Hyo seems a little uncomfortable.

310
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,730
Me? No, I'm just
observing the others.

311
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,260
(While the others look
at the other side...)

312
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,960
(Wink)

313
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,670
(She succeeds in attacking
Jee Seok Sam.)

314
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,140
- Ji Ye Eun is being strange.
- Ji Ye Eun...

315
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Ji Ye Eun is being strange.

316
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,840
- Ye Eun suddenly...
- Why?

317
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,710
- I think it's Ye Eun.
- I think she just did something.

318
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,810
The topic of the conversation...

319
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,310
is what you want to eat for lunch.

320
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,780
- Lunch sounds good,
- Hey.

321
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,850
- Good.
- Lunch!

322
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,380
- Lunch.
- Lunch menu.

323
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,450
What do you want to eat, SOYEON?

324
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,620
- Me?
- Well...

325
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,150
- Tteokbokki.
- Excuse me.

326
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,320
- What?
- What? Are you out?

327
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,120
- Already?
- Is it over already?

328
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,590
(The world knows
that Jee Seok Jin is out.)

329
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,200
- He got killed quickly.
- It must be over here.

330
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,460
- What?
- Seriously...

331
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,830
- My goodness.
- It happened so quickly.

332
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,970
I wasn't looking at anyone,
but it happened in a flash.

333
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,000
(No one saw Ye Eun's wink.)

334
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,340
- The mafia is so good.
- My goodness.

335
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,500
- It was so quick.
- When did it happen?

336
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,700
It happened so quickly.

337
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,040
(Screaming)

338
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,170
- I was startled.
- What?

339
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,380
It happened so quickly.

340
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,610
(SOYEON, who's sitting
next to Mafia Ji, is out too.)

341
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,240
- No.
- What?

342
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,250
- Seriously?
- SOYEON.

343
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,810
- Really?
- It must be around here.

344
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,180
- Around here.
- It must be Jae Seok.

345
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,280
- What?
- That was great.

346
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,580
- It must be Jae Seok.
- It's not me.

347
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,990
- No.
- If one more is killed...

348
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,050
They all are really good.

349
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,360
Please talk about the lunch menu.

350
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,590
MIYEON, for lunch...

351
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,290
- What?
- What?

352
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,390
(Including Se Chan, three citizens
got killed in an instant.)

353
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,830
Three citizens were killed.

354
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,100
(Including Se Chan, three citizens
got killed in an instant.)

355
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,330
- One more...
- All right. It's over.

356
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,730
- What?
- Arrest the mafia now.

357
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,300
It must be around here.

358
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,940
- Seriously?
- Around here.

359
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
Look.

360
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,970
The angle is this way.

361
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,510
- And it has to be quick.
- Now...

362
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,470
- It's either Ji Hyo or Daniel.
- Daniel.

363
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,740
- It's either Ji Hyo or Daniel.
- It must be Daniel.

364
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,210
- I think it's Daniel.
- Daniel.

365
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,650
- Because Daniel...
- The angle is that way.

366
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,980
Because Daniel...

367
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,550
- has small eyes.
- Yes.

368
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,550
- It's easy for him to wink quickly.
- And...

369
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,650
- Seok Jin said it was quick.
- Right.

370
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,860
- It's Ji Hyo or Daniel.
- It's Daniel.

371
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,320
- One, two, three.
- Daniel.

372
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,490
- Daniel.
- Daniel.

373
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,030
Daniel got the most votes.

374
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,030
- It must be Daniel.
- The mafia of this round is...

375
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,970
- Ji Ye Eun.
- My goodness.

376
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,000
- What?
- Ji Ye Eun?

377
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,030
- Hang on.
- Really? How?

378
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,270
- I...
- Wait.

379
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,570
- Ji Ye Eun.
- My goodness.

380
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,870
- What?
- Ji Ye Eun?

381
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,870
- Hang on.
- Really? How?
Wait.

382
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,040
- Did someone else kill you?
- What's with him?

383
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,210
- I...
- He killed me.

384
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,210
Someone touched me.

385
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,340
- You...
- Me too.

386
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,410
- He killed me.
- What? Hang on.

387
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,810
- He killed me.
- I got touched.

388
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,450
- Someone touched me.
- In the back?

389
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,620
- No.
- Back?

390
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,450
- No, my hand.
- It should be the back.

391
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,020
- Your hand?
- What are you doing?

392
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,260
- What's wrong with him?
- Hey!

393
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,660
- Seriously...
- You...

394
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,290
- But...
- What happened?

395
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,430
- Then...
- What's wrong with you?

396
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,990
- Did my glasses fall on my hand?
- Who killed you, SOYEON?

397
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,330
- It was Daniel.
- I see.

398
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,330
- What are you doing?
- Listen.

399
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,230
- I was tapping my lap like this.
- And?

400
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,770
- Someone touched my hand.
- Okay.

401
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,470
So I thought I was the mafia.

402
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,010
It turns out
my glasses fell on my hand.

403
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,710
(When the glasses fell, he thought
the production crew touched him.)

404
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:29,490
(Without knowing that,
the fake mafia worked hard.)

405
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,620
- Come on.
- Darn it.

406
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,560
- You fool!
- What are you doing?

407
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,460
- What was that?
- Didn't I win?

408
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,830
- No.
- But...

409
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,960
- I thought it was Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun...

410
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,730
- It happened so suddenly.
- This is "X-Man."

411
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,970
We have to do this again.

412
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,700
- Let's do it again.
- This round doesn't count.

413
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,070
- Let's do it again.
- Oh, no.

414
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,370
Please close your eyes
and tap the table.

415
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,570
We will poke you in the back.

416
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,570
(They pick the mafia again.)

417
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,410
(The new mafia is selected.)

418
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,650
(The mafia is poked in the back
to know the identity.)

419
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,450
- Open your eyes now.
- Okay.

420
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,080
We should be careful
in the beginning.

421
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,550
We should look at their eyes.

422
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,120
But I can't look at their eyes.

423
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,220
Let's see each other's eyes.

424
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,450
(Let's see each other's eyes.)

425
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,490
- Okay.
- This is...

426
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,060
It's not easy to wink here.

427
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,190
It's not easy.

428
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,190
You didn't talk about lunch earlier.

429
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,460
- Lunch.
- Lunch.

430
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,600
No one talked about it.

431
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,960
- All right.
- Lunch.

432
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,730
- Sundaeguk for a day like this.
- Milmyeon.

433
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,540
- We should have gukbap.
- Makguksu with perilla oil.

434
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,740
- Makguksu with perilla oil.
- It sounds good.

435
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,270
- It sounds delicious.
- Right.

436
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,340
- SOYEON?
- Milmyeon.

437
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,870
- Milmyeon sounds good.
- Milmyeon.

438
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,870
- Milmyeon?
- Yes.

439
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,610
- MIYEON?
- Naengmyeon.

440
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,640
- Naengmyeon.
- Naengmyeon.

441
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,850
What about gamjatang?

442
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,110
- That sounds good.
- Gamjatang.

443
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,180
- It's hot.
- Aglio e olio.

444
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,320
- What?
- Aglio e olio.

445
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,390
- What you had yesterday.
- Me.

446
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,150
- Gukbap.
- Pork and rice soup.

447
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,020
- Gukbap.
- Gukbap.

448
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,720
- Milmyeon.
- Pasta.

449
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,530
- Milmyeon.
- He got killed.

450
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,560
- He got killed.
- Hey.

451
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,660
- Milmyeon.
- Daniel, are you out?

452
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,830
- Oh, no.
- When did you get killed?

453
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,930
- When did it happen?
- He's out.

454
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,130
- Unbelievable.
- Daniel.

455
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,930
- When did it happen?
- When did he get killed?

456
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,970
(Who is the mafia
who killed Daniel so secretly?)

457
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,640
- It happened so quickly.
- He got killed.

458
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,870
- Go ahead and kill me.
- Really?

459
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,740
Kill me if you want.

460
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,810
Go ahead and do it.

461
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,180
You should keep talking.

462
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,640
- We should talk about lunch.
- Right.

463
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,880
- Lunch.
- We should talk about lunch.

464
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
- Now...
- Gukbap.

465
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,780
you can talk about members
who have an unlucky face.

466
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,220
- An unlucky face?
- It's physiognomy.

467
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,190
I think Se Chan is unlucky.

468
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,420
- Why?
- What's the reason?

469
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,090
It's a little...

470
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,490
He looks unlucky.

471
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,560
- Jae Seok.
- Hey.

472
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
- Hey, Ji Ye Eun.
- You're just insulting him.

473
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,360
- You just say random things.
- Hey.

474
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,370
Are you saying he's ugly? What?

475
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,500
- I mean...
- Is he ugly?

476
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,970
It looks like something is missing.

477
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,770
- I got killed.
- You.

478
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,470
- I got killed.
- What?

479
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,470
I got killed.

480
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,610
I got killed.

481
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,840
- What?
- You did?

482
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,480
- You got killed?
- It must be one of them.

483
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,250
- Over here.
- One of them.

484
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,980
(They suspect those who are
sitting across Jae Seok and Daniel.)

485
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,650
- Did you get killed?
- I know who it is.

486
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,950
- You got killed?
- I know.

487
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,390
- You know?
- It's here.

488
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,360
- Those two are killed.
- It happened in a flash.

489
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,820
It happened so quickly.

490
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,330
I was really surprised.

491
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,590
- It happened quickly.
- What?

492
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,900
Keep talking about members
with an unlucky face.

493
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,000
SOYEON.

494
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,870
You're back with a new album,

495
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,470
but your outfit is quite simple,
which is really nice.

496
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,600
- What are you doing?
- She looks good.

497
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,070
- This is what's cool.
- I think it's pretty.

498
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,510
I picked 1 of the 5 hairpins...

499
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,080
- for today.
- She's dressed up.

500
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,240
- This is what's cool.
- It's a crown.

501
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,710
- This is cool.
- It's a little...

502
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,380
I think the pin is strange.

503
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,520
(It's a little...
I think the pin is strange.)

504
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,220
- That's the point.
- I think it's strange.

505
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,320
- Is Seok Jin dead?
- What?

506
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,550
- What?
- What?

507
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,620
(Seok Sam is out
after saying ridiculous things.)

508
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,860
- Is Seok Jin dead?
- What?

509
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,360
- What?
- What happened?

510
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,830
- What was that?
- Now,

511
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,260
- I was surprised.
- the rest...

512
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,460
- of the citizens...
- It must be here.

513
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,130
- should arrest the mafia.
- It must be one of them.

514
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,000
- These two are killed,
- Seriously.

515
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,800
- the mafia is good.
- I think it's one of them.

516
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,040
- Right.
- I was looking at Ye Eun,

517
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,070
- but I don't think she's the mafia.
- She didn't wink.

518
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,200
I was looking at Ye Eun,

519
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,240
- but I don't think she's the mafia.
- She didn't wink.

520
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,180
- It's here.
- It's Jong Kook.

521
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,840
- It's not me.
- Seriously, it's him.

522
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,310
- No. It's her.
- All right then.

523
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,450
- It's SOYEON.
- Why do you keep...

524
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,180
- That's because it's you.
- No.

525
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,680
- It must be Jong Kook.
- Yes.

526
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,050
- What?
- It's SOYEON...

527
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,290
- or MIYEON.
- Yes.

528
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,490
In this round,

529
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,720
- he's being quiet.
- My goodness.

530
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,390
- Right.
- I think...

531
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,960
- He sat back a little.
- I...

532
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,030
- That's right.
- No.

533
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,330
That's because I was afraid
people would choose me.

534
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,500
I'm serious. Trust me.

535
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,130
- It's MIYEON or...
- Is it you, MIYEON?

536
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,830
- No.
- Because... It might not be MIYEON.

537
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,670
But here's what I think.

538
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,370
It's hard to kill the person
right next to you.

539
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,640
(He says MIYEON attacked the person
next to her, which is hard.)

540
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,380
- Exactly. It's hard.
- MIYEON was being pretty, right?

541
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,010
- Good.
- She's just pretty.

542
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,210
- Pretty?
- No.

543
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,350
Pretty?

544
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,020
I kept checking him.

545
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,950
- And I saw her too.
- It's not me.

546
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,990
- You checked...
- He killed them...

547
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,620
- while checking their eyes.
- Right.

548
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,160
- I think it's Jong Kook.
- And...

549
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,890
while we were laughing together,

550
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,060
- Jae Seok got killed.
- Right.

551
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,360
- While we were laughing?
- I think Jong Kook killed him...

552
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,700
while laughing like this.

553
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,770
- It's Jong Kook.
- And think of the angle.

554
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,600
- Killing these two is...
- Exactly.

555
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,370
- That means it's over here.
- Listen to me.

556
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,600
It's not me.

557
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,840
The reasoning... It's not you?

558
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,880
- Listen carefully.
- It must be him.

559
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,980
It's not me. Look at me.

560
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,250
When I do things like this,

561
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,480
I often chuckle
because I feel a little embarrassed.

562
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,150
- Seriously.
- You seemed embarrassed.

563
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,690
No.

564
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,820
- There you go!
- It's her.

565
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,820
She wouldn't give in.
Catch him.

566
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,060
- Being embarrassed is...
- It's SOYEON...

567
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,730
- or Ddochi.
- What? Now it looks like...

568
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,360
- It must be Jong Kook.
- Ddochi?

569
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,730
- It's Jong Kook.
- No.

570
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,000
- Listen. It's not me.
- It's Jong Kook.

571
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,630
- One, two,
- It's either her or...

572
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,770
- three.
- SOYEON?

573
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,340
- Jong Kook. It can't be helped.
- Jong Kook.

574
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,540
- All right. Jong Kook...
- It's Ddochi,

575
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,440
- got the most votes.
- I'm telling you.

576
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,170
- I'm serious.
- The mafia is...

577
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,710
(Is Jong Kook the mafia?)

578
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,110
- The mafia is...
- It's you, right?

579
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,710
(MIYEON was the Mafia.)

580
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,520
- It was MIYEON.
- What?

581
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,950
Was it MIYEON?

582
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,990
- No way.
- You winked that way, didn't you?

583
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,590
She winked when she looked this way.

584
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,790
(While Seok Sam was distracting
everyone with aglio e olio)

585
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,960
(Silently, she assassinated Daniel.)

586
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,400
(Goodness)

587
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,300
(She boldly targeted Jae Seok
who was next to her.)

588
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,410
(Lastly, she killed
the weakest link Seok Sam.)

589
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,480
(Her strategy was as perfect
as her stunning beauty.)

590
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,010
- Haha's clueless.
- He can be such a fool.

591
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,550
- He was right.
- It was MIYEON.

592
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,050
I told you it was one of them.

593
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,050
- I feel so betrayed.
- What? Why?

594
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,320
- How did it even happen?
- I'm so shocked.

595
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,590
- Wasn't it you?
- It wasn't.

596
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,950
MIYEON smiled and...

597
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,720
- What?
- Why did you think it was me?

598
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,320
She managed to take out
the ones next to her.

599
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,030
I have to say this, though.

600
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,400
It felt nice to get a wink from her.

601
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,430
What are you saying?

602
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,130
- Come on, mister!
- It's true.

603
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,830
- It was a game, but it felt nice.
- Really?

604
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,200
And SOYEON was right next to her.

605
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,700
- Who did you target?
- I thought I'd get caught.

606
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,840
- Did you target the naive ones?
- Gosh, no.

607
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,740
- It's because they were close.
- Why did you choose us?

608
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,980
You chose...

609
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,780
- the naive ones.
- Yes, the naive ones.

610
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,650
- No way.
- They had glasses on.

611
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,810
I would've targeted Haha next.

612
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,180
MIYEON played well though.

613
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,380
- She did.
- I knew she'd be good at this.

614
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,980
You should've seen her
when she smiled.

615
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,350
I'll announce the next Mafia.

616
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,390
- Please close your eyes.
- No!

617
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,720
- Please, no.
- Don't look.

618
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,520
- I was already accused once.
- I don't want to be a Mafia.

619
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,730
- Don't come near me.
- No!

620
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,660
(Jae Seok is the Mafia this round.)

621
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,760
Please, no.

622
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,160
Done.

623
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,800
(Mixed feelings)

624
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,830
I don't get
why I'm nervous about this.

625
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,900
This...

626
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,140
This is nerve-racking.

627
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,640
(The kids make a fuss.)

628
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,770
The wink could come at you
right off the bat.

629
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
(Fidgeting)

630
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,980
- It begins when we talk.
- Really?

631
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,310
- Not before?
- Why are you wearing glasses?

632
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,510
- So not before.
- I had these on.

633
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,420
- Even in the last round.
- Really?

634
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,980
It could be the same person.

635
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,150
- Of course.
- Yes, we should be careful.

636
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,520
- Give it to us.
- You'll be talking about...

637
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,320
the nicknames
you want to give one another.

638
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,420
- Nicknames?
- Give everyone new nicknames.

639
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,090
- New nicknames?
- But we already have many.

640
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,700
We have nicknames.
Many, to be exact.

641
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,630
SOYEON's hair.

642
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,530
There's a mushroom
called lion's mane.

643
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,140
(Identical)

644
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,570
Come on.

645
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,240
- That's the worst.
- Lion's mane mushroom.

646
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,070
- Seok Jin can be cruel.
- I love it.

647
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,940
- Lion's mane mushroom.
- It's cute.

648
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,480
(While everyone was smirking
at the innovative nickname)

649
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,650
(Mafia Yu is looking for a window.)

650
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,950
(Activated)

651
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,390
It's cute.

652
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,060
(Se Chan is the first to die.)

653
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,990
(Se Chan's out.)

654
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,560
- He's out. Se Chan's out.
- What?

655
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,600
- Se Chan got hit.
- When?

656
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,200
- When did it happen?
- What on earth?

657
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,970
It was before he could say anything.

658
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,470
- When did it happen?
- What?

659
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,800
- It can't be one of them.
- I know.

660
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,440
- Who was it?
- The Mafia isn't on this side.

661
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,270
- Look at one person each.
- Right.

662
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,680
I'll do just that.

663
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,980
(While everyone
is focused on Jong Kook)

664
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,180
(Delivering his second wink)

665
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,680
(Haha's out.)

666
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,990
Who is it?

667
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,150
I'll look at one person each.

668
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,190
You'll now talk
about something else.

669
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,390
- What happened?
- Hold on.

670
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,930
- When did it happen?
- Is this how it happens?

671
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,360
- The Mafia is on this side.
- What on earth?

672
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,200
(Stellar acting from the Mafia)

673
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,600
- When were you targeted?
- Over here.

674
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,330
- Song Ji Hyo!
- The Mafia is over here.

675
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,770
- When were you targeted?
- The Mafia is over here.

676
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,340
- Talk about your weekends.
- Sure.

677
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,300
- What we did on the weekend?
- On the weekend?

678
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,340
- On the weekend?
- What did we do on the weekend?

679
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,510
- What did I do?
- On the weekend?

680
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,780
MIYEON, what did you do
on the weekend?

681
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,840
- Yesterday, we had work.
- Yes, we worked.

682
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,250
- Seok Sam?
- Over here.

683
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,550
I think I went
for a walk this weekend.

684
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,950
- Why are you uncertain?
- Something about that...

685
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,990
- You went for a walk?
- Do you need an alibi?

686
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,650
Why are you uncertain?

687
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,090
(Firing his last shot)

688
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,190
(Seok Jin's out.)

689
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,660
Seok Jin.

690
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,360
- Hold on.
- What is it?

691
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,030
Did you get hit?

692
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,570
- The round is over.
- What?

693
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,170
- Three of you were eliminated.
- Wait.

694
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,070
- Those remaining...
- What happened?

695
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,770
will guess who the Mafia is...

696
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,900
- and make an accusation.
- I'm clueless.

697
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,040
- What on earth?
- It's one of these three.

698
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,410
- It's him.
- It's Jae Seok.

699
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,740
- I think...
- It's Jae Seok.

700
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,240
- It's him.
- Right?

701
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,450
- It's not me.
- It's Jae Seok.

702
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,010
- It really isn't me, SOYEON.
- Jae Seok?

703
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,520
- It's not me.
- I think it's him.

704
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,750
- I'm feeling it.
- Hear me out.

705
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,420
Look at who was eliminated.
One, two, and three.

706
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,490
- You have to watch closely.
- I did.

707
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,490
The three of them were eliminated.

708
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,490
- Exactly.
- That's what I saw.

709
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,230
The three of them were eliminated.

710
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,660
Exactly. These three.
They're in your range.

711
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,560
Jae Seok, I think it's you.

712
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,330
- It's you.
- It's just...

713
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,600
- It's so you.
- It's not me.

714
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,140
- It's one of the two.
- During this round,

715
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,510
you said "It's not me" way too much.

716
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,870
- Exactly.
- But I wasn't accused...

717
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,280
in previous rounds.

718
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,210
This time, you're accusing me.

719
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,250
I'm telling you
not to make a mistake.

720
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,620
I had my eyes on MIYEON...

721
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,080
since someone could play
the Mafia twice.

722
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,590
- It's not her.
- It's not me.

723
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,790
- Isn't it you?
- I think it's him.

724
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,820
- It's not me.
- Guys.

725
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,090
- Daniel should be on the hook too.
- No way.

726
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,460
Also, let me say this.

727
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,000
- They were easy targets.
- When Seok Jin became...

728
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,230
the third target,

729
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,230
I realized we were dealing
with a smart culprit.

730
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,240
I could tell the Mafia was smart.

731
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,470
When we talked about our weekends,

732
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,440
we were focused on Seok Jin
because he was talking.

733
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,210
- That's when he targeted Seok Jin.
- Goodness.

734
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,780
(That's why it's Jae Seok.)

735
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,910
- It's Jae Seok.
- It's Jae Seok.

736
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,650
- Exactly.
- It's Jae Seok.

737
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,850
- That's really smart.
- That's a skill.

738
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,390
Are you not going to suspect Daniel?

739
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,520
- No.
- No.

740
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,390
It was evident in your tone.

741
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,820
- That's right.
- You'll accuse someone...

742
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,490
- on the count of three.
- I can't believe you.

743
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,360
In 1, 2, 3. Daniel.

744
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,400
(Everyone chooses Jae Seok
except Jae Seok.)

745
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,670
- Only Jae Seok chose Daniel.
- Right.

746
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,400
Meanwhile, the rest chose Jae Seok.

747
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,170
For this round,

748
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,640
Jae Seok was the Mafia.

749
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,210
Seriously.

750
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,510
- What did I tell you?
- I knew it.

751
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,980
Daniel said it felt nice...

752
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,740
to be winked at.

753
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,410
To me, it felt filthy.

754
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,080
It felt like being shot by a gun.

755
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,720
That's how it felt.

756
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,790
I was laughing like crazy...

757
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,150
- Right.
- when someone with crooked teeth...

758
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,420
It felt like being shot by a gun.

759
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,090
- This...
- It felt filthy.

760
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,630
- It didn't feel good.
- You can't help...

761
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,130
but target the naive.

762
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,760
- Right?
- You can't help it.

763
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,370
You don't target those
who are sharp.

764
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,030
His wink was nothing like MIYEON's.

765
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,270
- Right.
- It felt weird...

766
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,570
- to get a wink from him.
- Do you have the next Mafia?

767
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,070
- This is a lot of fun.
- It felt so weird.

768
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,470
In the first round, there will be...

769
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,040
five secret gestures.

770
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,080
There will be five hints
that point to those gestures.

771
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,150
MIYEON is currently in the lead...

772
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,950
- with four points.
- We couldn't guess her.

773
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,090
- MIYEON got away with it.
- Tied in second place...

774
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,190
are Ji Hyo, SOYEON,
Ye Eun, and Jong Kook.

775
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,920
So the five of them...

776
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,290
will receive three hints.

777
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,260
- Those who weren't caught.
- The remaining five...

778
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,660
will only get two.

779
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,170
- Not bad.
- Please come here...

780
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,200
- and check them out together.
- Okay.

781
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,570
Jong Kook...

782
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,470
- can see these three.
- Sure.

783
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,940
- Can we see them?
- Do we look at them together?

784
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,010
- This?
- Yes, together.

785
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,480
- I'm curious.
- Let's see what we have.

786
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,010
- What's this?
- Feet?

787
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,780
Someone's feet.

788
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,510
- Someone's getting off a vehicle.
- Isn't that a vehicle?

789
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,050
Is that a vehicle?

790
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,050
- Yes, someone's getting off it.
- Isn't that a vehicle?

791
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,020
- Someone's getting off a vehicle.
- Isn't it parked?

792
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,750
Are we playing as individuals?

793
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,760
- Yes, as individuals.
- I should keep my mouth shut.

794
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,790
Right.

795
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,630
(The second hint)

796
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,060
(Jegichagi?)

797
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,600
Okay, got it.

798
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,470
(Then, the third hint)

799
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,600
- What's this?
- Meat?

800
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,000
- Chuck flap tail?
- Chuck flap tail?

801
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,270
(Barcodes for chuck flap tail
that get smaller in size?)

802
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,310
Why were we given the same ones?

803
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,910
Right. I get it.

804
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,510
- What?
- What is it?

805
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,580
(Did Detective Kim's hunch kick in
the moment he saw it?)

806
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,920
- Can't you tell us?
- Well...

807
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,580
- Please tell us.
- I'm just inferring.

808
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,850
- How?
- What made you think it?

809
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,690
- Well, my guess...
- How did you do it?

810
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,090
- What could these be?
- All right. Let's do this.

811
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,490
Let's guess what these can be.

812
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,530
(What secret gestures
do these three hints point to?)

813
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,400
- Now, the weaklings.
- Unbelievable.

814
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,060
- Wait.
- What's this?

815
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,700
- Did you see this?
- What is it?

816
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,830
Who's in the red shorts?

817
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,130
Isn't it Jong Kook?

818
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,540
- What is this?
- What's this?

819
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,770
This isn't a photo of us.
Our legs aren't this thick.

820
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,840
(5 people are at the red line.)

821
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,610
I know what this is.

822
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,440
It's left foot first,
then right foot.

823
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,210
(Is left foot and right
the right order?)

824
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,510
- You're right.
- Are we playing as individuals?

825
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,920
(Did you step in first
with your right foot?)

826
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,890
(The basics in a Game of Wits
on Running Man)

827
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,450
(Being unskilled detectives,)

828
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,290
(they think about the order
of the feet first.)

829
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,890
Unlike the others,
only he has his left foot forward.

830
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,260
(Only the one in red shorts
has his left foot forward.)

831
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,460
There's the R sticker too.

832
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,930
- Exactly.
- The left foot.

833
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,300
What's this?

834
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,700
Wait. Isn't this our bus?

835
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,900
(Even the remaining hint suggests
getting on with the left foot?)

836
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,000
Isn't this our bus?

837
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,770
- Look.
- This is left foot or right foot.

838
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,070
When getting on a bus...

839
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,140
Quiet.

840
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,040
- Here's the left foot.
- Yes, the left foot.

841
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,780
- The left foot.
- The left foot comes forward again.

842
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,440
- Okay, got it.
- But...

843
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,280
You'll change clothes...

844
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,480
and gather back here
so that we can move out.

845
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,580
What could this be?

846
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,390
The chubby fat under your eyes.

847
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,520
- Did you always have that?
- It's aegyosal.

848
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,890
- Was that drawn?
- Yes.

849
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,660
- Draw some for him too.
- Really?

850
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,060
- I...
- Do you want me to?

851
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,430
- It's fine.
- Here.

852
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,030
- Would that do the trick?
- Should I?

853
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,060
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

854
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Should I do it?

855
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,630
- Will it give me aegyosal?
- Yes.

856
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,970
- Go ahead.
- Try it, Seok Jin.

857
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,570
- But this...
- Gather around.

858
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,340
Try it on one side first.

859
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,640
- Under your eyes.
- Draw it for him.

860
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,940
- Keep your eyes open.
- Seok Jin wants this.

861
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,210
Aegyosal.

862
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,750
- Is it done?
- Seok Jin.

863
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,350
- See?
- You suddenly have aegyosal.

864
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,420
- Do I...
- Look at the camera.

865
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,420
(Does he really have aegyosal?)

866
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,620
Seok Jin, you're giving me
Lady Gaga vibes.

867
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,020
- What did you do to me?
- Well...

868
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,490
SOYEON, can you...

869
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,630
SOYEON, be honest with me.

870
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,960
- What is it?
- Should I remove this?

871
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,100
(Asking the one
who speaks her mind to him)

872
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,770
I quite like it.

873
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,900
- Are you trying to be funny?
- I quite like it.

874
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,340
- But...
- She gave him aegyosal.

875
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,270
- He wants to look younger.
- I want to look cool.

876
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,870
- Are you trying to be cool?
- Yes.

877
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,040
- How much younger does he seem?
- Really?

878
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,010
- About three years?
- Hold on.

879
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,410
Three years?
So he looks like he's in his 30s.

880
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,520
- His 30s?
- Yes.

881
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,750
- Is he in his 50s?
- No, his 60s.

882
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,820
- Right now?
- Yes.

883
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,220
- Is he in his 60s?
- Yes.

884
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,150
He already looks young for his age.

885
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,260
You'll now head
to the first destination.

886
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,490
- Sure.
- Got it.

887
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,030
You were told...

888
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,400
that this race is to celebrate...

889
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,330
- Family Month in May.
- Sure.

890
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,930
You'll go to a large supermarket
where buying gifts for children...

891
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,270
- is easy.
- Really?

892
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,500
- A large supermarket?
- A supermarket.

893
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,170
You'll get on the bus now.

894
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,710
You can begin
to do the secret gestures.

895
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,710
- Now?
- It starts now?

896
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,880
- It starts now.
- Now?

897
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,340
- Yes.
- It starts now?

898
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,980
(Se Chan follows the bus...)

899
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,150
Let's get going.

900
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,250
(boarding hint and runs ahead.)

901
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,780
(Seok Jin follows close behind.)

902
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,090
Left foot first.

903
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,320
Why did you run?

904
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,360
(Left foot 2)

905
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,360
Gosh, that hurt.

906
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,030
(Left foot 3)

907
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,030
(Left foot 4)

908
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,630
Is someone checking this?

909
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,630
(Left foot 5)

910
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,030
- What...
- Okay.

911
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,170
Wait, what's going on?

912
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,570
Go on. Let's see what you do.

913
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,570
- You go ahead.
- What's going on?

914
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,870
- It's not okay.
- What is this?

915
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,910
Success.

916
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,270
(Right foot 3)

917
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,140
This gesture...

918
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,250
(Hint 1)

919
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,380
(They all board,
doing what they think is right.)

920
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,380
- Can I sit here?
- I don't want to hear it.

921
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,150
- I don't want to hear it.
- I don't want to hear it.

922
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,690
- It opens. I'll...
- No, it's fine.

923
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,260
We already have a member
who succeeded in doing...

924
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,720
- the secret gesture.
- Who's that?

925
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,430
- I think it's me.
- It's me.

926
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,860
- I think it's me.
- It's Se Chan.

927
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,660
- It's me.
- Before you got into the van,

928
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,070
we said we were going to a place
related to Children's Day,

929
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,070
- which was a hint for you all.
- Yes.

930
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,770
Then some of you got a photo hint
of someone boarding a van.

931
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,970
That meant...

932
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,680
(First secret gesture:
Be the fifth person to board)

933
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,880
you should be
the fifth person to board.

934
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,680
Today is May 5, Children's Day.

935
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,520
- Who is it?
- We're going to a place for kids.

936
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,720
- It's me.
- Out of you all,

937
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,090
- the fifth person to board...
- Me.

938
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,620
(Who was the fifth to board?)

939
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,290
- What?
- Why did you run?

940
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,460
Gosh, that hurt.

941
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,660
(Hesitant)

942
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,990
Is it the left or right foot?

943
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,430
I'll go first.

944
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,400
(Daniel)

945
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,770
- Me.
- It's Daniel.

946
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,640
- It's me!
- You didn't know, did you?

947
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,680
I didn't know.

948
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,340
- How lucky.
- Then...

949
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,780
it wasn't the left or right foot?

950
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,850
- It was the order you got on.
- Darn it!

951
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,150
I counted how many had gotten in.
I let him go first...

952
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,090
because I saw SOYEON
get in right foot first.

953
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,420
I wanted to be the fifth person
to board left foot first.

954
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,660
- Really?
- You thought about being fifth?

955
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,630
- Yes.
- I didn't think of that.

956
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,160
It was the number five.

957
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,300
I thought it was a race
because of you.

958
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,760
- Sorry. I wanted to board first.
- I got lucky.

959
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,130
- Shoot.
- Now...

960
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,470
there are four secret gestures left.

961
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,470
Once you reach
the place where you'll shop,

962
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,970
you can each get something...

963
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,910
- Oh, really?
- that costs...

964
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:31,910
- under 100 dollars.
- For real?

965
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,910
- For real?
- Including a gift for a child?

966
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,810
- Today, you're the children.
- Good.

967
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,920
- Your budget is 100 dollars.
- That's amazing.

968
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,250
- Is it really for us?
- I love it.

969
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,280
Can we keep it?

970
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,350
The condition is,

971
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,520
only the first five people
to do the secret gesture...

972
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,430
- get to keep what they buy.
- You need to know what it is.

973
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,490
Daniel succeeded already.

974
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,830
So you can help the other members
as you're shopping.

975
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,630
- Can I? Got it.
- Yes.

976
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,270
You need to know
what the gesture is.

977
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,340
What could it be? What is this?

978
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,640
- Let's have a look.
- No.

979
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,910
I'm hurt.

980
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,710
Show me, and I'll show you.

981
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,150
If you treat me like this...

982
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,450
Show me, and I'll show you.

983
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,780
(They share their hints.)

984
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,820
- What?
- What is this?

985
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,820
(Ye Eun's hint)

986
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,390
What? This is so hard.

987
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,160
MIYEON sees in slow motion.

988
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,090
Are we to buy this or what?

989
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,160
- Do we buy this?
- I think so.

990
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,600
I'm so pleased to meet you.
It's my first time seeing you.

991
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,800
- Same here. We're i-dle.
- It's a pleasure.

992
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,870
Yes, I heard. MIYEON...

993
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,700
- They're i-dle.
- I saw you a lot.

994
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,400
- They're i-dle.
- I know. Earlier on,

995
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,870
- MIYEON was to one side of me.
- Yes.

996
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,840
She turned like this
and winked at me.

997
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,350
That pose was just...

998
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,750
- You felt butterflies?
- You like the pose?

999
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,480
I had to turn.

1000
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,880
I saw MIYEON in slow motion.

1001
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,490
- That happens.
- She winked in slow motion.

1002
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,750
I saw Jae Seok's wink
in slow motion too.

1003
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,590
- A slow motion wink.
- That's awesome.

1004
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,390
(Gross)

1005
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,230
Your glasses make you look good.

1006
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,430
- It hit me really hard.
- Seok Jin.

1007
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,700
I look like a baby
without my glasses.

1008
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,240
- You look like a baby?
- You do look young for your age.

1009
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,640
- You're in your 60s?
- He's in his 60s.

1010
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,240
- I had no idea.
- It's true.

1011
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,510
I didn't know either.

1012
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,880
- SOYEON. Your voice...
- Hey.

1013
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,780
- hits hard.
- It sounds so annoying.

1014
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,920
It rings in your ears.

1015
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,180
Yes. That's why you're the rapper.

1016
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,620
You do look young.
I thought you were 55.

1017
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,090
- Me too.
- That's what I thought.

1018
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,290
Isn't it the same thing?

1019
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,720
- Hey, that's the same thing!
- That's the same thing.

1020
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,930
- I don't look that much younger.
- I thought he was in his 50s.

1021
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,330
- I don't look too young.
- Listen.

1022
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,130
Is your big birthday party
next year?

1023
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,500
- Yes.
- We must celebrate.

1024
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,270
- We'll do it on Running Man.
- He's 62.

1025
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,530
- Can you not do that?
- Running Man...

1026
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,270
Did your dad have a big party?

1027
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,070
- I don't think he did.
- See?

1028
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,540
- My dad had a big party.
- Did he?

1029
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,810
- Her voice almost zaps you.
- "My dad had a big party."

1030
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,480
"My dad had a big party."

1031
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,710
He's getting annoyed.

1032
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,710
- Seok Jin's getting scarred.
- I'm getting annoyed.

1033
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,620
- We rented a buffet restaurant.
- Did you?

1034
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,820
- We celebrated.
- They did.

1035
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,450
- Her voice has a unique tone.
- Gosh, SOYEON...

1036
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,020
- It rings.
- Hey.

1037
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,720
- Isn't this Emart?
- It is.

1038
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,660
- We're at Emart?
- You've been here?

1039
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,890
I've been here.

1040
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,260
This is insane. What should I do?

1041
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,230
- You just have to...
- Hey.

1042
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,570
(Hey!)

1043
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,770
(Dozens of cameras
await for them to get out.)

1044
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,810
- Why?
- This is...

1045
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,040
(They sense something suspicious.)

1046
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,810
- Is there a mission?
- Is there something?

1047
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,250
- Do we have to be number five?
- Is there something?

1048
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,580
(Secret gesture hints)

1049
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,480
(There was a photo
showing someone getting out.)

1050
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,050
The fifth to get out?
We did that already.

1051
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,250
Come on!

1052
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,820
Let's just wish for luck.

1053
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,290
- Wait. This is...
- It's a mission.

1054
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,990
- Get out first.
- Just get out.

1055
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,160
- It's not about being number one.
- Get out.

1056
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,060
- Just get out.
- Get out.

1057
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,130
- No, wait. I won't go now.
- Get out.

1058
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,170
- Get out!
- I don't want to.

1059
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,570
- I'll go first, then.
- Get out.

1060
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,270
Who cares about that?

1061
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,510
- It's fine. What's so important?
- Hey.

1062
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,670
- Hyung In counted something.
- Really?

1063
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,180
Just get out already!

1064
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,650
You get out too!

1065
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,420
You go on first.

1066
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,320
- Get out.
- You get out.

1067
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,990
- Get out.
- Are you off or on?

1068
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,590
- Are you off?
- Not yet.

1069
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,720
- You're still on?
- Yes.

1070
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,820
You haven't gotten off yet?

1071
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,990
- Get out quick. Go!
- Get out.

1072
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,060
Get out!

1073
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,330
Jae Seok's still clinging on.

1074
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,260
- Get off!
- No.

1075
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,970
- They put cameras up there too?
- No, I'm still...

1076
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,970
(They all want to be 5th.)

1077
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,870
Get off quick. People can't get off.

1078
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,040
- What are you doing?
- What is this?

1079
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,270
- Were you 5th, SOYEON?
- I'm number 5.

1080
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,010
I'm number five.

1081
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,180
- Right foot!
- Gosh.

1082
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,210
- Right foot.
- I'm number five.

1083
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,120
Right foot.

1084
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,550
- What is this?
- I'm number five.

1085
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,690
- Ssaebssaeb's still on.
- He hasn't exited yet.

1086
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,490
Let foot or right foot?

1087
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,990
Will you get out already? Come on.

1088
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,360
It was the left foot earlier.
Here goes.

1089
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,630
We have someone who did
the second secret gesture.

1090
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,360
- Really?
- Who is it?

1091
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,500
- There is someone?
- There was a secret gesture?

1092
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,470
- Who is it?
- Among the hints,

1093
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,570
(The second secret gesture)

1094
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:59,110
if you look closely at the photo
of someone getting out of the van,

1095
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,840
- they step out right foot first.
- Yes.

1096
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,680
The fifth person
to get out right foot first...

1097
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,080
succeeded this time.

1098
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,250
- The fifth?
- Right foot first?

1099
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,420
I went right foot first.

1100
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,990
- Out of all of you,
- I went left foot first.

1101
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,660
the fifth person
to get out right foot first...

1102
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,560
The fifth person
to get out right foot first...

1103
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,730
was MIYEON, so she succeeded.

1104
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,570
(MIYEON!)

1105
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,730
- What?
- How were you the fifth?

1106
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:24,770
When did I do that?

1107
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,970
(Left foot 1)

1108
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,570
(Left foot 2)

1109
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,610
(Left foot 3)
(Left foot 4)

1110
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,780
(SOYEON was first
to exit right foot first.)

1111
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,610
(Right foot 2)

1112
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,710
(Right foot 3)

1113
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
(Right foot 4)

1114
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,980
(Right foot 5)

1115
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:46,060
SOYEON was the first
to step out right foot first.

1116
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,990
- MIYEON was the fifth person.
- For real?

1117
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,060
This is really...

1118
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,590
- Congratulations.
- What is this?

1119
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,900
Oh, the fifth person
to exit right foot first.

1120
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,160
I used so much energy.

1121
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,530
Since MIYEON succeeded as well,

1122
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,970
- you can enjoy your shopping spree.
- I'm jealous!

1123
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,270
Pick out what you each want...

1124
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,040
and bring it to the counter.

1125
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
- Got it.
- Okay!

1126
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,780
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's go, MIYEON.

1127
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,510
- Us two can relax and shop.
- Yes.

1128
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,320
I never get these things right.

1129
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,350
This never works for me.

1130
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,050
I can buy
100 dollars' worth of stuff.

1131
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,490
Yes, 100 dollars and under.

1132
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,960
What should I get?

1133
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,090
How are we to spend 100 dollars?

1134
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,100
(Only the five who succeed
keep their presents.)

1135
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,100
Where is that sold?

1136
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,570
(Hint 2, Hint 3)

1137
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,510
The jegi...

1138
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,970
(He's looking for a jegi.)

1139
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,940
It's not here?
I thought it would be here.

1140
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,580
Balloons.

1141
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,350
(Hint 2)

1142
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,510
The jegi...

1143
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,320
Sports equipment...

1144
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,680
(Hint 2)

1145
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,190
Shouldn't the jegi be in
the sports equipment section?

1146
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,260
It's not here?

1147
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,360
What were the hints?

1148
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,060
Earlier... Meat?

1149
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,460
(Meat?)

1150
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,700
- Jegi?
- Where's the meat?

1151
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,030
They don't sell it here.

1152
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,970
What did you buy?

1153
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,440
- What?
- What did you buy?

1154
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,370
- Nothing yet.
- What are you looking for?

1155
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:12,680
Out of the things we saw earlier...

1156
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,140
Meat?

1157
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,750
Yes, there was meat, right?

1158
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,210
Why are they getting smaller?

1159
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,320
(Hint 3: Grilled natural beef
chuck flap tail)

1160
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,520
Why are they getting smaller?
Do we have to do something here?

1161
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,250
Do we perhaps have to buy meat?

1162
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,460
Right?

1163
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,960
- Let's go to the meat corner.
- Yes, let's go to the meat corner.

1164
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,460
(She runs to the food section
where the meat is at Jong Kook's words.)

1165
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,700
(Se Chan checks the hint once more.)

1166
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,670
What could this be?

1167
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,110
It's a line.

1168
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,710
Do I have to buy something red?

1169
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,910
How am I supposed to know with this?

1170
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,810
(Does the secret gesture
have to do with the color red?)

1171
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,150
I should buy something big
and expensive.

1172
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,620
(Meanwhile, Daniel has already
succeeded in the mission.)

1173
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,820
Wait, toilet paper.

1174
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:01,520
I should buy some toilet paper
as a housewarming gift for Jong Kook.

1175
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,730
I should buy this one
from this brand.

1176
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:05,830
(He gets to enjoy shopping
without worrying about the mission.)

1177
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,100
Okay, this one is nice.
It's nice and big.

1178
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,970
I'm sure he'll like it.

1179
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,740
(Also having succeeded
in the mission,)

1180
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,940
(MIYEON is on a shopping spree.)

1181
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,170
A gift for Children's Day.

1182
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,610
Shouldn't I buy something like this?

1183
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,510
(She's at the age where she is
very interested in dolls.)

1184
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:24,180
(Giggling)

1185
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,150
I think it kind of looks like me.

1186
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,850
Right?

1187
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,790
Na Eun has already outgrown
these toys now.

1188
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,060
She has outgrown all of these.

1189
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,760
Gosh, Legos.

1190
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,230
This looks like fun.
I want to do this at home.

1191
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,930
(While she's going crazy for toys
that even Na Eun has outgrown...)

1192
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,170
What could this be? It's a line.

1193
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,430
They all have their left foot out.
And five people?

1194
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,640
I don't think it's about five people
coming to the cashier.

1195
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,410
I think it must be something red.

1196
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,370
Does it have to be
exactly 100 dollars?

1197
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,310
Gosh, what's this?

1198
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,140
Gosh, what's this?

1199
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,080
Sir, what are you doing here?

1200
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,520
(Anyone can tell that this man
playing jegi looks suspicious.)

1201
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,450
(The props director did very well
during Running Man versus Staff.)

1202
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,820
Sir, what are you doing here?

1203
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,820
(But why is he playing jegi here?)

1204
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,890
What are you doing?

1205
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,390
Sir.

1206
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,460
(He's just playing jegi
without saying a word?)

1207
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,600
(And he's really good at that.)

1208
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,070
What is this? Can I try too?

1209
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,240
(Se Chan didn't get the hint
about the jegi.)

1210
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,310
- Can I?
- No, right now...

1211
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:27,040
(It seems like he has to
do something with the jegi.)

1212
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,380
Wait. Let me try it once.

1213
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,980
Hang on. Since it's May 5,
do I only have to do 5?

1214
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,720
(The secret gesture had something
to do with 5 so far.)

1215
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,350
Four, five.

1216
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,620
- Fail.
- What?

1217
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,720
What is this?

1218
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,130
What is that? He's playing jegi.

1219
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,530
There was a jegi earlier.

1220
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,030
What is this?

1221
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,200
- Why?
- What are you doing?

1222
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,900
I was playing jegi just now.

1223
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,140
I want to try it too.

1224
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,300
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

1225
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,140
Try it.

1226
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,340
Why are you so good at this?

1227
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,180
Why are you so good at this?

1228
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,780
Why are you so good at this?

1229
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,420
- Do you want to try it?
- Yes.

1230
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,550
(She's surprisingly good at jegi!)

1231
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,460
- What?
- Five, six,

1232
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,990
seven, eight,

1233
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,390
nine, ten.

1234
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,060
Fail.

1235
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,830
(It's not about kicking it
10 times either?)

1236
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,000
How many times is it?

1237
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,030
- Have you tried it five times?
- Yes.

1238
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,300
- Was that not it?
- Ssaebssaeb, what are you doing?

1239
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,930
- Well, I...
- Is it maybe 25 times?

1240
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,940
- What are you doing?
- We're playing jegi right now.

1241
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,570
What is that?
Oh, this is the jegi...

1242
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,310
- Yes.
- The jegi master. Our director.

1243
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,710
How many times
do we have to kick it?

1244
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,410
- How many times is it?
- He won't tell us.

1245
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,480
(Chuckling)

1246
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,610
Twenty-five.

1247
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,280
- What?
- Five times five is twenty-five.

1248
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,180
- How can you do this 25 times?
- May 5.

1249
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,950
- That's why I tried it 10 times.
- It's right. He just laughed.

1250
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,320
We should...

1251
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,930
(He fails after a single kick?)

1252
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,860
Hang on. You had your turn.

1253
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,900
- You already had your turn.
- Okay, SOYEON.

1254
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,630
- Can't I try again if I catch it?
- No.

1255
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,470
Do we have to use both feet?

1256
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,400
- I'm at a disadvantage.
- One, two,

1257
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,710
- three, four,
- What?

1258
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,510
- five.
- Five?

1259
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,240
- Fail.
- That's not it. Hang on.

1260
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,710
(It's not kicking it 5 times
with both feet either.)

1261
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,620
- What are you doing here?
- Why are you here?

1262
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,620
(The jegi master was just watching
as they played jegi.)

1263
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,890
Why? Did he fail?

1264
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,830
(There seems to be a reason.)

1265
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,830
- What?
- Oh, you just kicked it to me.

1266
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,170
Wait, he passed the jegi to me.

1267
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,800
Do we have to pass it
back and forth? But why...

1268
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,470
Do we have to do five
as we pass it back and forth?

1269
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,940
Do we have to pass it
back and forth? But why...

1270
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,410
Do we have to do five
as we pass it back and forth?

1271
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,140
- What?
- Wait a minute.

1272
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,940
- This must not be it.
- SOYEON, you try it.

1273
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,910
- What is this?
- What could it be?

1274
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,590
- Is it the other foot?
- SOYEON, you have...

1275
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,790
(SOYEON, you have...)

1276
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,790
SOYEON, you have succeeded...
- in the secret gesture.
- What was it?

1277
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,860
We had to do it five times.

1278
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,990
SOYEON, you have succeeded...

1279
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,090
- in the secret gesture.
- What was it?

1280
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,230
(The hidden gesture was to pass
the jegi back and forth 5 times.)

1281
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,930
SOYEON, you passed it back and forth
five times.

1282
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,560
Gosh, what is this?

1283
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,570
You've succeeded.

1284
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,840
SOYEON,
you can get the items that you buy.

1285
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,510
The rest of you have failed.

1286
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,870
It was five...

1287
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,740
Oh, this was no big deal.

1288
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,980
Gosh, I was nearly there.

1289
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,280
I should just do some shopping.

1290
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,980
Now, there are
only two secret gestures left.

1291
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,590
- I should walk around.
- Three are done. Two are left.

1292
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,020
That was so close.

1293
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,190
What should I buy?

1294
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,460
(SOYEON, who has succeeded
in the mission, starts shopping at ease.)

1295
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,830
I mean, this is even...

1296
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,560
(She's just buying all the snacks.)

1297
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,900
It's buy 2, get 1 free.

1298
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm so happy.

1299
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,470
I'm so proud of myself too.

1300
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,440
- SOYEON, what did you buy?
- What?

1301
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,300
I'm going to buy these now.

1302
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,570
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1303
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,340
But everyone...

1304
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,810
You can choose stuff,
but you can't keep them, right?

1305
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,510
Let me take another look.

1306
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,880
I think it should be here somewhere.

1307
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,880
The jegi.

1308
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,850
They don't sell any.

1309
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,020
(The Jegi Man keeps looking
for a jegi,)

1310
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,190
(not knowing that the jegi mission
is finished.)

1311
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,960
This must not be it.
Is this the right place?

1312
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,060
I was almost there, but I failed.

1313
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,460
(Meanwhile,
Se Chan barely missed the mission.)

1314
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,660
There must be something here.

1315
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,900
Hello.

1316
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,830
(He looks around
after spotting suspicious cameras.)

1317
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,970
(He finds something.)

1318
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,510
(There's a red line on the floor
like the one in the hint?)

1319
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,480
I think it's something red.

1320
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,750
(He tries going across once.)

1321
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,980
(Nothing happens.)

1322
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,520
Five people.

1323
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,190
(Hint 4)

1324
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,360
Sir, shall we take a picture?

1325
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,860
Five people have to go across.

1326
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,630
Who wants to take a picture?

1327
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,370
I'll take a picture with you.

1328
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,870
I'll take a picture with you.

1329
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,840
I'll take a picture with you.

1330
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,840
(Offering photos with people
in the middle of a supermarket)

1331
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,970
One person... Yes, come on over.
I'll take a photo with you.

1332
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,410
Two people. Come. It's okay.

1333
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,080
- Two more people.
- Oh, my.

1334
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,580
Just one more person.
Yes, come this way.

1335
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,450
It's okay. Come.

1336
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:59,880
Yes, come this way.

1337
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,750
Could you all stand like this?

1338
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,720
Please stand here.

1339
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,950
- Okay.
- Right.

1340
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,460
Could you do this pose with me?

1341
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,690
The right foot.

1342
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,160
On the very left, your right foot.
Then, the right foot.

1343
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,090
My left foot. Right foot.

1344
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,430
And the right foot.

1345
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,970
All together. In 1, 2, 3.

1346
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,030
I'll step with my left foot.

1347
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,100
All together. In 1, 2, 3.
I'll step with my left foot.

1348
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,140
(They crossed at the same time.)

1349
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,340
Yang Se Chan,

1350
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,540
you have succeeded
in the secret gesture.

1351
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,380
(Se Chan succeeds
in the secret gesture!)

1352
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,580
Gosh, thank you.

1353
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,880
Gosh, thank you so much.

1354
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,250
I'll take a selfie with you.

1355
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:34,450
Let's all take a selfie. Okay.

1356
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,120
In 1 2, 3.

1357
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,320
Gosh, that was awesome, Se Chan.

1358
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,690
Thank you, guys.

1359
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,960
(Hint 4, Success)

1360
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,690
Se Chan, you can get
100 dollars' worth of stuff.

1361
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:47,260
Now, there is one
secret gesture left.

1362
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,900
Gosh, where is the secret gesture?

1363
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,370
Five!

1364
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,310
We'll gather by the cash registers
in five minutes.

1365
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,940
There's five minutes left.
Let's hurry up and find it.

1366
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,680
Gosh, there is no jegi.

1367
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,810
My goodness.

1368
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,950
(They can get a present only if they
succeed in the last secret gesture.)

1369
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,450
Hello, there.

1370
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:08,320
This is my first time seeing you,
but you sure look cool.

1371
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,190
I doubt that, sir.

1372
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,620
(What?)

1373
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,760
Why did that gentleman say that?
It's fascinating.

1374
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,630
Is there a mission like this too?
Perhaps? No?

1375
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,200
Did he actually say it
because he was curious?

1376
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,130
- Hey, Ye Eun.
- Yes?

1377
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,870
Please show us a hint
that we don't have.

1378
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,040
- I'll actually show you.
- Okay.

1379
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,210
It doesn't matter
if you show me anyway.

1380
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:33,110
Can I show this to you?

1381
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,640
(She can't figure out the hint alone,
so she shows Jae Seok.)

1382
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,080
Help me out.

1383
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,250
(As Jae Seok checks
the hint carefully...)

1384
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,920
"Grilled natural beef
chuck flap tail."

1385
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,090
Oh, I see.

1386
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,190
I think I should go over there.

1387
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,020
"Grilled natural beef..."

1388
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,190
I must be a fool.

1389
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,760
(They rush over
to the meat section.)

1390
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,200
I think there must be something
if I go over there.

1391
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,800
Two.

1392
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,800
(Right then)

1393
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,870
Two.

1394
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,170
I'm going to try buying
chuck flap tail.

1395
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,470
Wouldn't this be it?

1396
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,170
(Thinking carefully)

1397
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:07,310
Oh, it must not be related
to the chuck flap tail.

1398
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,910
From what I can see,

1399
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,210
the receipt keeps getting smaller.

1400
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,450
(Has Jae Seok figured
something out?)

1401
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,920
Do we have to buy
exactly 50 dollars' worth?

1402
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,720
Exactly 50 dollars?

1403
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,920
Gosh, this secret gesture.

1404
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:23,690
Where is this secret gesture?
What is it?

1405
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,460
Gosh, I really have no clue.

1406
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,830
(With members who have no idea
what the last secret gesture is...)

1407
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:28,630
What is this secret gesture?

1408
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,030
Exactly 50 dollars.

1409
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,500
This is 47.8 dollars. What about 50?

1410
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,670
This is 59 dollars. This is 52.

1411
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,670
I need to buy one
that's easy to take out.

1412
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,670
(They each buy items related to 5
according to their deductions.)

1413
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,140
Hey, is that all you bought?

1414
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,340
Gosh, I thought I bought a lot.

1415
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,150
This is 49.8 dollars. I just need
something that's 0.2 dollars.

1416
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,580
Thank you.

1417
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,620
(The mission is over.)

1418
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,790
So, someone has succeeded
in the final secret gesture too.

1419
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,490
The final secret gesture was...

1420
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,590
- You saw the receipts, right?
- Yes.

1421
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:57,130
- The sizes got smaller.
- Right.

1422
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,530
That's right.

1423
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:02,560
So, you had to buy an item
that was the fifth most expensive.

1424
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:05,630
After checking how much you paid,

1425
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,300
Jae Seok, at the end...

1426
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,070
He must've gotten that price.

1427
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:11,970
From what I can see,

1428
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,140
the receipt keeps getting smaller.

1429
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,610
And this is related to
the number five, right?

1430
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:17,810
(And this is related to
the number five, right?)

1431
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,680
The total amount
has to come in fifth.

1432
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,220
This isn't about
buying chuck flap tail.

1433
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,920
- How much is all that?
- What?

1434
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,550
- Are you at about 50 dollars?
- A little over 70.

1435
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:26,590
A little over 70?

1436
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:27,790
How much is all that?

1437
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:29,730
I don't know.
Maybe about 90 dollars?

1438
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:30,790
- Ninety dollars?
- Yes.

1439
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:33,530
(He started asking
how much the others were spending.)

1440
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,700
I think about 50 dollars would do.

1441
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,800
This is the one.

1442
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,100
This.

1443
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,800
(He gets a trash can
that's around 50 dollars.)

1444
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,840
I need items
that I can easily take out.

1445
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,640
- I'll be paying for these soon.
- Right.

1446
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,380
I can control my total
with these ramyeon packages.

1447
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,040
- That's 80 dollars.
- Is that 103 dollars?

1448
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,050
- I'm taking this out.
- The winner...

1449
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,350
could be the one
who is the closest to 50 dollars.

1450
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:53,550
Excuse me.

1451
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,390
I'm sorry, but how much
did the others buy?

1452
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,090
I'm so sorry about this.

1453
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:01,520
May I?

1454
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,260
(He checked the receipts
that had been discarded.)

1455
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,230
It has to be higher
than 84.69 dollars.

1456
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,500
- How much is all that?
- It's 86.61 dollars.

1457
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:12,300
I'm good, then. I'll take all that.

1458
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,370
(His sum total ranked 5th!)

1459
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,910
You were able to rank fifth
in the overall money spent.

1460
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,610
- I see.
- Were you calculating the amount?

1461
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:20,740
Of course.

1462
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:23,450
Only the five people
who did the secret gesture...

1463
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:24,680
can keep what they bought.

1464
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,850
- Okay.
- Nice!

1465
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,180
(Only the 5 that succeeded
get to keep what they bought!)

1466
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,120
Yes!

1467
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,020
I couldn't find a jegi anywhere.

1468
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,720
- A jegi...
- Bring it.

1469
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,890
- It was close.
- I couldn't find one.

1470
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:37,160
A refund? No one's keeping ours?

1471
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,590
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1472
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,330
- Let's move out.
- Let's go.

1473
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,060
- Okay!
- I'm doomed today.

1474
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,270
Okay.

1475
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,700
Where are we headed next?

1476
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,670
For the first round,

1477
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:49,070
you had fun at a place
that was perfect...

1478
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:51,270
- for Children's Day.
- So this is how it'll be today.

1479
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:54,140
In the next round,
you'll have beef...

1480
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:57,110
which is the perfect dish
to share with your parents...

1481
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,150
- on Parents' Day.
- At a restaurant?

1482
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,750
- Beef!
- Nice!

1483
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,620
(A beef restaurant
that parents will love)

1484
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,780
- No way.
- That's awesome.

1485
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,290
- Goodness.
- Nice!

1486
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,690
- At the restaurant,
- That's great.

1487
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,190
there will only be...

1488
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:08,720
one secret gesture.

1489
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,560
You must succeed in order to eat.

1490
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,360
You'll be playing a game
on our way there...

1491
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,930
- that will win you a hint.
- Sounds good.

1492
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,900
- The four in the back.
- The jegi was a tough one to get.

1493
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,030
- Ye Eun, Ji Hyo,
- Ye Eun,

1494
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,170
- Ji Hyo.
- SOYEON, Jong Kook.

1495
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,640
- SOYEON, Jong Kook.
- Don't we get a hint?

1496
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,110
- You don't.
- Not us?

1497
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,140
- Careful with that.
- Sure.

1498
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,470
Jae Seok might see it.

1499
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:26,610
Hey, bring it here.

1500
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,310
- Don't let Jae Seok see it.
- Where is it?

1501
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:29,580
- SOYEON. What is it?
- Yes?

1502
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,880
(Checking the hint
for the secret gesture)

1503
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,450
(Hint: Yaksu)

1504
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:34,820
- Do you all have the same one?
- Let's share.

1505
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,290
- Yes, they're the same.
- Are they the same?

1506
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,020
- So that's what it is.
- What does this even mean?

1507
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,420
Why? What does it say?

1508
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,820
Ye Eun, let's share.

1509
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,790
(Daniel didn't get a hint.)

1510
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,030
Is it a drawing, or is it meat?

1511
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,500
- It's an animal.
- An animal?

1512
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,130
- Can you eat that?
- An animal?

1513
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,670
Would you like some bread?

1514
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:50,770
Sure thing.

1515
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,430
- Let's share.
- A great spot to take...

1516
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,770
- your parents out...
- Let's share.

1517
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:54,970
- for beef.
- Got it.

1518
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:58,310
(He shares the hint with Haha.)

1519
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,110
- Well...
- What does it mean though?

1520
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,440
What does it mean?

1521
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,780
I bet you don't know it either.

1522
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,580
(Hint: Yaksu)

1523
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,010
- Isn't it mineral water?
- Hey.

1524
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,120
- Mineral water?
- What are you having?

1525
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,380
(What's the secret gesture
related to "yaksu?")

1526
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,190
- What does this even mean?
- You can't get it right...

1527
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,420
- without a hint.
- Right.

1528
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,020
You can't. So, come on.

1529
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,790
- I don't know.
- You can get off now.

1530
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,230
Let's go, guys.

1531
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,460
- Let's go.
- It starts now.

1532
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,530
You can now do the secret gesture.

1533
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,430
You can do it
the second you exit the bus.

1534
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,170
Hold on a second.
The same rule applies.

1535
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,570
- I need to free my arm.
- Haha, come on.

1536
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:28,900
(Does "yaksu" have anything to do
with getting off the bus?)

1537
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,840
Left foot. Left foot first.

1538
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,110
One, two, three.

1539
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,340
(They get off the bus for now.)

1540
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,340
Can I?

1541
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,480
You can get going.

1542
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,820
What is he doing?

1543
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,880
(Walking on all fours?)

1544
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,890
(Screeching)

1545
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:44,890
(Flimsy Daniel thought "animal"
was the actual hint.)

1546
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,320
- Animal wasn't it, was it?
- Left foot.

1547
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:48,690
You lied about it being "animal."

1548
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,090
I didn't. It's cow.

1549
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,260
- What did she lie about?
- Cow?

1550
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:52,430
I'm right.

1551
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,160
- She said the hint was "animal."
- Did you tell him?

1552
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,070
- It's not that.
- Right?

1553
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,970
(Flimsy Daniel
even gets tricked by Ddochi)

1554
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:00,200
Ye Eun, come on.

1555
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,240
- What is it?
- Here we go.

1556
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,810
- What's the hint?
- What?

1557
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,040
- What's the hint?
- Here we go.

1558
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,780
I've been of help, haven't I?

1559
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,640
- I've helped out a lot.
- What was the hint?

1560
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,680
Sir, please have some water.

1561
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,080
- Something about this seems nice.
- What's this?

1562
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,220
Something smells good.

1563
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,450
(Delivering it to Seok Sam)

1564
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,620
Hold on. Why did he give you
a cup of water?

1565
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,020
- I just poured a cup.
- What's with the water?

1566
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,760
- I want some too.
- Why did you give him water?

1567
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,890
- Sir.
- Cheers.

1568
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:21,890
- The water...
- Cheers.

1569
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:24,090
(Haha tries to give mineral water
to Seok Sam.)

1570
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,130
Have some first.

1571
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:27,000
- Water? What's going on?
- Water?

1572
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,360
Where did Jae Seok go?

1573
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,830
- Hold on. I want some water too.
- Why did he give me water?

1574
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,330
- This has no meaning to it, right?
- Who's handing it out?

1575
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:32,500
- I want some water too.
- Water?

1576
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,800
Aren't we supposed
to get mineral water?

1577
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,000
(What does "yaksu" mean?)

1578
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Yaksu.

1579
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,840
- What is it?
- Did you get the hint?

1580
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,170
I didn't.

1581
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,480
Come on. What was the hint?

1582
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,280
Share it with me.

1583
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,950
Jae Seok, please.

1584
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,720
Stop trying to sweet-talk me.

1585
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,020
I'm sympathetic,
and you keep taking advantage of it.

1586
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,050
- I'm sympathetic.
- Ye Eun, hold on.

1587
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:55,320
- Ye Eun.
- If you keep doing this...

1588
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,630
- We can solve this together.
- Why did the bell ring?

1589
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,760
We can solve it together?
Right, of course.

1590
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,830
Exactly. We can solve it together.

1591
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:02,960
Here's the hint.

1592
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,430
I'm only going
to share it with you two.

1593
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,570
- We need to get lunch.
- Sure.

1594
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:06,640
- What is it?
- Tell us.

1595
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,670
"Yaksu."

1596
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,840
- Yaksu?
- The hint was yaksu.

1597
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,570
- Did it just have the word?
- Yes.

1598
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:13,070
- Yaksu.
- As in mineral water?

1599
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,410
Help me eat lunch today.

1600
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,180
- Okay, fine.
- Yaksu.

1601
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,710
- I'll let you know once I get it.
- Sure.

1602
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:18,750
(I'll let you know once I get it.)

1603
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:22,350
(Will she be able to get something
in return this time?)

1604
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:25,350
(Meanwhile, inside the restaurant)

1605
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:27,820
- Why here?
- The water.

1606
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,890
- What?
- Do we need to drink that?

1607
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,290
This is it.

1608
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:32,730
I'm sure of it.

1609
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,330
Where are the cups?

1610
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:36,200
I see you brought your cups.

1611
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,200
(Is the secret gesture
related to mineral water?)

1612
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,070
(Copying SOYEON)

1613
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,210
(They hurry
and drink the mineral water.)

1614
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:45,570
Drinking the water can't be it.

1615
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,640
Are we allowed to drink this?

1616
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,910
(That wasn't it.)

1617
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,180
(Quietly)

1618
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,480
Have a cup of water.

1619
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,220
- Me?
- Yes, have some water.

1620
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,390
(Delivering mineral water
to Kang Chan Hee,)

1621
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,220
(the father-like figure
of Running Man)

1622
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,120
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1623
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,360
Thanks for your hard work.

1624
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,230
There has to be something more.

1625
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:06,730
Hold on. Where's the water?

1626
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:07,730
(He only ended up doing
a few good deeds.)

1627
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,900
Jae Seok.

1628
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:11,970
(Ddochi and the others
find a different water bottle.)

1629
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:13,500
- Jae Seok.
- Let go of me.

1630
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,240
- That'll take too long. Have this.
- Let go of me.

1631
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,570
- Let go.
- Let Ye Eun go first.

1632
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,640
- Ye Eun goes first.
- Got it.

1633
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,380
- After her.
- All right. You had your water.

1634
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:22,080
- Ye Eun drank the water.
- Let me have some.

1635
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,250
I drank the water.

1636
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:24,550
Can I also have a sip?

1637
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,350
- Just a second.
- Sir!

1638
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:27,650
- Just this once.
- Why?

1639
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:28,720
Can you sit here?

1640
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,780
- Why?
- Can I help you drink this?

1641
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,550
- I know what you're getting at.
- Seok Jin, just this once.

1642
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,020
- Please sit here.
- Please.

1643
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,690
I know why you're asking me
to do this.

1644
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:35,860
- Just once.
- The theme is Parents' Day,

1645
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,030
and I'm the eldest.

1646
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,490
Let us bow down to you.

1647
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,000
- Let's bow.
- What is this?

1648
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:43,370
- Wish for good health.
- But bowing after serving water...

1649
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,630
- We do that at memorial services.
- Hey.

1650
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,140
- I mean...
- Let's bow.

1651
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,840
You shouldn't bow to someone alive
after serving a cup of water, right?

1652
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,940
Then...

1653
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,940
Can you please drink this?

1654
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,510
I won't.

1655
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:54,510
- Please.
- I...

1656
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:55,610
Drink your own cup of water.

1657
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:56,980
I'll have MIYEON's.

1658
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,480
- Earlier...
- Wait.

1659
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,610
(He drinks mineral water
to honor MIYEON's dedication.)

1660
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,850
Thank you.

1661
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,490
- Hold on.
- Wasn't this it?

1662
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,590
- This...
- What's the correct gesture?

1663
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,360
I don't get it.

1664
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,360
(Frustrated)

1665
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,390
What's this?

1666
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,130
(MIYEON finds something.)

1667
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,430
- What's this?
- Parents' Day. Hold on.

1668
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,730
(She lifts it back up again.)

1669
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:19,770
- What is it?
- How...

1670
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,640
(There's a number on the back
of the sitting cushion!)

1671
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,240
- What's that?
- What is this?

1672
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,340
Ten?

1673
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,810
(What does the number 10
on the sitting cushion mean?)

1674
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:28,840
What's that?

1675
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:30,780
- I guess.
- Share what you figured out.

1676
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,080
Can you tell me?

1677
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,020
- Ten times.
- Ten times?

1678
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,720
- We're to bow ten times?
- Is that wrong?

1679
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:39,150
What are you two doing?
Do you know what to do?

1680
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,660
(Bowing)

1681
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,760
Hey. Do you know what to do?

1682
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,460
(She begins to bow
to Seok Sam ten times.)

1683
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,260
Hey. What are you doing?

1684
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,430
- Did you bow twice?
- You shouldn't bow twice.

1685
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,200
It's wrong to bow twice!

1686
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,130
- What's going on?
- Why are you bowing twice?

1687
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,500
MIYEON, hey.

1688
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,840
- Why are you bowing?
- Is it really...

1689
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,940
- It can't be a New Year's bow.
- What?

1690
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,370
- It can't be a New Year's bow.
- No way.

1691
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,240
- She...
- What is it, then?

1692
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,580
(What does the number
on the sitting cushion mean?)

1693
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,950
- Something seems off.
- Father!

1694
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,420
(Oh...)

1695
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,220
(Ssaebssaeb figured something out.)

1696
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,390
(Jae Seok noticed
the sitting cushions.)

1697
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:12,020
Where did you find
the sitting cushion?

1698
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,720
Hold on. There are sitting cushions
around here.

1699
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,860
- Seven.
- What is it?

1700
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,330
(There are other sitting cushions
with different numbers!)

1701
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:23,930
(Jae Seok: 5)

1702
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:25,600
Where's the sitting cushion?

1703
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,170
- What do you have?
- The number.

1704
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,600
- What is it?
- We need to find the number eight.

1705
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,440
No way. It's not here though.
Find the eight.

1706
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,740
I think it has to be eight.
Yes, eight.

1707
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,980
Where are the sitting cushions?

1708
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,280
(SOYEON heads outside.)

1709
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,110
No way.

1710
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,320
(She finds the sitting cushion
with the number 8.)

1711
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,720
(The number 8 cushion lands
in SOYEON's hands.)

1712
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,520
- SOYEON, let me join you.
- Did you find it?

1713
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,850
Let me join you.

1714
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:47,320
- Well...
- She found it.

1715
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,020
- What is it?
- She found number eight.

1716
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,490
How many sitting cushions are there?

1717
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,230
(Just then)

1718
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,430
I know I'm right.

1719
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,560
This.

1720
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,870
I think...

1721
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,900
- I'm right, aren't I?
- What number is that?

1722
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,200
- Five.
- Didn't I succeed?

1723
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,340
I think I know what it is.

1724
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:04,440
- Yaksu.
- Hold on.

1725
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,180
I thought of a divisor in math.

1726
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,710
- Same here.
- Is there one here though?

1727
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:10,910
Parents' Day?

1728
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,150
That's it. That's the one.

1729
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,850
- What's that?
- Number two.

1730
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:15,850
- What?
- Two.

1731
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:17,090
(Jong Kook found 2, a divisor of 8.)

1732
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:21,160
(May 8, Parents' Day)

1733
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:25,830
(Find the divisors of 8,
Sitting cushions with 1, 2, 4, 8)

1734
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,060
(Jong Kook: 2)

1735
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,030
(Out of 1, 2, 4, and 8,
2 were found.)

1736
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:32,000
(SOYEON: 8)

1737
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,940
That's the one.
You got the right one.

1738
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,100
(Numbers 1 and 4 remain!)

1739
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,540
Yaksu and eight.

1740
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,040
Yaksu.

1741
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,840
I'm clueless.

1742
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,240
- Yes!
- What is it?

1743
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,450
- I got it!
- What is it?

1744
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,450
I got it.

1745
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,580
I got it, and I'll tell you
like I promised.

1746
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,490
- Hold on.
- What does "yaksu" mean?

1747
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:53,290
Come here. I'll tell you.

1748
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,860
- I promised you earlier.
- Right.

1749
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,690
Yaksu doesn't mean water.

1750
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,260
It's a math term.

1751
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:01,230
What are the divisors of eight?

1752
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:03,200
- What are they?
- I don't know.

1753
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,870
- I should look it up.
- Divisors of eight.

1754
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,500
Okay, I got it. Ye Eun.

1755
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,670
- What is it?
- Come here.

1756
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:08,700
(Seok Sam figured out
what the secret gesture is.)

1757
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,010
(But MIYEON is also on his tail.)

1758
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:13,170
(MIYEON and Haha heard
what "yaksu" really means.)

1759
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:14,610
That was tough to figure out.

1760
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:16,080
- There are still a few left.
- Go and get one.

1761
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,750
- There are a few left.
- What's left?

1762
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:18,910
There are still two spots left.

1763
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:21,120
There are two over there.

1764
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:24,150
Oh, right. Gosh, you fool.

1765
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,290
A divisor of eight.

1766
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:30,730
Hey, what about me?

1767
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:32,960
- This is a divisor, right?
- No, that's not...

1768
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,130
Is it about math?

1769
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:36,430
- Let me have this one.
- Why?

1770
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,270
- Let's switch. I'll give you this.
- Why?

1771
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,270
Why would we switch?

1772
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,470
- I want number ten.
- Why?

1773
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:42,100
I'll give you two.

1774
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,440
- I already had 2.
- Then, you can have 2.

1775
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,340
This isn't it.
I don't think this is it either.

1776
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:47,580
Didn't he just take it from me?

1777
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,310
Is this right? Let's see.

1778
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:51,480
Who has two?

1779
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,110
What in the world is a divisor?

1780
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,050
What is a divisor?

1781
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,420
Gosh, this was it.

1782
00:56:58,850 --> 00:56:59,850
I got it.

1783
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:02,120
Do you have a four? Darn it.

1784
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,930
- My goodness.
- Got it.

1785
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:05,460
(The correct cushions go
to the geniuses who know about divisors.)

1786
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,400
- This... A three...
- No, that won't work.

1787
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,600
A three doesn't work.

1788
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,470
MIYEON,
this didn't mean anything either.

1789
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:11,570
(The rest brought number cushions
that weren't related at all.)

1790
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:14,670
So, four of you have succeeded
in the secret gesture.

1791
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:15,670
Yes.

1792
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,540
Today's hint was "Yaksu."

1793
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,040
- I thought it meant something else.
- Yes.

1794
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,640
Gosh, I found out in the middle.

1795
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,940
The common hint was Parents' Day,

1796
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,680
- Eight.
- and the partial hint of "Yaksu."

1797
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,450
If you combine those,
you would get the divisors of eight.

1798
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:30,490
- One, two, four, and eight.
- Two, four, and eight.

1799
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:31,920
Those of you who found
the cushions with those numbers...

1800
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,250
Gosh, how are we supposed to
know this?

1801
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,460
- So, please show us the cushions...
- This one was useless?

1802
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,660
if you've succeeded.

1803
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,390
- I found it at the end.
- Okay!

1804
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:40,600
One, two, four...

1805
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,600
Only the empty-headed people
couldn't get it right.

1806
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,370
Only the four
who succeeded will get...

1807
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:48,140
a beef meal
that melts in your mouth.

1808
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:51,010
- Okay!
- That's so mean!

1809
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:53,740
- Let's eat.
- Gosh, seriously?

1810
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:56,140
- Hey, it's beef tartare.
- That's insane. Beef tartare.

1811
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:59,310
- Oh, my. This place has good food.
- My goodness.

1812
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,120
- That looks so good.
- It's so fresh.

1813
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,650
- Gosh, look at this protein.
- It's practically alive.

1814
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:03,920
The beef tartare is insane.

1815
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,220
(The juicy sirloin and rib meat
coated in a smoky flavor)

1816
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,990
You can just tell
that this is sirloin.

1817
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,030
And that's rib meat.

1818
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,030
That looks so good.

1819
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,330
Gosh, that looks so delicious.

1820
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:15,500
Hey, I'll grill the meat for you.

1821
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,130
Gosh, I'm hungry.

1822
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,500
- Jong Kook.
- Hey.

1823
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,640
- Have some beef tartare.
- Yes, I like beef tartare.

1824
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,770
- Seriously, it looks so good.
- I know.

1825
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,270
Gosh, the beef tartare is
driving me crazy.

1826
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,680
Oh, my. It looks so fresh.

1827
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,710
It looks like great quality meat,
doesn't it?

1828
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,380
Hey, that was an egg yolk.

1829
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,450
I thought it was sesame oil,
but it was an egg yolk.

1830
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:38,150
(They boost their appetite
with beef tartare.)

1831
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,320
Is the beef tartare good?

1832
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,120
(Furrowing her eyebrows)

1833
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,860
Gosh, that beef tartare!

1834
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,390
It looks so good.

1835
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,200
- So...
- It's tasty.

1836
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,900
- It's almost sweet.
- Yes.

1837
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,800
Ye Eun, don't look at them.
Let's just look straight ahead.

1838
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:51,900
No.

1839
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:58,170
(These two can't take their eyes off
in hopes they might get something.)

1840
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,410
That looks so tasty.

1841
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,010
Oh, they grill it on a gridiron.

1842
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:03,040
(Right then,
the sirloin is done being cooked.)

1843
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:06,180
- Shall I do it? Sure.
- Thank you.

1844
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,550
- SOYEON, grill it for us.
- Of course.

1845
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,590
- My gosh. This is incredible.
- It looks amazing.

1846
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,820
Gosh, how nice.

1847
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,260
Goodness, shall I try it?

1848
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:15,920
- Go ahead.
- Is it done already?

1849
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,860
It's fully cooked.
This is good enough to eat.

1850
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,190
- Isn't it?
- It was precooked too.

1851
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,460
- Should we wait a little longer?
- My goodness.

1852
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,270
SOYEON, try it.

1853
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:26,070
Jae Seok, what does it taste like?

1854
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,540
It tastes like the meat
you've had before.

1855
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,370
Oh, that's delicious.

1856
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:33,310
(The youngest who grilled the meat
also takes a bite.)

1857
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,780
It's perfect. We have to eat it now.
This is fully cooked.

1858
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,150
- Gosh, by the way...
- Seok Jin.

1859
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:41,320
- The rib meat is good too.
- Yes?

1860
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,180
- Isn't Jong Kook younger than you?
- What?

1861
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,220
I mean...

1862
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,390
(The eldest grabbed the tongs
so naturally.)

1863
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:47,290
I mean, Seok Jin naturally...

1864
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:49,290
started grilling the meat for you.

1865
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,390
This is what Parents' Day is about.

1866
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,060
- No, but...
- This is Parents' Day right here.

1867
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,660
I laid the meat out at first, right?

1868
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:57,030
But then,
he started cutting it up himself.

1869
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,400
(Doing his filial duty to
his younger friend for Parents' Day)

1870
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,640
- I didn't even realize it.
- This is Parents' Day.

1871
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,670
- Gosh, this is... Sure.
- Seok Jin.

1872
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:05,040
- I'll do it.
- It's fine. This is Parents' Day.

1873
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:09,740
The sirloin is amazing. My goodness.

1874
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,250
- Oh, it's good.
- It's so delicious.

1875
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:14,250
- It's good. It's seasoned. Nice.
- My gosh.

1876
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,420
- It's nicely seasoned.
- Right?

1877
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,250
It has a nice flavor.

1878
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:20,590
Protein.

1879
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:22,120
It's so delicious.

1880
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,160
- It's really good.
- I know. It's so good.

1881
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,960
This reminds me of my mom.

1882
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,260
It reminds her of her mom.

1883
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:31,070
- Are you sure?
- Yes, because it's delicious.

1884
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,470
Gosh, the rib meat is the best.

1885
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:34,500
(Her soul has left her body.)

1886
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,140
My gosh. It must be so good.

1887
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:40,070
This is so hard.
This is hard on my heart.

1888
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,740
Hey, her eyes have gone crazy.

1889
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:43,640
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong with her?

1890
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,310
- This is really good.
- Her eyes have gone crazy.

1891
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:47,050
(Has Food Fighter lost her mind
after seeing the food?)

1892
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,880
Hey, what's wrong?

1893
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,020
Hey, Ye Eun! What's wrong?

1894
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,520
- What's wrong with her?
- What's wrong?

1895
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,820
- Ye Eun, take a whiff!
- What's wrong?

1896
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,120
I can't stand it!

1897
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,560
- Ye Eun.
- What's wrong with her?

1898
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,030
What is this?

1899
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,460
- What's wrong?
- What's going on?

1900
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,030
- What is this?
- What's going on?

1901
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,160
What are you doing?

1902
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,260
Hey, I'll give it to you
if you come over here.

1903
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,300
Over here.

1904
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,670
- I can't stand it anymore!
- What is this?

1905
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,870
(The meat fell on the floor!)

1906
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:12,970
Hey, go over there.

1907
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:14,280
(Charging over to the table)

1908
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,280
(Grabbing)

1909
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,610
Hey!

1910
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,650
It's hot.

1911
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:20,180
- What was that?
- Good job.

1912
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,820
- Fine.
- If someone goes crazy for meat,

1913
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,720
you just have to let them have some.

1914
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,150
(Beef is the vaccine.)

1915
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,820
Food Fighter took
a really big piece in the meantime.

1916
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,620
Gosh, Food Figher is seriously...

1917
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,790
A really big piece.

1918
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:32,260
That's impressive, indeed.

1919
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,730
Everyone, perhaps...

1920
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:34,900
(Seok Sam is having fun
raising zombies.)

1921
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,860
- This is so tasty.
- Everyone, perhaps...

1922
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,130
Can you kiss your own elbow?

1923
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:41,000
- I can!
- If you can, I'll give you some.

1924
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:42,400
Can you kiss it?

1925
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,140
(Training the beggars
with a ridiculous mission)

1926
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:48,540
- Oh, it doesn't work.
- If you can, I'll give you some.

1927
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:51,280
- If you kiss...
- How can you do that?

1928
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,150
- You can't kiss your own elbow.
- I can do it.

1929
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:54,320
It's supposed to be touching
your elbow with your tongue.

1930
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,520
- Oh, she can do it.
- You can't kiss your own elbow.

1931
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,720
Oh, she can do it!

1932
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,920
(It works!)

1933
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,230
Oh, she can do it!

1934
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:06,330
She can?

1935
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:09,500
Hey, she can do it. Ye Eun did it.

1936
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,900
- Ye Eun can do it.
- Ye Eun did it.

1937
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,070
Hey, you must've dislocated
your shoulder!

1938
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,140
Hey, did you pop your arm out?

1939
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:16,400
- So you could eat this?
- How does this work?

1940
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,410
Can anyone else kiss
their own elbow?

1941
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:18,610
- Ye Eun, show me once more.
- She can do it as she lost weight.

1942
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,210
- Ji Ye Eun!
- Gosh, this actually works.

1943
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:21,540
(Elbow kiss)

1944
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,980
You actually did it. My gosh.

1945
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,780
- Seriously... You're an oddball.
- I've never seen anyone do this.

1946
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:27,920
- You really are an oddball.
- I can't do it.

1947
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,280
You can't do it, can you?
Try it. She can't do it.

1948
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:31,550
- No, I can't do it.
- That's impressive.

1949
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:33,550
- She did it with the will to eat.
- How can you kiss your elbow?

1950
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:36,060
So, it's been a while, but K-pop...

1951
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:38,030
The random dance game is
all the rage these days.

1952
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:40,700
I'll play a song,
and you'll do a random dance...

1953
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:42,430
And when you do...

1954
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,970
Are you kidding me?

1955
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,430
The one who dances well...

1956
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,600
What happens if we dance
but don't get to eat?

1957
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,340
What if we dance really hard, but...

1958
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,210
- That means you didn't dance well.
- Yes.

1959
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:53,470
"You didn't dance well."

1960
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:55,710
If you do a random dance...

1961
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,010
- How can I dance...
- I don't really know...

1962
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:58,280
- when I don't know any dances?
- about K-pop.

1963
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,210
- Then, it's something you all know.
- Okay.

1964
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,220
Jae Seok, play "Candy" or...

1965
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,550
- Play Shim Shin's songs for me.
- Hang on a minute.

1966
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:06,290
- Let's go with G-DRAGON.
- Oh, yes.

1967
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:07,920
- Then, go up to the front.
- Of course.

1968
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:11,760
Yes, you have to dance to this.

1969
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:15,660
(The signature dance move
of "Too Bad")

1970
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,300
(Creaking)

1971
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,500
- That's nice.
- What's that?

1972
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,500
- Hey, you guys are good.
- That's good.

1973
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,040
(Right then)

1974
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,810
I can't believe
I'm in front of i-dle...

1975
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:30,080
(Food Zombie,
the expert in joint dislocation)

1976
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,510
- Get out of here!
- Ji Ye Eun!

1977
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:33,850
- Get out!
- This is ours!

1978
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:35,620
Hey, this is ours! Hey, MIYEON!

1979
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:36,620
(MIYEON joins in.)

1980
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:37,920
- Hey, MIYEON!
- Oh, MIYEON.

1981
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,190
Get out of my way!

1982
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:42,190
- Get out of my way!
- Oh, MIYEON...

1983
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,590
- What will we do about her?
- First of all...

1984
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:48,260
(It's hard to watch
the eldest member's begging dance.)

1985
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:50,530
- First of all...
- The participants should get some.

1986
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:51,700
- First, you'll each get one...
- Gosh, I'm sorry.

1987
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,500
- for participating.
- A participation prize.

1988
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,200
- And I'll give one to Ji Ye Eun.
- Thank you.

1989
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,710
Or you can have some beef tartare.

1990
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:58,810
Yes, you can have some beef tartare.

1991
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:00,210
- Can I have some beef tartare?
- Yes, you can.

1992
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:02,180
- Thank you.
- Yes, go ahead.

1993
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,910
- Oh, I get two? Thank you.
- Yes, dip it in some salt.

1994
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:05,210
Can I get a participation prize too?

1995
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:07,180
Yes, Ji Hyo.

1996
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,820
- Thank you for the food.
- You have to participate first.

1997
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:13,020
Of course. What is this, by the way?
Is it a zombie dance?

1998
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,760
- What is it?
- No.

1999
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:16,160
Gosh, it's so good.

2000
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,930
(Humming in delight)

2001
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,030
It's so good.

2002
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:21,830
The beef tartare is really good.

2003
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:24,130
It's really good with rice.

2004
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:26,530
MIYEON doesn't really like to dance.

2005
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,070
- Is that so?
- But when she was dancing...

2006
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:29,800
- Don't you like to dance, MIYEON?
- I'm not really good at dancing.

2007
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,210
You don't like to dance,
but you danced like that?

2008
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,170
- MIYEON doesn't like to dance?
- She doesn't.

2009
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:34,410
She tried really hard just now.

2010
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:36,510
She's in a girl group,
but she doesn't like to dance?

2011
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:38,750
- Dancing is her least favorite.
- Oh, really? Why?

2012
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,410
Well, because she's not very good.

2013
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,350
- So she doesn't dance much?
- She doesn't. She's not that good.

2014
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:44,020
- So she doesn't dance much?
- She doesn't.

2015
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,320
Then, what?
Do you just use your looks for fame?

2016
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,320
(Singing)

2017
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,720
- Oh, your vocals?
- Yes, she's our main vocalist.

2018
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,830
- Are you the main vocalist?
- The main vocalist.

2019
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:52,990
- She's our main vocalist.
- Oh, she's the main vocalist.

2020
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,200
- I didn't know!
- You're the main vocalist?

2021
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,230
She's our main vocalist...

2022
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:56,660
- with good looks.
- Gosh, her singing...

2023
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,070
- Oh, a main vocalist with looks.
- She's a really good singer.

2024
01:04:58,070 --> 01:05:00,000
- She sings well with her looks?
- She's a really good singer.

2025
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,440
- Hey, usually,
- My gosh.

2026
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,970
if someone is that pretty,
they can't really sing well.

2027
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:04,640
- She's totally unbelievable.
- I see.

2028
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:06,510
When you usually look at a group,

2029
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:08,410
- you can spot the main vocalist.
- That's right.

2030
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:10,410
- I was the same.
- That's right.

2031
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:11,710
- Were you the main vocalist?
- I was the main vocalist.

2032
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:12,750
- I see.
- Yes.

2033
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:14,980
I was obviously the main vocalist.

2034
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:17,720
Jong Kook, do you want to see
a glutton of Running Man?

2035
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,750
- What?
- A glutton of Running Man.

2036
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:19,750
- A glutton.
- A glutton?

2037
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:20,820
- Is there a glutton?
- I see.

2038
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:22,360
- A glutton.
- Can you eat with gusto then?

2039
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:23,920
- Eat with gusto.
- A glutton, not a main vocalist.

2040
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,830
- It's nice to have a glutton.
- A glutton.

2041
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,130
We want to dance.

2042
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,900
- We want to dance.
- We want to dance.

2043
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,000
- We want to dance.
- Give us the music.

2044
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:33,430
- Give us the music.
- Yes.

2045
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:35,170
i-dle has so many songs.

2046
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,340
That's right.
i-dle's songs are really nice.

2047
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,410
"Queencard?"

2048
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:38,570
- "Queencard."
- Is this the dance?

2049
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:40,680
- "Queencard."
- "Queencard."

2050
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,210
(She gets up
as soon as the music starts.)

2051
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:47,550
(The main vocalist who hates dancing
takes the stage again.)

2052
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:50,950
Didn't MIYEON say she hated dancing?

2053
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:54,520
Didn't you say
you didn't lilke dancing?

2054
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:56,520
I like it today.

2055
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,790
- Nice.
- MIYEON, you're doing well.

2056
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:00,490
- Let's go.
- Nice.

2057
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:01,700
- Nice.
- Oh, my.

2058
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,270
- That's great.
- She can dance well.

2059
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:05,570
There you go.

2060
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,440
- MIYEON, here you go.
- That's great.

2061
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,770
Here you go.

2062
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:10,640
- Here is meat.
- We need the chorus.

2063
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,540
If you dance diligently,
you'll get meat.

2064
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:14,310
- How about the chorus?
- "Queencard."

2065
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:15,580
- The chorus is coming up.
- Hey.

2066
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:16,880
- The chorus is coming up.
- Hey.

2067
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,380
It's the chorus.

2068
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:20,750
- Queencard
- Queencard

2069
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:21,850
(Queencard!)

2070
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,720
(The queen takes
the center position.)

2071
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,790
(She has an inflatable dancing doll
on either side.)

2072
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,390
Ye Eun.

2073
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:31,360
Ye Eun, you're kicking up dust.

2074
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:35,730
(The huge inflatable dancing doll
flaps around.)

2075
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,770
Hey, why are you so big?

2076
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,330
Hey, you look like a giant.

2077
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,200
"I'm a queencard."

2078
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,110
(Next to the original queen)

2079
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:45,910
Hey, you look scary.

2080
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:47,480
(Attack on the queencard)

2081
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,410
(I'll go and eat meat.)

2082
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,680
She looks like a crane.

2083
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:54,920
(The clicking pose)

2084
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,550
- Click.
- Click.

2085
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:57,990
(A good example)

2086
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:59,820
- Click.
- Click.

2087
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,390
- That's good enough. Well done.
- Go ahead and eat.

2088
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,490
MIYEON is good.

2089
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:06,530
- Go ahead and eat.
- MIYEON, let's take some food.

2090
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:07,630
- Okay.
- Eat some food.

2091
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:08,760
- Well done. Eat some food.
- It was great.

2092
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:09,830
- MIYEON is good.
- Thank you.

2093
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:11,930
- Well done. Eat some food.
- Okay.

2094
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:13,830
The inflatable dancing dolls
were nice.

2095
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:14,900
(Highly satisfied)

2096
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,000
- MIYEON is the main vocalist,
- That's right.

2097
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,370
but she takes the stage
whenever there's music.

2098
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,570
Can I take this as well?

2099
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:21,380
- I want to eat.
- Go ahead and take it.

2100
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:23,540
- I see that MIYEON likes to dance.
- I think she's okay with it today.

2101
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,380
- She likes to dance.
- I guess I like to dance.

2102
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:27,920
- She likes to dance.
- Seriously. I didn't know.

2103
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,180
That was so funny.

2104
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:31,090
They were like
the inflatable dancing doll.

2105
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,430
- You know,
- That's right.

2106
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,690
SOYEON and MIYEON are
the guests of the day.

2107
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:42,100
- I learned a lot about i-dle today.
- Really?

2108
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,630
MIYEON is the main vocalist...

2109
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:44,830
- who doesn't like dancing.
- Yes.

2110
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:46,730
- That's right.
- I don't like it.

2111
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:48,570
I'm sorry, I didn't know
that MIYEON was the main vocalist.

2112
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:51,110
It isn't widely known
that you're the main vocalist.

2113
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:52,110
- Since you're pretty,
- Yes.

2114
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,140
everyone thinks
that you're the visual member.

2115
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,180
- Don't say that.
- That's right.

2116
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,380
- Seriously.
- MIYEON, stop being pretty.

2117
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,240
- Stop being pretty.
- Oh, my.

2118
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,410
- Her voice...
- Because of her good looks,

2119
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:00,010
- the words don't travel.
- Her voice is so...

2120
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:01,520
SOYEON, you have a nice tone.

2121
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,650
- Her tone suits variety shows.
- She...

2122
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,450
I'm happy to hear
that I have a nice tone here.

2123
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:07,620
- You have a nice tone.
- Yes.

2124
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:08,790
- That's right.
- Her voice is very...

2125
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,290
- It sticks to the ears.
- That's right.

2126
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:11,290
- Yes.
- Such tones sound very funny...

2127
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:12,490
- in period dramas.
- Period dramas?

2128
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:14,700
Please say,
"I'm the queen of Joseon."

2129
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,630
I'm the queen of Joseon.

2130
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:21,840
(This queen is like a chick
who has no dignity whatsoever.)

2131
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,640
- She has a nice tone.
- It's cute.

2132
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,340
- It's cute.
- It's very charming.

2133
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,310
- That's why she can rap.
- Yes.

2134
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:28,480
- That's right.
- She can rap.

2135
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,510
Her rap sounds great.

2136
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:31,080
It sounds amazing in a recording.

2137
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,480
Where are we going right now?

2138
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,550
The location we're headed to
is related the May,

2139
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:37,220
- the Family Month.
- Is that so?

2140
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,290
Which place could it be?

2141
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:40,250
- All right.
- My guess is the Teachers' Day.

2142
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:42,020
- That must be it.
- Jong Kook must be right.

2143
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:43,290
- You're a genius.
- Yes.

2144
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,660
- It's a school.
- It's a school.

2145
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,960
- It's a school.
- For goodness' sake.

2146
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,460
- Gosh, it really is a school.
- What?

2147
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,430
It's a school. I was right.

2148
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,200
- My goodness.
- Is it a school?

2149
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,370
It's about the Teachers' Day.

2150
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:54,600
(Just as Detective Kim predicted,
they arrive at a school.)

2151
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,670
Is it a school?

2152
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:57,910
- Do students get a day off?
- I guess they do on May 5.

2153
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,670
- What will we do here?
- Let's go.

2154
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:02,480
(Which secret gesture is related
to the Teachers' Day?)

2155
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,110
What's this? Is this a high school?

2156
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:05,780
What's this?

2157
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,250
What's this?

2158
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:10,050
Why do the desks look different
in this high school?

2159
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:11,350
This classroom is very small.

2160
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:15,090
You must've guessed
why you came here.

2161
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:17,190
We came to a school
since it was a place...

2162
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:19,260
that suited Teachers' Day,
one of the special days in May.

2163
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:22,030
- A teacher's kindness
- The school has one secret gesture.

2164
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,430
I'm sure you want to use
your brain since you're in school.

2165
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:26,500
- No.
- No.

2166
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:27,840
- No.
- No.

2167
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,370
- I don't want to use my brain.
- No.

2168
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:31,570
- I want to go to a snack bar.
- We don't want to do it.

2169
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:34,310
For a hint,
you'll have a quiz called...

2170
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:37,440
Good Thing If You Leave,
Bad Thing If You Come Back.

2171
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,610
You guys will be divided
into two teams.

2172
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:41,520
If you answer a question correctly,

2173
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,650
you'll get up and move
to the Answer Zone.

2174
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:47,760
But if a teammate gives
an incorrect answer,

2175
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,990
one person in the Answer Zone
will come back.

2176
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,990
- Back to the start.
- Won't it be never-ending?

2177
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:54,930
You'll return to the Quiz Zone
in the order...

2178
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:56,760
- of answering correctly.
- Okay.

2179
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,270
- It's similar to what we did.
- A team will win...

2180
01:09:58,270 --> 01:09:59,900
when all the members escape first.

2181
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,370
- We'll need good members.
- Depending on the result,

2182
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:03,140
- you'll receive one hint...
- That's right.

2183
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:05,140
- of a different difficulty level.
- That sounds good.

2184
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,540
You can divide up the members
as you want.

2185
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:07,710
This seating arrangement is nice.

2186
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:08,710
- Seok Jin.
- There's too much difference.

2187
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:10,440
I tested Daniel's knowledge...

2188
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,850
- during the last get-together.
- How's Daniel?

2189
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:13,310
His head is half-smashed.

2190
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:14,380
(His head is half-smashed.)

2191
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:15,580
- He just has...
- Daniel.

2192
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,550
- that image because of the glasses.
- Really?

2193
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:18,550
- His head is half-smashed.
- Really?

2194
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:19,920
- It's because of the glasses.
- I see.

2195
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,160
- Half-smashed.
- That's so funny.

2196
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,920
- Half-smashed.
- It's because of the glasses.

2197
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,090
- Really?
- I tested him.

2198
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:25,530
- We don't want Daniel.
- Everyone,

2199
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:27,160
let's divide ourselves
into winners and losers.

2200
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,360
- But...
- Okay.

2201
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,200
- Se Chan versus Daniel.
- Okay.

2202
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,700
- Se Chan, you're my opponent.
- Ji Hyo versus Ye Eun.

2203
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:32,770
- Winners and losers?
- Yes.

2204
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,170
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2205
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:35,870
(People who are on the same level
play rock-paper-scissors.)

2206
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,070
- I won.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2207
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,970
- I lost.
- Winners, go over there.

2208
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:40,210
- Losers, over here.
- Winners.

2209
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:42,310
- Let's do well.
- That team looks very strong.

2210
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:43,680
- Seriously.
- That team looks very strong.

2211
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,350
- Study the members.
- Good.

2212
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,480
- Without those two members,
- What?

2213
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,920
that team will totally crumble.

2214
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,050
I can't believe it.
I'm a university graduate.

2215
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:52,090
Hey.

2216
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,660
- How's MIYEON?
- MIYEON is bad at it.

2217
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:55,890
- Is she bad at it?
- Hey!

2218
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:58,090
- MIYEON is bad at it.
- I heard you.

2219
01:10:58,090 --> 01:10:59,830
- On the team...
- Is her head smashed?

2220
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:01,330
- Smashed?
- Yes.

2221
01:11:01,330 --> 01:11:03,030
Perhaps that'd be an exaggeration.

2222
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:04,230
But she's the worst on the team.

2223
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:05,300
Is that so?

2224
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:06,370
- Nonsense!
- Okay.

2225
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:07,740
- SOYEON.
- She's a know-it-all.

2226
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,000
- We...
- I'm a know-it-all.

2227
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,240
- MIYEON is good.
- I don't think that's the case.

2228
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,040
I think MIYEON is smarter than you.

2229
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:13,910
- You'll see.
- My goodness.

2230
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,040
"You'll see."

2231
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,380
- "You'll see."
- Her voice...

2232
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:18,480
- Are you okay?
- It's so funny.

2233
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,080
- Here comes the first question.
- Okay.

2234
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,080
What's an election system
to pick the next pope...

2235
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,150
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2236
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:26,620
(Jae Seok decided to answer
after listening to the first line.)

2237
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:28,090
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2238
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:29,260
Conclave.

2239
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,560
(Jae Seok is correct.)

2240
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,290
- He doesn't disappoint.
- Conclave.

2241
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:33,930
- He doesn't disappoint. Well done.
- Good.

2242
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:35,160
- Conclave.
- That was insane.

2243
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,230
What?

2244
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:38,430
What am I going to do?
Is the quiz going to be like this?

2245
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:39,530
- Okay.
- What was that?

2246
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,470
- All right.
- Concla?

2247
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:42,700
He's totally smart.

2248
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,510
- Was there a leak on the questions?
- It's okay.

2249
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:47,840
How did he know
that it was the conclave?

2250
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,340
It was all over the news
these days...

2251
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,840
- due to the election of the pope.
- That's right.

2252
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,150
- There was a movie, "Conclave."
- That's right.

2253
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:54,850
- But this question...
- I want a variety show-related one.

2254
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:57,050
The question is too serious.

2255
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:59,050
- The difficulty level is too high.
- MIYEON.

2256
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:01,190
- Yes.
- The questions should be serious.

2257
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,660
It was your first time
hearing about it, right?

2258
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:05,160
- It's common knowledge.
- Okay.

2259
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:08,460
- Philosopher John Stuart Mill...
- Let's go.

2260
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:09,730
said the following.

2261
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:10,860
- Okay.
- Johns?

2262
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:13,200
- What's this?
- "It is better to be a human..."

2263
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:14,440
- "than..."
- Let me answer.

2264
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,500
Socrates.

2265
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,900
(Seok Jin is correct.)

2266
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,210
- All right.
- There you go.

2267
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:20,070
- Seok Jin.
- Go.

2268
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:21,840
- He's so smart.
- Focus.

2269
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,940
SOYEON.

2270
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:24,240
Did you know the answer?

2271
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,580
(Shaking her head)

2272
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:27,820
- The oldies should leave.
- That's right.

2273
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,980
- The oldies should leave.
- Let's have a real match.

2274
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:31,090
- Focus.
- Let's go.

2275
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:33,020
- It's neck-and-neck.
- This is great.

2276
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,360
- Daniel.
- Let's go.

2277
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:36,790
In yutnori, geol means...

2278
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:37,930
- Let me answer.
- Yes?

2279
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:39,130
Lamb.

2280
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:40,260
Okay!

2281
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,500
(Jong Kook is correct.)

2282
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,400
- What's going on?
- Hold on a second.

2283
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,600
- Okay.
- We should listen to the question.

2284
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,600
- Okay!
- No one listens to the question.

2285
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:50,440
If we go in the order of age,
Haha is next.

2286
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:52,140
- Let's go.
- Then Ji Hyo is next.

2287
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:54,510
- The three everyone expected.
- Okay.

2288
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:55,540
Focus.

2289
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:57,010
- Okay.
- Focus, Ji Hyo.

2290
01:12:57,010 --> 01:12:58,680
Change your image.

2291
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,450
- Daniel, make use of your image.
- Okay.

2292
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:02,520
What's the name
of 1 of the 5 best palaces...

2293
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,520
of the Joseon dynasty...

2294
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,790
that was founded by Taejong?

2295
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:07,290
- Let me answer!
- Okay.

2296
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:09,520
We saw it. We went there.

2297
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,660
- Yes, we did.
- We went there.

2298
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,690
- It's in Jongno.
- Three, two...

2299
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:13,730
(There's a reason why
Haha is so excited.)

2300
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:17,630
(In Episode 693,
they had a history tour in Seoul.)

2301
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:23,540
(They saw and learned about
the Changdeokgung Palace.)

2302
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,510
Let me answer! We saw it.

2303
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:27,240
- Yes, we did.
- We went there.

2304
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,480
(Does Haha remember
the Changdeokgung Palace?)

2305
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,280
- It's in Jongno.
- Two...

2306
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,110
Changdeokgung Palace.

2307
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:33,750
(Haha is correct.)

2308
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:38,650
(Haha remembered it!)

2309
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:40,090
- Well done.
- You did it.

2310
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:41,190
That's right.

2311
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:42,590
- I was going to say it.
- I was going to say it.

2312
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:43,720
I was going to say it.

2313
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:44,990
Seriously. Changdeokgung Palace.

2314
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:47,630
- I can't believe this happened.
- Hey.

2315
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:48,900
(Meanwhile, the YEON Sisters
remain silent.)

2316
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,800
He's the second best on our team.

2317
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,730
Wait. The ones who are sitting down
shouldn't be nervous. It's okay.

2318
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,140
- It's too...
- But it'll be embarrassing...

2319
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,370
if you don't escape next.

2320
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,810
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2321
01:13:57,810 --> 01:13:59,070
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

2322
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:00,810
- It's neck-and-neck.
- It's neck-and-neck.

2323
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:04,750
In which country is the sacred place
of Buddhism...

2324
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:07,380
and the biggest temple
in the world that became...

2325
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,980
a UNESCO World Heritage Site,
Angkor Wat?

2326
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,150
- They don't know.
- Which place?

2327
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:12,320
- Angkor Wat.
- Angkor Wat?

2328
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,890
- Don't you know?
- You've heard of it many times.

2329
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:14,920
- Angkor Wat.
- Be quiet if you don't know.

2330
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,720
- All right.
- Be quiet if you don't know.

2331
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,290
(Answer: Cambodia)

2332
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:21,700
(Is it India?)

2333
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,030
The biggest temple in Korea?

2334
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,570
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2335
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,800
- Three,
- If it's wrong, one will sit down.

2336
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,040
- two...
- If it's wrong, one will sit down.

2337
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,070
- Turkiye.
- Go and sit down.

2338
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:33,170
(Incorrect)

2339
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:34,510
Turkiye.

2340
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:38,110
At least he didn't say, "Turkey."

2341
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:39,580
(I'm proud of him.)

2342
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:43,450
(The first one to answer,
Jae Seok returns to the Quiz Zone.)

2343
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:45,920
- Hey, say something.
- It's time to answer.

2344
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,390
- Give it a try if you want.
- MIYEON.

2345
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:50,520
- Okay.
- Let me answer. India.

2346
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,690
- India?
- For goodness' sake.

2347
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:54,960
(Seok Jin returns
to the Quiz Zone as well.)

2348
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,530
- MIYEON, I thought of India.
- MIYEON,

2349
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:58,870
- I thought of it too.
- Hey.

2350
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:02,500
- Jae Seok, answer the question.
- All right, Let me answer.

2351
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,670
Cambodia.

2352
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,370
- All right.
- How could you not know this?

2353
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:07,440
- I had no idea.
- I didn't think it was Cambodia.

2354
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,910
- You can get back up.
- My guess was Egypt.

2355
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,950
- My guess was India.
- My guess was India too.

2356
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:14,080
- I didn't think of Cambodia at all.
- Turkiye is the changed name.

2357
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,120
Cambodia.

2358
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,350
- Before Gojoseon came to be,
- Yes.

2359
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:19,420
this figure descended
from the sky...

2360
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:21,360
in order to spread
humanitarianism...

2361
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,320
- and married Ungnyeo.
- Let me answer.

2362
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,320
Dangun.

2363
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,690
- Good.
- No.

2364
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:26,930
- No way.
- I think it's incorrect.

2365
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:28,400
- That's...
- Go back to your seat.

2366
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,430
- Go back.
- Isn't it Dangun?

2367
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:30,800
- Let's listen to the question.
- Come back.

2368
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,100
(With Haha's return, Team Seok Jin
goes back to the beginning.)

2369
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:34,570
- Let's listen to the question.
- Come back.

2370
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:36,200
- Let's listen to the question.
- Let her finish.

2371
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,600
Who is the mythological figure...

2372
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,310
who married Ungnyeo
and fathered Dangun?

2373
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:42,040
- You know the answer, right?
- Hold on.

2374
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:43,880
- You should know the answer.
- Why...

2375
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,210
- Is it Dangun's dad?
- What's the answer?

2376
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:47,580
- Correct.
- Yes. That's right.

2377
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,980
- All right.
- Dangun's dad.

2378
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,750
- Don't you know?
- Do you mean Dangun's father?

2379
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:51,890
- Dangun's...
- Dangun's dad.

2380
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:53,520
- Dangun's dad.
- Dangun's dad.

2381
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:56,320
- This is... They don't know.
- Grandpa Dangun

2382
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,820
(Singing)

2383
01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:01,430
(She tries to think of the answer
by singing a song.)

2384
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:03,700
This figure came
before Dangun settled down.

2385
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,530
With the humanitarian spirit,
he founded a nation

2386
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:08,200
This figure came
before the events of that song.

2387
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,640
Did he come before those events?

2388
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:12,140
- That song only mentions Dangun.
- He came before Dangun.

2389
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:13,710
(Grandpa Dangun's birth
isn't in the song.)

2390
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:16,340
- Grandpa Dangun...
- I'll give a hint...

2391
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,510
- since everyone has a chance.
- Okay.

2392
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,080
- He married Ungnyeo, right?
- That's right.

2393
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,150
- His name ends with "Ung."
- That's right.

2394
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:24,180
- SOYEON will go. It's okay.
- I don't know.

2395
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:25,220
- Let me answer.
- No.

2396
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:27,350
His name ends with "Ung?" Hwanung.

2397
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,990
- What?
- It's correct.

2398
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:30,220
- Hey.
- How did you know?

2399
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:31,360
- SOYEON.
- How did you know?

2400
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,930
(She answered correctly
as soon as she heard a hint.)

2401
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:34,960
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

2402
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,730
- Why did she act like...
- SOYEON, how did you know?

2403
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:37,860
she didn't know the answer?

2404
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,270
I heard the name somewhere.

2405
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:40,770
- How did you know?
- I heard the name somewhere.

2406
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:42,400
- I heard the name somewhere.
- My goodness.

2407
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:43,870
- This is insane.
- Hwanung saved me.

2408
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:45,840
- There's no balance.
- I think we'll win.

2409
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,040
- Let's stay quiet.
- Hurry up.

2410
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,080
- All right.
- Let's stay quiet.

2411
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,510
- Se Chan, let's not answer.
- What's an economic term...

2412
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:52,250
for a phenomenon
where the prices fall...

2413
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,580
and the value of money rises
due to economic recession?

2414
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:56,880
We got it often back in the day.

2415
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,050
- We got it very often.
- Two.

2416
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:59,350
What? Inflation?

2417
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:01,560
- We got it often back in the day.
- We got it very often.

2418
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:03,060
Let me answer. Deflation.

2419
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,360
- No.
- Nice!

2420
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,660
Yes!

2421
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:08,730
Hey, what's wrong with you guys?

2422
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:10,200
- You should've answered.
- I knew the answer.

2423
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,630
- Ye Eun.
- I knew the answer.

2424
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:13,270
- I was worried about messing up.
- I knew the answer.

2425
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:15,240
- I knew, but I couldn't say it.
- Just give your answer.

2426
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,640
- You need to answer.
- Just do it. We need to win.

2427
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,040
- Film my mouth.
- One of you needs to answer next.

2428
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,510
- Go.
- All right.

2429
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:24,040
The female Prime Minister
who revived the economy in the UK...

2430
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,110
and served the nation for 11 years,

2431
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:28,350
- Margaret Thatcher...
- Hurry up.

2432
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:29,720
Let me answer. Never mind.

2433
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:30,980
- Go ahead.
- No.

2434
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,120
- She was called "'Blank' Lady."
- Hurry up.

2435
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,220
- What goes in the blank?
- What's the answer?

2436
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:36,220
- Hey, it's easy.
- "Blank" Lady?

2437
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:38,130
- It's easy.
- Don't give a hint.

2438
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,360
- Okay.
- Parisian Lady?

2439
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,190
- Gosh.
- Come on.

2440
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:43,260
(He proved that
his head was half-smashed.)

2441
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,500
For goodness' sake.

2442
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,600
- All right.
- It's the other team's turn.

2443
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,070
- You have three seconds.
- No.

2444
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:48,970
- Three, two...
- I'm sure you've heard of it.

2445
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:50,640
- Athenian. Athenian Lady?
- Yes?

2446
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,140
Athenian Lady?

2447
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:55,310
(Answer: Iron)

2448
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:56,310
(Jae Seok returns once again.)

2449
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:57,480
- Let me answer.
- Seok Jin, answer the question.

2450
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,950
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2451
01:17:58,950 --> 01:17:59,950
Iron Lady.

2452
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:02,250
- I see. Iron Lady.
- It was an easy one.

2453
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,550
- Iron Lady.
- This is driving me crazy.

2454
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,920
- Margaret Thatcher.
- Athenian Lady!

2455
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,120
Thank goodness.
I almost said, "Gypsy Lady."

2456
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:12,030
Gypsy, gypsy, gypsy

2457
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:13,890
Gypsy lady

2458
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,560
That's so funny.

2459
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,860
Parisian Lady, Athenian Lady,

2460
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,070
- Gypsy Lady.
- Gypsy Lady.

2461
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:20,970
- That's funny.
- That's so funny.

2462
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:24,270
All right. What's the capital
of the first democratic nation...

2463
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:25,540
where
the international sports event...

2464
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,240
Let me answer. Athens.

2465
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:28,540
Correct.

2466
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:30,680
- My goodness.
- How did this happen?

2467
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,650
(He answered correctly
before hearing the full question!)

2468
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:34,550
- Good.
- Hey, you guys.

2469
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:36,220
You guys are so stupid.

2470
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:37,250
He got out.

2471
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:38,790
- How did you get out?
- No way.

2472
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:39,990
(Yang Empty Head
miraculously escaped!)

2473
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:41,990
- How tasty.
- It's Ye Eun's turn.

2474
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:43,320
- Ye Eun.
- You can do it.

2475
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,660
- Ye Eun, escape right away.
- You can do it.

2476
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,430
- Hey.
- Jae Seok, we're ahead.

2477
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,130
- Hold on. Guys.
- Ye Eun, get ready.

2478
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:50,060
If Ye Eun escapes in this round,

2479
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,800
there's a big chance
that we'll lose in the next round.

2480
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:52,800
- That's right.
- That's right.

2481
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,670
- Ye Eun, don't answer first.
- Okay.

2482
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:56,440
- Good.
- Let them answer incorrectly.

2483
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,640
- That's right.
- Then...

2484
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,040
- Jae Seok...
- I'll keep my mouth shut.

2485
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:01,610
What's the metallic money
of the Joseon dynasty...

2486
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:02,610
You got this.

2487
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:04,950
What's the metallic money
of the Joseon dynasty...

2488
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:05,950
You got this.

2489
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,310
that was mentioned
in "The Veritable Records..."

2490
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:09,550
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2491
01:19:09,550 --> 01:19:10,750
- Sangpyeong tongbo.
- Okay.

2492
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:12,690
- Okay.
- Okay.

2493
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:15,490
- Jong Kook talks about it often.
- Jae Seok.

2494
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:17,690
- Okay.
- You should've gotten it right.

2495
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:19,490
- I knew the answer.
- Jae Seok.

2496
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:21,030
- I knew the answer.
- That's right.

2497
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,200
- Sangpyeong tongbo.
- It's okay.

2498
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,730
- You should've gotten it right.
- Look at the remaining people.

2499
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:24,930
- Okay.
- It's okay.

2500
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:27,400
(The lineup puts
the other team at ease.)

2501
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,840
- Perhaps I should escape 1st.
- Jae Seok, escape 1st.

2502
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:31,370
Okay. Shall I escape first?

2503
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:32,710
- Let's see.
- No.

2504
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:34,570
- No.
- What are you talking about?

2505
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:36,240
You should've gotten
"Sangpyeong tongbo" right.

2506
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,640
- I agree.
- Ye Eun.

2507
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,210
It's okay. You're Shin-chan.

2508
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:40,910
- You're a university graduate.
- Yes.

2509
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,350
- Did you call me round?
- A university graduate?

2510
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,750
- Round?
- Round?

2511
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,650
- Why would she say that?
- Hey.

2512
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:48,520
- Why would she call you round?
- Seriously.

2513
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,820
- Round.
- Why would she do that?

2514
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:51,160
Ye Eun is unbelievable.

2515
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:53,660
Even when she's on good terms
with someone,

2516
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:55,500
- she becomes sensitive.
- Let's see.

2517
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:58,630
- You'll see a new expression.
- A new expression.

2518
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:00,800
- I want to get it right. Please.
- MIYEON.

2519
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,140
- Please.
- What's a new expression?

2520
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,500
This is a question for Ye Eun.

2521
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,800
- A new expression.
- I don't know many new expressions.

2522
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,410
Say the meaning of this expression.

2523
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:08,640
- The meaning.
- I think it'll be hard.

2524
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,280
- Ye Eun might have an advantage.
- One, two, three.

2525
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,610
(What does a new expression,
AFM mean?)

2526
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:12,780
- What?
- AFM?

2527
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:14,750
Come up with something.
It's an abbreviation.

2528
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:16,050
- What?
- What's that?

2529
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:17,320
- AFM?
- Come up with something.

2530
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,720
It's an abbreviation.

2531
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,990
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2532
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:21,450
As for me.

2533
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:24,090
(Haha is correct.)

2534
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:25,360
- You're correct.
- My goodness.

2535
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:28,060
(He's surprised
that his answer is correct.)

2536
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,230
My goodness.

2537
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,770
(How is it correct?)

2538
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:35,700
Haha said it to be funny.

2539
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,740
- But it was correct.
- He got lucky.

2540
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,340
How did you do that?

2541
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:40,870
- Was it a wild guess?
- My goodness.

2542
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:41,940
Ye Eun is shocked.

2543
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:43,480
Do people really use
that expression?

2544
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,180
You're lying. AFM?

2545
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:46,950
- As for me...
- There it is.

2546
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:48,880
Who uses that expression?

2547
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,890
- It's 2 to 2.
- If 1 person escapes, we'll be set.

2548
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,950
It's 2 to 2,
but they not on the same level.

2549
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:56,460
- We can't let Ye Eun escape.
- What's the capital of Finland?

2550
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,990
- What? You know this, right?
- Hey, you know this.

2551
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:00,130
- You know this, right?
- Let me answer.

2552
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:01,630
- I didn't hear the question.
- Helsinki.

2553
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,360
Jae Seok, why did you answer
correctly?

2554
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,030
- I did it because she didn't know.
- It was for the best.

2555
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:06,070
- Okay.
- Was it Helsinki?

2556
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:07,070
- Okay.
- It was Helsinki.

2557
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,300
- I know Helsinki.
- You escaped.

2558
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:10,100
- Let's go back if she's wrong.
- Let's do that. That's right.

2559
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,670
- Did you know?
- Was it Helsinki?

2560
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:12,710
- No.
- It was Helsinki.

2561
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:15,440
(Two strong members remain
in Team Seok Jin.)

2562
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,580
- Let's go back if she's wrong.
- Let's do that. That's right.

2563
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:17,710
Helsinki.

2564
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:19,650
- Did you know?
- You escaped.

2565
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,710
Helsinki?

2566
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,180
Listen. If Ye Eun escapes,
it'll be game over.

2567
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,320
I don't know.

2568
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,590
- Ye Eun.
- You need to escape.

2569
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:26,820
Let's do well.

2570
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:29,020
What's the capital of Chile?

2571
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:30,820
I hate these questions.

2572
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:31,860
- My goodness.
- Hold on.

2573
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:34,760
- Don't answer if you aren't sure.
- The capital of Chile.

2574
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:36,200
I don't know.

2575
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,800
- Ye Eun, go ahead.
- Don't feel pressured, Ye Eun.

2576
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,900
- It's okay. Hold out.
- Ye Eun, hurry up.

2577
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,400
- I don't have a clue.
- Hold out.

2578
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,770
Look at the other team.
They don't know either.

2579
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:43,340
- Use your brain.
- If you know, answer.

2580
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:44,940
(Dazed)

2581
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:46,070
- Is there a hint?
- No.

2582
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:47,810
We had a concert in Chile.

2583
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:48,910
Ye Eun.

2584
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:51,750
MIYEON, you had a concert there.
Go through your memories.

2585
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,810
In that case, can I give it a try?

2586
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:55,550
- Yes.
- Give it a try.

2587
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:56,780
- You should give it a try.
- Am I wrong?

2588
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:58,120
- It's okay.
- Give it a try.

2589
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,620
- Give it a try.
- Give it a try.

2590
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:01,450
- I'm not sure.
- Go ahead and answer.

2591
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:02,760
I don't know if it was a dream.

2592
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,020
- I think I learned it.
- Go ahead.

2593
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,860
- Go ahead. That's it.
- Hey.

2594
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,690
- Chile.
- What?

2595
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:10,230
(The capital of Chile, Chile)

2596
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:11,400
What was that?

2597
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,130
- You dreamed about it.
- MIYEON.

2598
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,670
- Are you kidding me?
- It was a dream.

2599
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:16,740
You dreamed about it.

2600
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:18,910
It was a dream.

2601
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:20,540
The capital of Chile, Chile.

2602
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:22,640
- Was it a dream?
- Yes. You did well.

2603
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:25,010
- What's wrong with you?
- The capital of Chile, Chile?

2604
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,810
Some capitals have the name
of the respective nation.

2605
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:28,520
- That's right.
- Some capitals are like that.

2606
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:31,120
- She's all over the place.
- All right.

2607
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:32,350
(With Seok Jin's return,
it's 1 to 3.)

2608
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:34,990
- I have no idea.
- Pele.

2609
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:36,360
(Answer: Santiago)

2610
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,020
(Laughing)

2611
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:39,660
Luxembourg.

2612
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:41,730
(Incorrect)

2613
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:44,030
- The next one is you.
- The next one is me.

2614
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:45,700
Is that so?

2615
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,170
- Hold on.
- Chile?

2616
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,040
- Okay.
- I think Ye Eun knows.

2617
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,470
- Santiago.
- That's right.

2618
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,670
(Jong Kook escapes
as soon as he sits down.)

2619
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:53,840
(Meanwhile)

2620
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,240
You should've answered quickly.

2621
01:22:56,410 --> 01:22:57,740
The representative Silhak scholar...

2622
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,510
- of the late Joseon dynasty...
- Let me answer. Chong Yag Yong.

2623
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:02,550
Kept in the Janggyeong Panjeon
of the Haeinsa Temple,

2624
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:03,550
- Korea's...
- Go ahead.

2625
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:05,490
Let me answer. "Tripitaka Koreana."

2626
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:10,990
(The godmother of the Empty Heads
escapes the Quiz Zone.)

2627
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:15,530
(The last 2 members remain.)

2628
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,930
- How could you not know it?
- I know it.

2629
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:20,400
- I know it when I hear it.
- Why didn't you answer?

2630
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,430
What's wrong with you?

2631
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:23,000
- You can beat MIYEON.
- Queencard!.

2632
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,470
- It's okay.
- Hey.

2633
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,670
- You can beat MIYEON.
- Ye Eun.

2634
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:27,440
- It's a match between the two.
- MIYEON, you can do it.

2635
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:28,510
Ye Eun.

2636
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:31,410
- Ye Eun!
- It's MIYEON versus Ye Eun.

2637
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:32,880
- MIYEON.
- MIYEON, you can do it.

2638
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,310
- Listen.
- Hey.

2639
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,780
- She's nothing.
- They'll give you a question...

2640
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:37,180
- you and Ye Eun can answer.
- Yes.

2641
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,920
- So you can answer it.
- Say, "Let me answer."

2642
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:41,290
- Answer quickly.
- You can do it.

2643
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:42,320
- Ye Eun.
- Answer quickly.

2644
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,660
- Yes. "Let me answer."
- Say it quickly.

2645
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:45,090
- I knew the last one.
- It's okay if it's wrong.

2646
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:48,860
(The last match for a better hint)

2647
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:52,070
What's the revival movement
of the cultures...

2648
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:53,830
that primarily took place
in Italy...

2649
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:56,140
and other countries in Europe...

2650
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:58,100
from the 14th century...

2651
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,540
- to the 16th century?
- You got it. It's so easy.

2652
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:00,670
- What is it?
- You know it.

2653
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:02,010
- It's really easy.
- The revival moment...

2654
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:03,980
- of the cultures?
- You've heard it many times.

2655
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:05,680
Renaissance.

2656
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,850
- Don't give a hint.
- You know it, right?

2657
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:09,820
- It's so easy.
- You've heard it many times.

2658
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:12,790
This word gets thrown around
all the time.

2659
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:13,790
- Italy...
- I mean...

2660
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:14,820
- and other countries...
- What is it?

2661
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:16,290
- I'll know once I hear it.
- You know it, right?

2662
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:18,430
Just say what comes to your mind.

2663
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:20,360
- It's a foreign word.
- It's near Gangbyeon.

2664
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,560
What?

2665
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,200
It's the word
for the cultural revolution.

2666
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,230
- There aren't many other words.
- No.

2667
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:27,830
- Europe.
- Think of a foreign word...

2668
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:29,570
you've heard very often.

2669
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:32,140
- A foreign word.
- It has to do with fanciness.

2670
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:33,640
- You know it too.
- Innovation.

2671
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,710
You've heard of it.

2672
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:36,580
This is driving me crazy.

2673
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,140
(Will Ye Eun be able
to think of it first?)

2674
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,480
You'll know when you hear it.

2675
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,680
MIYEON,
you'll know when you hear it.

2676
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,150
Both of them know the word.

2677
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:43,280
- I know!
- Okay.

2678
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,420
- She knows the answer.
- I know!

2679
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:45,850
- Okay.
- She knows the answer.

2680
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:47,090
Renaissance.

2681
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:48,420
(MIYEON is correct.)

2682
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:49,860
Renaissance.

2683
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:51,320
(The blank facial expression
was a feint!)

2684
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,460
(Since MIYEON is correct,
Team Seok Jin wins!)

2685
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,330
- Well done!
- You did it!

2686
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,360
- Queencard
- Queencard

2687
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:02,040
(Her butt was heavy
in a literal sense!)

2688
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:05,670
She's today's king of the quizzes,
Ji Ye Eun.

2689
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:07,870
She's a university graduate.

2690
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:10,240
Well done.

2691
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,310
- Ye Eun.
- Well done.

2692
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:13,980
It's okay, Ye Eun.
You're a university graduate.

2693
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,050
You could get it wrong too.

2694
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:16,780
- She was greatly humiliated.
- You could have...

2695
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:18,950
- Greatly humiliated.
- It's okay. You've heard of it.

2696
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:20,690
- You've heard of it, right?
- They're teasing her.

2697
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:24,420
This team won
since all five members escaped.

2698
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,830
We'll give the team that won
an easy hint,

2699
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,060
and we'll give the team that lost
a difficult hint.

2700
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:31,030
- We're still getting one now.
- Right. Let's do this.

2701
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:32,570
- Let's do this.
- Let's try.

2702
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:34,530
- It's a hard one, but we could try.
- That's right.

2703
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:37,340
The first five to carry out
the hidden gesture...

2704
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,910
will be leaving work quickly.

2705
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:41,880
The other five will be candidates
to receive the penalty.

2706
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,410
- Here?
- What is this?

2707
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:45,810
- What is this?
- This is how it is?

2708
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:47,180
This is a school.

2709
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:49,180
So they gave us
numbers related to schools.

2710
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:50,980
- We have to do this gesture?
- Yes.

2711
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:52,150
- What is this?
- It's the same as before.

2712
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:53,720
Is it about singing?

2713
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:54,750
(General hint: 0515)

2714
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,190
- What?
- Singing.

2715
01:25:56,190 --> 01:26:00,260
The teacher's grace is like the sky

2716
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:03,130
- Wouldn't that be it?
- I don't think it's that easy.

2717
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,770
Is it a passcode? What is it?

2718
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:07,430
- That's possible.
- They're numbers.

2719
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:08,430
- What's this?
- Ye Eun.

2720
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:10,540
(Team Seok Jin
received a high-class hint.)

2721
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:11,800
- What is this?
- Is it anxiety?

2722
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:13,540
- Isn't this...
- Isn't it a tire?

2723
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:15,140
Right. It's a tire.

2724
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:16,310
I don't know what it is.

2725
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:18,040
The car frame of a Carnival.

2726
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,680
Is this the car frame?

2727
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:22,350
- This is the tire.
- I get the tire.

2728
01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:23,720
I don't know. Do you get it?

2729
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,750
What is this?
I know what it is, but...

2730
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:27,650
- Right. I don't get what it means.
- We have to guess.

2731
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:28,990
What does it mean?

2732
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:30,090
(What do the hints 0515
and a car mean?)

2733
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:32,960
Both teams can leave now.

2734
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,030
Seriously. I really don't...

2735
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:37,400
Are there more rooms?

2736
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,630
(General hint: 0515)

2737
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:41,670
It would be related
to Teacher's Day, right?

2738
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,300
What would it be?
Is there an extension telephone?

2739
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:46,140
Someone could pick up
when we press 0515.

2740
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:47,640
Maybe a song will be played
when we press 0515...

2741
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:48,780
on the karaoke machine.

2742
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:52,910
Since it's Teacher's Day...

2743
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:55,650
(General hint: 0515)

2744
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:56,850
Teacher's room?

2745
01:26:56,850 --> 01:26:58,520
(General hint: 0515)

2746
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,620
Classroom?

2747
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:01,490
Where are you going, SOYEON?

2748
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:03,260
(The members who only received
the number hint search indoors.)

2749
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,190
- What is this?
- Teacher's room?

2750
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,900
- But the picture...
- Picture?

2751
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,600
They said they received
a picture earlier.

2752
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,700
- Yes. They were holding a picture.
- Yes.

2753
01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:16,300
It's so difficult. And...

2754
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,770
I have no idea.

2755
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,810
Are we looking for a teacher?

2756
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:24,310
What do I do? What gesture do I do?

2757
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:26,150
(High-class hint)

2758
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:28,050
What are we supposed to do?

2759
01:27:28,050 --> 01:27:29,050
(He also has no idea.)

2760
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:30,380
Do I have to take a picture?

2761
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:34,190
(He takes a picture
just like the hint.)

2762
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:35,860
(High-class hint)

2763
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:36,920
Is it not this?

2764
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,690
(High-class hint)

2765
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:40,590
Is it not this car? Is it this one?

2766
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:42,100
Should I take a picture of this car?

2767
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:43,560
(High-class hint)

2768
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,330
(But...)

2769
01:27:46,930 --> 01:27:47,930
It's this car, right?

2770
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,070
(The number plate looks weird.)

2771
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:50,070
What's this car?

2772
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:52,070
What is this? I really...

2773
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:54,770
Is it not about cars?
Where did I put it?

2774
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:57,040
(There are numbers similar to 0515.)

2775
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:58,910
What is this? 0515?

2776
01:27:58,910 --> 01:28:00,080
What's 0515?

2777
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,820
This place is too big.

2778
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:04,250
The school...

2779
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:05,950
But the hint...

2780
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:07,820
- What is this?
- It's 0515?

2781
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:12,360
It's confusing. It's so hard.

2782
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:13,760
- Seok Jin.
- What... Yes.

2783
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:15,060
- What's your hint?
- What?

2784
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:16,930
Should we share our hints?

2785
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:19,030
- Should we share?
- Yes.

2786
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:20,830
- You helped me earlier.
- Right.

2787
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:22,400
- Let's share.
- Let's share our hints.

2788
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,400
- Okay.
- You have one.

2789
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,970
- Let's share. Come here.
- Let's share.

2790
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:26,910
- Let's do it together.
- Let's do it together.

2791
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:28,510
- Come here. Let's do it together.
- We could win if we do it together.

2792
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:29,810
- Let's show them.
- Chungju...

2793
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:30,840
- Jee and Ji. Cross.
- Cross.

2794
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:31,840
Let's see.

2795
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,350
- What's yours?
- I'll show you.

2796
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:34,950
Here. It's hard.

2797
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:36,980
- What's this?
- I did think of this.

2798
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:41,920
- I couldn't see it. What is that?
- It's a tire. It's just a tire.

2799
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,160
(They checked the hints.)

2800
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,460
Don't tell anyone.
That's why I'm not giving it to you.

2801
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:46,690
- You might give it to others.
- What are you doing here?

2802
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:47,890
(At that time)

2803
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:50,730
We formed an alliance.

2804
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:52,000
I want to join too.

2805
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:54,530
- We...
- Is it a two-person alliance?

2806
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:55,900
Yes, because...

2807
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:57,540
- I...
- Darn it.

2808
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:00,040
- I got everything I wanted.
- No way.

2809
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:01,740
I saw that.

2810
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,580
It's 0515.

2811
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,650
Hey. You...

2812
01:29:05,650 --> 01:29:06,950
Why is no one here?

2813
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:10,520
(MIYEON also heads to find an ally.)

2814
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,920
Over there.

2815
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:15,860
- No entry.
- We can go out, right?

2816
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:16,920
(She found people
to form an ally with.)

2817
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:19,330
- What?
- Me too. Let's share our hints.

2818
01:29:19,330 --> 01:29:21,060
- Let's do it together.
- Let's share our hints.

2819
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:22,900
- No. We have enough here.
- MIYEON.

2820
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,860
Hey, SOYEON.

2821
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:26,300
- What are you saying?
- We just need two to share.

2822
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:28,740
We have to do it together
to solve it quickly.

2823
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,640
You have to promise not to leave me.

2824
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:32,770
- Right.
- I will never leave you.

2825
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:34,610
- Right.
- Today's mission...

2826
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:36,040
- What are you doing?
- Right.

2827
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,040
We did it together.

2828
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:41,510
We don't need him as well.
He and I have the same hint.

2829
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:43,720
You two can play
rock-paper-scissors.

2830
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:46,090
Hold on. Ji Hyo?

2831
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:47,090
Yes?

2832
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:49,960
- Let's share our hints.
- Yes.

2833
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,430
- Let's see.
- One, two, three.

2834
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:54,790
(The i-dle union
is putting its heads together.)

2835
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:55,860
A tire?

2836
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,530
Maybe we have to find this car.
Isn't it the car number?

2837
01:29:58,630 --> 01:30:00,730
I think so.

2838
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:02,640
(The i-dle union succeeded
in guessing first.)

2839
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,940
I think it is.

2840
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:06,770
(They head to find 0515.)

2841
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:09,180
Why are you suddenly
running with a smile?

2842
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:13,810
(MIYEON runs ahead
to find the 0515 car.)

2843
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:14,910
It's not this one.

2844
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,080
(11 Run 0508)

2845
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:18,520
(But there's no car
with 0515 on the number plate.)

2846
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:19,520
It's not here.
(But there's no car
with 0515 on the number plate.)

2847
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,590
What was the number? Was it 0515?

2848
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:27,960
Is it over there?

2849
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,060
(SOYEON heads somewhere else.)

2850
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:32,600
Wait.

2851
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:36,800
You promised to do it with me!

2852
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,200
Goodness. It's a car?

2853
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:40,240
Goodness. It was the plates?

2854
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,040
- When did everyone...
- What is it?

2855
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:43,140
I guess there's something there.

2856
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:44,940
No!

2857
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:47,980
- What is it?
- What is it?

2858
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:49,420
(It's about who finds 0515 first.)

2859
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:51,350
- What is it?
- Why are you all here?

2860
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:53,350
What is it?

2861
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:56,960
- Hold on.
- Why?

2862
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,460
Darn it.

2863
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:01,890
(It's not here as well.)

2864
01:31:04,230 --> 01:31:05,360
It's not this one either?

2865
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:09,940
The driver is sleeping.

2866
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,240
- Is there a 0515 car?
- Did you find it?

2867
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:14,440
- What is it?
- Is it the plates?

2868
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:15,510
Are we going to the cars?

2869
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:17,240
(Haha)

2870
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:18,810
I guess it's up there.

2871
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:22,220
Hold on.

2872
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:24,880
- Is there a 0515 car?
- Is it up there?

2873
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,250
(The members are searching cars
and looking for 0515.)

2874
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:30,560
(The sound of his brain working.)

2875
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:34,430
(Haha, with 20 years of experience,
heads somewhere.)

2876
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:37,300
(There's is another parking lot?)

2877
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:38,870
(There were more cars
hidden in another building.)

2878
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:39,900
What's this?

2879
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,500
(There were more cars
hidden in another building.)

2880
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,840
(He checks the number plates
as soon as he arrives.)

2881
01:31:44,770 --> 01:31:45,940
Where...

2882
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:47,740
(The competition winner found Haha.)

2883
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:49,310
There are so many cars.

2884
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,480
It's 0515. It's here.

2885
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:56,350
(He found 0515.)

2886
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:59,890
(Haha found the car
without forming any alliance.)

2887
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:00,890
Here.

2888
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:03,060
(SOYEON appears as well.)

2889
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,360
- It's 0515.
- It's 0515.

2890
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,830
- What is this?
- What is this?

2891
01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:10,930
You succeeded in getting in the car.
Please wait a moment.

2892
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:12,630
Okay. Close the door.

2893
01:32:12,630 --> 01:32:13,930
- It's crazy.
- Goodness.

2894
01:32:14,130 --> 01:32:15,230
What is it?

2895
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,410
(Ye Eu, who searched
with a bent back, also gets in.)

2896
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:20,510
I found it!

2897
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:22,510
- It's 0515.
- Okay.

2898
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:23,780
This is a surprise.

2899
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:25,310
It's 0515, right?

2900
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:26,780
What would it be?

2901
01:32:26,810 --> 01:32:30,080
Is there nothing here?
Are there no cars here?

2902
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:31,980
Where's SOYEON?

2903
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:39,760
Ji Hyo. Hurry, Ji Hyo.

2904
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:44,830
There are cars here as well.

2905
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:46,200
There are cameras here.

2906
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,730
There were cars here as well.

2907
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:49,000
Hurry up, Ji Hyo.

2908
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:52,540
- We found it!
- It's here!

2909
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:54,440
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo)

2910
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,180
- Hurry.
- It's here.

2911
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:58,880
You can take the last seat.
Hurry up.

2912
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,410
Hurry up.

2913
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:01,680
We're all here.

2914
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:02,980
It's over.

2915
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:04,720
- The car is full.
- Congratulations.

2916
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,590
The five members, excluding Daniel,

2917
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:08,250
- What?
- have succeeded.

2918
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:09,620
(The 5 members, excluding Daniel,
succeeded in the secret gesture.)

2919
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:14,190
(We're going home!)

2920
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:15,330
Goodness.

2921
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:17,560
There were cars here as well.

2922
01:33:19,070 --> 01:33:20,500
This is so thrilling.

2923
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,340
- It's so nice.
- It feels so nice.

2924
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:25,870
We'll get going, Seok Sam.
Good luck.

2925
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:27,270
Good game.

2926
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:29,180
- Did you go in with Dong Hoon?
- I couldn't.

2927
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:30,410
- Who was in the car?
- There was a 0515 car?

2928
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:31,810
Everyone who went there
except me got in the car.

2929
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:33,450
- Five of them?
- Where was the car?

2930
01:33:33,450 --> 01:33:34,680
- Inside there.
- Right?

2931
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,980
- It was in there.
- That's right.

2932
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:37,980
- Inside?
- We checked this side.

2933
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,790
Did they all leave?

2934
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:43,090
They're in the car over there.

2935
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:44,990
- There was a 0515 car.
- Will they be leaving like that?

2936
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,890
Hey, SOYEON!

2937
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:48,860
Bye, MIYEON!

2938
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:50,500
- Bye.
- You're annoying.

2939
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,770
You can stop right here.

2940
01:33:52,770 --> 01:33:55,430
Those sneaky ones.
Dong Hoon got in too.

2941
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,170
- MIYEON.
- You said...

2942
01:33:57,170 --> 01:33:58,640
- you wouldn't leave me.
- Seok Jin.

2943
01:33:58,640 --> 01:33:59,970
- MIYEON.
- You're the worst.

2944
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:02,240
- You betrayed me.
- Why did you not follow me?

2945
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,810
- You abandoned me.
- No.

2946
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:05,410
You should have found it.

2947
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:07,480
What is this? Are we supposed
to stand in front of it?

2948
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:09,650
- What's going to explode?
- How many of them?

2949
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:12,750
Three will go off, and two won't.

2950
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:14,650
- I'll let you pick one first.
- Go ahead.

2951
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:15,760
- Number three.
- Okay.

2952
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:16,760
- Number three.
- Pick one.

2953
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:17,890
I pick this one.

2954
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:19,360
Will you pick number five?

2955
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:20,530
I'll get what remains.

2956
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:21,760
- I pick number five.
- Okay.

2957
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:22,860
- I'll take number two.
- Like this?

2958
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:24,560
- Yes.
- Number five.

2959
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:26,970
- All right.
- Does anyone want to switch?

2960
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Do you want to switch?

2961
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,640
- Do you want to switch?
- Do you want to switch?

2962
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:30,770
- Let's switch.
- Switch.

2963
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:31,940
- You two will switch?
- Who will switch with me?

2964
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:33,270
- Me.
- Numbers 1 and 5.

2965
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:34,440
Yes. They're switching.

2966
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:36,140
I don't think
number three will go off.

2967
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:38,640
All right then.
Three of them will go off, right?

2968
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:42,180
Yes. As I count to three,
all of them will go off together.

2969
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:44,450
(Who are the 3 members
with the worst wits?)

2970
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:46,520
One, two, three.

2971
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:49,220
One, two, three.

2972
01:34:50,790 --> 01:34:51,860
Three.

2973
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:53,960
(MIYEON, Seok Sam, Daniel)

2974
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:55,190
- What? MIYEON...
- I'm safe!

2975
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:57,500
- What? It's MIYEON.
- Yes!

2976
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:58,760
- What? MIYEON...
- I'm safe!

2977
01:34:58,760 --> 01:34:59,830
I did it!

2978
01:34:59,830 --> 01:35:03,340
(Ssaebssaeb switched his choice
and escaped the penalty.)

2979
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,240
- What is this?
- I did it!

2980
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:07,810
- It's really annoying.
- SOYEON!

2981
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:10,610
- It's okay.
- This is it for today.

2982
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:12,710
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2983
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:16,880
(Running Man's spring election is
one step ahead of the real one.)

2984
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,420
When you are tired and exhausted,

2985
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:20,050
I will show you a set
of three cute acts.

2986
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:21,850
(Acting cute)

2987
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:24,760
- To the person who shouts the most,
- What?

2988
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:25,930
I'll give them 200 dollars.

2989
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:28,760
(The new face of the camp,
Actor Lee Seung Hyub)

2990
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,660
(An ambitious rookie,
Actress Park Ji Hu)

2991
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:35,200
(The unpredictable election
begins like that.)

2992
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,500
Why are you blushing?

2993
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,600
- Seung Hyub.
- She is...

2994
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:42,270
(The foolish passion and conspiracy
behind the big game)

2995
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:43,810
You ragged punk!

2996
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:45,310
- Ragged punk?
- This is...

2997
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:46,810
Think of Jae Seok.

2998
01:35:46,810 --> 01:35:48,650
He has no time to care
about the livelihoods of the public.

2999
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,950
(Are they finally
reaching an agreement?)

3000
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:53,350
- But you'll change your mind?
- Sure.

3001
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:56,060
(The shocking ending
to the fierce battle for votes!)

3002
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:57,190
(Vote in Spring)
