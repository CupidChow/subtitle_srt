00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,440
(Kim Jong Kook announces
his marriage on Running Man.)

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,470
(The day this article was released)

3
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,510
Hello.

4
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,110
Okay.

5
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,380
(The story of that day, which moved
up the show's broadcast time)

6
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,850
- Hello.
- Did you hear the news?

7
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:08,950
- What?
- Seok Jin,

8
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,580
Jong Kook is looking for you.

9
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,920
Okay. Why?

10
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,850
I'm getting married,
so you should be there.

11
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,590
- Who's getting married?
- I am.

12
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,860
- Are you getting married?
- Yes.

13
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,960
You're shooting something
for your YouTube channel, right?

14
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,760
- I'm serious.
- You're the bride.

15
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,030
- No. I'm serious.
- That's the theme, right?

16
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,760
- What's with your face?
- Is that true?

17
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,670
It's true. The article
will be published today.

18
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,470
Why did you hide it the whole time?

19
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,570
(Having trouble breathing)

20
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,040
(Panting and groaning)

21
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,370
I'm really moved.

22
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,210
Okay. Let's go.

23
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,580
- Jong Kook.
- Let's go.

24
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,480
Quiet. Okay.

25
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,680
- Hello.
- Is that true?

26
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,620
- Okay!
- I still can't believe this.

27
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,950
(Feeling awkward)

28
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,690
Nice to meet you.

29
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,020
Hello.

30
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,360
Okay. We're here.

31
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,460
- Okay.
- It's shocking news.

32
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,960
- I don't believe it.
- Let's stop talking about it.

33
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,730
(One person is making a fuss
while saying hello.)

34
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,300
Let's stop.

35
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,600
- Why?
- Why should we stop?

36
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,930
- Again...
- All right. Let's begin.

37
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,870
- All right.
- Why aren't you talking to me?

38
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,500
- You will talk about it.
- Why aren't you talking to me?

39
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,570
Will you talk about it
during the opening or not?

40
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,040
- He should talk about it.
- You didn't tell Ye Eun.

41
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,510
Why aren't you talking to me?

42
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
(Sighing)

43
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,980
- It's shocking.
- It's unbelievable.

44
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,350
Ji Hyo, who are you talking to?

45
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,420
- It's so shocking.
- I was just saving it.

46
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,380
- Save what? The date?
- Yes. I'm so happy for him.

47
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,390
- Are you happy for him?
- I am.

48
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,450
- Aren't you sad?
- Are you getting married?

49
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,950
- What?
- Are you getting married?

50
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,960
- Aren't you sad?
- Are you getting married?

51
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,660
- What?
- Are you getting married?

52
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,590
(They both are flustered.)

53
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,290
- He did?
- I thought he was joking.

54
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,300
- Seriously, it's...
- Anyway...

55
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,730
- He suddenly came into my car.
- Quiet.

56
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,970
- Why are you not telling me...
- Let's keep it down.

57
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,670
Why did you not tell me?

58
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,340
It's true. All right.
Let's begin, then.

59
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,340
- Begin what?
- Okay.

60
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,740
Are we going to talk
about it or not?

61
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,480
- We should talk about it.
- We should.

62
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,680
- There will be articles.
- Really?

63
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,280
- The articles will be released.
- Is he getting married?

64
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,410
- Is that true?
- Yes.

65
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,980
- He's getting married.
- That can't be true.

66
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,420
It's not marriage.

67
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,450
Anyway, that's what happened.
I'm getting married.

68
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,450
- Seriously?
- Why are you wrapping things up?

69
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,590
- What are you doing?
- You can't be doing this.

70
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,960
Tell us the whole story, Jong Kook.

71
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,190
- Tell us.
- If you do that...

72
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,230
- You should say it yourself.
- Okay.

73
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,000
- It's true. I'm getting married.
- What?

74
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,230
- Really?
- Yes. I'll live happily.

75
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,400
That's amazing.

76
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,470
- Thank you.
- My gosh.

77
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,470
(8 years ago)

78
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,100
(Since 8 years ago, they've wanted
the tiger to get married.)

79
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,840
- He needs to get married now.
- Right.

80
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,140
(7 years ago)

81
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,240
(It's not that you don't want
to get married. You want to.)

82
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,440
It's driving me crazy!

83
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,950
(6 years ago)

84
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,880
(You are becoming choosy,
and your muscles are getting fat.)

85
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
(4 years ago)

86
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,250
(If you say he can't get married
in three years,)

87
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,350
(do you think he will stay still?)

88
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,350
I think I can.

89
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,050
- Do you think he will let it slide?
- I'll get married for sure.

90
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,090
(1 year ago)

91
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,560
(- Will you get married or not?
- I should get married.)

92
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,960
(Kim Jong Kook, the bachelor, was
constantly nagged until last year.)

93
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,300
(I'll make sure
you see me get married.)

94
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,030
(I will have to stay alive
to see him get married anyway.)

95
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,030
(Please stay alive for a long time.)

96
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,470
(No one expected
it would actually happen.)

97
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,770
- Really?
- Yes. I'll live happily.

98
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,470
- I feel like crying.
- I got goosebumps.

99
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,410
Now you understand
why I feel like crying.

100
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,480
When the production staff
heard this...

101
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
- A lot of you didn't know, right?
- Everyone didn't know.

102
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,320
I just found out today.

103
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,980
- I just found out today.
- My goodness.

104
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,390
- I just found out too.
- Me too.

105
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,720
- I have a shoot scheduled that day.
- Right.

106
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,020
- I have to work too.
- Jong Kook is having...

107
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,330
the 30th anniversary concert
this year.

108
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,030
- Right.
- He is.

109
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,360
So I thought he was doing something
for his concert.

110
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,330
- He asked me to host his wedding.
- I see.

111
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,570
So I said, "I will probably be
working that day."

112
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,500
And it turns out
he was talking about his wedding.

113
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,470
- Yes. It's true.
- So I will...

114
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,410
- find a way to move up the shoot.
- Okay.

115
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,880
- You will change your schedule?
- I should do that for Jong Kook.

116
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,210
I will host the ceremony
in a dignified manner. Don't worry.

117
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,980
- I know.
- Will it be open to the media?

118
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,250
I should go there no matter what.

119
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,780
- Ye Eun, you are...
- Why did you not tell me?

120
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,820
Are you all right?

121
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,190
- When it goes on air...
- Sure. It's a blessing.

122
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,060
- I was really...
- It's unbelievable.

123
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,590
- Like this...
- Hey.

124
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,760
If you were born in the past,

125
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,930
you should've joined
the independence army.

126
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,000
He didn't say anything
until the very end.

127
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,260
- You're good at keeping secrets.
- Because...

128
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,360
You're like an independence fighter.

129
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,670
(He agrees.)

130
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,700
- When Jong Kook moved,
- Right.

131
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,700
a lot of people said...

132
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,300
- it was a hint.
- This is crazy.

133
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,840
We said things like that as a joke.

134
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,140
- We found it strange.
- "Jong Kook is moving."

135
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,050
And Seok Jin kept saying,
"You are getting married."

136
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,250
(Hints from the past year)

137
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,720
(Do you have a girlfriend or not?)

138
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,650
(Why are you asking
about my girlfriend now?)

139
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,660
(See? He doesn't say
he doesn't have one.)

140
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,960
(He's getting married.)

141
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,290
(His face turns red.)

142
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,930
(He's getting married.
You're being strange.)

143
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,130
(Send a video message
to your girlfriend!)

144
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,100
(Just wait a little more.)

145
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,300
(It turns out
Seok Sam's hunch was right.)

146
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,310
(There are a lot of cute things.)

147
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,680
(Hey, you.)

148
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,710
(If you're going to be like this,
just get married.)

149
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,380
(When Jong Kook liked cute things,
Jae Seok knew he'd get married.)

150
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,420
- It did feel that way.
- I showed...

151
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,280
I let it show a lot.

152
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,990
He's sweating on his nose.

153
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,960
- He seems happy though.
- The thing is...

154
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,590
- If I announced it on another day,
- Really?

155
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,930
I thought you guys would have
placards here on Running Man.

156
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,330
- We wouldn't do that.
- That's why.

157
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,460
After you told me to stay quiet,

158
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,730
- on "My Little Old Boy..."
- No, I won't do that.

159
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,570
- No.
- And you reveal your new house.

160
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,770
- Then you shyly say, "She..."
- I won't do that.

161
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,670
- Stop it. No.
- She shows up.

162
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,310
- She
- She

163
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,080
- He will sing like that.
- She...

164
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,780
- No.
- She

165
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,380
It will never happen.

166
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,280
(In the meantime)

167
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,050
She suddenly shows up
with her face covered.

168
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,590
(One person is
being unusually quiet.)

169
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,720
(Shaking)

170
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,690
- Jong Kook.
- What is that?

171
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
(Clapping his hands)

172
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,030
(Giggling)

173
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,760
- Jae Seok.
- I thought it was a prank.

174
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,470
Everything is good,
but the most shocked one is him.

175
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,170
- Look at him.
- Hey, you were...

176
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,370
- Look at him.
- I understand.

177
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,770
- He's the same.
- I...

178
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,210
- Actually, I wasn't...
- He's the same.

179
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,610
I wasn't going to tell him.

180
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,080
- To me, he was...
- Right.

181
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,510
(13 yeas ago, Haha kept his marriage
a secret from Jong Kook.)

182
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,980
(After that, Jong Kook trembled,
feeling so betrayed.)

183
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,020
(He will find out about my marriage
through articles.)

184
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,360
(I will never tell Haha...)

185
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,560
(about my marriage.)

186
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,660
(I'm so sick of this.)

187
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,400
(The threat of revenge continued
until last year.)

188
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,470
You did the same thing.

189
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,670
- He suddenly said he'd get married.
- That's right.

190
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,540
- I felt really betrayed.
- I was really surprised.

191
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,970
- I'll live happily.
- Our restaurant will go well.

192
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,770
- Our restaurant will go well.
- Okay.

193
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,980
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

194
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,080
I'll help you make a living.

195
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,150
That's not the problem.
My fiancée hates you the most.

196
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,680
She does?

197
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,020
- No. I'm just joking.
- Your fiancée?

198
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,820
- No. I'm just joking.
- Your fiancée?

199
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,650
- Do I know her?
- I just...

200
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,460
- No. You don't know her.
- I don't?

201
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,060
- She's not in show business.
- No.

202
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,230
I thought you would marry Chaeyeon.

203
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,560
Are you crazy?

204
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,500
Are you out of your mind?

205
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,970
- I thought...
- Jin Sook...

206
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,970
(His fiancée hates Haha
for a reason.)

207
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,870
Why are you talking
about Jin Sook all of a sudden?

208
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,140
It's over now. Don't talk about it.

209
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,570
- It's the end.
- Stop it.

210
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,610
I should've done it more.

211
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,210
- It's over.
- This is crazy.

212
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,210
Don't talk about it anymore.

213
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,950
Jong Kook, why are you
sweating so much?

214
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,150
- I'm sweating a lot.
- On behalf of Jong Kook,

215
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,050
I'll briefly tell you
about the news.

216
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,160
- This is really...
- We have always asked Jong Kook...

217
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,860
- Yes.
- when he would get married...

218
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,960
- every New Year.
- That's true.

219
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,860
And finally, our Jong Kook...

220
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,730
- is getting married!
- Yes!

221
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,170
- Yes.
- It's true.

222
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,240
- It's shocking.
- Let's begin now.

223
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,340
He's shy.

224
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,170
- This is unbelievable.
- I was supposed to dress up...

225
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,770
- as a woman for the opening.
- Right.

226
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,510
They were being considerate.

227
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,880
That's why you changed the opening.

228
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,510
- Right.
- It is the most surprising news...

229
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,580
- I've heard this year.
- Yes.

230
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,780
- It really is.
- Right.

231
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,150
We will now meet our guests...

232
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,350
- and start the opening.
- We should focus.

233
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,020
If you are hungry,
you can order some bread or drinks.

234
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,860
- Really?
- Once you order them,

235
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,330
- we will get you the food.
- Really?

236
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,230
Jong Kook, you should eat first.

237
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,060
I told you not to do this!

238
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,730
- Let's eat.
- Go ahead.

239
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,970
- Let's eat.
- Let's go.

240
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,870
Haha, stay focused.

241
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,140
Hey, I really can't...

242
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,040
- pull myself together.
- Haha is still in shock.

243
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,670
(He's still feeling dizzy.)

244
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,140
He's shocked.
He can't focus on the shoot today.

245
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,410
You will be excused today.

246
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,050
This is wild.

247
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,710
I'm so happy.

248
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,880
(The aftereffect
is going to last long.)

249
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,780
- I want this one.
- I was deeply shocked.

250
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,720
- Me too.
- But seriously...

251
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,490
No, just one.

252
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,260
- Let's share it.
- I thought he was kidding.

253
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,460
I was in shock. So I...

254
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,390
When he came and started
talking to the camera,

255
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,600
I thought he was filming a video...

256
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,800
- for his 30th anniversary concert.
- I know.

257
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,000
It's real, right?

258
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,370
(Still can't believe it)

259
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,200
I will give you one.

260
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,640
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

261
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,570
Your back is really hunched.

262
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,770
- Stand tall.
- I will stand tall.

263
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,080
(They both talk nonsense.)

264
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,440
That tight-lipped man.

265
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,380
This is wild.

266
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,180
It's beautiful.

267
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,750
- You should eat all of this.
- Right.

268
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,920
(Laughing)

269
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,590
- I will buy.
- Okay.

270
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,650
Everything.

271
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,590
Congratulations
on your engagement, Jong Kook.

272
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,060
Stop it. It just happened.

273
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,730
- It just happened. What?
- What are you having?

274
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,260
- Thank you.
- Do we go up?

275
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,800
- Yes.
- Thank you.

276
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,430
(They all chose bread
in the awkward atmosphere.)

277
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,670
- They must be used to filming.
- I know.

278
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,970
It's a big space.

279
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,910
Is eating bread the mission?

280
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,310
This place is huge.

281
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,080
There are lots
of big cafes these days.

282
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,050
- Mega cafes.
- Big cafes.

283
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,480
- But it's...
- What's this space?

284
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,220
- usually in the outskirts.
- Right.

285
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,650
This place is really nice.

286
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,890
- It's like a bookstore here.
- It's very unique.

287
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,390
This place is clearly perfect
for commercial...

288
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,060
- and drama shoots.
- Commercials.

289
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,930
I think a lot of filming
was done here.

290
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,560
- Yes.
- Lots of celebrities visited.

291
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,930
I saw earlier...

292
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,360
Everyone is just saying...

293
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,700
- empty words. Aren't we?
- We...

294
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,800
- I can't concentrate.
- It's like...

295
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,370
- we are floating.
- We are not floating.

296
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,870
We feel a little empty.

297
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,170
- Right.
- Everyone is thinking about that.

298
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,410
- What do we do?
- Gosh.

299
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,580
It's like someone
already hit a hole-in-one.

300
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,110
Playing golf doesn't
feel fun anymore.

301
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,410
I thought he was joking.

302
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,480
- It feels weird.
- I...

303
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,220
Why is he announcing
his marriage this way?

304
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,550
(Why is he announcing
his marriage this way?)

305
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,590
- Fascinating.
- Feels like I took a heavy blow.

306
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,420
He's here.

307
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,790
My goodness!

308
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,290
(The groom-to-be is here.)

309
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,960
- My gosh!
- What?

310
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,730
- What's wrong?
- What...

311
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,330
Do we have to cross-dress today?

312
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,100
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

313
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,070
If you don't want to cross-dress,
you don't have to do it.

314
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,670
Not today.

315
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,610
What are you talking about?
I need to work harder now.

316
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,910
- Right.
- Yes.

317
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,480
(Jong Sook is
a soon-to-be breadwinner.)

318
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,980
- You are...
- It's Seok Jin.

319
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,980
- You're here.
- You're wearing a wig too?

320
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,380
- Hey.
- You're doing it too?

321
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,750
- I see.
- Seok Soon.

322
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,020
Hey,

323
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,720
- you don't look like Jong Sook.
- Don't I...

324
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,920
look more like He-Man?

325
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,320
- He's He-Man.
- Yes.

326
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,620
American professional wrestler.

327
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,660
Choo Sung Hoon with long hair.

328
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,320
He doesn't look like a woman.

329
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,490
- Where...
- I think he should put a hairpin...

330
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,530
on his hair to look like a woman.

331
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,590
Right. I need the hairpin.

332
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,600
- Is there any other wig?
- I know.

333
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,830
- I...
- He's like long-haired...

334
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,400
- I chose pink on purpose.
- Stop it.

335
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,530
- It's like this.
- Pink hair won't make you a woman.

336
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,700
- I look like a woman, don't I?
- The bangs...

337
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,570
Now that your hair is fuller,

338
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,410
you look like you're in your 30s.

339
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,710
- I appreciate it.
- I mean it.

340
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,240
- You are a good person.
- His hair is so full.

341
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,080
- Hair is important.
- He looks like Ms. Choi.

342
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,650
(He looks like Ms. Choi.)

343
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,780
Don't you agree?

344
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,620
- Doesn't he look like her?
- Ms. Choi.

345
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,750
- Right?
- He looks like he's in his 30s.

346
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,250
- Do I resemble you, Ms. Choi?
- He looks like her.

347
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,660
- He looks like he's in his 30s.
- Seok Jin.

348
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,390
I think you should
watch out for him.

349
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,360
- He's sinking you slowly.
- He's working to bring you down.

350
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,730
- He's working to bring me down.
- He looks like he's in his 30s.

351
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,060
- He looks like he's in his 30s.
- Right.

352
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,430
- I was really shocked.
- Yes.

353
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,540
I can't believe everyone here
found out about it today.

354
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,600
But I understand him.

355
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,110
- I understand him.
- It's understandable.

356
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,140
- If he had told me,
- He's shy.

357
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,440
I would've told everyone.

358
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,210
(I would've told everyone.)

359
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,850
- Articles would've been out.
- When I'm drunk.

360
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,180
I would go live on Instagram
and say, "Everyone, Jong Kook..."

361
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,850
"Never mind."

362
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,120
"What is it?"
Then I would say, "Jong Kook..."

363
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,320
- Here's why.
- We know he would do that.

364
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,320
- I would giggle.
- If I had told you earlier,

365
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,720
you wouldn't have been
able to do well on the show.

366
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,230
- Right.
- And when we meet him on Monday,

367
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,060
- we will have done this.
- Right.

368
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,160
They would've done that.

369
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,600
- They would've done that.
- We would've.

370
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
So I couldn't say anything.

371
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,030
- He can't be trusted.
- No.

372
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,070
Never tell Haha anything.

373
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,240
When someone mentions "girlfriend,"
I will have done this.

374
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,810
(Clearing throat)

375
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,640
- Don't do such a thing.
- Right.

376
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,280
- Right. You would do that.
- Don't do that.

377
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,710
Ye Eun, what do you
think about Jong Kook's marriage?

378
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,010
- It's over.
- It's fascinating.

379
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,210
- How so?
- Why?

380
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,180
His place.

381
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,480
Looking at his place,
I was so convinced...

382
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,190
that he wouldn't have a girlfriend.

383
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,790
That makes sense.

384
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,960
Right.

385
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:03,290
(The shocking plastic bag house
was surely an old bachelor's place.)

386
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,830
Jong Kook,
that's giving off carcinogens!

387
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,060
- You didn't do it?
- Carcinogens?

388
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,070
- He can't have a girlfriend.
- He...

389
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,500
- His apartment, you mean?
- Yes.

390
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,440
- Jong Kook.
- She never came to mine.

391
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,010
- If you had told us earlier,
- She never came to my place.

392
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,970
we would've discussed it
with the crew.

393
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,040
That's how much she loves him.

394
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,510
So your fiancée loves plastic bags.

395
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,510
No.

396
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,110
- She hates them.
- Is that it?

397
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,550
She never comes to my place.

398
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,550
- She never came to your place.
- That was a dealbreaker though.

399
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,290
- When she saw it on TV...
- That would've been bad.

400
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,550
It almost ruined
my chance of getting married.

401
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,020
- It could've been bad.
- My goodness.

402
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,590
- You threw them all away.
- He did.

403
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,660
Now I vacuum the floor...

404
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,130
- every day.
- Right.

405
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,660
- You keep your place neat.
- Nice.

406
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,700
- Right.
- Nice.

407
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,400
- Beautiful.
- Right.

408
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,000
With the good news,

409
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,100
- we have guests joining us today.
- Who are they?

410
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,240
Please let the guests come out.

411
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,370
- Let's go. Come on.
- Okay.

412
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,080
It's Ah Young.

413
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,780
What? Ah Young.

414
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,180
Hello.

415
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,850
(Running Man Ok Soon, Ah Young)

416
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,620
(Driving Mr. Catfish
and Mr. Hairtail crazy...)

417
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,220
(is Kim Ah Young,
the master of flirting.)

418
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,420
(Following her is...)

419
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,460
(actor Jang Dong Yoon.)

420
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,730
(Actor Jang Dong Yoon)

421
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:16,630
(Genius actor who can
pull off any genre)

422
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,400
(The guy, straight out of a comic,
even won a boxing contest.)

423
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,110
(His hot new show
is about to premiere.)

424
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,110
(A crime thriller
about a serial killer mother...)

425
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,110
(and her detective son
working together)

426
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,410
(Jang Dong Yoon returns
with SBS drama "Queen Mantis.")

427
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,580
Dong Yoon and Ah Young are here.

428
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,290
(It's Dong Yoon's second visit,
and Ah Young is family.)

429
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,550
He's handsome.

430
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,090
- He looks like an idol.
- He's really good-looking.

431
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,520
He looks like an idol.

432
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,990
How can he be so handsome?

433
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,630
He's really...

434
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,400
(Staring)

435
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
He looks so young.

436
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,700
He's got a baby face.

437
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,630
Say hi to Dong Yoon.

438
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,770
(Hunched back)

439
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,770
She's acting weird
because of Dong Yoon.

440
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,010
She's twisting her body.

441
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,540
Why are you wiggling your body?

442
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,910
She's a giant wiggly worm.

443
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,680
- She's acting strange, isn't she?
- What's wrong with her?

444
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,110
(The giant wiggle-worm
shows strange symptoms)

445
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,680
- Ye Eun should...
- I will stand there.

446
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,650
(She moved next to Dong Yoon.)

447
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,280
(Laughing)

448
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,320
- What's wrong with her?
- Ye Eun...

449
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,820
Are you older than her?

450
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,090
I was born in 1992.

451
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,190
He's older.

452
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,860
(He's 2 years older than Ye Eun.)

453
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,130
He's two years older.

454
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,130
Really?

455
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,290
He looks so young.

456
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,500
- Ye Eun.
- Hey.

457
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,860
- Look at you.
- Gosh.

458
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,830
(She faltered a little late.)

459
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,830
He's Ye Eun's type.

460
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,840
- Is he?
- Yes. He looks like a nice guy.

461
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,070
Ah Young said...

462
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,940
- Ah Young said...
- She's a giant worm.

463
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,610
he's Ye Eun's type.

464
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,010
- Is he?
- He's clearly her type.

465
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,350
- He looks like a good guy.
- He's got pale skin.

466
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,920
- He looks like a good boy.
- Like a good boy.

467
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,750
Look. She's blushing.

468
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,950
(Ddochi's real type is here.)

469
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,950
Dong Yoon looks like
a guy from church.

470
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,120
- Yes.
- Yes.

471
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,860
- A church guy is your type?
- Do you go to church?

472
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,730
(He asks a question first,
and she answers.)

473
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,030
I'm a big church guy.

474
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,100
Me too.

475
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,470
(Me too.)

476
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,300
- "Me too."
- Religion united them.

477
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,670
They're both Christians too?

478
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,000
- Amazing.
- Nice.

479
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,200
I went to church yesterday.

480
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,640
(I went to church yesterday.)

481
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,340
She said,
"I went to church yesterday."

482
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,540
She's amazing.

483
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,440
Dong Yoon and Ah Young are here.

484
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,880
Dong Yoon is starring
in the drama "Queen Mantis."

485
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,180
- Goodness.
- That's...

486
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,280
- "Queen Mantis?"
- "Queen Mantis?"

487
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,450
- "Queen Mantis."
- "Queen Mantis."

488
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,120
- Is Ko Hyun Jung in it too?
- She is.

489
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,550
I've seen the commercial.

490
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,620
It was super interesting.

491
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,560
- What is it about?
- Well...

492
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,800
Hyun Jung plays the role
of a serial killer.

493
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,500
She's the demon.

494
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,900
Demon. Does it mean four demons?

495
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,930
- Four demons?
- No.

496
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,130
The actual...

497
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,200
- Praying mantis?
- Praying mantis?

498
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,540
- Praying Mantis Fist.
- Praying Mantis Fist?

499
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,710
- Praying mantis...
- Is it in the show?

500
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,240
When it gets bitten
by a grasshopper,

501
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,540
- it attacks.
- Right.

502
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,910
It paralyzes.

503
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,110
With Praying Mantis Fist.

504
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,150
- Amazing.
- Are you on the show too, Ah Young?

505
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,980
I'm not.

506
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,220
I just...

507
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
- came here.
- You just came here.

508
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,520
You came to help.

509
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,720
Help who?

510
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,260
You came to help.

511
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,660
Help who?

512
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,990
I'm going to be weird today.

513
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,530
(I'm going to be weird today.)

514
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,300
Hey!

515
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,570
- Come on.
- He's strange.

516
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,270
Why would you say such a thing?

517
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,570
She said, "Help who?"

518
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,940
Just be you.

519
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,100
I keep tearing up.

520
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,870
- What's up with you?
- Really?

521
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,170
- What's up with you?
- I'm not myself today.

522
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,410
Why would you...

523
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,580
You don't know, do you?

524
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,450
- I just heard upstairs.
- You heard?

525
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,550
- Did you hear the news?
- So I...

526
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,650
No, I didn't hear anything.

527
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,320
I wondered who was getting married.

528
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,880
Is it Yang Se Chan?

529
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,050
- Is it Choi Daniel?
- Here she goes again.

530
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,290
(Is Yang Se Chan
or Choi Daniel getting married?)

531
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,120
- You're scaring me.
- Here she goes again.

532
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,990
You scare me.

533
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,460
- Here she goes again.
- And it's only the start.

534
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,630
- Here's why.
- Yes?

535
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,330
I think it's about time
we put an end to the flings.

536
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,700
- What are you going to do?
- Right.

537
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,900
- That's why.
- Right.

538
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,430
Are we going to
continue the fling or not?

539
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,670
It's stimulating them once again.

540
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,810
- They've been lying low.
- I'm getting stimulated again.

541
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,710
- They're getting stimulated again.
- She's stirring them up.

542
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,710
Ah Young is going to
stir them up once again.

543
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,840
- I know.
- She is.

544
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,080
(Ah Young changes it
into a dating show again.)

545
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,180
- Goodness.
- Dong Yoon is going,

546
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,650
"What are they talking about?"

547
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
I think Jong Kook
is getting married.

548
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,220
Really?

549
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,050
- He is.
- Really?

550
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,090
(He finally figures out
what is going on.)

551
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,620
I am really getting married.

552
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,860
What is the concept of your outfits?

553
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,530
I'm going to seduce you today.

554
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,430
(I'm going to seduce you today.)

555
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,300
- They're dressed as women.
- I got my eyes on you.

556
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,440
I got my eyes on you.

557
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,800
- They got their eyes on him.
- Yes.

558
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,670
- They're dressed as women.
- When did you hear it?

559
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,570
I thought they were being punished.

560
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,510
They are dressed as women!

561
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,680
Today...

562
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,010
Ah Young thought...

563
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,450
these two were being punished.

564
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,450
- No.
- I thought you were being punished.

565
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,180
- You don't look like a woman.
- Ah Young.

566
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,020
It's going to be tough for you two.

567
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,720
Jong Sook and Seok Soon
are here today.

568
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,760
Ye Eun, you are...

569
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,890
You won't be successful today.

570
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,800
A couple needs something in common.

571
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Dong Yoon and Ah Young
will join the couples race.

572
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,870
It's called,
Spend More, Get Lucky. Jackpot Date.

573
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,340
Regardless of who your date is,

574
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,640
the three with the largest sum
at the end will win a prize.

575
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
- Really?
- Yes.

576
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,080
Out of the remaining members,

577
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,180
three random people...

578
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,080
will receive a penalty.

579
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,850
Have you heard of...

580
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,590
the Sangsaeng Consumption Lottery
that was recently introduced?

581
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,750
- The Sangsaeng Consumption Lottery.
- I know what it is.

582
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,790
If you spend
over a certain amount...

583
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,560
to help the local economy,

584
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,990
you receive a lottery ticket
in return.

585
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,260
- Really?
- Just like that,

586
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,300
every time you spend
over a certain amount today,

587
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,230
you'll receive a lottery ticket too.

588
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,430
- That sounds nice.
- I see.

589
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,900
It's meant to encourage people
to spend money.

590
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,370
The more you spend,

591
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,270
the greater your chance
to turn your life around.

592
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,910
- The more we spend?
- Yes.

593
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,010
- Nice.
- We must spend money today.

594
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,510
We should be spending our money.

595
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,980
By playing games,

596
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,010
you can win
additional Running Money,

597
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,520
and how well you do...

598
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,050
will decide the order
of spending money on a date.

599
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,520
- On a date?
- You won't be able...

600
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,790
to pay for your date
just because you want to.

601
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,560
Those who pay first
will get to pay more,

602
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,060
- while those who pay last...
- That will matter today.

603
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,290
might not be able to pay at all.

604
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,930
It's bad to finish last.

605
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,200
First, let's decide
who the couples will be...

606
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,970
- for today's race.
- Okay!

607
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,100
Jong Kook and Seok Jin,
the egen boys of Running Man...

608
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,800
- will join the race...
- Egen boys?

609
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,510
as female members today.

610
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,980
- Please set the stage.
- Egen boys?

611
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,010
I didn't expect this today.

612
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,810
- Okay.
- Okay.

613
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,550
- All right.
- This must be a dance initiation.

614
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,550
- Is that so?
- We haven't done this in a while.

615
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,850
- No way. Is it what I think it is?
- Really?

616
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,720
Let's do this.

617
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,620
As you can see
from what's behind you,

618
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,830
we're at a cafe in Pyeongtaek...

619
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,860
that captures the style of New York.

620
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,800
- It's like Times Square.
- What a unique place.

621
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,170
New York? Times Square!

622
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,430
This place is amazing.

623
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,670
It's pretty too.

624
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,900
It's so pretty here.

625
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,010
- I see.
- We'll carry that vibe...

626
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,040
and choose the couples...

627
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,780
in an American after-party style.

628
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,280
- An after-party?
- No way.

629
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,150
- What do I do?
- I haven't been to one before.

630
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,650
- Can we start chatting?
- What do you do at these parties?

631
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,280
Embody the Hollywood style.

632
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,750
- Oh, no.
- I haven't been to one before.

633
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,960
- Same here.
- Who has?

634
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,160
What do you do at after-parties?

635
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,460
- What are they like?
- They're simple.

636
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,630
- Do we mingle?
- You just gather to eat and drink.

637
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,690
- You gather to eat.
- Right.

638
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,660
If you like
the English song playing,

639
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,270
go up on stage and dance.

640
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,270
As a couple?

641
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,400
- Anyone can go up there.
- I'm a terrible dancer.

642
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,440
The last remaining man and woman...

643
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,810
will be paired as a couple.

644
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,640
- So...
- We have to push others off.

645
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,810
If you want to partner up
with someone,

646
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,980
keep holding onto them.

647
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,310
- As in hug?
- Okay!

648
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,950
- Do they do that in the US?
- As in hug?

649
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,550
- How can we hug each other?
- Hug each other?

650
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,620
- How can we hug each other?
- Hold on a second.

651
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,220
What are you worried about?

652
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,890
Why would you even worry about that?

653
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,660
(He-Man will end up pushing
his opponents off the stage anyway.)

654
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,230
What do I do?
Who will you partner with?

655
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,930
I don't know. This is embarrassing.

656
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,870
Can I ask for your support?

657
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,570
- Sure.
- I want to partner with Ye Eun.

658
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,870
- Ye Eun?
- Got it.

659
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,270
- You'll go with Ah Young.
- Ah Young?

660
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,010
- Don't get in my way.
- We'll let you be with Ye Eun.

661
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,980
- Let me be with Ye Eun today.
- Okay.

662
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,880
What was that?

663
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,680
Did you ask them
to let you be with Ye Eun?

664
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,850
- Who said that? Ah Young?
- Yes, Ah Young.

665
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,520
- He's totally my type.
- Seriously?

666
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,620
- What was that, Ah Young?
- I love it.

667
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,290
Ah Young must want
to partner with me.

668
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,690
- Seriously?
- Ah Young, support me today.

669
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,390
Who are you choosing? Got it.

670
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,690
- Dong Yoon.
- Dong Yoon?

671
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,360
- Dong Yoon.
- Yes?

672
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,430
Why are there so many girls today?

673
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,370
Dong Yoon's catching my eye.

674
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,740
- Was that Ah Young?
- Yes, Ah Young.

675
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,340
He's totally my type.

676
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,770
- Did you hear Ah Young?
- I can't believe Ah Young.

677
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,870
- He's handsome.
- He makes me uncomfortable.

678
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,210
When the song ends,

679
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,010
the two left on stage
will become partners.

680
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,510
Once you've been chosen as a couple,
head to the side...

681
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,880
and enjoy the snacks.

682
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,020
- Only then can you eat.
- Got it. Only couples...

683
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,590
There's plenty of bread
and buns to eat.

684
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,220
- Everything looks so good.
- No way.

685
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,620
They're displayed nicely too.

686
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,290
- No way.
- Let's share.

687
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,290
(The staff also prepared
fruit cups.)

688
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,260
Let's find out
who the first couple will be.

689
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,500
- Play the song.
- I should get into it.

690
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,530
Ji Hyo?

691
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,230
(This song is a bit old
for an after-party.)

692
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,570
Isn't this "SexyBack?"

693
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,870
(The participants respond
to the music.)

694
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,640
I'll face the storm first.

695
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,870
- What?
- Here comes Jong Kook.

696
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,980
(Creaking)

697
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,350
(Jong Sook enters the ring,)

698
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,550
(and so does Giant Ji.)

699
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,480
(Se Chan joins
because he's going after Ye Eun.)

700
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,590
I'll face the storm first.

701
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,890
(At the same time)

702
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,990
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

703
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,830
(Blowflies gather around Dong Yoon.)

704
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,230
Maybe next time.

705
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,860
- Is this how it should be done?
- Maybe next time.

706
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,530
(Shoving)

707
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,700
(With one shove,
he takes care of the small fry.)

708
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,440
- Hold on.
- Wait.

709
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,440
(Dong Yoon's been shackled.)

710
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,870
Is this how it should be done?

711
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,310
- Wait.
- What is this?

712
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,810
(No matter how hard Ye Eun tries
to reach for Dong Yoon)

713
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,110
You're so annoying!

714
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,710
Don't.

715
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,350
Guys, this is only the first round!

716
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,680
(Se Chan picks fun over the girl
he's been flirting with.)

717
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,590
- Hold on. I can't dance.
- What's going on?

718
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,120
Shouldn't I be dancing?

719
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,430
(The others cling to him
without giving up.)

720
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,660
- Seriously?
- Wait.

721
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,560
What do you think you're doing?

722
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,760
(He picks Dong Yoon up in his arms.)

723
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,530
- Five.
- Are you kidding me?

724
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,600
- Stop it.
- Four.

725
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,700
Hey!

726
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,840
(The oldest lady in the room
puts up one last fight.)

727
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,340
- That was incredible.
- Three!

728
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,070
(This means that Seok Soon will end up
with Jae Seok or Daniel.)

729
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,580
(Dashing away)

730
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,080
- Two.
- You're so annoying.

731
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,110
(Only 2 seconds left!)

732
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,310
- Two.
- What's going on?

733
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,880
- One.
- Hold on.

734
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,750
- Wait.
- Hold on.

735
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,250
My pants.

736
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,290
Please put me down.

737
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,620
We don't know just yet.

738
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,430
- Why...
- The first couple...

739
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,660
- has been chosen...
- Seriously?

740
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,060
- as Dong Yoon and Jong Sook.
- That was intense.

741
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,860
- What was that?
- Okay!

742
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,900
He was...

743
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,100
I have to ask.

744
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,600
Does what he wants
not matter in this case?

745
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,570
Ye Eun, did you actually
put in the effort?

746
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,440
I did. Look at my arms.

747
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,440
Look who's behind her.

748
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,010
Ye Eun, look behind you.

749
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,950
(Her brothers can't take
her being happy.)

750
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,410
Come on!

751
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,650
- Okay.
- Nice.

752
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,080
- Dong Yoon...
- Are you kidding me?

753
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,180
- Thank you.
- My Dong Yoon.

754
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,290
Aren't you getting married soon?

755
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,420
What?

756
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,090
- Aren't you getting married soon?
- Quiet!

757
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,790
"Aren't you getting married soon?"

758
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,290
I'm going to enjoy
my last moments of freedom today.

759
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,560
- Dong Yoon, you kept teasing us.
- I know.

760
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,860
- Wear those and take your seats.
- Okay.

761
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,400
I've lost my interest in the game.

762
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
(She's lost interest.)

763
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,500
- Let me tie this for you.
- Someone still wants you.

764
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,740
- Look at how he's...
- What do you mean?

765
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,600
Don't you usually tie this
around your wrist?

766
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,170
- Really?
- Aren't armbands for gym owners?

767
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,110
- He's sweet.
- Wrap it around your head.

768
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,680
- He's so cute.
- How considerate of him.

769
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,380
- You look great together.
- Let's go!

770
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,550
But...

771
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,620
I'm going to dance this time around.

772
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,020
- Please take your seats...
- This is pretty.

773
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,590
and enjoy the beverages.

774
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,890
The sooner you sit, the better.

775
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,150
Do we get to sit first?

776
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,490
- We should sit as soon as possible.
- Right.

777
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,860
We should team up fast and sit.

778
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,490
- My Dong Yoon.
- Now...

779
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,660
Thank you.

780
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,200
- Sit wherever you want.
- Sure.

781
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,630
Let's have some iced Americano.

782
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,030
(Finally, they get
to enjoy some time alone.)

783
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,740
Do you watch your weight
or anything?

784
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,440
- I don't.
- Okay, good. Let's sit.

785
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,510
(While Jong Sook and Dong Yoon
get to know each other)

786
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,150
You can get married
if you become my partner.

787
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,510
What does she mean by that?

788
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,720
- Not many of us are single.
- What was that?

789
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,120
- Why would she say that?
- Not many of us are single.

790
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,650
- If you become my partner...
- I'm just saying.

791
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,720
- Can we share your pension?
- Do you get a pension?

792
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,360
- You can share my pension.
- Subways are free.

793
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,560
Is the subway free for you?

794
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,660
You can ride the subway for free
if you partner with me.

795
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,800
(They're offering odd promises.)

796
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,500
We'll see how you do from here.

797
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,930
- Okay, let's go.
- Get ready.

798
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,300
- Gosh, this song.
- No way.

799
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,500
- Hey!
- This was played on "X-Man."

800
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,640
(Bouncing his head)

801
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,210
We're on.

802
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,450
(While a wild dance party
takes place)

803
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,550
Which gym do you go to?

804
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,320
The one in my neighborhood.

805
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,580
(Jong Sook engages
in a conversation.)

806
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,750
- I saw it.
- Saw what?

807
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,750
- On your YouTube channel.
- Right.

808
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,390
- You do sparring sessions.
- Of course.

809
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,090
The gym I go to is next
to COEX Mall.

810
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,390
(Thankfully, their interests match.)

811
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,860
When there's a chance, can I...

812
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,570
You can come by anytime.
I'd love that.

813
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,770
I'm recovering
from a shoulder injury, you see.

814
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,240
(While the couple agree
to work out together)

815
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Only I need to be on the stage.

816
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,570
(It's like a battlefield
on the stage.)

817
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,810
Hold on. This feels like a club
for middle-aged men and women.

818
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:44,650
(A nightclub in Pyeongtaek
known for its unappealing crowd)

819
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,250
This isn't how after-parties are.

820
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,690
- Come on.
- I can't believe it.

821
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,690
Haha and Ji Hyo,
you were chosen as a couple.

822
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,960
Play the song.

823
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,590
(For once, a new song is playing.)

824
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,930
- What's this?
- It's "Soda Pop."

825
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,860
Ah Young, are you going for it?

826
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,500
(Got it!)

827
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,540
(Ah Young has a firm grip
on the Dongducheon hottie.)

828
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,310
No!

829
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,310
(Seok Soon joins the party.)

830
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,980
What are you doing, old man?

831
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,110
What's your problem?

832
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,320
(A fierce battle of the booties)

833
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,350
In the end...

834
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:26,220
(Who are the 3rd most popular
man and woman?)

835
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,760
Ten, nine,

836
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,100
- eight, seven,
- No!

837
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,030
- Go away.
- six...

838
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,100
You're after Se Chan.

839
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,630
Got it, Ah Young.

840
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,770
She wants Se Chan.

841
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,040
(Holding tight)

842
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,810
- Hold on.
- She wants Se Chan.

843
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,010
Go away!

844
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,070
- Hold on.
- Two.

845
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,240
- Wait.
- One.

846
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,910
- Wait.
- What?

847
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,980
(Time's up.)

848
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,250
(An unexpected couple is born.)

849
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,320
What...

850
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,820
- You.
- When did you get on the stage?

851
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,160
- You...
- Ah Young was right here.

852
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,620
It's all right.

853
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,890
- How did they get together?
- Are we a couple?

854
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,830
What on earth?

855
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,060
- There was a switch.
- Just so you know,

856
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,260
you were my second choice.

857
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,300
Who was your first choice?

858
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,300
Dong Yoon.

859
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,040
Look at Ye Eun.

860
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,870
Ye Eun, who are you
going to partner with?

861
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,270
All right. We're the only four left.

862
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,510
- Sure.
- Will it be Ye Eun and Jae Seok?

863
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,540
(Music, cue)

864
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,010
(Ah Young gives him the gaze again.)

865
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,750
- Why is she looking at me?
- Se Chan.

866
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,450
(Get on the stage.)

867
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,220
Yang Se Chan!

868
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,490
(She's a bit corny.)

869
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,960
- What's her deal?
- Go, Ah Young.

870
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,720
- Se Chan, go for it.
- Ah Young...

871
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,130
Ah Young looks like someone
who's been out partying before.

872
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,260
Eight, seven,

873
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,030
- six, five,
- They're wrestling on stage.

874
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,100
- four,
- Oh, no.

875
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,540
- three,
- Hurry.

876
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,540
- two...
- What now?

877
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,840
(Time's up.)

878
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,340
What on earth?

879
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,910
Jae Seok and Ye Eun are a couple.

880
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,250
- Okay!
- The final couple...

881
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,310
- is Ah Young and Se Chan.
- Ah Young...

882
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,620
- must like Se Chan.
- You're a couple.

883
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,680
(Hunchback slowly gets up.)

884
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,550
Hey, Ye Eun's a bit too ugly.

885
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,920
Your charm index plummeted.

886
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,460
Was she hurt?

887
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,500
Wait.
Why are you worrying about her?

888
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,700
- He asked if she was hurt.
- He's worried about me.

889
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,200
- She fell too hard.
- Hey.

890
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,870
- I'm okay.
- Stay away!

891
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,770
- I'm fine.
- "Stay away."

892
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,040
What got into you?
I told you to stay away.

893
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,880
You found your partner for the day.

894
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,880
Those who actively participated
and found their partner sooner...

895
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,780
will get more seed money,
in order of getting partnered up.

896
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,350
(They get more seed money.)

897
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,720
- Oh, gosh.
- Okay!

898
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,920
Okay! Yes.

899
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,260
- You also get payment priority.
- It's good we got partnered up.

900
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,700
You can pay first too.

901
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,700
I had no idea.

902
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,530
The first-place couple...

903
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,340
- gets 100 dollars.
- Gosh.

904
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,770
The 3 couples in 2nd to 4th place...

905
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,640
- each get seventy dollars.
- Seventy dollars.

906
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,980
The last-place couple
gets 50 dollars.

907
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,010
- Not bad.
- That's not bad.

908
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,620
You can divide the money
with your partner as you wish.

909
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,020
- Can we?
- In the end,

910
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,720
it comes down to how much you have.

911
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,490
Discuss with your partner
how much each of you should keep.

912
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,960
- We each get 35 dollars?
- Yes, 35 dollars.

913
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,930
- We got seventy dollars.
- Seventy dollars?

914
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,760
- It's an individual race?
- Then...

915
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,130
- Then half each.
- I'll split the money.

916
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,200
- Is it 25 dollars each?
- Here.

917
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,100
- Ten dollars?
- We might switch couples.

918
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,140
Hey.

919
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,210
- And five more dollars.
- Eat up.

920
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,270
(Seed Money Status)

921
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,770
No stealing.

922
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,280
We told you this was a couple race,

923
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,210
and today,
you're on a continuous date.

924
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,250
It's time for you
to pay the date expenses...

925
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,450
and get a lottery ticket.

926
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,090
The expenses
for the first date at the cafe.

927
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,420
You bought bread and pastries,

928
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,030
you ate the fruit cups we prepared
and ordered drinks too.

929
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,030
The total is 300 dollars.

930
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,800
- What?
- The total is 300 dollars.

931
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,430
(They must pay...)

932
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,430
(for everything they ate!)

933
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,170
- We have to pay?
- But...

934
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,140
- You said we could eat.
- Seok Jin bought a lot of bread.

935
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,170
- Cream cheese hotteok?
- This is tasty.

936
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,310
This looks nice.

937
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,540
- There's cream cheese inside.
- Can you eat it all, Seok Jin?

938
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,350
(They chose everything they wanted
without second thought.)

939
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,620
(Included in the first cafe date...)

940
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,390
(was a dinner show.)

941
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,690
(The expenses
came up to 300 dollars!)

942
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,890
- What?
- You'll make us pay?

943
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,630
We must spend to win tickets.

944
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,430
- But...
- Here's another detail.

945
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,960
I said you'd get lottery tickets.

946
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,070
Each time you spend 30 dollars,

947
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,770
- you get one ticket.
- We must spend.

948
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,100
We must spend to win.

949
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,210
- That's how it's structured.
- Yes.

950
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,610
Can we cover the 300 dollars?

951
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:40,240
We can't spend 30 dollars
when we only have 35 each.

952
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,410
You can pass
if you don't want to pay,

953
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,520
and the last person to pay
must cover...

954
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,880
- the remaining balance.
- The front-runners must pay.

955
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,620
If you don't have enough money,
you go bankrupt,

956
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,020
and as a penalty, each time,
something is drawn on your face.

957
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,020
Okay.

958
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,760
The last people to pay
will go bankrupt.

959
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,960
(Not enough money
means bankruptcy and face paint.)

960
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,200
Will you please pay up?
We'll go bankrupt anyway.

961
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,600
To get a lottery ticket...

962
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,270
Yes, you must pay
to get a lottery ticket.

963
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,100
But why...

964
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,700
Why are you over here, Ye Eun?

965
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,210
- There's no seat.
- Why is she over here...

966
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,710
when she's not partnered
with either of us? What's up?

967
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,250
You're with Mr. Bucktooth.

968
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,620
- Ye Eun!
- Why are you over here?

969
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,480
I'll pay you to go away.

970
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,620
My gosh.

971
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,690
- We're a couple.
- The first couple...

972
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,160
- will head that way to pay.
- Sounds good.

973
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,130
One of you will go first,
and then the other.

974
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,530
Oh, we go separately?
Then Dong Yoon...

975
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,230
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

976
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,000
Oh, over there? Okay.

977
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
(He can pay as much as he wants
of the 300 dollars.)

978
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,110
The total is 300 dollars.
How much would you like to pay?

979
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,540
You get a lottery ticket
for every 30 dollars you spend.

980
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,910
The more you want...

981
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,140
I only have 50 dollars, so how...

982
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,980
I'll pay 30 dollars.

983
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,410
Thank you.

984
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,320
Write your name
next to the number of your choice.

985
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,150
This lottery is called Lucky Number.

986
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,460
Those who get a lottery ticket
can pick a number...

987
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,390
- between 1 and 9.
- I pick 9.

988
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,000
A member of the crew
will draw a ball at random.

989
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,870
The person to guess the number
wins first place.

990
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,030
Oh, really?

991
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,700
The people who guessed
the number before and after it...

992
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,540
will win second place.

993
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,970
The probability isn't too bad.

994
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,410
The person who wins 1st place
will get 150 dollars.

995
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,510
- What, 150 dollars?
- Yes.

996
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,310
The 2nd-place prize is 50 dollars.

997
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,880
- Fifty dollars? Okay.
- Fifty dollars.

998
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,520
If there are multiple winners,

999
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,320
you must split the prize money,

1000
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,420
- so ideally, you want to keep it.
- Okay.

1001
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,790
- You're done.
- Okay. Thank you.

1002
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,430
(Remaining balance: 270 dollars)

1003
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,330
The current total is 270 dollars.

1004
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,330
(Remaining balance: 270 dollars)

1005
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,300
I must invest early on.

1006
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,970
I must invest while I can afford to.

1007
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,170
- How much will you pay?
- Thirty dollars.

1008
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,770
- Okay.
- Here's the lottery ticket.

1009
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,310
(Remaining balance: 240 dollars)

1010
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,310
Number four.
Fight to die, and you win.

1011
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,680
(While Jong Sook
is getting her lottery ticket...)

1012
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,280
(Haha is teasing Ye Eun.)

1013
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,720
You don't stand a chance.
He's way too good for you.

1014
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,790
- I saw it.
- You know it's a joke, right?

1015
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,520
- Yes, well...
- You're not kidding.

1016
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,990
You're just throwing a net
hoping to get a straggling fish.

1017
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,030
That's not the case.

1018
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,060
Isn't that wrong?

1019
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,400
It is wrong.

1020
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,600
- Hoping to get...
- No.

1021
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,500
- You love him?
- You should be sincere.

1022
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,510
- My gosh.
- Ye Eun's face is so red.

1023
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,810
- What's wrong with her?
- Her face is red.

1024
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,250
- It's so obvious.
- What are you really thinking?

1025
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,650
- Come on.
- What's up with her?

1026
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,920
What are you doing?

1027
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,990
Your girlfriend's cheating on you.

1028
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,120
She's not my girlfriend.
We're just partners.

1029
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,290
Dong Yoon,
what kind of woman do you like?

1030
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,190
I go to church,
which is why I think she said that.

1031
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,330
You go to church?

1032
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,030
(Butting in)

1033
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,770
You go to church?

1034
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,400
(Laughing heartily)

1035
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,340
- What are you doing?
- You were over here.

1036
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,140
- When...
- When did she go over there?

1037
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,410
Is she a ghost?

1038
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,440
(And...)

1039
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,610
(Ye Eun lost out
before she knew it.)

1040
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,250
I'd love to... Where's your church?

1041
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,980
What are you doing?

1042
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,150
(Jumping up)

1043
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,020
- I'm curious.
- Is she a ghost?

1044
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,520
- You want something, Ye Eun?
- The love interest...

1045
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,720
He's mine.

1046
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,890
- Yours is over there!
- Okay.

1047
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,590
- Yours is over there.
- Okay.

1048
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,390
Do you like the rural lifestyle?

1049
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,500
- Totally.
- I love the rural life.

1050
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,300
I love the rural life.

1051
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,170
(The flirt master
infiltrates again.)

1052
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,270
She's sitting across from him.

1053
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,710
- I love the countryside.
- Oh, you do?

1054
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,710
(Me too.)

1055
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,210
He likes the rural lifestyle.

1056
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,240
- Yes.
- I'm interested in that.

1057
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,710
I like the rural lifestyle.

1058
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,180
Sounds good.

1059
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,280
- I'm so envious.
- We could farm together.

1060
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:42,620
Farming together...

1061
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,550
Sow seeds and perilla leaves...

1062
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,860
My skin's crawling.
The pension lady. The Pensioner.

1063
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,290
Watch out, Dong Yoon.
I came here to rescue you.

1064
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,260
- These two are vixens.
- No, we're...

1065
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,330
- No.
- Okay?

1066
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,330
I know them. They're vixens.

1067
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,500
I'm not a vixen. She totally is.

1068
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,100
- No.
- Keep quiet, Ye Eun.

1069
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,910
(Jong Sook is back.)

1070
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,410
- Dong Yoon.
- Why is she so scary?

1071
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,440
Jong Sook.
He strayed while you were away.

1072
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,510
- He strayed.
- No, I...

1073
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,680
(Seok Soon tattles.)

1074
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,880
I didn't stray.

1075
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,250
"I didn't stray."

1076
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,420
- He's stuttering.
- "I didn't stray."

1077
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,690
(Chewing)

1078
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,990
It looks like...

1079
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,700
(She returns to her boyfriend
who looks like he's chewing cud.)

1080
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,500
- You look like...
- Did you have fun?

1081
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,800
How was it?

1082
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
I'm busy. I just finished a shift.

1083
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,440
I got back from work.

1084
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,800
Sorry for staying to eat.

1085
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,610
- That's funny.
- You two are like real...

1086
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,010
It's all for fun.
For entertainment's sake.

1087
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,350
- It's not. You're serious.
- Do you like to exercise?

1088
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,710
- I don't.
- She's really...

1089
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,880
- Do you like exercise? I love it.
- Yes.

1090
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,020
I need you to like exercise.

1091
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,420
Dong Yoon really loves to work out.

1092
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,150
- You don't look it.
- He competed...

1093
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,120
- and won a boxing match.
- That's cool.

1094
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,020
- You're okay with him boxing?
- That's fine.

1095
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,590
- He could get hurt.
- I don't care.

1096
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,290
(She answers without hesitation.)

1097
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,500
You're serious.

1098
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,660
He doesn't look like
he works out much.

1099
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,500
- But his look...
- I love to work out.

1100
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,300
He looks like a sweet boy,
so how is he so athletic?

1101
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,540
He doesn't fear getting hit.

1102
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,710
You need that to box.

1103
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,310
I heard about that.

1104
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,640
- He saved a criminal.
- Isn't that too much?

1105
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,610
I didn't save a criminal.

1106
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,810
- You caught a criminal.
- Do you want to box?

1107
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,550
Why do you like men who work out
when you don't work out?

1108
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,420
- I love exercising.
- Is your fiancee fit?

1109
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,860
- We're complete opposites.
- You love to exercise...

1110
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,230
I'm fine if they don't stop me
from exercising.

1111
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,790
Did you always go to church?

1112
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,760
- I was born in faith.
- Me too.

1113
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,800
Say you're in the street
and someone tries to attack you.

1114
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,770
- He caught someone.
- You're on a date.

1115
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,210
There are men who run away...

1116
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,040
and men who stay to fight.

1117
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,440
Which would you prefer?

1118
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,510
- In order to get away...
- That happened to me.

1119
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,250
- "Let's run."
- He caught someone.

1120
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,220
- No. It's annoying.
- "Don't do it."

1121
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,990
- Ye Eun. What are you doing?
- What if...

1122
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,990
(She's captivated,
despite the long-distance nagging.)

1123
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,430
but he wants to fight.

1124
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,490
- That's a bit...
- Isn't that not good?

1125
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,600
It's not.

1126
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,430
You're the type to fight.

1127
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,700
- Would you stay and fight?
- No. I'd run away.

1128
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:15,570
- What's your MBTI?
- I'm an ENFP.

1129
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:19,140
Ye Eun's on an actual date here!

1130
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,340
You don't look like an ENFP.

1131
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,780
Ye Eun.

1132
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,280
- Why are you here?
- Why are you over there?

1133
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,780
She asked what his MBTI was.

1134
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,450
He doesn't look like an ENFP.

1135
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,720
Dong Yoon's weird too.
He keeps asking questions!

1136
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,720
- No, I...
- He keeps asking questions!

1137
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
No, I...

1138
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,190
- What's going on?
- The questions...

1139
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,960
- He could be curious.
- He asks me questions.

1140
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,130
- He asks me questions.
- Get out of that seat!

1141
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,700
He's asking me questions.

1142
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,000
She won't budge. This is serious.

1143
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,670
- Okay, fine.
- I can't believe her face went red.

1144
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:51,070
Dong Yoon, do you have
a girlfriend in real life?

1145
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,910
- I don't.
- Even if he did,

1146
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,740
- would he say so?
- He wouldn't tell us.

1147
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,080
Why would you ask him
such a useless question?

1148
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Did Jong Kook mention anything about
getting married until last week?

1149
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,220
- No, he didn't.
- I didn't.

1150
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,650
- Oh, but it's true.
- Stop asking useless questions.

1151
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,780
Do you say so
if you have a girlfriend?

1152
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,590
Well, if I do...

1153
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,650
He still wouldn't.
It's better not to.

1154
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,790
- I wouldn't have said it, then.
- Of course.

1155
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,490
- But you don't have one now?
- I really don't.

1156
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,560
- Not now?
- Oh, really?

1157
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,230
I was getting ready
to introduce Jong Kook...

1158
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,900
to someone
who could become his wife.

1159
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,500
- Come on.
- Really.

1160
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,100
Don't do that.
I don't like that kind of thing.

1161
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,330
I should introduce her
to Si Kyung now.

1162
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,600
(I should introduce her
to Si Kyung now.)

1163
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,840
- Is it us?
- This is so great.

1164
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,640
Haha or Ji Hyo, one of you can go.

1165
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,780
Will you go first?

1166
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,810
(Starting with Haha,
Ji Hyo and Ah Young pass.)

1167
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:31,950
The next couple can go.

1168
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,580
Can we make money again?

1169
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,320
I want to hear the full story,
don't you?

1170
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,120
About Jong Kook.

1171
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,460
When...

1172
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,260
- How they met...
- You didn't know he had one?

1173
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,060
Really?

1174
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,730
Please pick someone now.

1175
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,900
So, everyone has paid now.

1176
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,430
The last person to pay was Se Chan.

1177
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,770
Se Chan,

1178
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,970
- you went bankrupt.
- Oh, dear.

1179
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,140
- You have to pay 90 dollars total.
- What?

1180
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,380
- You have to pay 90 dollars.
- Okay.

1181
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,510
I'll buy a lottery ticket.

1182
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,580
Thirty dollars?

1183
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,110
Okay, here is 30 dollars.

1184
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,310
(Before Se Chan, 7 people paid
30 dollars each, so 210 dollars total.)

1185
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,880
- Ah Young, can I have five dollars?
- What? Here.

1186
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,480
Can I have five dollars?

1187
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,090
If I buy a lottery ticket and win,

1188
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,220
- That's right.
- can we split it in half?

1189
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,760
No, I'd give you more, then.
Don't worry.

1190
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,990
(Se Chan paid 30 dollars
after borrowing 5 dollars.)

1191
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,760
(He received one lottery ticket.)

1192
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,390
You can draw anything. That's right.

1193
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,300
I feel bad.

1194
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,770
- That looks cute.
- My gosh.

1195
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,100
Yes, that's no big deal.

1196
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,570
- Come on.
- This is all right.

1197
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,040
Okay, then. You've all received
the lottery tickets...

1198
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,740
- that you paid for.
- Gosh, please.

1199
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,640
- Did you pick your lucky numbers?
- Yes.

1200
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,680
- Please.
- So, currently,

1201
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,180
Ye Eun chose number two.

1202
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,320
Haha had three.

1203
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,880
Daniel also had three.

1204
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,450
- Four.
- Jong Kook had four,

1205
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,890
and Jae Seok had six.

1206
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,290
- This is going to be...
- Seok Jin and Se Chan had eight.

1207
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,620
- And Dong Yoon had nine.
- Oh, really?

1208
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,890
- Let's go!
- Number nine!

1209
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,960
- I hope I win. Number four.
- All right.

1210
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,300
A number has been chosen.

1211
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,530
- Number 9.
- Number 4.

1212
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,970
- Number 3.
- Please pick number 6.

1213
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:58,030
- Number 4.
- Numbers 2, 3, and 4.

1214
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,340
- Numbers 2, 3, and 4.
- Number 3.

1215
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,500
- Number 4.
- Numbers 2, 3, and 4.

1216
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,240
- Number 8.
- The lucky number is...

1217
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,310
- Number 8.
- Number 8.

1218
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,610
(Which number will be chosen
to win 150 dollars?)

1219
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,980
It's number eight.

1220
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,640
(It's number 8.)

1221
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,580
(8. Seok Jin, Se Chan)

1222
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,810
(Se Chan and Seok Soon win.)

1223
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,950
- I was going to choose eight.
- You're the best!

1224
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,450
(Shouting with joy)

1225
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,550
- I was going to choose eight.
- You're the best!

1226
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,060
At the last minute, I erased it.

1227
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,530
- Gosh, number eight.
- Hey.

1228
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,990
Then, for number eight,

1229
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,930
the 2 of you can split
the 150 dollars.

1230
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,100
- That's insane.
- They're so lucky.

1231
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,770
Dong Yoon, you came in second place,

1232
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,370
so you get 50 dollars.

1233
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,470
The numbers before and after
get second place.

1234
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,010
- I mean...
- You must've had 7 or 9.

1235
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,110
Yes, I had nine.

1236
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,510
Oh, you had nine.

1237
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,810
(Celebrating his win)

1238
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,080
Hey, even with number seven,

1239
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,310
- That must be so thrilling.
- you get 50 dollars.

1240
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,120
- Gosh, this is seriously...
- I mean, this is...

1241
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,920
This is why we shouldn't gamble.

1242
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,820
- Do you want a cut of my winnings?
- A cut?

1243
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,360
- I chose eight but erased it.
- Are you giving me a cut?

1244
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,530
(Smiling bashfully)

1245
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,560
- I chose eight but erased it.
- Are you giving me a cut?

1246
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,760
How much did you get?

1247
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,100
- I got 50 dollars.
- My gosh.

1248
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,330
- Still, we're a team.
- Right.

1249
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,800
(A heartwarming scene unfolds,
which is a rarity on Running Man.)

1250
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:05,730
(Amazed)

1251
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,870
- Here's 15 dollars.
- My gosh!

1252
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,100
Hey! For real.

1253
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,040
Look. My dear Dong Yoon...

1254
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,440
- Why?
- My dear Dong Yoon. Listen up.

1255
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,810
My dear Dong Yoon gave me
15 dollars.

1256
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:15,810
Why?

1257
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,750
- Because he won.
- You didn't give me anything.

1258
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,320
- I gave him a cut.
- What is this?

1259
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,950
(Jong Sook looks happier than
when he announced his marriage.)

1260
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,890
(So annoyed)

1261
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,160
- Do you know how warm I feel?
- My goodness.

1262
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,230
(I'm jealous.)

1263
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,490
What are you doing?

1264
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,500
Why are you sitting here?

1265
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,000
- Why are you sitting here?
- Can I have just five dollars too?

1266
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,100
Really?

1267
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,600
(The generous angel says
he'll even give Ye Eun a cut.)

1268
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,670
- Are you serious?
- No!

1269
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,470
Why are you trying to give money
to another woman?

1270
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,840
You must be crazy!

1271
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,040
- What are you doing?
- No!

1272
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,480
No, you shouldn't do that!

1273
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,780
- Get out of here!
- What are you doing?

1274
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,780
Are you crazy? Get out of there!

1275
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,780
(He gets rid of his rival
with brute force.)

1276
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,080
You! How dare you?

1277
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,080
(Come here.)

1278
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,850
How dare you try to
pull something like this? No.

1279
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,220
(Beckoning to another woman
when his girlfriend isn't watching)

1280
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,490
- You can't give it to her! Why?
- Hey, why are you doing this?

1281
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,020
- Oh, my.
- You shouldn't do this!

1282
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,360
- What do you think you're doing?
- Hang on.

1283
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,760
- These two are so weird.
- Is that five dollars?

1284
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,930
- Aren't these ten-dollar bills?
- Five dollars.

1285
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:06,930
Oh, are they dollar bills?

1286
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,160
- What is this? Why, Dong Yoon?
- Dong Yoon.

1287
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,500
What's going on here?

1288
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,200
- Dong Yoon, I love you.
- They're weird!

1289
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,770
This guy is so weird!

1290
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,600
Take Ye Eun away.

1291
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,870
(Seed Money Status,
Seok Jin: 80 dollars)

1292
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,270
- Okay!
- Let's get going.

1293
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,610
(They move to
the next date location.)

1294
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,580
- The couples are going together.
- Yes.

1295
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,480
(They move in order of
the couple selection.)

1296
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,680
- The weather is nice.
- Yes, it's nice today.

1297
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,050
(Greeting the friendly couple)

1298
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,490
What's going on with our car?

1299
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,760
What's this? Is it this one or that?

1300
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
- Choose a date location...
- Then, the price goes down...

1301
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,190
- and get in the car.
- Gosh, hang on.

1302
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,830
For that one,
the lottery ticket is...

1303
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,330
The lottery ticket price goes up,

1304
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,530
and the winnings go up too.

1305
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,430
That's a gamble.

1306
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,240
- This one is...
- That's right.

1307
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,370
This is a bit...

1308
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,040
- Safer.
- It's safer.

1309
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,540
I tend to...

1310
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,010
go for the safer option.

1311
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,340
- I like being safe too.
- I usually...

1312
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,110
- really hate stuff like gambling.
- Right.

1313
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,850
- I prefer to be steady and stable.
- Oh, really?

1314
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,080
I don't even invest my money.
I just put my money into savings.

1315
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,220
- Then, shall we go with low risk?
- Yes.

1316
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,950
You have to be on the same page
like this.

1317
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,150
- In order to imagine a future.
- A date spot?

1318
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,360
- The date spot...
- Yes.

1319
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:08,220
(They pick a date spot with a cheap
lottery ticket and lower winnings.)

1320
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,790
- Okay! There.
- Thank you.

1321
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,660
- Lady first.
- Gosh, don't say that.

1322
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,860
(Where will he go on a date
with the energetic lady?)

1323
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,330
- Hello.
- Let's go.

1324
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,770
Earlier, when I saw them
splitting the 150 dollars,

1325
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,170
my eyes were honestly spinning.

1326
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,600
I'm going to go with
the higher price, no matter what.

1327
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,610
Isn't that obvious?
Why else do you buy lottery tickets?

1328
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,680
Don't you buy lottery tickets,
dreaming of becoming rich overnight?

1329
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,680
- That's true. Okay.
- Yes.

1330
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,110
- Let's go. Okay.
- Let's go. Okay.

1331
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,580
Of course, we should go with this.

1332
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,620
- As long as we don't go bankrupt.
- Of course.

1333
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,650
- Seok Soon.
- Hello.

1334
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,550
- Oh, my.
- Who is this?

1335
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,590
- What? My goodness.
- Hey, is this where you were?

1336
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,220
- Dong Yoon.
- Hey, Jong Kook.

1337
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,620
- I mean, Jong Sook.
- Dong Yoon, how have you been?

1338
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,460
- Jong Sook.
- Yes, hi.

1339
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,360
- It's been a while.
- Niel.

1340
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,900
- Dong Yoon.
- Yes?

1341
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,960
Is anything bothering you?

1342
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,970
- My girlfriend is just so perfect.
- Of course.

1343
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,000
- I know.
- That's obvious.

1344
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,440
- You met such a nice lady.
- We have...

1345
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,140
- the same interests.
- Really?

1346
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,170
Our conversation
just keeps on going.

1347
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,340
- Your girlfriend...
- Interests? Like what?

1348
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,370
- Boxing.
- Boxing.

1349
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,810
- Oh, you box?
- Do you really do boxing?

1350
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:01,440
- Yes.
- He won a boxing competition.

1351
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,580
- In an amateur competition. Yes.
- For real?

1352
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,710
- Can you do some shadow boxing?
- Sure.

1353
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:06,950
- Show us.
- When we get off.

1354
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,150
- Show them later.
- Can't you do it in here?

1355
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,150
- That's because punches...
- Yes?

1356
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,920
come from the lower body.

1357
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,490
- You can't do it while sitting.
- Right, you have to use your legs.

1358
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:16,030
He's always such a show-off.

1359
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:17,490
- He always does that.
- I know.

1360
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:19,230
- I'm just...
- This guy doesn't seem like me.

1361
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,700
- I know.
- This guy is really good.

1362
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,860
- Is he?
- Also,

1363
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,200
I hear he's much better
than his peers.

1364
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,470
- Really?
- I became really hooked.

1365
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:27,000
- Seriously.
- Why did it suddenly get hot?

1366
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,600
- My gosh. Right.
- It was cooler earlier.

1367
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,640
I hear it's going to be hot
until this week,

1368
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,210
and it'll cool off
starting next week.

1369
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,340
Are you sure?

1370
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,740
- It's fall now.
- Why are you doubting me?

1371
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,180
So, you can choose...

1372
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,450
the date location that you want.

1373
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:40,650
- We get to choose?
- You came here...

1374
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,990
- in order of the couple selection.
- Yes.

1375
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,990
So, that car is already full,

1376
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:46,820
which means you don't have a choice.

1377
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,190
- You have to get in the big van.
- Hang on.

1378
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,830
- Come on.
- But how...

1379
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:52,630
So, you'll go to
different date locations.

1380
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:55,000
You won't be seeing that team
for a while.

1381
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,430
- Wait.
- Then, will it be the four of us?

1382
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,700
Is Dong Yoon in there?

1383
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,470
- Hey, what are you doing?
- This is...

1384
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,300
- What are you doing, Ye Eun?
- I really...

1385
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,340
- This is good.
- Her eyes went...

1386
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,010
- This is so infuriating.
- Is Dong Yoon in there?

1387
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,340
Gosh, out of my way.

1388
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,310
(She charges forward to the car.)

1389
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,110
Hey, if we're going to be couples...

1390
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,510
So, you must have a lot...

1391
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,580
- What is this?
- You can't get in! There's no room!

1392
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,950
- Why are you here?
- There's no room!

1393
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,490
- Get out!
- There's no room!

1394
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:17,620
Go away!

1395
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,660
- Go over there!
- Get out!

1396
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,820
- She must be crazy.
- Go away.

1397
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,420
- Control your girlfriend!
- Come on.

1398
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,230
- I mean...
- She's not my girlfriend!

1399
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:25,560
- Why isn't she your girlfriend?
- Get out!

1400
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,430
Why can't you control your partner?

1401
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:29,330
- Our car is full.
- Come here.

1402
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,670
- We're full.
- My goodness.

1403
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,030
- Gosh, seriously.
- This car is full.

1404
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,040
(She gets dragged off
to the other car in the end.)

1405
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,100
- Ye Eun.
- What's wrong with her?

1406
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,570
- My gosh.
- She's hilarious.

1407
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:36,870
She's so spunky.

1408
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:39,740
- Then, is Haha's couple in here?
- Gosh, seriously.

1409
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,380
- I'm having such a hard time.
- Can we all fit in here?

1410
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,350
Hey, scoot in.

1411
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,310
Anyway,

1412
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,280
- I told you my goal earlier.
- Yes.

1413
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,980
Seriously, today,

1414
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,190
my goal is to get in the top three.

1415
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:53,220
- Those of you in the front row.
- Gosh, seriously.

1416
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,060
You're broke, aren't you?

1417
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,690
- They're broke.
- We're not broke. We have money.

1418
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,430
- How much did you spend?
- Can I say this?

1419
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,730
- What?
- Dong Yoon gave me money.

1420
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,060
He gave you two dollars.

1421
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,200
- Really?
- He gave me five dollars.

1422
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,470
- Five dollars?
- Dong Yoon is not your average guy.

1423
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,400
Dong Yoon is... That guy is...

1424
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,110
- He's no joke.
- He treats people...

1425
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,740
- He bewitches people.
- Right.

1426
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,110
(Sighing)

1427
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,780
- Gosh, this is so annoying.
- How long do we have to be apart?

1428
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,040
How long will we be apart?

1429
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,910
You'll be at totally different locations
for this date.

1430
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,250
- Totally different?
- Yes.

1431
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,850
Why did you plan
the mission this way?

1432
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,050
Ji Ye Eun.

1433
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,890
(Ye Eun is simply irritated
by the producer.)

1434
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,160
Gosh, right now, Jong Kook is...

1435
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,630
- For real.
- This morning,

1436
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,560
- I was so surprised.
- I know. I was shocked.

1437
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,400
I thought it was some kind of
hidden camera prank.

1438
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:36,400
Apparently, he uploaded
a handwritten letter and stuff.

1439
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,830
- An article?
- It hasn't been published yet.

1440
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:38,900
What handwritten letter?

1441
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,340
- Jong Kook wrote one.
- I think Jong Kook wrote it.

1442
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,840
- To whom? Us?
- No.

1443
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:43,470
- An official one.
- Oh, like an official announcement?

1444
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,010
- To his fans?
- Why would he write to us?

1445
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,240
I thought he had written one to us.

1446
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,310
He probably did that, thinking...

1447
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,910
he's a K-pop idol too.

1448
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,810
Turbo's one of the first
K-pop idol groups.

1449
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,750
Of course. He wrote to his fans.

1450
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,680
- It's fascinating.
- No wonder...

1451
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,950
Jong Kook's been clutching
his phone all day.

1452
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,090
- What took him so long?
- I mean...

1453
00:46:58,090 --> 00:46:59,720
His marriage... His fiancée...

1454
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,620
- She's not Chaeyeon.
- It's not her.

1455
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,760
I wonder who she is.

1456
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,090
Of course, it's not Chaeyeon.

1457
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,200
- Could it be Pak Se Ri?
- Of course not.

1458
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:09,430
- It's not Se Ri.
- Pak Se Ri?

1459
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,430
What if...

1460
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,140
What if...

1461
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:15,040
Jae Seok, don't say it.

1462
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,470
(That's enough about his fiancée!)

1463
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,280
("We won't bring it up again either"
by the staff)

1464
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:22,640
I don't think...

1465
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,680
I've ever been asked to host
a wedding on such short notice.

1466
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,290
- No way.
- CEO Jang and I are scrambling...

1467
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,320
to rearrange our schedule.

1468
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,960
- No way.
- There's no way I can miss it.

1469
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,090
No wee.

1470
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,430
- No wee?
- What?

1471
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,960
- My gosh, Jong Kook.
- How meticulous of him.

1472
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,570
- He...
- He's overly meticulous.

1473
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:45,630
He's meticulous.

1474
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,140
- Tell me about it.
- Well...

1475
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,140
(Agent Kim even kept
his girlfriend a secret.)

1476
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,810
He reminded us
of an independence fighter.

1477
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,440
- He's a true celebrity.
- Jong Kook's a celebrity for sure.

1478
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,810
A true celebrity.

1479
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:55,840
I believe that all men
should learn how to box.

1480
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,950
I agree.

1481
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:59,310
Why are you and your girlfriend
talking so much about boxing?

1482
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,850
My girlfriend and I click.

1483
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,250
- When it comes to boxing...
- We're made for each other.

1484
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,020
- Do you love her?
- I do.

1485
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,060
- Do you love her?
- I do.

1486
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,690
Come on. Of course, he loves me.

1487
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,390
- Boxing brought us together.
- Couples should have...

1488
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,390
a common interest.

1489
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,500
Who has a girlfriend
that he can spar with?

1490
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,160
Why do you keep gazing
at Ye Eun, then?

1491
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,600
- Why are you flirting with her?
- I...

1492
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,840
That's not it.
She stays next to me, that's all.

1493
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,400
- She couldn't think straight.
- Exactly.

1494
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,840
From what I can tell, he's too kind.

1495
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,210
He was just being considerate.

1496
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,140
I bet he's popular.

1497
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,240
Of course, he is.

1498
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,280
That's irrelevant now.

1499
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,380
Doesn't this remind you of Jeju?

1500
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,880
- What?
- Not at all.

1501
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,550
We're in Pyeongtaek.

1502
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:37,790
This is my first time here.

1503
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,450
- It's so hot.
- It's really hot.

1504
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:40,460
It's scorching.

1505
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,220
What's this?

1506
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,560
It must be because
there's a US army base here.

1507
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,500
Even the parking lot...

1508
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,060
- I get it.
- reminds you of New York.

1509
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,870
- It's so hot.
- This reminds you of New York.

1510
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,930
- No kidding.
- I thought that was a mural.

1511
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:52,970
- Same here.
- Yes.

1512
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:55,240
You're here
at the Songtan Special Tourist Zone.

1513
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,010
There are many exotic shops...

1514
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,340
- influenced by the US Army bases.
- Let's have budaejjigae!

1515
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,940
It's also known as Song Francisco.

1516
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,180
- Song Francisco?
- Have a fun date...

1517
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,520
at the Pyeongtaek International
Central Market...

1518
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,050
and the shopping avenue.

1519
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,320
You'll pay for everything later...

1520
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,690
- after we total the amount.
- Nice.

1521
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:14,060
- The team in first place.
- I see.

1522
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,460
Then...

1523
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,530
(They earned more money
by playing a game on the way.)

1524
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,190
This is for the team
in second place.

1525
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,460
Hello.

1526
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,860
It's so hot.

1527
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,500
- It's too hot.
- It's really hot.

1528
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,800
Who's that over there?

1529
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,370
- That's Tanaka.
- It's Tanaka.

1530
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:26,970
- Why is Tanaka over there?
- How fascinating.

1531
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,000
It's Tanaka.

1532
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,840
Who's Tanaka?

1533
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,940
He's Tanaka.

1534
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,280
- Don't you know who he is?
- I don't.

1535
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,310
You don't know who Tanaka is?

1536
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,250
If we do it right,
it'll look like we're in the US.

1537
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,250
- Tell me about it.
- Jae Seok, you're so right.

1538
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,250
(You can pretend to be
in New York on vacation.)

1539
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,920
This makes us feel
like we're in another country.

1540
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,320
It's so pretty.

1541
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,560
- It's so pretty here.
- What is this place?

1542
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:49,960
This makes us feel
like we're in another country.

1543
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:53,630
(A mural street, similar
to a back alley in the US)

1544
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,660
There must've been tracks here.

1545
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,270
- You're right.
- This used to be a railroad.

1546
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:58,770
This is an old railroad.

1547
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,270
(Murals extend along the railroad
that led to the US army base.)

1548
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:05,040
This is giving me a New York vibe.

1549
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,480
- No way.
- Do we look cute?

1550
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,140
Haha, there's John Lennon.

1551
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,910
This is so cool.

1552
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,050
(Haha posed for a photo.)

1553
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,350
Can you take a photo of me?

1554
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,280
(But Se Chan comes
to stand next to him.)

1555
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,190
(He ends up taking a selfie
with his short arm.)

1556
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:25,030
This place...

1557
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,630
- This doesn't feel like Korea.
- Exactly.

1558
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,430
- Who even thought of this?
- This is nice.

1559
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,200
It's much cooler here.

1560
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,470
It's cooler here.

1561
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:32,630
I'm loving this street.

1562
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,040
It's so pretty.

1563
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,640
Doesn't this remind you...

1564
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,970
- of the 2000s?
- You're right.

1565
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:39,070
I haven't seen a street like this
in a while.

1566
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,840
Tell me about it. This is downtown.

1567
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,640
At places like this,

1568
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,180
- it's nice to have kebab.
- You're right.

1569
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,310
- Kebab?
- Haha.

1570
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:46,750
- I want a taco.
- Taco?

1571
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:48,880
They have food here
from all over the world.

1572
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,120
That's Ye Eun.

1573
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,390
- Ye Eun!
- Look.

1574
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,320
- What's that?
- That's so cute.

1575
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,790
Ye Eun, wait for us.

1576
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,060
Ji Hyo, how is it this big?

1577
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,290
- Why is it so big?
- It's huge.

1578
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,330
- How...
- It's huge.

1579
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,000
- How is it this big?
- Why is it so big?

1580
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,200
- That's nice.
- Should we get this for Jong Kook?

1581
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,370
As a gift?

1582
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:04,630
As a wedding gift.

1583
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:05,730
A wedding gift?

1584
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,270
Jong Kook doesn't need...

1585
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:09,340
something to hold in bed anymore.

1586
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,240
- Exactly.
- Now that I think about it,

1587
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,340
it's all coming together.

1588
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,340
What do you mean?

1589
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,080
Didn't he buy a lot of key rings?

1590
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,380
- He did. Cute key rings.
- He did.

1591
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:22,020
(The evidence he left behind
that pointed to an imminent wedding)

1592
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:27,560
(He's been crazy
about cute key rings.)

1593
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:34,700
(He made a felted doll with love
as if it were his own child.)

1594
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:39,300
(He had an open mind
about cute items.)

1595
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,540
(He was open-minded
about cute items.)

1596
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:48,680
(All of these were signs
of an imminent wedding!)

1597
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:50,110
- What?
- Is that it?

1598
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,180
He also loves the color pink.

1599
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,680
Check the footage we filmed
on Running Man.

1600
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,820
- Jong Kook's getting married.
- Tell me about it.

1601
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,880
At some point,
his love for cute items...

1602
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,920
- He couldn't help himself.
- You're right!

1603
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,490
- Hey!
- My gosh.

1604
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,790
What the...

1605
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,290
He startled me.

1606
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:05,930
- Back at Ye Eun's house.
- Right.

1607
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:07,760
He knew a lot about wallpaper.

1608
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,030
- Right.
- My gosh.

1609
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:12,270
(The evidence he left behind
that pointed to an imminent wedding)

1610
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:14,470
(Surprisingly, he knew
the wallpaper was expensive.)

1611
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:17,670
(He showed interest in it,
unlike the others.)

1612
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,880
- And the items around the house.
- You're right.

1613
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,640
- He said...
- He recognized them.

1614
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,510
He asked me questions about them.

1615
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,780
(That's an expensive lamp.)

1616
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,720
(I changed mine to these too.)

1617
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,990
(The clothes don't slip off.)

1618
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:34,160
(The culprit kept sending signals.)

1619
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,660
- Exactly.
- He's never been interested...

1620
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,830
- in those things.
- You're right.

1621
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,830
- He said the wallpaper was nice.
- Yes, the wallpaper.

1622
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,060
- He talked to you about the vibe.
- Yes, the vibe.

1623
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,760
His fiancée must've
picked out items for him.

1624
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,070
- What's this?
- This is fascinating.

1625
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,570
- This is so cool.
- Tell me about it.

1626
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:49,970
- Isn't it cool here?
- It's so nice.

1627
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,510
This feels like a back alley
in Itaewon.

1628
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:52,570
That's true.

1629
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:56,080
(A back alley lined
with all kinds of tailoring shops)

1630
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:00,820
Imagine Jong Kook's fiancée in this.

1631
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,850
We could get Jong Kook
a suit as well.

1632
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,350
- For Jong Kook?
- If he had been here,

1633
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:05,720
we wouldn't have gotten him
a suit and everything.

1634
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,720
Exactly.

1635
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,060
Check that out.

1636
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,560
Haha, is that the army base?

1637
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,390
- It is.
- Over there?

1638
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:13,090
The Osan base is right here.

1639
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,460
Yes, the Osan camp.

1640
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,260
- So this is the base.
- No way.

1641
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,130
(They see a hamburger place
right outside Osan Air Base.)

1642
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:19,770
- No way.
- Check out that place.

1643
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,100
This is really famous around here.

1644
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,040
- Really?
- Their hamburgers are popular.

1645
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,110
This place is famous around here.

1646
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:26,440
We should check it out.

1647
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,710
- It's really famous.
- I love it.

1648
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:28,910
Why don't we have a hamburger?

1649
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,010
- Sounds good.
- Go for it.

1650
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:31,380
Hello.

1651
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,480
(They head inside as if spellbound.)

1652
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,620
- I want a bacon steak burger.
- Can we order burgers?

1653
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,920
- Sure.
- Why does it smell so good?

1654
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,620
- My gosh.
- The smell is incredible.

1655
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,120
- Hello.
- I want a hot dog.

1656
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,360
Something smells delicious.

1657
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,460
- A hot dog?
- Eat the signature dish.

1658
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,260
- I want a hot dog.
- Right here.

1659
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:44,990
- Have a seat.
- Let's sit.

1660
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,030
Just so you know,
you'll have lunch next.

1661
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,330
Then...

1662
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:51,500
- Let's keep it simple.
- Let's just have a little taste.

1663
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,030
- We'll have finger foods.
- Buffalo wings?

1664
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,070
How about this?
We'll order a burger...

1665
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,200
for two people to share.

1666
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,370
- Three in total.
- That's right.

1667
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:59,340
- The cheese hot dog.
- The cheese hot dog?

1668
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,610
Would you like a cheeseburger
or a chili burger?

1669
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:03,610
Jae Seok, I want
the chili cheese burger.

1670
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,480
Let's have the chili cheese burger.

1671
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,020
The chili egg burger
also looks good.

1672
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,220
Then, the chili egg burger.

1673
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,990
- The price is going up by 50 cents.
- Really?

1674
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:11,620
We'll have the Miss Jin Top.

1675
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,690
- What?
- How much is it?

1676
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,860
(The most expensive dish)

1677
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,960
How could you?

1678
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,660
That's for us to share.

1679
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,260
- How could you?
- We're paying for it together.

1680
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,330
- Come on.
- Let's have the steak burger.

1681
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:23,370
- Sounds good.
- How much will this cost us?

1682
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:25,970
I've always wanted
to have a burger here.

1683
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,870
Exactly, the burgers
that are wrapped in foil.

1684
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,940
I wanted to try their hot dog.

1685
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:31,970
Yes, the hot dog.

1686
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:34,480
- They use imported sausages.
- The sausages.

1687
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,880
Did you have to cut your hair
in that annoying style?

1688
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,650
You look like someone else.

1689
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,480
- Did you call me annoying?
- He looks like a baby.

1690
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,980
- Well...
- This is a trending style.

1691
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,990
Only the most stylish people
wear this hairstyle.

1692
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,520
It's just that
you don't have a lot of hair.

1693
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:48,660
- You're like a wet mouse.
- I don't have a lot of hair?

1694
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,790
I've been taking many supplements
for hair growth.

1695
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,460
- Right.
- I'm sorry.

1696
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,460
- You...
- Isn't this the perm G-DRAGON got?

1697
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,200
Have you been copying him again?

1698
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,970
I'm right.
He got the exact same perm.

1699
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:59,800
Hey, this is the hair
Lee Eui Jung had...

1700
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,470
in "Guys and Girls."

1701
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,870
With it spiking up?

1702
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,910
(While they were joking around,)

1703
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,540
(the food was cooked on the spot.)

1704
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:09,480
(A heap of cabbage)

1705
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,710
I bet it'll be delicious.

1706
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,110
(Ketchup and mayonnaise
with sausage and patty)

1707
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,420
That looks so good.

1708
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,620
(Topped with a fried egg)

1709
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,620
No way. Can it smell any better?

1710
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:21,520
This looks like a rice burger.

1711
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:22,990
This looks really good.

1712
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:25,430
(Since it's a snack,
2 people share 1 burger.)

1713
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,960
This is crazy.

1714
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,730
- Careful.
- Here.

1715
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:30,830
Thanks.

1716
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,100
(Lots of chili sauce)

1717
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:34,070
That's crazy.

1718
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,370
(Although it's a winning combo,
they're still amazed.)

1719
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:37,670
What on earth?

1720
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,240
- It's delicious.
- No way.

1721
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:41,540
This is crazy.

1722
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,280
(The original US hot dog
is just as good.)

1723
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,410
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1724
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:47,420
Really?

1725
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,920
Sir!

1726
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,750
It's so good.

1727
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:54,260
(Even Ah Young, who's watching
her weight, takes a big bite.)

1728
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,820
- How do you eat this?
- It's so good.

1729
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:57,690
My gosh.

1730
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:59,290
(While they enjoy a date
that's actually like a date...)

1731
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,360
It's really good.

1732
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,770
(What's going on with Team A
making those punching sounds?)

1733
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:06,500
Nice. Good.

1734
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,240
(Are Jong Sook and Dong Yoon
punching each other?)

1735
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,840
(Why is this couple engaged
in an intense battle?)

1736
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,010
- This is a first for me.
- This is the boxing gym...

1737
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:21,020
that is frequented
by soldiers nearby.

1738
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,380
You will enjoy a sparring session
with US soldiers today.

1739
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,450
- What?
- As a date?

1740
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:26,590
- We'll die.
- I have no intention of doing that.

1741
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,690
How could we possibly fight them?

1742
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:30,060
Each couple will have...

1743
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,430
a one-on-one sparring session
with a US soldier.

1744
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,630
You will be scored based...

1745
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:35,360
on how many times
you punch the face,

1746
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,330
the front of the torso,
and the side.

1747
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,470
What the...

1748
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:39,570
(Right then,)

1749
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,670
(Jong Sook and Dong Yoon's opponent
enters the ring.)

1750
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,370
(Jayden Matthew Serrano,
Amateur boxer of 26 years)

1751
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:48,080
- Is he Matthew?
- This is no joke.

1752
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,210
Look at them.

1753
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,310
- Professional.
- He's a professional.

1754
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,480
- You have to be strong.
- Strong play.

1755
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,050
- Please.
- You have to be strong.

1756
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,120
- Okay!
- Okay.

1757
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,050
- You have to be strong.
- Your best.

1758
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,520
Best play, please.

1759
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,060
- Best play?
- Yes, best play.

1760
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,590
- Yes, because you are a strong man!
- Best.

1761
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,760
A strong man. Professional.

1762
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,130
- Best play!
- Best.

1763
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,230
- Best.
- Smack! Okay?

1764
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,970
(Asking him to beat the others to a pulp
with all the English he knows)

1765
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:15,300
- Matthew! Enemy.
- Enemy.

1766
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,640
(The weakest couple's request)

1767
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,580
(Will things go the way they want?)

1768
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,680
- Why are they...
- You're tiring yourselves out.

1769
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,950
Why are they fighting
amongst themselves?

1770
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:25,180
Please start and stop...

1771
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,250
- at the sound of the whistle.
- Okay.

1772
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:28,680
- Go.
- JK.

1773
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,520
(Pink Princess steps
into the ring first.)

1774
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:33,620
(The match starts.)

1775
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:36,690
- You weigh the same.
- Do your best!

1776
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,890
Do your best!

1777
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,700
Do your best!

1778
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,730
(Jong Sook goes in
with a punch first.)

1779
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,830
Your enemy. Your family's enemy.

1780
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,600
"Your family's enemy."

1781
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,900
Your family's enemy.

1782
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,970
(He scores 3 points in a flash.)

1783
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:53,140
(His pride in boxing doesn't
seem to be a bluff.)

1784
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,210
Matthew looks slightly nervous too.

1785
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,780
Hey, Jong Kook sure is different.
He's kind of like...

1786
00:57:58,310 --> 00:57:59,950
This is real boxing. My gosh.

1787
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,650
(His muscular body is
more agile than ever.)

1788
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,220
- Matthew is being cornered.
- Matthew looks...

1789
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,220
Jong Kook seems to
have learned boxing.

1790
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:11,160
He has 26 years of experience,
but Jong Kook is doing so well.

1791
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,730
(Soccer Kim is definitely better
at boxing than he is at soccer.)

1792
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,900
Looking at the color of Jong Kook's
hair, he looks like a madman.

1793
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,770
(The boxing psycho)

1794
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:22,100
- The color of his hair is...
- Right?

1795
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,670
He looks like
G-DRAGON who worked out a lot.

1796
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:24,970
Throw a jab.

1797
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,740
- Do your best!
- Yes!

1798
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,310
Counterpunch.

1799
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:31,110
(A camera gets smashed
as Matthew steps backwards.)

1800
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,850
- It's okay.
- No problem.

1801
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:35,920
- It's okay.
- Give me five dollars.

1802
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,250
It's fine. It's okay.

1803
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:40,050
You have 20 seconds left.

1804
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,720
- Score more points!
- Hey.

1805
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,360
You need to score more points!

1806
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,660
- Jong Kook is using his strength.
- Gosh, Jong Kook.

1807
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,030
He's pushing forward.

1808
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:55,300
(This time, he drives Matthew
into the opposite corner.)

1809
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:00,110
(This sparring session makes people
understand the rumors about him.)

1810
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,310
(Throwing a series of blows
until the end)

1811
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:05,410
He's blocking with his left arm
like this.

1812
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,220
(1 minute comes to an end.)

1813
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:08,980
- Next.
- You're good.

1814
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:09,980
Dong Yoon.

1815
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,350
(Jong Sook is out. Dong Yoon is in.)

1816
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:12,490
Okay, go.

1817
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,360
- Matthew, let's go.
- I think I did well.

1818
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,360
Ready.
(The match starts.)

1819
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,560
(Flour Boy suddenly changes.)

1820
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,200
- He landed that punch!
- One, two!

1821
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,140
- Gosh, Dong Yoon!
- Hey, for real.

1822
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,200
- Hey, why is he doing badly?
- This is a documentary!

1823
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,840
This is a documentary!

1824
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:35,240
(Flustered)

1825
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,710
- He's fast.
- Matthew looks flustered.

1826
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,150
Matthew is flustered.

1827
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:42,580
This is not SBS' sports channel.

1828
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,490
(A masculine moment from Dong Yoon
who's serious about boxing)

1829
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:47,020
Gosh, nice, Dong Yoon.

1830
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,990
Hey, but Dong Yoon is really good.

1831
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:51,530
Oh, Matthew is...

1832
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,030
(The dizzying blows
just keep coming.)

1833
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,870
- Matthew is...
- Jong Kook, Matthew is good, right?

1834
00:59:57,870 --> 00:59:58,970
He's good.

1835
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,440
- You have ten seconds left.
- My gosh.

1836
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,200
Hey, Dong Yoon. My goodness.

1837
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,840
(Testing the waters one last time)

1838
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,740
(Right then, a counterpunch that
even overcomes his shorter reach)

1839
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,310
Are you okay, Matthew?

1840
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,450
Come on. He's your enemy.

1841
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:14,550
That's so funny.

1842
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,220
(The match ends
with Dong Yoon's series of blows.)

1843
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,190
- Hey.
- Matthew.

1844
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,490
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1845
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,060
- Thank you, man.
- Gosh, that was...

1846
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,690
Hey, Dong Yoon. You're so good.

1847
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:23,730
He was so fast.

1848
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:25,490
Hey, you're so good.
Let me help you with those.

1849
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,500
- Feeling! Cross!
- Intuition! Cross!

1850
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,530
Nice.

1851
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,870
- Oh, man.
- Is that allowed?

1852
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:31,870
(The younger guy
gets beaten up first.)

1853
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:33,430
(The oldest boxer steps up
to avenge his younger brother.)

1854
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:34,870
Okay. Nice!

1855
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,140
(The counterattack rains down
right away.)

1856
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,140
(He gets knocked out before he even
gets to throw his kitty fists.)

1857
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,410
Oh, no!

1858
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,710
How was the date,
now that you've tried it in person?

1859
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:43,950
- The date?
- It was so much fun.

1860
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,580
- Is this really a date?
- I...

1861
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,150
- Is this a date?
- Wouldn't you get dumped...

1862
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,850
- if you actually did this?
- What kind of date is this?

1863
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:52,150
How nice would it be
if there were a couple like this?

1864
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:53,220
It's only nice for them.

1865
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:56,560
- The best girlfriend.
- I loved it so much, really.

1866
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,160
I'll tell you how many punches
you landed.

1867
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,860
Seok Jin and Daniel,
since you're beginners,

1868
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,830
- we doubled your scores.
- What?

1869
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:04,930
- That's not fair.
- What is this?

1870
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:06,930
- It is fair.
- We were just sparring lightly.

1871
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,300
- It's fair for beginners.
- It is.

1872
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,300
We were just playing a game.

1873
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,870
- Why? We're beginners.
- Isn't this unfair?

1874
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:11,870
We're beginners.

1875
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:13,570
Daniel, you landed three punches.

1876
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:14,880
- What?
- Seok Jin,

1877
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,040
- you landed 12 punches.
- Only 3?

1878
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,850
- You threw many punches.
- Nice, 12.

1879
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:20,420
Doubling your scores,
you had a total of 30 punches.

1880
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,790
See? If we knew that,
we would've thrown more punches.

1881
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:25,950
But Jong Kook,

1882
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,890
you landed 30 punches on your own.

1883
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:29,560
(However, Jong Sook achieved
30 punches on his own.)

1884
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,160
- Okay.
- Nice.

1885
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:33,900
- But punches... I hit him a lot.
- Dong Yoon.

1886
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,600
Dong Yoon, you landed 27 punches.

1887
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,470
- We're no match for them.
- They got almost double.

1888
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,640
- This is...
- So, Team Jong Kook won big-time.

1889
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,700
- Thank goodness.
- Indeed.

1890
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,540
Team Jong Kook will get 100 dollars,
and Team Seok Jin will get 70.

1891
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,540
(Jong Sook, Dong Yoon: 100 dollars,
Seok Soon, Niel: 70 dollars)

1892
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:50,340
Well, this is
an individual thing anyway, right?

1893
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,350
Seriously, though, this was so hard.

1894
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:53,350
It's a great workout.

1895
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:56,450
Now, you'll choose and pay
for lottery tickets.

1896
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:59,250
Before we came here,
we told you that the cost...

1897
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,590
- was cheaper with lower winnings.
- That's right.

1898
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:04,990
So, the total amount we spent here
was 120 dollars.

1899
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,090
As you split the bill,

1900
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:07,830
you can buy a lottery ticket
for ten dollars each.

1901
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:09,530
- Each ticket is ten dollars?
- Yes.

1902
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:12,030
- But it's so expensive.
- It was 120 dollars?

1903
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,140
But the four of us
will be splitting the bill.

1904
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,700
Hello.

1905
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,940
(Remaining balance: 120 dollars)

1906
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:21,010
I will pay 30 dollars again.

1907
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:23,880
Because there are four of us,
I want to be fair.

1908
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,450
So, here's 30 dollars.

1909
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:29,280
- Three lottery tickets?
- You can take three.

1910
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:32,050
- One, two... I'll take these.
- Okay.

1911
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,990
It's not really my style,
but today is a special day.

1912
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:38,060
I've reached a turning point
in my life,

1913
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:39,760
so I'll pay this much.

1914
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,200
(The happy groom-to-be
pays 50 dollars.)

1915
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,800
I'll take these. All right. Thanks.

1916
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:45,030
Okay.

1917
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:46,230
Are there still this many left?

1918
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,600
The remaining balance is 40 dollars.

1919
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,610
There's 40 dollars left?

1920
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:52,940
(Remaining balance: 40 dollars)

1921
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,110
I'll take four.

1922
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,940
One, two, three...

1923
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,680
I'll take this middle row.

1924
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,680
(He gets 4 lottery tickets
after paying off the balance.)

1925
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:04,520
(Now, it's Daniel's turn.)

1926
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,260
- Daniel, you don't have to go.
- Why?

1927
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,220
Seok Jin paid off
the remaining balance...

1928
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,260
- Darn it! Seok Jin!
- and took the lottery tickets.

1929
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,230
You can't tell him that.

1930
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:16,500
- Earlier, you were nodding at me.
- How much did you spend?

1931
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,470
Seok Jin, you should've left me one.

1932
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:19,830
How many did you two...

1933
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,540
We'll scratch off
the lottery tickets now.

1934
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,500
When you scratch off
the square labeled Your Shape,

1935
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,710
you will find a shape
from rock-paper-scissors.

1936
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:28,210
If your shape wins
against the six shapes on the right,

1937
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:29,280
you get the winnings multiplied...

1938
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,850
- by the number of shapes you beat.
- Really?

1939
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:33,480
- If you beat 1, you get 1 dollar.
- That's not bad.

1940
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,680
If you beat 2, you get 2 dollars.
If you beat 3, you get 3 dollars.

1941
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,690
If you beat 4, you get 4 dollars.
If you beat 5, you get 5 dollars.

1942
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:40,790
If you beat all six,

1943
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,320
- you get 100 dollars.
- For real?

1944
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,160
- Not just multiplied by 1 dollar?
- There's a prize of 100 dollars?

1945
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,560
- Now, in the same order as before,
- That's the jackpot.

1946
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,230
- you will scratch off your tickets.
- Shall we see, then?

1947
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:48,930
Okay, I'll go first.

1948
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,200
Dong Yoon likes gambling games
more than I thought.

1949
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:55,140
- Okay, my shape is rock.
- What is it?

1950
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:56,470
Rock. Paper.

1951
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:59,340
Then, I need lots of scissors.
All right. Jackpot!

1952
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:00,980
Then, I need lots of scissors.
All right.

1953
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:01,980
(The bottom row is all scissors!)

1954
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,110
Gosh, he has three scissors.

1955
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:05,150
(If the top row is all scissors too,
he wins the 100 dollar jackpot.)

1956
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:06,750
- I got three scissors.
- Really?

1957
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:07,750
(If the top row is all scissors too,
he wins the 100 dollar jackpot.)

1958
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,850
(Will he hit the jackpot
with his first lottery ticket?)

1959
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:09,850
How many do you need
to win 100 dollars?

1960
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:11,450
You have to beat all six.

1961
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:12,450
(Will he hit the jackpot
with his first lottery ticket?)

1962
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:16,260
- Yes, start from the bottom.
- Take your time.

1963
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,060
(He beat all 6!)

1964
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,630
- Yes, start from the bottom.
- Take your time.

1965
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,360
- I won!
- Is that 100 dollars?

1966
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,000
- That's 100 dollars!
- Really?

1967
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:24,600
- No way.
- No, for real.

1968
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,100
- He's even lucky.
- It's real.

1969
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,540
- This guy...
- He even has good luck.

1970
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,300
He's a lucky guy.

1971
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,270
He bought 3, but he won 100 dollars?

1972
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:34,140
He's getting something in return
for his kindness.

1973
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:38,110
This time,
the highest amount you can win is...

1974
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:40,550
- We had the higher winnings.
- Yes, you can win 200 dollars.

1975
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:41,950
(The highest amount
they can win is...)

1976
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,350
(double that of the boxing team
at 200 dollars.)

1977
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:45,590
The total amount you spent...

1978
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,360
- How much was it?
- was 135 dollars.

1979
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,660
- How did we spend so much?
- We spent a lot.

1980
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,720
With the stitching...

1981
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,890
(They visited a uniform shop,
unable to resist the temptation.)

1982
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,260
(They start by decorating bags.)

1983
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,530
(Each name costs 15 dollars.)

1984
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:01,740
(Each patch costs 3 dollars.)

1985
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:06,140
(After decorating their bags,
they shop for matching outfits.)

1986
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,540
(Why are you
suddenly buying uniforms?)

1987
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,350
(Each uniform costs 30 dollars.)

1988
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:13,850
(An A and an S)

1989
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:16,450
(Ah Young loves Se Chan.)

1990
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:20,150
(The A and S couple even get
their initials stitched on.)

1991
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:22,720
(Like so, they spent
a total of 135 dollars...)

1992
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,260
(at the hamburger restaurant
and uniform shop.)

1993
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,930
- How much do you have?
- But when you pay,

1994
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:31,230
you can buy 1 lottery ticket
for 15 dollars each.

1995
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:32,970
- For 15 dollars?
- Yes, 15 dollars.

1996
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,870
- I'll buy as many as I can.
- I'll buy them. I'll bet my money.

1997
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,510
- Out of the four...
- We should've spent a lot, then.

1998
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,540
- Right.
- Haha and Ji Hyo,

1999
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:40,840
- you can go together.
- Okay.

2000
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,940
- Gosh, the lottery tickets...
- Okay.

2001
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,250
I should go all-in.

2002
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,480
- Each 1 costs 15 dollars?
- Yes.

2003
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,050
Okay, then.

2004
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,850
We have to buy as many as possible.
That way, we have higher odds.

2005
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:52,320
Jae Seok, you're totally broke.

2006
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,950
I'm going to buy four too.

2007
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,330
- Then, we can pick them...
- Well, later...

2008
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:58,590
I have enough for...

2009
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:00,590
Okay, next.

2010
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,300
- You guys can go.
- It would be awesome to win.

2011
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,930
I hope I can win this one...

2012
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,230
Should I really go all-in?

2013
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:07,740
The ticket worth 200 dollars...
I'll take 4 tickets.

2014
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,100
(He pays 60 dollars.)

2015
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,710
The remaining balance is 30 dollars.
You can't pay more than that.

2016
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:15,210
(The remaining balance
is 30 dollars.)

2017
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:16,940
- What?
- They paid a lot.

2018
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,250
But...

2019
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,450
(Before Jae Seok
and Ye Eun got here)

2020
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:20,610
(Remaining balance: 135 dollars)

2021
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:21,750
(All-in!)

2022
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,420
(She pays 45 dollars.
He pays 60 dollars.)

2023
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:30,960
(Haha buys 4 lottery tickets,
and Ji Hyo buys 3.)

2024
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:35,730
(Thanks to the Tiger Moth couple,
only 30 dollars remains.)

2025
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,730
Then, can we only buy two tickets?

2026
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:38,970
For 30 dollars?

2027
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:40,100
Then, let's get one each.

2028
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:41,800
- Here's 15 dollars.
- I'll take 2.

2029
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,140
No, Jae Seok.

2030
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:44,370
He did get here first, though.

2031
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:46,110
(Remaining balance: 30 dollars)

2032
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:47,640
So it's 15 dollars each.
I wanted to purchase all of them.

2033
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,780
People who came earlier
spent a lot of money.

2034
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:51,180
They got lottery tickets.
We won't be able to win with these.

2035
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,250
We won't be able to win.

2036
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:55,050
(They end up purchasing
1 lottery ticket each.)

2037
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,050
We can't buy more
since people bought all of them.

2038
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:58,590
- Can't you buy more?
- Did people really buy all of them?

2039
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,190
We can't buy more
since people bought all of them.

2040
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,260
- For goodness' sake.
- We need to buy them here.

2041
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,760
I'll explain the lottery.

2042
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,530
If you win six times,

2043
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:08,100
- you'll receive 200 dollars.
- That'll make you number 1.

2044
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,360
If you win five times,

2045
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,530
- you'll receive 10 dollars.
- Number 2.

2046
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,830
- Ten dollars?
- Yes.

2047
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:14,170
Will you receive 10 dollars
if you win 5 times?

2048
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,040
That means the probability is bad.

2049
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,510
If you win 4 times,
you'll receive 8 dollars.

2050
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:19,640
If you win 3 times,
you'll receive 6 dollars.

2051
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:20,780
If you win 2 times,
you'll receive 4 dollars.

2052
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,010
If you win 1 time,
you'll receive 2 dollars.

2053
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:23,080
Let's do it now.

2054
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:24,910
Haha, go ahead.

2055
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:26,610
(The one with 4 lottery tickets,
Haha begins to scratch 1st.)

2056
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:28,720
My hand is scissors.

2057
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,920
- It's mine.
- Okay, I won twice.

2058
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:33,720
(Currently, he has acquired
4 dollars.)

2059
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,390
- I won three times.
- Three times.

2060
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:36,960
You need to win 6 times
to receive 200 dollars.

2061
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,530
I won four times.

2062
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:39,730
- I won four times.
- It's meaningless.

2063
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,230
- That means I'll get eight dollars.
- Eight dollars.

2064
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:42,830
You lost seven dollars.

2065
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,530
My hand is rock.

2066
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,700
- Gosh, why am I losing so much?
- It's over. It's a dud.

2067
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
- It's a tie.
- You won three times.

2068
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,810
I didn't win once
in this lottery ticket.

2069
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:53,240
- For 3 wins, you get 6 dollars.
- You get 6 dollars.

2070
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,180
Ties are meaningless, right?

2071
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,240
- Yes.
- Ties are meaningless.

2072
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,910
- It's a dud.
- It's a dud.

2073
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:01,750
(Only 2 lottery tickets remain.)

2074
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:04,190
- Okay. One.
- One.

2075
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:05,490
- Gosh.
- It's game over.

2076
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:06,750
- Two.
- He can't get six wins.

2077
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:07,960
Three.

2078
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:09,360
- Four.
- Five.

2079
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,590
- I got five wins. Ten dollars.
- Ten dollars.

2080
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:13,630
- You lost 5 dollars.
- You lost 5 dollars.

2081
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:15,260
- Still, it's cool.
- Will anyone get six wins?

2082
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,760
Will anyone get six wins?

2083
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,730
- My hand is rock.
- I think it'll be hard.

2084
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,630
- You need six wins.
- You get another chance.

2085
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:21,700
Let it be scissors.

2086
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,970
It's over. Haha lost money.

2087
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:26,640
(It's already a dud.)

2088
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:27,940
- Haha lost money.
- How much is it?

2089
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,480
- How much is it?
- One, two, three.

2090
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,650
- Three.
- It's meaningless. Six dollars.

2091
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:33,550
(He bought 4 lottery tickets,
but he failed to win a jackpot.)

2092
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:35,220
How about you?

2093
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,520
- I bet Ji Hyo will win a jackpot.
- He lost his money.

2094
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:38,890
I bet Ji Hyo will win a jackpot.

2095
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:41,460
- Oh, my.
- What is it?

2096
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:43,490
- Is it a jackpot?
- It's over. It's meaningless.

2097
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:44,930
- I got one win.
- One win?

2098
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:46,490
- One win means...
- Two dollars.

2099
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:47,560
You lost so much money.

2100
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,660
You lost 13 dollars.

2101
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,730
No way. This is ridiculous.

2102
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:52,000
- Will she win a jackpot?
- This is ridiculous.

2103
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,200
Ye Eun, if she doesn't win
a jackpot,

2104
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,900
- we might.
- You're right.

2105
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,000
- How many wins?
- Two.

2106
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,170
- We don't know yet.
- Two?

2107
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:58,470
- Four dollars.
- No.

2108
01:08:58,740 --> 01:08:59,840
- One.
- What?

2109
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,080
- Ji Hyo won four dollars.
- We might get a big break.

2110
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,410
Did I win four dollars?
I can't believe it.

2111
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:07,350
(What will be
Ji Hyo's last lottery ticket?)

2112
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,350
Did I win four dollars?
I can't believe it.

2113
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:11,590
Is it a dud?

2114
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:12,690
(She fails to win a jackpot.)

2115
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,090
- It's hard.
- Your hand is paper.

2116
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,220
- Four.
- For goodness' sake.

2117
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,730
(The last lottery ticket has
4 wins.)

2118
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,190
Four wins? It's eight dollars.

2119
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:20,530
I lost 30 dollars.

2120
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:22,330
Both of them lost money.

2121
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:23,760
Jae Seok, one of you
will win a jackpot.

2122
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,830
- Go first.
- No way.

2123
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:26,900
(Then another couple might have
the jackpot lottery ticket.)

2124
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,770
(The one with 1 lottery ticket,
Ye Eun gives it a go.)

2125
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:31,340
- It's over.
- It's over.

2126
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,770
(Ye Eun gets a dud.)

2127
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:33,810
It's over.

2128
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,580
- One, two, three.
- It's over.

2129
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,010
- Three wins.
- Three wins.

2130
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:38,150
- Six dollars.
- Six dollars.

2131
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:40,150
- Please.
- Jae Seok, give me ten dollars.

2132
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:41,620
Please.

2133
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,320
Maybe it's a jackpot.

2134
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:45,050
(All the other lottery tickets
were duds.)

2135
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,790
Paper is a good one.
He just needs rocks.

2136
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:50,220
(Will this lottery ticket bring
the miracle of a jackpot?)

2137
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,860
(It'll be a jackpot
if he gets 6 rocks.)

2138
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:52,990
He just needs rocks.

2139
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:54,190
Let's see.

2140
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,360
Oh, no.

2141
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,730
It's a rock.

2142
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:57,830
(He gets 1 rock.)

2143
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:59,630
Will it win him 200 dollars?

2144
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:00,940
- Rock.
- Rock.

2145
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,000
Will it be a jackpot?

2146
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:04,770
- Hold on.
- Will it be a jackpot?

2147
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,210
- Rock.
- It'll be a jackpot.

2148
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,340
(If the upper row has rocks,
it'll be a jackpot!)

2149
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,680
Three wins.

2150
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:13,250
- Will it be a jackpot?
- No way.

2151
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,580
- I think it'll be a jackpot.
- No way.

2152
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:16,120
Rock.

2153
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,120
(4 consecutive rocks)

2154
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,750
This is incredible.

2155
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,920
- Jae Seok.
- Hold on.

2156
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,220
- Rock.
- Oh, my.

2157
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:23,360
Five wins.

2158
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,390
(All 5 hands are rocks.
He needs 1 more rock.)

2159
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:26,460
Seriously, Jae Seok.

2160
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:27,930
- Ten dollars.
- Jae Seok, this is incredible.

2161
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:29,500
- Just this one.
- No way.

2162
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,600
If this one is a rock...

2163
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,070
(Will the 1 lottery ticket he had
win him a 200-dollar jackpot?)

2164
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:33,130
Seriously.

2165
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,300
This is nerve-racking.

2166
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,970
This is nerve-racking.

2167
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:38,810
I think it's a rock.

2168
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:42,180
(All 6 hands are rocks.)

2169
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:43,840
(Jae Seok wins
a 200-dollar jackpot.)

2170
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,850
- You won 200 dollars.
- Jae Seok, no way.

2171
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,080
(Jae Seok wins
a 200-dollar jackpot.)

2172
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:49,350
- I...
- Yes!

2173
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:52,050
(The one remaining lottery ticket
brought him a jackpot!)

2174
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:54,020
- How did that happen?
- Gosh, this is...

2175
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,990
- Thank you.
- He bought one lottery ticket.

2176
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:59,230
Ye Eun.

2177
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:00,430
Jae Seok, please give me 50 dollars.

2178
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:01,760
Jae Seok, please give me 50 dollars.

2179
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,930
- She's your teammate.
- I'm your teammate.

2180
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:06,200
They share their winnings.
Please give me 50 dollars.

2181
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:07,530
Thank you.

2182
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:08,770
(He donates 50 dollars
to his poor partner.)

2183
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:10,340
Jae Seok is the best.

2184
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:11,510
You earned money.

2185
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,840
- Gosh, this is...
- It's so electrifying...

2186
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,440
- that he won 200 dollars.
- I'll give you 30 dollars.

2187
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,340
Would you give me 50 dollars?

2188
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,510
What are you talking about?

2189
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:19,510
- You're talking nonsense.
- What are you talking about?

2190
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,710
I'll give you 30 dollars.

2191
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:21,820
- It's nonsense.
- Why would I give you...

2192
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:23,180
- fifty dollars?
- I earned money.

2193
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:25,420
- Come on.
- Would you give us the change?

2194
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,660
- Please, Jae Seok.
- We didn't get to scratch tickets.

2195
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:29,220
- But they have a lot of money.
- No, we don't.

2196
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,230
We didn't get to scratch tickets.
Please give us the change.

2197
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:32,860
- Please give us the change.
- Three dollars each.

2198
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:35,200
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

2199
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,560
- We're partners.
- How much did you get?

2200
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,770
Four dollars.

2201
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:39,030
Thank you.

2202
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:40,200
(Ah Young and Se Chan
are happy about the change.)

2203
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,770
- Five dollars is a lot.
- He gave us five dollars.

2204
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:43,540
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

2205
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:45,770
(Only Jae Seok and Ye Eun
finish the date on a happy note.)

2206
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:47,640
I don't have money.

2207
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:49,040
I don't have money,
so I'll pick the place...

2208
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,410
- with the lower price.
- Get on the van of your choice.

2209
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,550
I'll play it safe.

2210
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:54,080
Ji Hyo, let's go here.

2211
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:55,880
- Here?
- We don't have money.

2212
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,150
(Being broke, the Mapo Siblings
go with the safe choice.)

2213
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:58,550
We don't have money.

2214
01:11:58,620 --> 01:11:59,920
Let's play it safe...

2215
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,820
- since it's the last round.
- We need to play it safe.

2216
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:03,860
- I'll go inside.
- Why did you come here?

2217
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:05,590
- You want...
- Should I have gone elsewhere?

2218
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:07,860
- a big break.
- You should give it a go.

2219
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,330
Where did Dong Yoon go?

2220
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:10,530
(They go to the lunch places
with different menus.)

2221
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:12,600
- Maybe I won't get to see him.
- You won't get to see him.

2222
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:14,900
We don't have money.
Gosh, 200 dollars.

2223
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:16,600
(They have no idea
what the menu will be.)

2224
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:17,940
- How did he win that?
- Seriously.

2225
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:21,380
We won't go
to another burger place, will we?

2226
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:26,210
(Feeling unsure, they arrive
at the last date location.)

2227
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:27,750
- You're here.
- Okay.

2228
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,850
What?

2229
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,220
We just went around.

2230
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:32,690
We... What?

2231
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:36,060
- We were here.
- I mean... Hello.

2232
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:37,420
This is...

2233
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,260
What's this? We just went around.

2234
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:42,500
Wasn't there a burger place here?

2235
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:44,200
This place looks delicious.

2236
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:46,300
- We just went around.
- I mean...

2237
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,840
- Hey, is it a burger again?
- What?

2238
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:51,270
- What? Another burger?
- Is it a burger again?

2239
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:53,410
Haha, we were there just now.

2240
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,540
We were there.

2241
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:56,080
(Current location:
The new burger place)

2242
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,640
(The burger place from earlier)

2243
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,810
We...

2244
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,950
(The van went around
so that they wouldn't notice.)

2245
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:02,620
Hello.

2246
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,790
- Hello.
- You must've crossed the street.

2247
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:06,520
(A burger place
with the authentic taste...)

2248
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,790
(that's in front of the US Army base
in Pyeongtaek)

2249
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:09,060
- Gosh.
- Haha.

2250
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,220
- Hello.
- Had we known...

2251
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,290
(It's like a diner
in a Hollywood movie.)

2252
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:13,060
- Hi. Hello.
- I mean...

2253
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:14,900
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

2254
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,530
I mean...

2255
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:18,170
(While this place is nice)

2256
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:20,800
If you go through the video,

2257
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:23,470
you'll see that Ji Hyo
and I shared a burger...

2258
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:25,470
at a cafe in the morning.

2259
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:28,740
Then we came here
and ate a burger...

2260
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:29,940
before coming to this place.

2261
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:33,450
What's the menu for the other team?

2262
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:34,520
It's budaejjigae, right?

2263
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:38,250
(Bingo)

2264
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:40,090
Budaejjigae.

2265
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:42,060
It must be a famous place.

2266
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,660
I really want Dong Yoon to come.

2267
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,530
I don't think Dong Yoon will come.

2268
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:48,860
(She's obsessed with Dong Yoon.)

2269
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:49,960
What's wrong with her?

2270
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,170
Do you want to meet Dong Yoon...

2271
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,970
in private?

2272
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:54,700
Don't be like that.

2273
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:55,940
- He's trying to help.
- I'm close to him.

2274
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:57,340
You aren't close to him.

2275
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,410
Apparently, he's close to him.

2276
01:13:58,410 --> 01:13:59,970
- They've always known each other.
- I'm close to him.

2277
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,110
He even called me yesterday.

2278
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:02,480
- "Se Chan."
- Let me see.

2279
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,880
It must be in your call history.

2280
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:07,150
Let me see.

2281
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:09,280
- She wants to see it.
- You're lying.

2282
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,280
If you don't want me to help,
forget it.

2283
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,120
- Show me your call history.
- Why do I need to do that?

2284
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,290
What? Jong Kook is here.

2285
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:14,590
(Did Jong Sook and Dong Yoon
appear?)

2286
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:16,420
What? Jong Kook is here.

2287
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,560
(What? Jong Kook is here.)

2288
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,760
- Jong Kook is here.
- Hello.

2289
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,930
(Dong Yoon's girlfriend,
Jong Sook, appears.)

2290
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:20,990
- Jong Kook.
- What?

2291
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,960
- Are you coming with Dong Yoon?
- Hey.

2292
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,900
Dong Yoon is so charming.

2293
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,100
He's incredible.

2294
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,800
Hello.

2295
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,240
- Dong Yoon is smart.
- Sit here.

2296
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,770
- Dong Yoon is here.
- Dong Yoon is smart.

2297
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:33,070
Dong Yoon, sit here.

2298
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:34,910
- Dong Yoon is here.
- Hello.

2299
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:37,380
Dong Yoon is smart.

2300
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,750
- Come on out for a second.
- Jae Seok, go on in.

2301
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:39,850
Go on in.

2302
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:42,020
(She's determined
to sit next to Dong Yoon.)

2303
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,620
- "Go on in?" Put your feet down.
- "Go on in."

2304
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,120
There you go.

2305
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,820
Jae Seok, stop her advances.

2306
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:48,020
(Struggling)

2307
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,090
Well done.

2308
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:50,360
That's funny.

2309
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,290
More than today

2310
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,430
- Gosh, Ye Eun.
- Boxing was fun.

2311
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:56,700
- That's funny.
- You know,

2312
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,870
Ye Eun talked about Dong Yoon
all day long.

2313
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:02,470
Dong Yoon, Kang Hoon, Seung Ho...

2314
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,070
The other couple must've taken
the money in the previous round.

2315
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,970
We didn't do badly.

2316
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:08,010
- Is that so?
- Yes.

2317
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:09,340
- That's right.
- Are they leading by far?

2318
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:10,840
No. They're in bad condition.

2319
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,480
- As for us, one team is leading.
- Really?

2320
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,780
- Yes. One team is leading.
- Which team?

2321
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,350
- I see.
- One team is leading.

2322
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:17,020
- They hit a jackpot.
- One person did.

2323
01:15:17,150 --> 01:15:18,250
- One person?
- One person.

2324
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:20,120
Aren't we leading by far?

2325
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,920
- The two of us.
- We're doing well.

2326
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,820
- We have incredible teamwork.
- How much do you have?

2327
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:24,990
- We have a lot of money.
- We have a lot of money.

2328
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:25,990
- "We have a lot of money."
- Then...

2329
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:27,900
- why did you come here?
- Honey.

2330
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,800
Honey, do you have a lot of money?

2331
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:31,600
- Honey.
- What are you doing?

2332
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,300
What's wrong with her?
Come on, Ye Eun.

2333
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,270
- She's definitely excited.
- Ye Eun.

2334
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:36,300
What are you doing?

2335
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,440
Are you the one
who's getting married?

2336
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,870
(I'm the one who's getting married.)

2337
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:40,110
"Honey, do you have a lot of money?"

2338
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:41,580
- That meme is so old.
- It's so old.

2339
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:43,040
- Ye Eun.
- This is...

2340
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,210
the last chance
to change your partner.

2341
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:48,450
- By any chance...
- Why did we get that chance?

2342
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,320
- Why?
- Other couples have it too.

2343
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,690
- Other couples have it too.
- Really?

2344
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:53,950
- You've had the same partner.
- I like my current partner.

2345
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,660
We get along so well.

2346
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:56,890
- We're a fated pair.
- It's only if you want it.

2347
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:58,530
It's only if both parties want it.

2348
01:15:58,530 --> 01:15:59,960
(She gets caught untying
the couple's handkerchief.)

2349
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,560
- You can keep going...
- Why...

2350
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,700
- with the same partner.
- Listen.

2351
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:06,270
It's not like I'm your partner
by choice.

2352
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:08,900
- Also, you can leave if you want.
- Ye Eun.

2353
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:11,170
But if you're going to leave,
give me back my 50 dollars.

2354
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,140
- That's right.
- Did you guys have...

2355
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,740
- Give it back to me.
- a business relationship?

2356
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:16,540
- Yes.
- Many transactions were made.

2357
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:19,480
- They're a fake couple.
- You can leave if you want,

2358
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,510
but give me back my 50 dollars.

2359
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:23,620
Firstly, express your wish
to change your partner.

2360
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:27,190
Raise your hand
if you want a new partner.

2361
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:28,220
- But...
- One...

2362
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,720
- We should close our eyes.
- For everyone to see?

2363
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,030
- Close your eyes then.
- Okay.

2364
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:33,230
- Close your eyes.
- Close your eyes.

2365
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:34,460
- One, two, three.
- It's for entertainment.

2366
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:35,460
Close your eyes.

2367
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,100
- This is to check your wish.
- Okay.

2368
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,270
Close your eyes.

2369
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:40,030
One, two, three.

2370
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,940
(Only the four of them
raised their hands.)

2371
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:45,940
- All right. Put your hand down.
- Okay.

2372
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:49,210
Now, a connection has been made.

2373
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,440
- Is that so?
- Really?

2374
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,810
- Yes. Thus,
- Has a connection been made?

2375
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,780
Ah Young and Ye Eun
will switch positions.

2376
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,590
Ah Young and Ye Eun
will switch positions.

2377
01:16:58,590 --> 01:17:01,420
(She gets another Pouty Mouth
as her new partner.)

2378
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:04,790
(They succeeded in teasing Ye Eun!)

2379
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:05,990
- Ah Young.
- I knew it.

2380
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:08,160
Dong Yoon is loyal.

2381
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,330
- I like my girlfriend so much.
- Seriously.

2382
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:11,570
- Come here.
- Dong Yoon!

2383
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:13,900
Why are you making this show boring?

2384
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,440
(She becomes angry.)

2385
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,470
I haven't done anything.

2386
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:21,410
He didn't make it boring.
It's entertaining.

2387
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:24,910
- Ye Eun.
- It's so entertaining.

2388
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:26,610
- Ye Eun, come here.
- Give me 50 dollars before you go.

2389
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,880
- Give me 50 dollars before you go.
- Give it back.

2390
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,280
(Her ex-partner
wants his money back.)

2391
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,280
No.

2392
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,790
- Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun.

2393
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:34,550
- We're busy.
- Don't be like that.

2394
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,390
- Ah Young is my partner.
- Hey.

2395
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:37,660
Wear this. Come here.

2396
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:40,060
We need to wear matching T-shirts.
Come here.

2397
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:41,900
- I have it.
- Give me 50 dollars.

2398
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,300
I only have 50 dollars.

2399
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,870
- Hey, you got 50 dollars.
- Ah Young.

2400
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,030
- Here you go.
- Gosh, Ah Young.

2401
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:49,040
- Ye Eun, let's switch seats.
- May I sit here?

2402
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,410
(Hurried)

2403
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:53,240
- Jae Seok, please move.
- You should switch seats.

2404
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,640
- I can do that for you.
- Jae Seok will move.

2405
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,010
- I can do that for you.
- Se Chan, come here.

2406
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:57,040
- Okay.
- Se Chan.

2407
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,210
I can do that for you.

2408
01:17:58,210 --> 01:17:59,380
Seriously.

2409
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:01,350
- I can sit here, right?
- You can do that.

2410
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:02,650
They're switching seats.

2411
01:18:02,650 --> 01:18:03,850
(She continues to sit next to him
as a last resort.)

2412
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,890
Ah Young, switch the handkerchief
on your wrist.

2413
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,620
- I see. Okay.
- Yes.

2414
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:12,090
- Did the partners actually change?
- Ye Eun.

2415
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:13,430
Did you give back 50 dollars?

2416
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:15,430
- You saw me do it.
- Would you like some money?

2417
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:16,700
Hold on.

2418
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,730
Dong Yoon wants to give her money.

2419
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:22,100
Why do you shake up my heart?

2420
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,200
I have a lot of money.

2421
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:25,710
Really?

2422
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:26,940
- He's strange.
- Listen.

2423
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,240
- Ye Eun.
- Dong Yoon...

2424
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,310
Dong Yoon plays with my heart.

2425
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:32,580
Ye Eun, you're only showing
your back...

2426
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,010
to your new partner.

2427
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:35,150
Listen.

2428
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:37,220
Listen. Knock, knock. Look at me.

2429
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:38,950
- Ye Eun.
- You're only showing your back.

2430
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,650
Why are you looking at your money?

2431
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:42,420
How much can you give me?

2432
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:45,330
- What? What kind of a line is that?
- How much do you need?

2433
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:47,530
How much can you give me?

2434
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,260
Why do you keep going
for a comedy skit?

2435
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,500
- Really?
- Ten dollars is a lot.

2436
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,000
- Still...
- Oh, my.

2437
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,070
Stop giving her money.
Why would you...

2438
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,340
- What's up with him?
- I feel like he's the type...

2439
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:00,670
- to get swindled.
- Dong Yoon is so...

2440
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:02,010
Dong Yoon is like that.

2441
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:03,680
- That's funny.
- That's funny.

2442
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:07,350
This restaurant opened in 1969.

2443
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:09,920
- In 1969?
- The budaejjigae restaurant...

2444
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,820
has kept the tradition going
for 56 years.

2445
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,420
Before the meal begins,

2446
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:15,620
you'll have a mission
to win additional money...

2447
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,720
and decide on...

2448
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,390
- the order of payment.
- Okay.

2449
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,230
The mission is...

2450
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:22,360
the Lucky Vicky Expression.

2451
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,700
When one expresses the keyword
with their body,

2452
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:27,400
the partner needs to guess
correctly.

2453
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,470
You'll receive money in the order...

2454
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:30,870
- of correct answers...
- We're good at it.

2455
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:33,070
- in three minutes.
- You need quick wits.

2456
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:35,480
- You can pass 2 times.
- You can pass 2 times.

2457
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,440
The keyword
will either be an emotion...

2458
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,510
- or an object. It'll be simple.
- Good.

2459
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:40,810
An emotion or an object.

2460
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:42,280
- Something like happiness.
- Yes.

2461
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:44,620
How shall we do it?

2462
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:45,690
You need to express it.

2463
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:47,020
Shall I express it?
Will you answer then?

2464
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,020
Okay, I'll answer.

2465
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,090
I'll go out there
and express the keyword.

2466
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:51,460
- Okay.
- If it doesn't work...

2467
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:53,360
I'll answer. I'm really good at it.

2468
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:55,800
She's totally...

2469
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,130
- Empty Head.
- I can't believe that girl.

2470
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:59,330
(Graduated from Korea
National University of Arts)

2471
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:01,800
Which couple wants to go first?

2472
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,840
Let's play rock-paper-scissors
since it's important.

2473
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:03,840
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2474
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,970
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

2475
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:06,810
- It's okay.
- We'll go last.

2476
01:20:06,810 --> 01:20:07,810
That's a good idea.
If you can't do it,

2477
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:09,880
- we need to switch places.
- Okay.

2478
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,410
But I can't guess the keywords.

2479
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:13,550
I'm too lacking to do that.

2480
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,080
For goodness' sake.

2481
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,520
(She's very objective
about her abilities.)

2482
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:19,950
- Using my body...
- She's terrible. Just watch.

2483
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,760
- Jong Sook!
- She's terrible.

2484
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,330
- Express the emotions well.
- I'll express them well. Seriously.

2485
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:26,630
Get ready.

2486
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:28,400
Go slow. One word at a time.

2487
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,430
- One word at a time.
- Okay.

2488
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,060
Go as soon as you see the keyword.

2489
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,830
(Keyword: Refreshing)

2490
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:33,870
Adorable.

2491
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,870
Cute.

2492
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:38,970
- It's hard.
- Cute. Apple.

2493
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,210
Cute.
Apple.

2494
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:42,480
Refreshing.

2495
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,540
Okay.

2496
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:45,580
I'm quick-witted. Let's go.

2497
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:46,810
It was a hard one.

2498
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,350
(Keyword: Twisted donut)

2499
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,450
Twisted. Baby octopus.

2500
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:52,320
- There you go.
- Is a baby octopus eating?

2501
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,350
- What's this?
- Green onion kimchi.

2502
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:55,120
Twisted.

2503
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,420
Twisted donut.

2504
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:59,160
(The Smelly Belly Button Couple
has good teamwork.)

2505
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,460
- You're good.
- I'm quick-witted.

2506
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:01,530
This is incredible.

2507
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:02,730
(Keyword: Horror)

2508
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:03,830
(Screaming)

2509
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:05,030
- Cute.
- She loves it. How cute.

2510
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:07,230
- She's scared.
- She loves it.

2511
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:08,640
That's good.

2512
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,470
- What's this?
- She loves it.

2513
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:11,640
What do you like? How cute.

2514
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:17,680
(Refreshing versus Horror)

2515
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:21,380
(Horror isn't much different
from refreshing.)

2516
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:22,480
How cute.

2517
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:23,850
She loves it.

2518
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:25,920
- You're scared.
- She loves it.

2519
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,450
(Incredible acting skills from Korea
National University of Arts)

2520
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:29,360
- What's this?
- She loves it.

2521
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:31,020
- What's this?
- Pass.

2522
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:32,890
- Pass.
- You used...

2523
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:34,030
(She passes it in the end.)

2524
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:35,800
Gosh, this is hard.

2525
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,830
- No. You can't speak.
- No.

2526
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:39,100
- Go.
- You can't speak.

2527
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:41,470
- What's that?
- Go.

2528
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:42,800
You can't speak.

2529
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,840
What's that?

2530
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,870
(She expresses something diligently
with her hunched back.)

2531
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:49,810
(Keyword: Turkish ice cream)

2532
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:51,880
(Se Chan has gotten
the taste of Turkiye.)

2533
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:54,280
I'll catch it. I'll catch it fast.

2534
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:56,320
(Ice cream!)

2535
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,920
- Licking?
- She did a good job.

2536
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,920
- Seriously.
- She did a good job.

2537
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:01,620
Turkish ice cream!

2538
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:03,720
(They overcame a big crisis
through insane expressions.)

2539
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,820
Next.

2540
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,030
Cheering. Joy.

2541
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:10,160
- Armpit.
- Armpit.

2542
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:11,870
- Armpit.
- Armpit.

2543
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:13,330
Fresh.

2544
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:14,600
(She showed her armpits
to describe "Fresh.")

2545
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,270
- He's good.
- He's really good.

2546
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:17,340
- Well done.
- He's good.

2547
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:19,710
- It's a hard one.
- Shower.

2548
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:20,970
- Back scratcher.
- Good.

2549
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:23,910
- It was an easy one.
- I know. It was an easy one.

2550
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,780
- It was an easy one.
- They did very well.

2551
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:28,050
- We got many keywords.
- I did well, right?

2552
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:30,450
Ye Eun, we got many keywords.

2553
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,890
- I can guess from here, right?
- Yes.

2554
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:32,890
(Team Jae Seok and Ah Young
goes second.)

2555
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:34,320
- Ah Young.
- I'll use my facial expressions.

2556
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,720
- Okay.
- I can't make sounds.

2557
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:36,920
Use your facial expressions.
Just don't make sounds.

2558
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,090
- You can make gestures.
- Okay.

2559
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:39,560
- Okay, Ah Young?
- I'll watch carefully.

2560
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:40,590
Okay.

2561
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:41,800
- Okay.
- I'll watch carefully.

2562
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,730
Get ready.
You only have three minutes.

2563
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:45,130
You can pass two times.

2564
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:46,170
- Okay.
- Okay.

2565
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,200
Get ready.

2566
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,840
(Keyword: Scream)

2567
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,870
All right.

2568
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:53,210
No sounds.

2569
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:55,140
(She collapses to the floor
as soon as she begins.)

2570
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:57,380
Sadness? Despair?

2571
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:00,210
It's hard.

2572
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:01,720
- No.
- Go further.

2573
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:04,520
Wailing.

2574
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:06,890
- What's that? Hold on.
- I see.

2575
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,020
- I get it.
- Hold on.

2576
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:09,860
- It's easy.
- Hold on.

2577
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:10,860
(She described it perfectly.
What will be Jae Seok's answer?)

2578
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:12,660
"The Little Mermaid."

2579
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,160
- Pass.
- Pass?

2580
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,260
How could you not know that?

2581
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,400
- Jae Seok is strange.
- It's hard.

2582
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,430
The next one.

2583
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:22,570
Passing out.

2584
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:23,770
Isn't it passing out?

2585
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:24,940
You're sad.

2586
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:26,340
This is driving me crazy.

2587
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:28,010
- Tears fall.
- It's hard.

2588
01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:29,840
(Personification of misery)

2589
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:31,710
She's describing it perfectly.

2590
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:34,350
You're lonely.

2591
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,650
Sexy?

2592
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:38,820
Pass.

2593
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:40,790
- You've used up the passes.
- It's hard.

2594
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:42,320
- What? Cute?
- It's hard.

2595
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,590
- It's hard.
- Adorable. Cheerful.

2596
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:46,160
Cheerful. Going overboard.

2597
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:47,860
Nasty?
(Keyword: Electrifying)

2598
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:51,000
- I see. I get it.
- I get it.

2599
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,100
- Well done.
- Nasty?

2600
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:53,100
(Keyword: Electrifying)

2601
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,700
Electricity?

2602
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:57,100
- Is it similar?
- You can't mouth the words.

2603
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,470
Electrifying.

2604
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:00,770
- It's hard.
- Next.

2605
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:01,910
It's so hard.

2606
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:02,980
(Next question)

2607
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:05,310
Dong Yoon knows what to do
on a variety show.

2608
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:06,480
He's good.

2609
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,920
What? Gum?

2610
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,080
How far are you going?

2611
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,150
(Did she cook it with fire?)

2612
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:12,790
Fire?

2613
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,820
(What kind of food
is she turning over the fire?)

2614
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:16,720
Why is it so...

2615
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:20,030
DJ.

2616
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:21,660
Skewer.

2617
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:23,460
(He figures out that it's a skewer!)

2618
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:25,700
- I get it.
- I know what it is.

2619
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:27,200
- Well done.
- I know what it is.

2620
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,600
How could you not know it?

2621
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:30,140
- Jae Seok is strange.
- Ears?

2622
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:32,310
- Jae Seok is strange. Seriously.
- Ear skewer?

2623
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:34,010
- You stepped on the line.
- What?

2624
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:35,380
(The perfect description
is wasted on Jae Seok.)

2625
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,010
- "Ear skewer?"
- Ear skewer.

2626
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:38,610
- "Ear skewer?"
- You had it earlier.

2627
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:40,010
- How could you not know it?
- Did I have it earlier?

2628
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:41,510
- No.
- Hot dog.

2629
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:44,020
- Three, two...
- Hot dog. What's this?

2630
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,690
- How could you not know it?
- Okay.

2631
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:47,690
- Isn't it a lamb skewer?
- Lamb skewer.

2632
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,190
It was hard.

2633
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:50,660
- It was hard, Jae Seok.
- It was so hard.

2634
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:52,030
- All right.
- It was hard.

2635
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:53,760
Give us the easy keywords.

2636
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,500
- It was hard.
- Well done.

2637
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,600
Let's go.

2638
01:24:57,930 --> 01:24:59,330
- Get ready.
- Okay.

2639
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:03,840
(Keyword: Sparkling water)

2640
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,170
(Drinking)

2641
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:06,570
(It tickles the throat.)

2642
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:08,940
- How cute!
- No sounds.

2643
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:10,780
What?

2644
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:12,180
(She complimented him
from the bottom of his heart.)

2645
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:13,210
No sounds.

2646
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:14,950
- What is it? Soju?
- What?

2647
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:16,080
(He resumes acting.)

2648
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,520
(Keyword: Sparkling water)

2649
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,350
I know what it is. Mouthwash?

2650
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:20,390
That's right.

2651
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:21,820
- Mouthwash.
- Brushing the teeth.

2652
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:23,220
- I know.
- I hope it ends like this.

2653
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,090
- Coca-Cola.
- Yes.

2654
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:27,130
- Soft drink.
- How cute.

2655
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:30,360
(She looks at him
as if she's his mom.)

2656
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,700
Soft drink.

2657
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,230
Sparkling water.

2658
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:35,970
Well done.

2659
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,070
Sparkling water.

2660
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:38,640

2661
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,170
(Keyword: Excitement)

2662
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:41,470
No sounds.

2663
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:42,580
He's cute.

2664
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,880
- He's cute.
- Excitement?

2665
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,980
- Okay.
- No way.

2666
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:48,010
Ye Eun, being cute isn't...

2667
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:49,980
You can't make sounds.

2668
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,280
(Growling again?)

2669
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,420
Disgust?

2670
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:53,450
(Keyword: Disgust)

2671
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:54,490
Disgust?

2672
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:55,820
- Okay.
- Ji Ye Eun.

2673
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:57,120
It's correct? Okay.

2674
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,660
- Disgust?
- What?

2675
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:00,890
(Why did he look at me?)

2676
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:02,000
That was nice.

2677
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,660
- He looked at Ye Eun.
- Ji Ye Eun.

2678
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:05,470
- So accurate.
- Disgust.

2679
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:08,200
- It was an example.
- He looked at Ye Eun. So accurate.

2680
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,200
No.

2681
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,970
(She is the only one
who can't laugh.)

2682
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:12,970
This is absurd.

2683
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,870
Okay.

2684
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:17,610
What is this? He's giving signs.

2685
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:19,350
I guess they made some signs.

2686
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:21,480
(Keyword: Tambourine)

2687
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:22,550
What's that?

2688
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:25,150
- What's that?
- Don't do that.

2689
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:27,490
- You shouldn't do that.
- Karaoke. Tambourine.

2690
01:26:27,490 --> 01:26:28,560
(Tambourine)

2691
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:30,720
- Tambourine.
- Well done!

2692
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,630
- He's cute.
- This is really...

2693
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:35,090
(If they get this right,
they'll be tied for 1st place.)

2694
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,760
Okay.

2695
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:39,030
They came up with a signal.

2696
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:41,830
- Regret, dejection?
- Marriage.

2697
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:44,070
Come on. Despair?

2698
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:45,710
- Marriage.
- Nice!

2699
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:46,740
Despair?

2700
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:47,770
(They're tied with
Team Se Chan and Ye Eun.)

2701
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:48,910
- Really?
- We might lose.

2702
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:50,810
- He expresses well.
- This is interesting.

2703
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:52,350
- They have a signal.
- Hey.

2704
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:54,180
- They should do it again.
- Hold on.

2705
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:55,250
- What?
- Hold on.

2706
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:56,680
- This means emotions, right?
- Right.

2707
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,350
You made a sign.

2708
01:26:58,350 --> 01:26:59,750
- That's right.
- What?

2709
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:01,190
- Wait.
- You don't know that.

2710
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:02,790
- It doesn't mean emotions.
- So this...

2711
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:03,990
- No.
- This can't work.

2712
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:05,760
- No.
- Can't you use this for food?

2713
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,160
- It's an action.
- He doesn't know what it is.

2714
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:10,160
You know...

2715
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:11,900
(Some have many emotions.)

2716
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,670
(What should we do for emotions?)

2717
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:17,440
(It was Dong Yoon
who suggested the sly trick.)

2718
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,870
(This is for emotions.)

2719
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:21,240
(This is for food.)

2720
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:24,680
(The church brother's clever trick)

2721
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:26,010
Emotions.

2722
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:27,280
It's just an interjection.

2723
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,620
- Why?
- You can't use that.

2724
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:30,080
- We should keep going.
- No.

2725
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,320
- Everyone would get it like that.
- You're in last place.

2726
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:35,290
- This is cheating.
- This much...

2727
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:36,520
- Anyway,
- is okay.

2728
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,730
- that goes against fair play,
- Right.

2729
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:39,790
so you're disqualified.

2730
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:40,930
- Okay.
- You're disqualified.

2731
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:44,160
(They're disqualified.)

2732
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,200
Hold on.

2733
01:27:45,370 --> 01:27:46,370
- Disqualified?
- They answered so well.

2734
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:47,770
Disqualified or not,

2735
01:27:47,770 --> 01:27:49,000
- We're in second place.
- weren't we good?

2736
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,870
- You were good.
- But you can't do this.

2737
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:52,570
Did you ever tell us
we can't do this?

2738
01:27:52,570 --> 01:27:54,610
- Like giving signs in baseball.
- That's not allowed.

2739
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:55,740
- Who...
- In baseball...

2740
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:56,810
Did anyone tell us
this is not allowed?

2741
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:57,840
You have a good occasion coming up.

2742
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,210
- Don't get mad over this.
- That's right.

2743
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:00,450
Come on.

2744
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:02,150
- You have a good event coming up.
- Right.

2745
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:03,620
- Now, be quiet.
- You should have told us...

2746
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:04,820
that this wasn't allowed.

2747
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:06,390
- You have a good event.
- So...

2748
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:08,690
the team in first place
is Team Se Chan...

2749
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,620
and Ye Eun.

2750
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:13,160
This couple will receive
100 dollars.

2751
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:15,430
The team in second place...

2752
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,830
is Team Jae Seok, who won by luck.

2753
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:19,030
They will get 70 dollars.

2754
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:21,100
- Seventy dollars?
- We did so well.

2755
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:22,900
- Without emotions...
- Team Jong Kook...

2756
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:24,340
will get 50 dollars.

2757
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:26,970
- First,
- But we did well.

2758
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:29,480
- you can take the money.
- Nice.

2759
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:31,580
How will we eat?
Will you give us food?

2760
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:34,610
You can eat what you want.
We'll give you the menu.

2761
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:36,150
They have budaejjigae.

2762
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:37,180
- The assorted barbecue sounds good.
- That sounds great.

2763
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:39,890
- Assorted barbecue.
- We have to have steak.

2764
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:41,920
Let's eat enough.

2765
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,360
Do you want a T-bone steak
or LA galbi?

2766
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:44,990
The T-bone steak
would also be delicious.

2767
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:46,830
- Let's have the T-bone steak.
- We'll have the T-bone steak.

2768
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:49,000
- You'll have the T-bone steak?
- Shall we get four servings...

2769
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
for us?

2770
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,100
- Se Chan.
- That's too much.

2771
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:54,500
- But we...
- I'm sorry,

2772
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,400
but earlier, we...

2773
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,740
- Is she a gangster or what?
- What's wrong with you?

2774
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:01,570
- Earlier, we...
- We did more.

2775
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:02,980
let the incident slide.

2776
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:04,610
So don't order too much.

2777
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:06,750
You really look
like Pak Se Ri today.

2778
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:09,820
We might go bankrupt.

2779
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:12,020
- But...
- Just order a bit. Eat a bit...

2780
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:13,620
- when you're working.
- Okay.

2781
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:15,790
Don't try to eat...

2782
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:16,890
- I'm still hungry.
- everything here.

2783
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:19,830
- We'll first order budaejjigae.
- Two for each table.

2784
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:21,760
- Ramyeon noodles too.
- I'd like that.

2785
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:23,460
- That's nice.
- We should order budaejjigae.

2786
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:25,260
- Budaejjigae.
- Okay.

2787
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,770
- We can get one T-bone steak.
- That's right.

2788
01:29:27,770 --> 01:29:30,770
Then can we order
the assorted barbecue?

2789
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:33,810
He doesn't know how the world works.

2790
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:35,780
- Good. Go with that.
- It's his first time here.

2791
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:37,180
- Let him have the barbecue.
- Okay. Order it.

2792
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:38,210
- He should eat it.
- We never know what will happen.

2793
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:41,280
We'll have budaejjigae for two
and one assorted barbecue.

2794
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,480
- Hey.
- Hold on. You...

2795
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,050
- Just the assorted barbecue.
- You can either have...

2796
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:46,590
- the assorted barbecue...
- Right.

2797
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:49,720
We have to buy the lottery.
We won't skip that.

2798
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:51,390
(Today's main dish came in.)

2799
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:53,560
- Thank you.
- It looks great.

2800
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,730
- I'll turn it on.
- This looks good.

2801
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:57,660
The budaejjigae.

2802
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:00,130
- Amazing.
- This is my soul food.

2803
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,200
It looks good.

2804
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:02,500
Ramyeon noodles.

2805
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:04,700
Goodness. This...

2806
01:30:04,970 --> 01:30:06,270
Thank you for the food.

2807
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:08,270
It's been a while
since I last had budaejjigae.

2808
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:09,540
Enjoy your meal.

2809
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:11,780
It really looks good.

2810
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:14,780
(Jae Seok, the noodle lover,
is satisfied.)

2811
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:15,780
It's good.

2812
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:18,280
- It's good.
- This...

2813
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,150
It's so good with rice.

2814
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:25,290
It's so delicious.
Eating this after the hamburger...

2815
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:28,490
Ah Young is digging in.

2816
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:31,960
It's been so long
since I last had ramyeon.

2817
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:33,800
- Ah Young is on a diet.
- This is delicious.

2818
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,940
(It's cheating day
for Ah Young as well!)

2819
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,300
It's quite a lot.

2820
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:40,140
You have to boil it down.

2821
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:42,910
You can turn it off.

2822
01:30:42,910 --> 01:30:45,010
(Every day is a cheat day for her.)

2823
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:46,110
This...

2824
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,280
Thank you.

2825
01:30:48,650 --> 01:30:50,250
The assorted barbecue looks good.

2826
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,550
(He earned an assorted barbecue
platter from his girlfriend.)

2827
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:53,550
But this really looks good.

2828
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:56,360
- It has to become hot, right?
- Yes.

2829
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,520
- Goodness.
- Will "My Little Old Boy" film that?

2830
01:30:58,660 --> 01:30:59,760
Film what?

2831
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:01,930
- The wedding?
- Him going furniture shopping.

2832
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:03,700
- No. I won't do that.
- Yes, you will.

2833
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:05,460
We won't film that.

2834
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:07,700
Will you be switching to
"Same Bed, Different Dreams?"

2835
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:08,730
What?

2836
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,140
It will be on "GYM Jong Kook,"
right?

2837
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:12,810
It won't.

2838
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:14,370
- Sir.
- Why not?

2839
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:17,710
Family is family, and work is work.

2840
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:18,710
(While the word "family"
comes out of Jong Kook's mouth)

2841
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:20,280
I guess it's really barbecue.

2842
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:21,580
(While the word "family"
comes out of Jong Kook's mouth)

2843
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,350
That looks good.

2844
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:26,190
(Her boyfriend starts eating.)

2845
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:29,620
(He eats while giving off
a masculine smell.)

2846
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:30,760
It's fantastic.

2847
01:31:31,490 --> 01:31:33,930
I think this tastes better
after the hamburger.

2848
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:35,830
(This place becomes Texas.)

2849
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:37,030
This is good.

2850
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:42,740
- But...
- Hamburgers three times a day...

2851
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:45,670
Earlier... Right,
this is your third one, right?

2852
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:47,540
It's the third hamburger.

2853
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,380
This is my style.

2854
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:56,250
(The burger is full.)

2855
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,620
It was smoked.

2856
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:00,990
(They ordered many burgers
to get more lottery tickets.)

2857
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:03,460
The last lottery ticket
is the Lucky Number...

2858
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:04,690
- you saw in the beginning.
- Okay.

2859
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:06,930
We'll give you 1 lottery ticket
for every 20 dollars you spend.

2860
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:08,660
Okay. It's 6 times 2, which is 12.
We'll get 6 tickets.

2861
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:10,460
Your total bill...

2862
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:12,900
- is 225 dollars.
- What?

2863
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:16,700
The amount for the lottery ticket...

2864
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:18,770
is 25 dollars.

2865
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:20,570
- It's 25 dollars.
- It's 25 dollars.

2866
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:24,340
So the couple in first place
will go first...

2867
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:26,250
- We'll get the tickets?
- Yes. We'll do it now...

2868
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:27,250
Okay.

2869
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:29,550
I have a lot of money.

2870
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:32,350
- Shall we get two each?
- How many tickets do you have?

2871
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:33,450
I'll...

2872
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,320
- Get one.
- I'll get three.

2873
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:37,560
- That's a lot.
- Three.

2874
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:38,620
(Will he get 3 lottery tickets
at the last payment?)

2875
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:40,060
What would be better?

2876
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:41,730
Don't buy any.

2877
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:43,900
Seven, eight...

2878
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:45,600
We'll buy three each.

2879
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,230
Three.

2880
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,600
Will we split it
if we win the lottery?

2881
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,040
You're not going to promise.
Say it now.

2882
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,370
One hundred dollars? Around 6 to 4.

2883
01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:53,570
Okay. Six to four.

2884
01:32:53,910 --> 01:32:55,740
- That's why we're doing this.
- Yes.

2885
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:56,980
I'm sorry. We're late.

2886
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:58,540
- We'll go now.
- Okay.

2887
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:00,710
We'll get going.

2888
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:03,180
Ye Eun and Ah Young naturally...

2889
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:04,720
- Ye Eun and Ah Young naturally...
- Hold on, Ye Eun.

2890
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,720
- Yes?
- I have something to say to you.

2891
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:08,690
It's important.

2892
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:10,490
(Does Dong Yoon have something
to confess before the last move?)

2893
01:33:10,490 --> 01:33:12,260
He said he had something
to say to me.

2894
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:15,030
What? Really? We'll leave you then.

2895
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:18,400
I'll borrow her for a bit.

2896
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,730
- Dong Yoon.
- Yes?

2897
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:23,300
She's my woman.

2898
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:24,740
You don't have to worry.

2899
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:26,340
- This is crazy.
- You'll be in trouble.

2900
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:27,540
You don't have to worry.

2901
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:30,010
- Hey.
- Hold on.

2902
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:31,340
- Come here for a bit.
- Dong Yoon.

2903
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:32,780
Don't hurt my girlfriend.

2904
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:34,610
You don't have to worry.

2905
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:36,080
(The two men are acting,)

2906
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,750
Why are you doing this?

2907
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:38,990
(but someone is very serious.)

2908
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:41,050
What is it?

2909
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:42,990
There was something important
I had to say to you.

2910
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:44,190
What is it?

2911
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,590
How many lottery tickets
did you buy?

2912
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:49,600
(Did he bring Ye Eun here
to take advantage of her?)

2913
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,660
How many do you have?

2914
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:53,100
We have one in total.

2915
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:55,200
Goodness.

2916
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,300
(Dong Yoon and Jong Kook
only have 1 lottery ticket.)

2917
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,900
- Stop lying.
- You bought many tickets, right?

2918
01:33:59,070 --> 01:34:00,070
I have three.

2919
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:01,370
- You have three?
- Yes.

2920
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:04,380
Please give me one.

2921
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:06,750
- How much will you give me?
- Name your price.

2922
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:08,610
Should I pay a large sum?

2923
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:12,180
This was expensive.
It was 25 dollars each.

2924
01:34:13,290 --> 01:34:15,890
But it doesn't seem right
to sell it at full price.

2925
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:18,090
- The full price...
- Just give me five dollars.

2926
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:19,130
Really?

2927
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:21,190
Five dollars is...

2928
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:23,360
- Give me five dollars.
- I should pay you more.

2929
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,900
Only your tone is cold.

2930
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,900
- Testosterone girl.
- Estrogen...

2931
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:29,900
- I'll pay you 10 dollars.
- Just give me 5 dollars.

2932
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:32,340
- Take 10 dollars.
- Forget it. Just give me 5 dollars.

2933
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:35,170
Did you choose the number
on purpose?

2934
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:37,140
Yes. I chose number one.

2935
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:39,250
- I'll give you ten dollars.
- It's okay.

2936
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:40,980
- I couldn't...
- Why are you doing this?

2937
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:43,750
This was 25 dollars. Keep it.

2938
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,550
You can buy some snacks.

2939
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,090
Why are you doing this?

2940
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:50,390
It was half the price.

2941
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:52,490
They said they'd be here soon,
but they didn't.

2942
01:34:52,530 --> 01:34:53,860
- Right.
- What is this?

2943
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:56,030
Is this an event
for Jong Kook's wedding?

2944
01:34:56,030 --> 01:34:57,800
(The location is a wedding hall.)

2945
01:34:58,830 --> 01:35:00,970
Jae Seok.

2946
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:04,300
Groom Kim Jong Kook.

2947
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:06,010
- Don't do that.
- It...

2948
01:35:06,010 --> 01:35:07,640
- Will you emcee the wedding?
- Don't do it.

2949
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,540
I'm just practicing. I'll be...

2950
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:11,380
- Why are you practicing?
- After two weeks...

2951
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:12,780
You're already good.
Why are you practicing?

2952
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:14,180
I have to do it after two weeks.

2953
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:15,550
Stop it.

2954
01:35:15,550 --> 01:35:16,550
- Young In.
- Long time no see.

2955
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:17,880
Where were you, Young In?

2956
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,520
It's been a while.

2957
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:22,350
We didn't see Jong Kook today,

2958
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:24,890
but half of our conversation
is about him.

2959
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:27,130
When Jong Kook is not around,
we keep talking about him.

2960
01:35:27,190 --> 01:35:31,160
First, we said the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
members with the highest balance...

2961
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:33,300
will be given a prize.

2962
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:36,670
We'll pick 3 members,
excluding those 3,

2963
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:38,540
and proceed with the penalty.

2964
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:41,770
We'll first start
with the hamburger team...

2965
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:44,240
whose payment amount
and the prize money is lower.

2966
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,510
This team's prize money...

2967
01:35:45,510 --> 01:35:47,310
- is 300 dollars for 1st place,
- My gosh.

2968
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:49,620
- That's amazing.
- and 100 dollars for 2nd place.

2969
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:51,220
Then this team...

2970
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:52,520
- Ours must be huge.
- Their prize must be higher.

2971
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:55,050
As I told you, second place
is on either side.

2972
01:35:55,050 --> 01:35:57,020
- Please. Let's go.
- Please.

2973
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:59,560
The numbers are
1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9.

2974
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,090
- It's 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- I'll pick a number.

2975
01:36:02,230 --> 01:36:03,300
Please.

2976
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,460
You said you would do it.

2977
01:36:06,030 --> 01:36:07,500
- What number is it?
- It's out.

2978
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,930
- All right.
- Is there someone?

2979
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:10,900
- We have a first place winner.
- My gosh.

2980
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:12,070
- We do?
- Really?

2981
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:14,340
- I'm so jealous.
- That's great.

2982
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:15,810
- Who is it?
- One.

2983
01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:17,010
- First place...
- One.

2984
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:20,910
- Number four, Choi Daniel.
- Yes!

2985
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:23,850
(Number 4, Choi Daniel)

2986
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:26,190
- I'm in 2nd place.
- You won 2nd place as well.

2987
01:36:26,190 --> 01:36:27,720
- You also won 2nd place.
- Yes! I did!

2988
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:31,820
Choi Daniel gets 300 dollars
as the first-place winner...

2989
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:33,760
- and half the second-place price,
- That's amazing.

2990
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,960
which is 50 dollars.
So, it's 350 dollars in total.

2991
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,130
- It's 350 dollars.
- My gosh.

2992
01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:39,370
- He's in first place.
- My life...

2993
01:36:39,370 --> 01:36:41,300
I've turned my life around!

2994
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:42,970
- My gosh.
- All right.

2995
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:45,870
- We're next.
- We have more expensive...

2996
01:36:45,870 --> 01:36:47,570
lottery tickets and higher...

2997
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:50,310
- We don't know it yet.
- prize money.

2998
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:52,240
- Please.
- On Team Budaejjigae,

2999
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:54,810
the first-place winner
gets 500 dollars.

3000
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:55,950
- Did you say 500 dollars?
- It's 500 dollars.

3001
01:36:55,950 --> 01:36:57,250
- What about the 2nd place?
- The 2nd place...

3002
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:59,750
- gets 150 dollars.
- That's great.

3003
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:02,720
Dong Yoon's couple bought
only number five earlier.

3004
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,490
- Yes.
- But Ji Ye Eun sold her ticket...

3005
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:09,660
- to Dong Yoon for 12 dollars.
- What?

3006
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:11,330
- Let me explain.
- You.

3007
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:12,570
- She's out of her mind.
- No.

3008
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:14,330
- Hey, what are you doing?
- What's wrong with you?

3009
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:16,300
- I paid 12 dollars.
- You paid 12 dollars?

3010
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,470
You gave her 12 dollars?

3011
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:19,140
- No. Listen to me.
- Good.

3012
01:37:19,570 --> 01:37:20,670
But she...

3013
01:37:20,670 --> 01:37:22,040
It greatly increased the odds.

3014
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:24,880
- I mean, he asked me.
- If...

3015
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:27,010
no one wins, and we go broke,

3016
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:28,450
there's money left...

3017
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:29,720
- You're right.
- Yes.

3018
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,280
- Anyway,
- Wait.

3019
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,590
as long as it's not number 6 or 9,

3020
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:33,690
- we will have the winner.
- Right.

3021
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:35,290
As long as it's 6 or 9.

3022
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:37,720
- Please.
- I was going to choose number six.

3023
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:40,760
If it's number four,
it's still good for us.

3024
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:41,930
- Please.
- I don't know.

3025
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:43,960
- Number 4 is good for me.
- I like number 9 too.

3026
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:45,660
- They will get some money anyway.
- Number six is good for me.

3027
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:47,200
- They could be in 2nd place.
- Numbers 6, 4, and 5.

3028
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,200
(If my number is picked,
I'll definitely be the winner.)

3029
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,270
Numbers 6, 4, and 5.

3030
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:52,000
- Number 5 is better.
- Numbers 6, 4, and 5.

3031
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,940
Do we have the first-place winner?
I think we do. No?

3032
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:56,280
- We have a winner.
- We do.

3033
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:57,740
Who is that?

3034
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,710
- The winner is...
- It's number three.

3035
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:03,120
- Number one, Jang Dong Yoon.
- Yes!

3036
01:38:03,650 --> 01:38:05,120
- Number one, Jang Dong Yoon.
- Yes!

3037
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:07,390
(Number 1 that she sold to him)

3038
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:09,290
Dong Yoon.

3039
01:38:09,490 --> 01:38:10,760
- He's so lucky.
- That's what I gave him.

3040
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:13,390
- Dong Yoon gets 500 dollars.
- I gave it to him.

3041
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:15,930
Se Chan gets 150 dollars.

3042
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:17,160
(Dong Yoon gets 500 dollars,
and Se Chan gets 150 dollars.)

3043
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:18,330
Hey, but...

3044
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:19,800
- Hey, Ye Eun.
- Hang on.

3045
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,070
- If you didn't give him...
- You should've given it to me.

3046
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:24,140
- She's such a pushover.
- If you didn't give it to him...

3047
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:25,340
You don't need to give him that.

3048
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:27,510
- Let's give me 100 dollars.
- Jae Seok, I got...

3049
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:28,810
ripped off today.

3050
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:30,910
I can't believe this.

3051
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:32,380
Ye Eun, I think...

3052
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:33,710
you should ask him
to give you some of the money.

3053
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:36,180
Dong Yoon,
how much will you give me?

3054
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:38,880
- He's really lucky.
- It was mine.

3055
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,420
I know. She's so loyal.

3056
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:42,220
I'll make it 100, 100, and 300.

3057
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:44,590
Okay. I knew it.

3058
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:45,890
- He's too generous.
- That's good.

3059
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:47,960
- He's no joke. He's amazing.
- That's too much.

3060
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:50,130
The Spend More, Get Lucky,

3061
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:52,360
Jackpot Date Race is over now.

3062
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:54,670
I'll announce
the final amounts you have.

3063
01:38:54,730 --> 01:38:56,200
I told you...

3064
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,970
the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd winners
will get a prize.

3065
01:38:58,970 --> 01:39:00,340
I think I know the amount.

3066
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:01,640
The first-place winner is...

3067
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:03,310
- Dong Yoon?
- Is it Daniel?

3068
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:04,310
- No?
- It's Dong Yoon.

3069
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:05,840
- It's Dong Yoon.
- It's Jang Dong Yoon...

3070
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,080
with 460 dollars.

3071
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:09,980
(1st place: Jang Dong Yoon
with 460 dollars)

3072
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:11,750
- Good.
- I accept that.

3073
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:13,650
- He should've taken all the money.
- He did a good job.

3074
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:15,620
- I could've been the winner.
- He saved the money well.

3075
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:17,220
Here's the second place.

3076
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:20,430
- The amount is 391 dollars.
- Daniel.

3077
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:21,630
It's Daniel.

3078
01:39:21,630 --> 01:39:23,300
(2nd place: Daniel with 391 dollars)

3079
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:24,630
He turned his life around.

3080
01:39:24,630 --> 01:39:25,700
I did.

3081
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,800
He was broke.

3082
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:29,740
In third place...

3083
01:39:29,740 --> 01:39:31,540
- The 3rd place.
- The 3rd place is...

3084
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:33,540
For your information,

3085
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:35,840
- it changed because of Dong Yoon.
- What?

3086
01:39:36,110 --> 01:39:37,880
- That means...
- I bet it's Jong Kook.

3087
01:39:38,010 --> 01:39:39,110
- It's Jong Kook.
- The third place.

3088
01:39:39,110 --> 01:39:41,380
- I think it's Ye Eun.
- The amount is 251 dollars.

3089
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:43,520
(3rd place: 251 dollars)

3090
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:44,820
- It's Kim Jong Kook.
- Yes!

3091
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:46,350
(3rd place: Jong Kook
with 251 dollars)

3092
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:47,520
Who was it before?

3093
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,490
- It was Yang Se Chan.
- I knew it!

3094
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:52,220
It was me!

3095
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:55,190
- Listen.
- It serves you right.

3096
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:56,900
I can't believe
what's happening here.

3097
01:39:57,060 --> 01:40:00,530
The 4th place is Yang Se Chan
with 205 dollars.

3098
01:40:00,530 --> 01:40:03,240
The 5th place is Yu Jae Seok
with 185 dollars.

3099
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:05,740
The 6th place is Jee Seok Jin
with 156 dollars.

3100
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:07,140
What? How much do I have?

3101
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:08,910
The seventh place is Ye Eun.

3102
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:11,780
- I'm the last.
- The eighth place is Ah Young.

3103
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:13,580
- I see.
- The ninth place is Haha.

3104
01:40:13,710 --> 01:40:15,680
The last place has 32 dollars.

3105
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:16,720
- What did you do today?
- It's Song Ji Hyo.

3106
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:18,480
- What did they do?
- What did you do today?

3107
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,290
What's with Mapo-gu?

3108
01:40:20,290 --> 01:40:21,550
(The Mapo-gu couple
is ranked the lowest.)

3109
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:24,820
Among the members,
except for the top three,

3110
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:26,020
we will pick three people...

3111
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:27,990
- to get the penalty.
- It's the penalty.

3112
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:29,900
You can pick them if you want.

3113
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:31,000
Do you want me to pick them?

3114
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,600
- Let Dong Yoon pick them.
- Dong Yoon, you do it.

3115
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,500
- Let's do that, Dong Yoon.
- Do it, Dong Yoon.

3116
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,200
- He's got lucky hands.
- Shake them well.

3117
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:38,570
I bet he will pick Ye Eun.

3118
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,940
It will be great if he picks Ye Eun.

3119
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:42,510
- Ah Young, you should pick one.
- Let Ah Young do it.

3120
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:43,940
- What?
- Who is it?

3121
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:46,410
- Ji Ye Eun.
- I knew it.

3122
01:40:46,810 --> 01:40:48,210
(Ji Ye Eun)

3123
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:49,380
I didn't intend it.

3124
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:52,020
- Ji Ye Eun will get the penalty.
- But why...

3125
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:54,520
It serves you right!

3126
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:56,520
- Seriously...
- Dong Yoon.

3127
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,160
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't mean it, seriously.

3128
01:40:58,160 --> 01:40:59,260
- Dong Yoon is so lucky.
- Nice.

3129
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:01,390
- Why did you do a useless thing?
- Ah Young.

3130
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:03,230
- You should pick one.
- It can't be helped. Accept it.

3131
01:41:03,230 --> 01:41:05,000
- It serves you right.
- Just accept it.

3132
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,230
- Who is it?
- Ji Hyo.

3133
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:07,470
Ji Hyo? I see.

3134
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:08,600
Ji Hyo is picked.

3135
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:09,740
Ji Hyo, you should pick one.

3136
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:11,340
- Please.
- Pick Locust.

3137
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:12,540
I'm sorry, Ah Young.

3138
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:15,770
(They were so sweet
to pick each other.)

3139
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:17,110
I survived!

3140
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,410
- I can't believe this.
- It's the three women.

3141
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:22,380
Today, Song Ji Hyo,
Ji Ye Eun, and Kim Ah Young...

3142
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:23,820
- will get the penalty.
- How did the three get picked?

3143
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:26,350
- How did this happen?
- It's unbelievable.

3144
01:41:26,850 --> 01:41:28,250
The prize is...

3145
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:31,160
a watermelon, a seasonal fruit
that's sweet like a couple.

3146
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:33,290
- It looks delicious.
- The color looks great.

3147
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:34,390
It looks really good.

3148
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:37,560
Today's penalty is
making matching keychains.

3149
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:40,500
- That sounds fun.
- You will make a pair...

3150
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:43,900
of cute keychains and give
one of them to a person you want.

3151
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,840
- I'll give it to you.
- Ye Eun is so funny.

3152
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:47,170
- Ji Ye Eun.
- She will give him one.

3153
01:41:47,170 --> 01:41:48,270
It serves you right, Ye Eun.

3154
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:50,080
Except for the ones
to get the penalty,

3155
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,210
- you may go home now.
- I'll go home!

3156
01:41:51,210 --> 01:41:53,910
- Okay.
- Okay.

3157
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:55,050
Okay.

3158
01:41:55,050 --> 01:41:57,380
- Seriously...
- Thank you for your hard work.

3159
01:41:57,750 --> 01:41:59,820
(In the middle
of a forest of buildings,)

3160
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:02,120
(they get a walkie-talkie.)

3161
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:03,390
(Is someone there?)

3162
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:04,420
(Who is this?)

3163
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:06,090
(And a mysterious voice is heard.)

3164
01:42:06,090 --> 01:42:07,490
(I don't know what year it is now.)

3165
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:09,860
(It's a message from the past.)

3166
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:12,660
(A secret discovered
by following the voice)

3167
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:13,800
(There he is!)

3168
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:15,830
(What if you could change the past?)

3169
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:17,040
(What is this?)

3170
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:18,340
(Passing through a suspicious door)

3171
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:19,840
(It's from Jeon So Min.)

3172
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,510
(So Min turned back time
and returned?)

3173
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:22,640
(Why are you suddenly
talking about her?)

3174
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:25,110
(To solve the mystery,
they must escape in time.)

3175
01:42:25,110 --> 01:42:26,250
(Why are you so bad at this?)

3176
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:27,710
(What is the definition
of inflation?)

3177
01:42:27,710 --> 01:42:29,310
(People struggle because of this?)

3178
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:31,020
(Time flies.)

3179
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:32,320
(Do you hear me?)

3180
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,390
(Will they be able to escape...)

3181
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:37,020
(the panic room
within the time limit?)

3182
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:38,420
(Time Attack,
Prize and Penalty Fighter)
