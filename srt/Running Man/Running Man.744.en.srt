1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,240
(The cold spell that came
as if being jealous of spring)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,640
- Hello.
- Okay.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,310
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,950
- Nice to meet you.
- Okay.

6
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,250
There are envelopes.

7
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,620
- Envelopes.
- Jong Kook!

8
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,280
- Kim Bag.
- Jong Kook!

9
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,590
- They are not plastic bags.
- Kim Bag.

10
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,690
- That's not my thing.
- Envelopes.

11
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,920
I don't keep envelopes.

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,190
- Kim Bag.
- Mr. Kim Bag.

13
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,100
- Kim Bag is popular now.
- They're envelopes.

14
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,730
It has to be plastic bags.

15
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,200
- I did a lot of good things.
- Yes.

16
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,340
- I comforted a lot of people.
- You did.

17
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,370
- "Even Jong Kook lives like that."
- Exactly.

18
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,510
- "I'm doing just fine."
- Yes.

19
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,440
This is what people say.
"What's the point of making money?"

20
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,040
"He still lives like that.
I think I'm better off."

21
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,110
- Right.
- People were consoled.

22
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,550
- What Jong Kook did was...
- He gave people hope.

23
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,920
- quite comforting.
- It was a healing moment.

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,790
- "Even celebrities live like that."
- "There's no point..."

25
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,090
"of being a celebrity."

26
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,520
By the way, why did you smell
Jong Kook's sock?

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,790
Did you smell it?

28
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,460
- She smelled his sock.
- I was going to throw it away.

29
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,490
Why would you do that?

30
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,800
You know how you want
to smell things like that.

31
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,800
- Why? Smelling feet?
- Yes. You're curious.

32
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,370
- My goodness.
- "How would it smell?"

33
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,130
It's like how you want
to smell a dog's anus.

34
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,470
(It's like how you want
to smell a dog's anus.)

35
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,500
What?

36
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,270
(Smell what?)

37
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,510
- Smell a dog's anus?
- She means a dog's feet.

38
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,640
- She'd smell a dog's feet.
- That's right.

39
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,550
- That's what you can do.
- It's like smelling a dog's feet.

40
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,350
- That's what it is.
- The funky smell.

41
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,780
I like to smell things like that.
She's strange though.

42
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,190
- How do you do that?
- No, it's a joke.

43
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,890
- What?
- It's understandable.

44
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,220
- Right. It's understandable.
- Gosh, seriously...

45
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,030
Seok Jin, are you wearing
your wife's jacket?

46
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,230
- What's that?
- Your jacket is a little...

47
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,990
- It's too tight.
- It looks tight.

48
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,230
- Hey.
- I'm serious.

49
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,730
- You said it looked cool.
- Turn around.

50
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,930
- It looks too tight.
- You brat.

51
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,270
You look great.
You look like Pharrell.

52
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,340
I guess it looks good this way.

53
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,410
Pharrell Williams.

54
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,840
- Jeerrell.
- What?

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,440
Jeerrell instead of Pharrell.

56
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,040
(Laughing)

57
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,410
- You said it looked cool.
- Turn around.

58
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,150
- It looks too tight.
- You brat.

59
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,420
- As soon as we met earlier,
- I should wear it like this.

60
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,620
I said, "You look like Pharrell."

61
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,250
- You said I looked like Pharrell.
- But it's too tight.

62
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,350
- Is it a crop top?
- Those brats are really...

63
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,490
- Wait.
- This is a crop top.

64
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,790
- It's his wife's jacket.
- You should wear it like this.

65
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,560
How could you wear
your wife's jacket to the opening?

66
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,530
We used to wear this.

67
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,660
And you're a beggar.

68
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,930
Do you think you are dressed
like a celebrity?

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,630
You beggar, how dare you...

70
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,400
- Seok Jin.
- You're really...

71
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,340
Jong Kook even sacrificed his life.

72
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,410
- That's true.
- Right.

73
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,470
He sacrificed his life.

74
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,140
- I sacrificed everything...
- Right.

75
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,180
for Running Man.

76
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,650
- For Running Man.
- Jong Kook is very human now.

77
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,410
Right. I am.

78
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,620
Today, we will have
the 2025 Running Cup Championship.

79
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,250
- The Running Cup Championship?
- Yes.

80
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,760
First, let me introduce
a variety show player...

81
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,330
participating in the championship,
who is our family member.

82
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,790
- A variety show player?
- Who would it be?

83
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,260
It must be a veteran entertainer.

84
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,260
A variety show player?

85
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,330
To be called a player,
one should have a lot of experience.

86
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,370
- You punk.
- By the way,

87
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,740
- You...
- a player is...

88
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,140
- coming in.
- This is...

89
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,510
This is the fun...
You should go this way.

90
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,080
We bumped against each other.

91
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,440
He'll be done for after this.

92
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,050
- Kyeong Hwan.
- Hey.

93
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,310
Kyeong Hwan, you're here.

94
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,750
- It's been a while.
- He's my favorite.

95
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,620
- Yes. I just...
- Viewers don't love him so much,

96
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,650
but he's my favorite.

97
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,550
It's not that Kyeong Hwan is no fun.

98
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,090
He's just funless.

99
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,390
This is the fun of it.
What should I do today?

100
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,730
(Even his specialty that makes
people laugh elsewhere...)

101
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,930
(They stop laughing.)

102
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,800
- Kyeong Hwan of your team left?
- Where's Kyeong Hwan?

103
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,630
(He's standing right next to them.)

104
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,930
- I thought he left.
- Is he here?

105
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,540
(Strangely, his presence disappears
when he's on Running Man.)

106
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,370
Kyeong Hwan has been here
4 or 5 times.

107
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,370
- He's been here a lot.
- Were you here like six times?

108
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,310
- He came here a lot.
- I came here many times,

109
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,140
but it was vague. Today is the day.

110
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,410
- Today?
- If things don't go well today,

111
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,320
- I won't come again...
- You said the same thing last time.

112
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,120
We talk on the phone
after the shoot.

113
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,650
- Okay.
- And this is what he said.

114
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,090
"I won't go to Running Man again."

115
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,490
(Frustrated)

116
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,660
"Running Man does not suit me!"

117
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,800
"I'm funny when I'm on other shows!"

118
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,260
(He's been making
the same promise for years.)

119
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,830
On my way home,
my manager and I didn't say a word.

120
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,730
- Why?
- We kept silent.

121
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,940
- Why is that?
- He's fun only during the opening.

122
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,940
Right. Then he stays quiet
for the rest of the time.

123
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,370
- I'll be watching you.
- In an hour,

124
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,110
he'll be like this in a corner
feeling exhausted.

125
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,840
- "Let's go and have lunch."
- "Okay, Haha."

126
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,610
- He's energetic at first.
- It was really hard.

127
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,020
Kyeong Hwan, why didn't you shave
when you'd be on a major TV show?

128
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,450
- No.
- Did you not shave?

129
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,120
Don't say that.
I've been having some beard issues.

130
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
Why?

131
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,320
He was on the show
I was hosting recently.

132
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,090
- His beard was...
- Compared to the opening?

133
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,630
- His beard grew really fast.
- Really?

134
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,660
- His chin turned dark.
- Why is that?

135
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,500
- It happens when he's nervous.
- The MC is supposed to cover it up.

136
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,030
- But he reveals it.
- He should.

137
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,040
- We reveal everything.
- Right.

138
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,110
The MC even revealed my place.

139
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,910
(Holding grudges)

140
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,740
- Right?
- Your place?

141
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,380
- My goodness.
- Everything was exposed.

142
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,910
- I'm sorry.
- I'm done for.

143
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,420
- "Unanswered Questions."
- It's not so bad for me.

144
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,650
- It's no big deal.
- I'm done for.

145
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,020
Gosh, Jong Kook is so funny.

146
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,020
- Right.
- Oh, dear.

147
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,460
- Now we...
- Is Kyeong Hwan done?

148
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,720
- Yes.
- Is it over?

149
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,490
- What was that?
- Show us some more.

150
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,790
- What did you do?
- You're a variety show player.

151
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,360
The moment you cut me off when
I said, "This is the fun of it,"

152
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,730
it was over for me.

153
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,130
- It's so funny.
- Kyeong Hwan is the best.

154
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,470
Let me introduce the real athletes
for today's championship.

155
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,240
The athletes of the national team
are waiting now.

156
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,940
- Yes!
- Welcome!

157
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,210
- My goodness.
- Awesome.

158
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,310
- Nice to meet you again, Ji Won.
- My goodness.

159
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,310
- Hello.
- They're here.

160
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

161
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,850
Hello.

162
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,520
("World’s Number 1 Short Track Speed
Skater Park Ji Won Won Medals")

163
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,120
("Park Ji Won Won 2 Gold Medals
in the 9th Harbin Asian Winter Games")

164
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,090
("Jang Sung Woo Won Gold Medals
for Two Days in a Row")

165
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,730
("Jang Sung Woo Won a Gold Medal
in the Short Track 1000M")

166
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,500
(The heroes of the golden races)

167
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,500
- Hello.
- We have...

168
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,270
- Hello.
- You're so handsome.

169
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,500
- My goodness.
- They really are.

170
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,740
They have returned home in glory.
Jang Sung Woo...

171
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,240
- and Park Ji Won.
- Take a picture of us.

172
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,140
(Trying to take a picture
with the ice skating stars)

173
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,910
- My goodness.
- You guys are amazing.

174
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,950
They are the real celebrities.

175
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,650
- They really are.
- Jang Sung Woo and...

176
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,920
- Look at them.
- They're good-looking.

177
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,090
I wondered
what this combination was.

178
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,320
It was short-track speed skaters
and a shorty.

179
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,220
You're here as a shorty.

180
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,030
Why would you say...

181
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,990
such a lame thing?

182
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,460
- I wondered why they were together.
- You're right.

183
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,070
- I was like, "What is this?"
- All right.

184
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,170
We have Park Ji Won
and Jang Sung Woo here today.

185
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,900
(Jang Sung Woo, Park Ji Won)

186
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,070
- They are handsome.
- Please say hello to our viewers.

187
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,110
Hello, I'm a national short-track
speed skater, Park Ji Won.

188
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,710
Ji Won.

189
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,010
- Sung Woo.
- Hello.

190
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,650
I'm a national short-track
speed skater, Jang Sung Woo.

191
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,680
- Welcome.
- Sung Woo.

192
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,220
- He's so cute.
- He looks like Ju Hwan.

193
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,580
As you may know,
they won gold medals...

194
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,050
in the mixed relay race
and the men's 1,000m and 1,500m races...

195
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,420
- respectively. It's really...
- They won gold medals.

196
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,620
- It's hard just to win one medal.
- That's true.

197
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,660
- But they won many of them.
- My goodness.

198
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,460
- It's truly amazing.
- They're Korean athletes.

199
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,000
- I knew it.
- They must've worked hard.

200
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,600
I'm not sure if you know,
but during the Asian Games,

201
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,500
Kim Gil Li was wearing a helmet
that looked a little different.

202
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,840
- Right.
- The helmet seemed...

203
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,100
- a little different.
- Yes.

204
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,840
That's what only
the world's number one skaters get.

205
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,080
- Only they can wear it.
- Is that a thing?

206
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,840
- Park Ji Won also got one.
- The gold helmet.

207
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,480
- Yes.
- But he didn't wear it.

208
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,580
Why not?

209
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,280
It's heavier than you think.

210
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,720
- It bears an invisible weight.
- Because speed matters?

211
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,290
That's because it shows
that he's the world's number one.

212
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,790
It's the weight of number one.

213
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,960
- So...
- Is it a penalty?

214
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,990
Yes...

215
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,660
- What is a penalty?
- Penalty?

216
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,630
He's the world's number one,
so they give him something heavier.

217
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,430
It's not that it's actually heavier.

218
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,700
- That's just how you feel?
- He just feels pressure.

219
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,040
- I thought it was actually heavier.
- Hey, Bag Man.

220
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,470
- It doesn't weigh more.
- The weight...

221
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,010
- It's the weight of the crown.
- The weight of the crown.

222
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,370
- It's the psychological weight.
- Yes.

223
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,380
- You must feel that way.
- That's a lot of pressure.

224
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,680
Did you try weighing it?

225
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,580
Yes, it's exactly the same.

226
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,150
- He's persistent.
- Stop it.

227
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,950
I'm just curious.

228
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,420
- Come on.
- Don't be like that.

229
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,460
- I sacrificed my everything.
- Okay.

230
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,360
- You can't do this to me.
- All right.

231
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,190
- Let him do what he wants.
- Don't be like that.

232
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,960
Don't pick on Jong Kook for a month.

233
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,000
Right.

234
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,570
For me, the weight
of plastic bags is heavy.

235
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,870
(Bag Man has been suffering
without knowing it.)

236
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,870
- Kim Bag.
- It's hard for me.

237
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,240
The weight of bags.

238
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,980
Ji Won, you are the eldest member...

239
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,950
of the national team now, right?

240
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,080
You can say that.

241
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,250
- What?
- You're the eldest member, right?

242
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,580
How old are you?

243
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,480
- Now, I'm...
- How old is he?

244
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,320
between 28 and 30.

245
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,790
- That's it.
- I see.

246
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,660
(He was born in 1996.)

247
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,390
- That's it.
- I see.

248
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,790
That's how we say
our age these days.

249
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,630
- Between 28 and 30.
- Between 28 and 30.

250
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,500
- Is that how people say it now?
- That's nice.

251
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,730
- That's what they came up with.
- Yes.

252
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,170
When we tell our age,

253
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,300
- we state different versions of it.
- Right.

254
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,970
He and Seok Jin are 30 years apart.

255
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,270
I'm between 59 and 60.

256
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,410
- I'm half.
- Okay.

257
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,510
- He's between 59 and 60.
- He's between 59 and 60.

258
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,480
(Mr. Seok Sam is supposed to say
line number 5, exit number 9.)

259
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,850
So Ji Won is here
to join Running Man today.

260
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,050
- Nice.
- Welcome.

261
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,050
- And we have Jang Sung Woo here.
- Sung Woo.

262
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,560
- Sung Woo.
- Actually,

263
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,790
he's called the idol
of the short-track world.

264
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,660
- He's handsome.
- As you can see.

265
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,700
- Right. That's true.
- As you can see.

266
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,600
- He's good-looking.
- I was surprised when I saw him.

267
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,930
He's handsome.

268
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,800
You have a nickname, right?

269
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,070
Ji Won gave me the nickname.

270
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,440
Clean-topia.

271
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,110
- Clean-topia.
- It's clean.

272
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,310
That's funny.

273
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,240
- Because he's clean and pure.
- Yes.

274
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,450
Just looking at him
makes me feel cleansed.

275
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,080
You have such a nice skin.
Do you get a skin treatment?

276
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,880
I try.

277
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,490
He's fair-skinned.

278
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,950
He looks like Lim Ju Hwan.

279
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,120
Yes.

280
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,620
(They look exactly alike.)

281
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,060
Sung Woo was...

282
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,460
born in 2002.

283
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,230
- The World Cup.
- I see.

284
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,060
The 2002 World Cup was so much fun.

285
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,300
- That's too bad.
- Too bad.

286
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,670
- You get that a lot, right?
- It's sad.

287
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,540
They say, "It's too bad that
you didn't watch the World Cup."

288
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,200
- This is what I heard a lot.
- By the way,

289
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,510
you were conceived in 2001, right?

290
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,240
- What?
- Maybe.

291
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,440
(You were conceived in 2001, right?)

292
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,310
You scolded me earlier.

293
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,280
- Hey.
- You saw how daunted I was.

294
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,910
- It's not my fault.
- My comment didn't work out.

295
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,780
- I must say...
- You should do it right.

296
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,380
you two have the chemistry
of "My Little Old Boy."

297
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,590
- They do.
- You have good chemistry.

298
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,990
I was feeling nervous
when I said that.

299
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,990
- Is that snot?
- It's snot.

300
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,290
As you know, Jang Sung Woo...

301
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,100
won the gold medal
in the men's 1,000m.

302
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,770
- Yes.
- That's insane.

303
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,640
How long has it been
since you started skating?

304
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,200
I started when I was little.

305
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,310
- It was when I was six.
- He was only six?

306
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,710
- He's the ace.
- It's been about 17 to 18 years.

307
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,080
He's been working in one field
for 17 years.

308
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,310
He's a master.

309
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,680
Though he's still young...

310
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,720
- He's young, but his career...
- Yes.

311
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,850
Look. His thighs are this big.

312
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,490
- His thighs.
- They're this big.

313
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,090
That's why...

314
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,490
short-track speed skaters wear...

315
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,590
- wide pants.
- Right.

316
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,230
- We can't wear tight pants.
- Right.

317
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,030
I know, right? As you can see...

318
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,100
Their legs...

319
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,470
(Are his thighs this thick?)

320
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,800
This is what Sobangcha used to wear.

321
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,570
We wore pants like them
when we were little.

322
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,670
Jeong Won Kwan
used to wear pants like them.

323
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,740
I tried to look nice today.

324
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,080
That's what
Jeong Won Kwan used to wear.

325
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,350
(It's a story that Sung Woo,
who was born in 2002, doesn't know.)

326
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,210
We have Jang Sung Woo
and Park Ji Won here.

327
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,150
And Kyeong Hwan.

328
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,850
Kyeong Hwan.

329
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,090
Today's race is
the 2025 Running Cup Championship...

330
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,490
with the national skaters...

331
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,290
and the variety show players.

332
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,130
We have many sponsors
who are waiting...

333
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,930
to support you
so you can have good games.

334
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,800
Seok Sam Life Insurance
has been selected...

335
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,840
as the official sponsor
of Park Ji Won and Jang Sung Woo.

336
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,500
- Dreams!
- Dreams!

337
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,570
(Each sponsor has
a different star rating.)

338
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,940
By selecting sponsors
with the highest star ratings,

339
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,110
the team with the highest
total number of stars...

340
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,250
- wins the race.
- I see.

341
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,280
Three members with the most stars...

342
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,890
from the winning team
will receive a prize.

343
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,020
Three members with the fewest stars
from the losing team...

344
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,560
- will receive a penalty.
- Three and three.

345
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,890
I will announce the teams first.

346
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,260
- Is it already decided?
- Is it decided?

347
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,500
- Yes.
- Good.

348
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,000
- Kim Jong Kook.
- Yes.

349
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,100
- Jang Sung Woo.
- Nice!

350
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,970
- Jee Seok Jin.
- Yes!

351
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,800
Haha.

352
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,440
- It's a strong team.
- And...

353
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,640
Jee Ye Eun. This is one team.

354
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,410
- It's done.
- Including Ye Eun?

355
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,750
- Yes. And the other five.
- This is nice.

356
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,680
- They're too strong.
- We're a team.

357
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,880
Okay. Good.

358
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,280
- All right.
- Well...

359
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,590
- This is nice.
- Well...

360
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,190
- It's done!
- We're going to win!

361
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,720
- You're today's hero.
- Okay.

362
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
Forget about him.

363
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,390
No. We're on the same level.

364
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,430
- We're going to win!
- It's done.

365
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,630
It's nice.

366
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,470
All right. The two teams
will have to race today.

367
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,730
- Bring in the sponsors.
- Sponsors?

368
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
What's that?

369
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,740
- What is this?
- New World Motors.

370
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,770
Aerisu.

371
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,110
Is this it?

372
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,540
- Big Star Coffee.
- There are a lot.

373
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,910
There's Locust Boiler.

374
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,110
There's Locust Boiler.

375
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,980
What is Hair Never Dies?
What does that mean?

376
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,320
- It's about hair.
- That's for me.

377
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,180
- Hair Never Dies.
- I never die.

378
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,250
- Seok Sam Life Insurance is...
- I should pick it.

379
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,490
It feels like
it will go under early.

380
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,790
(Seok Sam Life Insurance)

381
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,960
- Hey!
- It feels like...

382
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,460
- Hey!
- It feels like...

383
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,430
- I mean...
- What are you talking about?

384
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,000
- Seok Sam Life Insurance.
- It looks so weak.

385
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,770
Among the 20 sponsors on the table,

386
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,000
- you will pick two each.
- Seok Sam Life Insurance.

387
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,940
Half of the sponsors
offer special benefits.

388
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,240
- Really?
- And the other half doesn't.

389
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,840
(Among the sponsors,
10 of them offer hidden benefits.)

390
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,180
- Okay.
- I'm nervous.

391
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,550
All right.
First, the guests will pick...

392
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,150
- two sponsors each.
- Two each.

393
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,880
- All right. Ji Won and Sung Woo.
- Okay.

394
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,520
It might be better to choose...

395
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,890
- something ambiguous.
- Something ambiguous.

396
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,490
- Right.
- It might be better.

397
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,690
- Sung Woo, you go first.
- Sung Woo will go first.

398
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,530
First, I'll choose...

399
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,690
Ddoddo Lottery with a big dream.

400
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,630
- Ddoddo Lottery.
- Ddoddo Lottery.

401
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,760
(Ddoddo Lottery)

402
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,900
To confront Sung Woo,

403
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,770
- I'll choose a bank.
- Running Bank.

404
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,470
- He's good.
- Good.

405
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,910
And I'll choose...

406
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,640
To keep Locust in check,

407
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,110
- I'll choose Locust Boiler.
- Locust Boiler.

408
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,710
- Locust Boiler.
- That's a good one.

409
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,410
I'll keep someone in check too.

410
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,710
I choose Seok Sam Life Insurance.

411
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,020
- Locust Boiler.
- How weak!

412
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,290
They took all the good ones.

413
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,860
(Ddoddo Lottery, Running Bank)

414
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,420
(Locust Boiler,
Seok Sam Life Insurance)

415
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,800
(They fight fire with fire
to keep each other in check.)

416
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,060
How weak!

417
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,630
I won't be as weak as you.

418
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,330
Kyeong Hwan is a guest, too?

419
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,570
You're a guest.

420
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,400
- Okay.
- Kyeong Hwan gets to pick.

421
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,370
- Oh, right.
- Go ahead.

422
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,610
Gold prices have gone up
a lot these days

423
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,210
So I choose Gold Electronics.

424
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,740
It's gone up a lot.

425
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,150
(Groaning)

426
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,550
That's disappointing.

427
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,280
- It definitely looks weak.
- It's weak.

428
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,880
How weak.

429
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,150
- That's not good.
- Everyone here is enemies.

430
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,420
- So I'd need an excuse.
- Okay.

431
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,520
Excuse Me.

432
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,590
I'll choose Excuse Me.

433
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,360
- Oh, no.
- Excuse Me.

434
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,460
- Excuse Me.
- That's really disappointing.

435
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,760
(He made a ridiculous choice
in a rush.)

436
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,130
Excuse Me, enemies.

437
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,530
- Okay.
- Excuse Me.

438
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,800
- Excuse Me.
- That's very disappointing.

439
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,040
(Feeling nervous)

440
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,270
Why doesn't it feel right?

441
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,610
I'll choose Goguryeo Withdrawal.

442
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,140
- I'll just pick...
- I will...

443
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,980
I want some coffee.
I choose Big Star Coffee.

444
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,110
- New World Motors.
- Two?

445
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,080
I choose Weak Friends
and Hatred Gallery.

446
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,820
- I...
- Selline.

447
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,080
choose Cheap Market
and Hair Never Dies.

448
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,720
Irresponsible Securities
sounds good.

449
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
- Side Daily News.
- Side Daily News.

450
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,290
Okay. I'll go to a corner.

451
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,220
Okay. First,

452
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,660
I'll check Side Daily News.

453
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,760
(Side Daily News)

454
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,700
(Side Daily News
chosen by Jong Kook has...)

455
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,400
(3 stars.)

456
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,570
Isn't this a good thing?

457
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,970
We can't tell you that.

458
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,070
(He can't tell if it's high or not.)

459
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,010
I'll check Irresponsible Securities.

460
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,280
(Irresponsible Securities)

461
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
(Side Daily News)

462
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,150
(They both have 3 stars.)

463
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,520
What is this envelope?

464
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,450
(What about the benefits?)

465
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,590
Is this it?

466
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,320
I'm afraid Side Daily News...

467
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,290
doesn't offer any special benefits.

468
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,130
- Penalties...
- Irresponsible Securities.

469
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,530
(Irresponsible Securities)

470
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,800
Am I unlucky?

471
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,430
I don't have any special benefits?

472
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,130
(Jong Kook didn't get any benefits
when there was a 50-percent chance.)

473
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,200
(Running Bank)

474
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,940
You can't show it to others.

475
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,510
(Ji Won's Running Bank has 4 stars.)

476
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,540
(Seok Sam Life Insurance)

477
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,440
(Seok Sam Life Insurance,
which sounds somewhat weak is...)

478
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,150
(Seok Sam Life Insurance)

479
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,720
(It has 6 stars!)

480
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,850
(It even offers a special benefit?)

481
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,190
(Ji Won got 10 stars
and a special benefit.)

482
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,560
(Seok Sam, who has no luck, is...)

483
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,730
What is this?

484
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,600
(Selline)

485
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,470
(It's not like him
to receive a benefit!)

486
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,300
A chance to be
an inspiration to others.

487
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,640
Selline will provide you
with trendy clothes to wear.

488
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,210
Be rid
of the usual team sweatshirt...

489
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,140
and always wear these clothes.

490
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,350
Did you wear your wife's today?

491
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,680
You're to get rid of it.

492
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,750
(G-rel is now
the ambassador for Selline.)

493
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,450
It's all right.

494
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,520
(Ji Hyo and Jae Seok
equally get 6 stars.)

495
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
(Excuse Me, Gold Electronics)

496
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,050
(Only 4 stars!
Kyeong Hwan is unlucky twice over.)

497
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,420
Shoot.

498
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,790
Hold on a second. This...

499
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,920
(The unlucky ones who lack stars)

500
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,330
This is nice.

501
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,790
(Sung Woo and Se Chan are
among those with a lot of stars.)

502
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,230
Did you pick something valuable?

503
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,560
- I'm always unlucky.
- Okay.

504
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,500
- Are you off to an event?
- Who are you cheering for?

505
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,340
- Stop it.
- Seok Jin's going to an event.

506
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,200
Are you kidding me?

507
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,240
You should sing a song.

508
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,540
- Are you releasing a trot song?
- Seriously?

509
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,580
What's going on?

510
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,340
- He must be releasing a trot song.
- Isn't it obvious?

511
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,580
- He's releasing a trot song.
- Have you been in my position?

512
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,410
It's like he's putting together
a new segment.

513
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,280
Introducing Selline's
spring and summer collection.

514
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,690
This looks like what you'd wear
for a penalty. Right?

515
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,260
Why did I have to choose this one?

516
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,160
(Selline: You can only take it off
after swapping sponsors.)

517
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,260
You've got to be kidding me.

518
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,030
- The world...
- He's an old man.

519
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,290
This must be your sponsor.

520
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,330
- Right.
- Yes, his sponsor.

521
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,560
His sponsor is Selline, not Celine.

522
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,430
- Are you kidding me?
- Selline.

523
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,340
Let me know if you want
to be funny today.

524
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,400
Who wants to be funny?

525
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,970
I'm sorry, but were you the captain
of the Asian Games cheering squad?

526
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,340
I wasn't.

527
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,180
Some say I look like
the cheering squad captain while...

528
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,350
- Anyway...
- Hey.

529
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,910
What's that?

530
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,280
- What?
- You look like a cartoon character.

531
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,150
Why do you keep wearing your wife's?

532
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,390
Are you worried
about the loss of hair?

533
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,650
(Hair Never Dies: Wig can only be
taken off after swapping sponsors.)

534
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,160
Hair Never Dies
will place confidence in you.

535
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,560
(His benefit is like a penalty too.)

536
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,700
My sponsor is Hair Never Dies.

537
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,300
- Hair Never Dies?
- Right.

538
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,930
- It never dies.
- It shows up top.

539
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,040
Hair Never Dies.

540
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,240
- That's a lot of hair.
- It sure is.

541
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,040
- You're lucky to have that.
- You're lucky.

542
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,210
- They come with a few things.
- Right.

543
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,710
Hold on a second.

544
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,780
I'd like a cup of coffee.

545
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,820
- Coffee?
- Yes.

546
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,180
(Hold on a second.
I'd like a cup of coffee.)

547
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,320
(He suddenly orders coffee.)

548
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,690
- Out of the blue?
- What's going on?

549
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,750
- What...
- I'd like a cup of coffee.

550
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,120
It's his sponsor!

551
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,790
- There's a benefit.
- Iced Americano, please.

552
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,560
- Big Star Coffee.
- Big Star Coffee.

553
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,090
- Just for me.
- I see.

554
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,160
- Big Star Coffee?
- I'm thirsty.

555
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,100
- That must be your benefit.
- Right.

556
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,400
You can order coffee
whenever you want.

557
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,100
- Exactly.
- He can have it.

558
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,530
- That's his sponsor.
- Okay.

559
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,670
(Iced Americano is delivered.)

560
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,670
Goodness.

561
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,070
No way.

562
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,140
(For the first time,
he wins an actual benefit.)

563
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,510
This is nice.

564
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,840
Especially when I'm thirsty.

565
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,880
This is great.

566
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,550
- No way.
- I can have another.

567
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,450
Gosh, I'm thirsty.

568
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,880
- Weak Friends.
- What...

569
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,250
- This doesn't need revision.
- Can't you order one for me too?

570
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,960
- What?
- I'll pay you back with this.

571
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,660
- What's that? What's Weak Friends?
- Weak Friends.

572
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,230
It lets you go from weak to strong.

573
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,860
- Really? Are we teaming up then?
- You can't tell others.

574
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,860
(Intrigued)

575
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,230
Sorry about this,

576
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,370
but please get Se Chan
a cup of coffee.

577
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,500
- Get him a cup.
- Thanks, Seok Jin.

578
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,400
- Go ahead. It's all right.
- I'll pay you back with this.

579
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,770
I have Weak Friends,
so protect the weak later on.

580
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,870
- Sure.
- Weak Friends.

581
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,540
Se Chan, you wanted some.
Here you go.

582
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,040
- Thanks, Seok Jin.
- Sure.

583
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,550
- No way.
- Goodness.

584
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:05,420
I can easily share coffee,
so just say the word.

585
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,080
It must be good.

586
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,790
I think it'll be bad to drink it.

587
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,390
- That won't be the case.
- There will be a downside.

588
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,190
Here's the first game you'll play.

589
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,530
- It's the King of Sweet Words.
- What's that?

590
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,900
You will choose a number
between 1 and 100.

591
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,430
After seeing the question,

592
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,900
you will come up with an answer...

593
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,170
that will be liked
by the number of people...

594
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,430
equal to the number you chose.

595
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,600
For instance, say the question is...

596
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,740
"What do you say to a lover
after an argument..."

597
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,640
- "when you're in the wrong?"
- Three things.

598
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,770
If you chose the number 100,

599
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,380
you'd write down something like...

600
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,140
"Sorry, I won't do it again."

601
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,780
But if your number is three,

602
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,480
you'd write down,

603
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,080
"As if you've never wronged me too."

604
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,220
You will discuss
after seeing each other's answers...

605
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,590
and guess the order
of the number you chose...

606
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,360
- from high to low.
- I get it.

607
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,790
If you guess correctly
how high you ranked,

608
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,290
you will win a point.

609
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,100
The team with the highest points
at the end will win.

610
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,030
After every mission,
the winning team...

611
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,070
will get one additional sponsor...

612
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,270
and then swap sponsors
with the opposing team.

613
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,300
- Can we get one from them?
- That's what you'll win.

614
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,340
Here are the first people
to compete.

615
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,340
From Team Jae Seok,
it'll be Jae Seok,

616
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,540
Ji Won, and Ji Hyo.

617
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,550
- The three of us?
- Nice.

618
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,150
From Team Jong Kook,

619
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,350
- it'll be Jong Kook,
- Sure.

620
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,020
Seok Jin, and Ye Eun.

621
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,150
- All right!
- I didn't get it.

622
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,220
- Okay!
- Go, team.

623
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,920
- All right.
- Let's go.

624
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,220
Come and choose a number.

625
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,220
- All of us?
- Just the six of you.

626
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,630
- Just the six.
- Good. It'll be just us.

627
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,060
- Don't share the number.
- Keep the number to yourself.

628
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,600
- It's for our eyes only.
- Don't even tell your teammates.

629
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,200
- Is that so?
- An easier number will do.

630
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
- Right.
- Exactly.

631
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,470
Let it be anything.

632
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,700
This will be tough.

633
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,240
Wouldn't a random number be better?

634
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,510
Is this my number? Okay.

635
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,210
At the camera?

636
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,750
- Can it be any camera?
- This is my number.

637
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,380
Here's the first question.

638
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,790
- Sure.
- Got it.

639
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,550
(What would you say to a lover
you caught stealing from your house?)

640
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,690
Who would do such a thing?

641
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,360
How does that make sense?

642
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,860
Why would you steal
from a boyfriend or girlfriend?

643
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,090
Why would anyone steal?

644
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,800
- It's like this.
- Who did the stealing?

645
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Did you get caught?

646
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,700
Is this based
on Se Chan's real life?

647
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,530
(Honey, what are you up to?)

648
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,000
(The start writing down
their answers.)

649
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,840
What would you steal
from someone's home?

650
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,170
A lover's home.

651
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,640
- You'd deeply apologize.
- This is a tough one.

652
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,810
You'd deeply apologize
if you need 100 people to relate.

653
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,680
- "I won't do it again."
- If it's just one person...

654
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,720
It'll be, "What are you looking at?"

655
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,920
- So what?
- Exactly.

656
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,490
I'm done.
There's no need to contemplate.

657
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,690
If you're done,
tell us yours one by one.

658
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,220
- Sure.
- Ji Hyo first.

659
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,090
(Ji Hyo picked number 80.)

660
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,590
I thought it'd be a hassle
for you to throw out,

661
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,060
so I was doing it for you.

662
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,600
I thought it'd be a hassle
for you to throw out,

663
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,200
so I was doing it for you.

664
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,070
- Let's see.
- That's a good one.

665
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,700
I bet she has a high number.

666
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,840
Ji Won?

667
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,570
It looked nice.

668
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,040
- He's being honest.
- It looked nice.

669
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,410
He's not holding back.

670
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,750
Saying that it looked nice
is the same as admitting it.

671
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,250
Here. I'm so sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

672
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,580
He must have a high number.

673
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,620
I'm so sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

674
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,890
He must have a high number.

675
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:57,950
He probably got 100.

676
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,060
- He got a high number.
- A high one.

677
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,460
Aren't you aiming for 100
on that one?

678
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,790
- Honesty is the best policy.
- It's better to be honest.

679
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,700
- Right.
- So I got caught grabbing it.

680
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,330
Gosh, this is pretty.
Where did you get it?

681
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,370
I honestly would say that.

682
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,610
As soon as I get caught,
I'll ask her where she got it.

683
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,240
- He got a low number.
- This happened in real life.

684
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,010
Right. You'll try to be charming.

685
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,380
- Here.
- As for me, I'll say this.

686
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,750
What? Why? What's wrong?

687
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,050
What? Why? What's wrong?

688
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,790
That's scary.

689
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,560
(Being disrespectful
which is what you'd expect for a 7)

690
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,930
- Look how bold he is.
- He must have a low number.

691
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,590
- This means his number...
- What?

692
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,630
- He has a low number.
- His number is low.

693
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,530
What would he steal
other than plastic bags?

694
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,840
- What? Why? What's wrong?
- Plastic bags?

695
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,240
- What else?
- Plastic bags.

696
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,140
He wouldn't steal luxury items.

697
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,640
I'd get caught
stealing toothpaste or something.

698
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,480
What? Why?

699
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,240
(The worst he'd do
is steal necessities.)

700
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,810
- How adorable.
- Ye Eun?

701
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,110
- Me?
- What would you say?

702
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,520
Isn't this mine?

703
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,020
- That's hard to determine.
- Isn't this mine?

704
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,150
- Isn't this mine?
- That...

705
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,550
That's vague.

706
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,890
- They all seem like low numbers.
- Around 20.

707
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,930
I think you picked a high number.

708
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,130
- Right?
- It's relatable.

709
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,400
- "I'm sorry" seals the deal.
- That says it all.

710
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,930
We can have him
ranked at number one.

711
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,530
Jong Kook picked
a really low number.

712
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,370
- That's right.
- His number is really low.

713
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,870
- Your number is low.
- Of course.

714
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,070
- It's low.
- It's low.

715
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,540
My number is low.

716
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,710
Jong Kook is around here.

717
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,840
Let's see.

718
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,380
This should be up here.

719
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,480
(They guess Ji Hyo who picked 80
is ranked 2nd.)

720
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,420
I think Ye Eun picked a high number.

721
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,690
- Don't you agree?
- That was a brazen answer.

722
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,090
- It was brazen.
- It's not that.

723
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,190
She was pretending to be confused.

724
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,090
I would rank at least second.

725
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,090
- Right?
- Come on. Isn't this mine?

726
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,560
- Don't be ridiculous.
- It's too shameless.

727
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,930
- But that way...
- No way.

728
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,470
What's your number?

729
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,170
This seems to be about right.

730
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,230
Ji Won, what's yours?

731
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,770
I'll use one for Hatred Gallery.

732
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,640
- What's that?
- What is it?

733
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,010
Come here.

734
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,110
- Why me?
- This is from the gallery.

735
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,550
(Hatred Gallery:
I'm afraid Hatred Gallery...)

736
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,780
(doesn't offer
any special benefits.)

737
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,880
(He drew a beard for no reason.)

738
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,980
- Is this the actual benefit?
- I used one of them.

739
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,990
(He lies without blinking an eye.)

740
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,460
- I bet you're lying.
- What do you mean?

741
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,660
- He drew that for no reason.
- Get over here.

742
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,720
What is it?

743
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,390
(Haha caught on.)

744
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,960
- What is it?
- He...

745
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,500
- I can't believe him.
- What's going on?

746
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,670
- What did he say?
- Get over here.

747
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,470
Why you...

748
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,140
I can't believe you.

749
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,770
Are you kidding me?

750
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,640
(The offender's signature beard
was drawn.)

751
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,280
- Why don't I...
- Like this?

752
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,480
- We'll go like this.
- I prefer this.

753
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,550
- You have Jae Seok ranked up top.
- That's right.

754
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,950
Jae Seok...

755
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,190
I think he has the highest number.

756
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,320
- Jae Seok had 92.
- Okay, 92.

757
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,220
- It was 92.
- That's a high number.

758
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,360
You have Ji Hyo ranked second.

759
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,700
Ji Hyo...

760
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,560
- had 80.
- Really?

761
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,100
This isn't bad.

762
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,330
- Her number was high.
- That sounds about right.

763
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,940
You had Seok Jin ranked third.

764
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,370
Seok Jin...

765
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,510
- had 27.
- See?

766
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,240
- It's low.
- Hold on. Twenty-seven?

767
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,680
- That's a low number.
- Isn't that a low number?

768
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,710
Is that a low number?

769
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,350
Ji Won...

770
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,050
- Ji Won...
- Others could have a low number.

771
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,550
- It's 1 to 100.
- Of course.

772
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,790
- Ji Won had 20.
- Yes!

773
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,090
(Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, Seok Jin,
Ji Won, Ye Eun, Jong Kook)

774
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,760
- Nice.
- How did our team do?

775
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,360
- Looking good.
- And Ye Eun...

776
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,590
(They'll get a perfect score
if Ye Eun had over 8.)

777
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,000
- Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun had 11.

778
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,200
Meanwhile, Jong Kook had seven.

779
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,330
- We all got it right.
- It's a perfect score.

780
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,940
Both teams get three points each.

781
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,700
- I didn't know that was doable.
- See?

782
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,740
I had no idea.

783
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,870
Jae Seok, we did great.

784
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,310
- Right?
- Yes, we did great.

785
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,740
- Round Two.
- Okay.

786
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,480
The two who didn't get to play...

787
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,450
- Ji Won will play again.
- Sure thing.

788
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,750
- Ji Won, come here.
- As for our team,

789
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,180
(Team Jae Seok:
Se Chan, Kyeong Hwan, Ji Won)

790
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,850
- We need to choose our numbers.
- Right.

791
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,320
- Those who didn't play.
- As for our team,

792
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,220
it'll be those two and Ye Eun.

793
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,420
- Maybe I shouldn't.
- Sure.

794
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,560
- Who then?
- Me?

795
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,620
- Go ahead.
- I'll sit this one out.

796
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,790
- Let it be either low or high.
- They're pretty much the same.

797
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,130
Either low or high.

798
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,330
- Can I show you my number?
- This is a good one.

799
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,530
- This is insane.
- This won't be easy.

800
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,700
What should I do this time?

801
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,170
- Here's the question.
- Mine's so easy.

802
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,240
No, wait. Excuse me.

803
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,140
(Excuse Me benefit:
Send 1 person on errands.)

804
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,040
- Jong Kook. Get me water.
- Excuse me. Can I order?

805
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,080
Be quiet.

806
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,910
(Excuse Me benefit:
Send 1 person on errands.)

807
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,420
Excuse me. Get me water.

808
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,280
(Errand refused)

809
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,690
Excuse me.

810
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,190
- No, thanks.
- He used "Excuse Me."

811
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,890
Excuse me.

812
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,090
- No.
- It's invalid.

813
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,790
What do I do if they don't listen?

814
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,590
You must make them listen.

815
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,200
- Excuse me.
- What?

816
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,300
I picked the wrong person.

817
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,670
I can't change the target.

818
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,800
- Ask again.
- You want some water?

819
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,300
- Yes. Get me one quick.
- Goodness.

820
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,270
- Speed up, please.
- Must I do this?

821
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,910
This sponsor moves fast.

822
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,880
- Okay.
- Thanks.

823
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,580
Don't turn your back to the cameras.

824
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,780
(Sputtering)

825
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,320
(Delivered to the throat)

826
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,220
Excuse me!

827
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,660
- Excuse me.
- Do you have to keep saying that?

828
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,230
- Who are you?
- That "Excuse me..."

829
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,800
- "Excuse me..."
- I won't bother him again.

830
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,260
You chose a nice sponsor.

831
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,270
Here's the question.

832
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,600
(Before a kiss, what comment
gives the other person butterflies?)

833
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,900
- This is a hard one.
- I...

834
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,370
I give them butterflies?

835
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,910
Do I have feelings for you?

836
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,680
Stay by my side.

837
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,980
(Comments before they shoot a kiss)

838
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,250
(Their answer must be as ticklish
as the number they picked.)

839
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,620
Something tantalizing.

840
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,980
Do you need to talk?

841
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,990
Ye Eun has never dated before.

842
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,190
(Haha writes something right away.)

843
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,060
- What do I do?
- Something enticing.

844
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,520
- Enticing?
- She doesn't know.

845
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,430
- This is hard.
- Think of the number you chose.

846
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,060
Kyeong Hwan's famous line.
"Do you want to know?"

847
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,260
- "Then give me 50 cents."
- No, it's something else.

848
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,170
- I should write something cheap.
- Shall we get to it?

849
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,270
- Sung Woo, are you done?
- Yes.

850
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,670
- We'll start with Ye Eun.
- She's busy writing.

851
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,970
- Focus on the nuance.
- Let's have a look.

852
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,810
- Let's just...
- "I'd like a drink."

853
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,210
"On your lips."

854
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,880
(I'd like a drink on your lips.)

855
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,980
(Childish wordplay)

856
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,050
That's not bad. I'll rank high up.

857
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,690
- She chose a big number.
- That's above average.

858
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,120
- This ranks high up?
- This is high up?

859
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,190
- That ranks high?
- This is high up?

860
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,990
- This is high up?
- People say that?

861
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,430
- People say this?
- Who says this?

862
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,660
This gives you butterflies?

863
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,230
That might not give you butterflies,
but with an answer like that,

864
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,000
we can guess the ranking
depending on what these two say.

865
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,700
- How high you'll rank.
- Really?

866
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,170
- Really?
- Sung Woo.

867
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,400
I'll look at her dreamily and say,

868
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,670
"Did you put on lip balm?"

869
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,710
(Sung Woo's comment was sweet.)

870
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,410
- That will rank high.
- That'll be pretty high up.

871
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,910
- That'll rank high.
- Haha.

872
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,280
- I wrote...
- Isn't it easy?

873
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,880
"Mi Ran."

874
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,480
- "It's Se Chan."
- What did he say?

875
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,250
- He's at it again.
- "It's Se Chan."

876
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,390
My gosh.

877
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,260
(On Episode 611 3 years ago,
during the AI text-reading game)

878
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,290
(Mi Ran. It's Se Chan.)

879
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:47,000
(Do I have feelings for you?)

880
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:52,240
(Haha had great fun
setting the two up.)

881
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,170
(He summoned Mi Ran for no reason.)

882
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,710
What's wrong with him?

883
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:01,780
"I want you like crazy. I love you."

884
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,110
- He ranks way down.
- What was that?

885
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,350
I bet he picked five or something.

886
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,780
No, that'll be a high number.

887
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,850
What got into him?

888
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,090
- It'll be low.
- That's decent compared to them.

889
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,790
Why did you summon Mi Ran?

890
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,890
Let's see what Ji Won wrote.

891
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,590
I'll end it in just three words.

892
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,060
(A clean, head-on approach)

893
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,960
- That's high.
- That's high.

894
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,170
- That's high.
- It'll be number one.

895
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,900
- That's almost 100.
- It's 100.

896
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,000
It's 100.

897
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,600
- Let's see Kyeong Hwan's answer.
- It should be about love.

898
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,210
Kyeong Hwan's is the worst.

899
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,470
No, it's not.

900
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:36,110
"My tongue's going in."

901
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,620
- Darn it!
- My gosh.

902
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,520
(Yuck)

903
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,690
- That's the worst.
- That's so vulgar.

904
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,160
(Staff squealing)

905
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:49,130
(His answer
even disgusted the crew.)

906
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,860
- Kisses...
- That's the worst.

907
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,400
- They're not all like that.
- He's the lowest.

908
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,600
- Isn't that a one-vote answer?
- I picked one.

909
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,070
(A dreadful gesture)

910
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,200
- Hey.
- That's a minus.

911
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,310
- That's a minus number.
- Come on.

912
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,710
(Here comes a tongue.)

913
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,280
(Not even Song Kang
can make it work.)

914
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,310
- Come on.
- Go with lips.

915
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,080
- Then...
- We're a PG15 show!

916
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,050
How can my lips go into her mouth?

917
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,290
- They can.
- But...

918
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,250
"My tongue, it's coming."

919
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,690
- Gosh.
- That's one vote.

920
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,390
- That answer...
- It ranks low.

921
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,390
- It'll be down the list.
- Ssaebssaeb.

922
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,300
- Ssaebssaeb's next.
- Ssaebssaeb.

923
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,300
Mine blows too.

924
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,300
- You're both insane, right?
- His is low too.

925
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,870
"I'm the Messi of kisses."

926
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,540
"Can I dribble with my tongue?"

927
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,910
(I'm the Messi of kisses.
Can I dribble with my tongue?)

928
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,410
(Another tongue attack)

929
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,780
- That's 0.5 votes.
- My gosh.

930
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,280
- That's the worst.
- That's the worst.

931
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,050
- That's gross.
- Hey.

932
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,380
I can't stand it.

933
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,390
That's how low his answer will rank.

934
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,790
- Whose is worse?
- I'm jealous.

935
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,390
- They all got a low number.
- Whose will rank lower?

936
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,620
- Hey.
- It's the same skill.

937
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,860
Only the comedians
mentioned their tongues.

938
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,130
- Only those two...
- My gosh.

939
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,400
It was a tongue-stabber.

940
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
- That's what tongues do.
- That's right.

941
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,400
- Trust me with this.
- Okay.

942
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,340
- Are you feeling it?
- Trust me.

943
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,270
- Do you feel it?
- Who will rank them?

944
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,740
- The ranking...
- Go and discuss.

945
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,710
(Rank 1, Haha:
I want you like crazy. I love you.)

946
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,710
That's number one?

947
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,050
- Number four?
- Don't worry.

948
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,950
- You'll really put that on top?
- Four?

949
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,050
Don't worry.

950
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,120
- You'll really put that on top?
- Yes.

951
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,390
(One by one, they rank the answers.)

952
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,120
- I think this is it.
- You decided?

953
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,190
- I think three...
- I think it goes here. No?

954
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,600
(This ranks 4th?)

955
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,700
Kyeong Hwan thinks
this ranks fourth.

956
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,970
- What...
- What? That's nonsense.

957
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,540
Isn't Kyeong Hwan's comment
at the bottom of the list?

958
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,510
Like I said,
some people will like it.

959
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,110
- This is...
- Shall we put that third?

960
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,310
- Here?
- Are you okay with it?

961
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,140
- Here...
- I think it's higher up.

962
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,410
- No.
- Shouldn't we...

963
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,680
- switch these?
- I'm positive.

964
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,720
- You're positive?
- You're positive?

965
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,650
- Ye Eun!
- Move that higher up.

966
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,590
That's not right.
It should be higher.

967
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,520
Who'd say
they're inserting their tongue?

968
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,890
How could this rank fourth?

969
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,860
- Come on.
- Yours should be fourth.

970
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,890
I think you can be
more confident. No?

971
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,600
Swap Ye Eun and Kyeong Hwan.

972
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,900
Kyeong Hwan said no.

973
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,130
- Yes, swap them.
- But...

974
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,330
- I don't think this works.
- Are you confident?

975
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:14,540
- "I'd like a drink on your lips."
- It has to be that.

976
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,010
- Ye Eun's comment is better.
- Ye Eun's should be higher up.

977
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,410
- Yes.
- Kyeong Hwan's funny and confusing.

978
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,280
- You made it ridiculous.
- Why did you write something silly?

979
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,480
Why did you add humor
when you lack skill?

980
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,180
Okay, fine.

981
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,650
He was too focused on comedy.

982
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:30,690
- I said "I love you" at the end.
- We chose well.

983
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,950
- "I love you."
- Let's see the results.

984
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,890
- What's the number?
- I can't tell.

985
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,390
- What number was Haha?
- Maybe...

986
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:38,030
- I said "I love you."
- Yes.

987
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,230
I got 100.

988
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,760
(The highest number appeared.)

989
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,070
- Then that's right.
- Aren't you grateful?

990
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,770
- You picked 100?
- Yes, 100.

991
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,400
- One hundred?
- Who's next?

992
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,170
- I got 85.
- Ji Won.

993
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,410
- What?
- Eighty-five.

994
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,770
- That's a good number.
- Got it.

995
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,140
- Eighty-five.
- That's pretty high.

996
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,780
- That's a high number.
- We're getting there.

997
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,010
- Sung Woo.
- I got 76.

998
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,950
- They're right.
- They got it.

999
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,250
(Rank 1 Haha,
Rank 2 Ji Won, Rank 3 Sung Woo)

1000
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,320
- This is important.
- It's Ye Eun and Kyeong Hwan.

1001
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,320
- Ye Eun.
- This is dangerous.

1002
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,520
Were you trying to be funny,
Kyeong Hwan?

1003
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,860
No, I really thought...

1004
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,130
- "The tongue's coming in..."
- I know, right?

1005
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:14,160
- This is...
- It's too crass.

1006
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,300
(Ddochi criticizes him.)

1007
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,770
"It's too crass."

1008
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,500
- I think...
- It's true.

1009
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,710
Isn't that something
that floats about online?

1010
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,510
- That's why it's better.
- That's why... Yes.

1011
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,110
- Ye Eun, what's your number?
- I got 23.

1012
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,280
- Kyeong Hwan.
- I got 23.

1013
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,880
- That's not too bad.
- No.

1014
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,450
(They succeed
if Kyeong Hwan's below 22.)

1015
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,650
I got 23.

1016
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,720
- No.
- Kyeong Hwan.

1017
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,920
I said no. I got 54.

1018
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,990
- What on earth was that?
- Hey!

1019
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,890
(Heo Kyeong Hwan 54)

1020
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,460
- Hey!
- Was that worth 54 votes?

1021
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,700
- How is this worth 54 votes?
- My gosh.

1022
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Who would say...

1023
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,500
- Fifty-four votes...
- This many people would like this?

1024
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,640
- It's half and half.
- Oh, no...

1025
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,440
If you're this close to me
face-to-face, it would work...

1026
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,940
Kyeong Hwan. Tongues and stuff
are for answers below ten.

1027
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,480
- Yes.
- It was for me, not you with 54.

1028
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,750
- A tongue's worth below ten.
- The tongue was too...

1029
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,680
- That was my answer...
- Using tongue...

1030
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,120
Fine. I'm sorry.

1031
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,420
You're Tongue Kyeong Hwan now.

1032
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,890
- That's...
- "Tongue Kyeong Hwan?"

1033
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,160
- That's gross.
- You're Tongue Kyeong Hwan now.

1034
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,190
Okay.

1035
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,690
- If Kyeong Hwan and Ye Eun swapped,
- Kyeong Hwan ruined it.

1036
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,730
- it would've worked.
- Yes.

1037
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,100
- It's okay.
- Both teams scores...

1038
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,170
are even now,
so we'll play one more round.

1039
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,830
All ten of you will participate.

1040
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,100
- Okay.
- Then we'll rank the answers.

1041
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:30,370
"You're a turd.
You dirty piece of dog poop."

1042
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,510
"I don't want to look."

1043
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,440
- Why do you keep saying...
- Don't talk like that.

1044
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,080
Team Jae Seok won.

1045
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,050
- Okay.
- That's fine.

1046
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,020
The winning team
gets one more sponsor.

1047
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,690
Among the 5 envelopes, 4 are duds,

1048
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,920
- and only one contains a sponsor.
- Really?

1049
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,290
Okay. Pick a dud.

1050
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,630
I hope you go down.

1051
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,330
I'll take this one.

1052
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,360
(Keeping a straight face
after checking)

1053
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,030
Gosh, I'm so unlucky.

1054
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,730
(First off, Jae Seok, Se Chan,
and Ji Hyo are out.)

1055
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,970
Let's do five now.

1056
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,070
It's a dud.

1057
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,970
- Kyeong Hwan got one.
- He did!

1058
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,870
- I can tell by his face.
- He got it.

1059
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,680
I got it.

1060
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,340
- Where Didas.
- Where Didas.

1061
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,480
(Ji Won gets a new sponsor!)

1062
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,350
- Oh, Where Didas.
- I just took the last envelope.

1063
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,620
Then we get a few more stars, right?

1064
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,880
- That's right.
- Hey, we have the advantage.

1065
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,520
And Team Jae Seok...

1066
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,890
can exchange a sponsor
with the losing team.

1067
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,990
You can exchange
with whoever you want.

1068
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,030
- Okay.
- Gosh, our team...

1069
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,190
Seok Jin has a good one now.

1070
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,330
- Right.
- He's living it up now.

1071
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,800
- Then, I'll switch.
- What?

1072
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,470
- What? I don't have...
- I'll switch with Big Star Coffee.

1073
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,730
You really must not have anything.

1074
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,740
Shall we have some coffee?

1075
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,000
Yes, Jae Seok. Let's have coffee.

1076
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,440
- All right. Let's have coffee.
- But why would you have coffee...

1077
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,070
- How about this one?
- No.

1078
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,680
- This one. Selline.
- No.

1079
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,240
All right. Then, Jae Seok has...

1080
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,280
Do we get to switch too?
Or is it just one of us?

1081
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,350
Just one.

1082
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,480
(Only one person on the team
can switch.)

1083
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,750
But then why...

1084
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,280
- Hang on. Jae Seok.
- What?

1085
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,550
Why do you get to switch?

1086
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,690
- He did what?
- Wait.

1087
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,220
- We didn't even discuss it.
- This is what I did.

1088
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,660
I didn't have many stars.

1089
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,290
Okay, got it.

1090
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,790
- I don't have many either.
- So, that was why...

1091
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,960
You should give me a boost next.

1092
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,830
Then, we'll move
to the next location...

1093
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,470
and do a mission
with a lunch sponsor on the line.

1094
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,300
- Okay!
- Sounds good.

1095
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,310
All right. Let's go.

1096
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,440
- I can't believe this.
- What?

1097
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,180
Gosh, "My tongue's going in."
That was the worst.

1098
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,950
It's so funny that
he keeps adding his catchphrases.

1099
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,580
- It's warm.
- Gosh, this is nice.

1100
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,780
Do we have to sit with our teams?

1101
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,990
Sit one seat apart
from your teammates.

1102
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,850
- One seat apart.
- I'll sit over here.

1103
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,260
- Someone should sit here.
- Oh, one seat apart?

1104
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,290
That's right, isn't it?

1105
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,590
- Yes.
- Okay!

1106
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,960
Nice.

1107
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,400
I'll explain the second mission.

1108
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
The second game is...

1109
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,630
Break Off MZ.

1110
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,330
It's a game that's popular
among Generation MZ these days.

1111
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:39,040
It's a different version of
the Super Mario Coin rhythm game,

1112
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,640
- but the word has been changed...
- What is this now?

1113
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,240
- to suit the standards for TV.
- What is this?

1114
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,810
You will go in order
and take turns...

1115
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:47,740
- to say "Sweet Little Kitty."
<i>- Sweet</i>

1116
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,280
Starting with the first player,

1117
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,950
you will each say,
"Sweet," "Lit," "Tle," "Kit," "Ty,"

1118
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,450
- "Sweet," "Little Kitty,"
- Gosh, this is hard."

1119
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,220
- "Sweet Little Kitty," and "Meow."
- Meow.

1120
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,420
- That's the end.
- This is hard.

1121
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,590
- That makes one set.
- It should be Black Cat...

1122
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,750
For the second set,

1123
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,990
- there should be two Meows.
- "Meow" and "Meow?"

1124
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:02,590
And for the third set,
it's "Meow," "Meow," and "Meow."

1125
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,630
(My gosh)

1126
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,960
It should be Black Cat Meow...
I mean Nero.

1127
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,700
Shall we go with Black Cat, then?

1128
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,230
- No.
<i>- Black cat</i>

1129
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,700
Sweet Little Kitty.

1130
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,040
Who in the world comes up with
games like this?

1131
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,140
I'm good at this kind of game.

1132
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,370
- Sung Woo, do you know this game?
- Do you know this?

1133
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,570
- Me?
- Yes.

1134
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,540
I know what it is,
but I've never played it before.

1135
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,580
- You know of it?
- Yes.

1136
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,310
- He still knows about it.
- He's so young.

1137
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,380
- He's Generation MZ.
- You play this a lot in college.

1138
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,550
He knows since he's Generation MZ.

1139
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,550
(This game was popular
on short form videos.)

1140
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,080
At least you know about it.

1141
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,720
- If you say the wrong word,
- This kind of game...

1142
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,050
or if you miss the beat,
you get minus one point.

1143
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,360
The team who loses more points...

1144
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,620
- loses the game.
- Gosh, I'm in trouble.

1145
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,930
I'm good at this kind of game.

1146
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,090
- Like before, the winning team...
- Gosh, this is hard.

1147
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,360
- will get to draw a new sponsor.
- Oh, really?

1148
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,170
- And you'll get a chance to pick...
- Yes.

1149
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,430
- a lunch sponsor first. Yes.
- A lunch sponsor?

1150
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,640
- We have to do well.
- Okay.

1151
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,700
- We have to do well.
- Let's go.

1152
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,140
Let's do a good job.

1153
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,310
- We have to do well.
- Okay.

1154
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,240
- Gosh, I'm not good at this.
- You just have to do well.

1155
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,310
Ye Eun.

1156
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:57,250
- You just have to do well.
- Ye Eun.

1157
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,320
(She even warns the muscular man.)

1158
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,650
- Yes, we should do well.
- This kind of game...

1159
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,950
- I'm so good at these games.
- Oh, really?

1160
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,620
- Hey.
- Gosh, this is hard.

1161
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,020
- "Sweet," "Little Kitty,"
- Let's go, then.

1162
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,060
"Sweet Little Kitty."

1163
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,460
(Meanwhile,
Ji Hyo is just looking around.)

1164
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,690
- "Sweet," "Lit..."
- Sweet!

1165
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,960
(Meanwhile,
Ji Hyo is just looking around.)

1166
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,530
(Nervous with games, Jae Seok
sounds like he just learned Korean.)

1167
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,130
- No. It's sweet, lit...
- No. Sweet, lit...

1168
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,140
(Super anxious)

1169
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,400
Gosh, this is hard...

1170
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,740
- Goodness, this is hard.
- It's hard.

1171
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,470
(Whenever they play Gen MZ games,)

1172
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:30,680
(he shows off
his peculiar sense of rhythm.)

1173
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,550
(They can't get through
a single set.)

1174
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:40,090
(On top of that, Ji Hyo gets it
wrong before the game starts.)

1175
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,560
Jae Seok, let's do a good job.

1176
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,430
(Will the two Grim Reapers
of Gen MZ games do well this time?)

1177
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,560
(And the two happen to be
on the same team.)

1178
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,400
And before we start,

1179
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,700
- There's something else, right?
- let's shout it out loud together.

1180
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,530
- Sweet little...
- Kitty!

1181
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,100
Sweet little kitty!

1182
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,800
- Sweet little...
- Kitty!

1183
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,440
Sweet little kitty!

1184
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,010
- Sweet little kitty, meow.
<i>- I'm a sweet</i>

1185

<i>- Little kitty</i>
<i>- Little kitty</i>

1186
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,850
(Running Man's MZ games always have
longer intros than the game itself.)

1187
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,720
Then, please change it to
Black Little Kitty.

1188
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,480
- Okay, we'll go with that.
- I think that's better.

1189
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,720
- Just go with Sweet!
- Black little kitty...

1190
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,420
- We practiced it until now!
- would be better.

1192
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,360
(Actually happy about this)

1193
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,730
- Black, lit...
- Tle, kit...

1194
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,090
No, you have to just say Black.

1195
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,200
(His turn to say Black,
her turn to say Lit)

1196
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,930
(They're bad at the game
even after changing it.)

1197
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,300
- Black, lit, tle, kit, ty.
- Tle.

1198
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,100
(Excited)

1199
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,010
- Then, let's go with Nero.
- Black...

1200
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,040
- Kitty.
- We'll go with Nero.

1201
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,380
- It's Black Little Kitty, Nero.
- Black Little Kitty, Nero.

1202
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,980
- This game is over now too.
- Okay.

1203
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,610

- Black little kitty.

1213
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,790

- Why is it Merong?

1214
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,030
(Feeling awkward)

1215
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,130
It's Nero!

1216
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,530
- It was going well!
- Nero!

1217
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,100
- Before this...
- He lost, right?

1218
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,800
- Merong isn't right.
- He lost.

1219
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
What happened is...

1220
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,670
- Shouldn't we get a practice round?
- He lost.

1221
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,670
No, he lost.

1222
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,410
- Nero... Please let it slide once.
- But this is...

1223
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,610
I was coming up
with lyrics before this.

1224
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,610
- I was making them.
- So why did we change it?

1225
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,810
- I was making them.
- You lost.

1226
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:10,910
- No, I was making them,
- You lost.

1227
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,010
- but you said...
- Merong was wrong.

1228
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,720
- I said, "It's not Merong."
- Please let Merong go.

1229
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,250
- I was about to say Nero.
- No, he lost on this.

1230
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,450
It's Nero.

1231
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,290
Gosh, it's so hot.

1232
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,220
My goodness.

1233
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,890
(He got heated up by himself
and takes his jacket off.)

1234
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,230

00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,810
- Okay, we've got it.
- Black. Little kitty.

1343
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,650
- Black. Little. Kit. Ty.
- We're good. All right.

1344
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,210
- Black. Little Kitty.
- We're all set.

1345
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,780
- Black little kitty. Nero.
- It's perfect.

1346
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,650
- All right. Ye Eun, let's go.
- Seriously. Let's go.

1347
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:36,990
- Let's start.
- Ready, go.

1348
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,120
(Ye Eun starts Round 5.)

1349
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,760
<i>- Black little kitty, Nero</i>
<i>- Black little kitty, Nero</i>

1350
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,530
- Black.
- Little.

1351
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:44,630
Black little kitty.

1352
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,730
- That's not it.
- No.

1353
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,900
Black little kitty.

1354
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,030
- That's not it.
- No.

1355
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,270
- It's just black.
- You guys are wrong again.

1356
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,630
- Gosh, our team is wiped out.
- How could this happen?

1357
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,270
- We lasted a long time.
- Seriously, just...

1358
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,470
- That team...
- It's over.

1359
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,480
- What is this? We never lost once.
- It's over. What is this?

1360
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:01,610
- I must not be a Gen MZ.
- I know.

1361
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,480
- You're not quite there yet.
- I'm not.

1362
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,180
We lost.

1363
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,480
- Team Jong Kook lost.
- You guys can't keep up.

1364
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,150
Team Jae Seok, who won,

1365
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:12,490
can get an extra sponsor
like before.

1366
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,790
(The winning team's benefit:
An extra sponsor for 1 member)

1367
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,120
- We were at a big disadvantage.
- But we were...

1368
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,430
We had a huge disadvantage.

1369
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,790
And you'll draw envelopes too.

1370
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:22,200
- One person can switch too.
- Let's do that.

1371
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,770
- Rock-paper-scissors or...
- Okay.

1372
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,000
You should sit this out once.

1373
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,770
- Okay, I'll sit this one out.
- Thank you.

1374
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,510
But for our team to win,

1375
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,910
- we should give it to the lowest.
- That's right.

1376
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,370
- The lowest member...
- Let's give one person everything.

1377
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,080
- No, the lowest...
- Hang on. The lowest should...

1378
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,350
But there's no way
someone doesn't have any, right?

1379
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,350
Hey, so it's advantageous
to have more stars.

1380
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,880
We should give someone
with the fewest number of stars...

1381
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,450
- the benefit.
- Does anyone have only one star?

1382
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,420
- I have more than one.
- I have more.

1383
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,690
(Ji Won has so many stars.)

1384
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,260
- I have 1 that's only 1 star.
- Then you should go.

1385
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,690
- Which one is it?
- This. Excuse Me.

1386
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,090
- Then, switch this.
- The lowest number of stars...

1387
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,090
We'll pick these first.

1388
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,230
(First, they'll take
an additional sponsor.)

1389
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,460
We need to take a risk.

1390
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,630
- We can get rid of it later.
- But they...

1391
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,830
I'm never lucky with these things.

1392
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,500
The one with the most sponsors.

1393
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,340
A dud is red, right?

1394
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,440
(Dud)

1395
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:03,740
Shoot.

1396
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,940
(Dud)

1397
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,080
- Why can't I get lucky?
- I heard youngsters loved you.

1398
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,140
- Jae Seok got it.
- Darn.

1399
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,410
Is it a good one or not?

1400
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,320
Can I use this once again?

1401
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,880
Running Information
and Communication Pref.

1402
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,150
For every mission,
regardless of the team,

1403
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,990
you may choose two sponsors...

1404
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,790
and check how many stars they have.

1405
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,360
I have two of these?

1406
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,530
- You can check two sponsors.
- Two?

1407
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:26,930
(It'll be beneficial
when swapping sponsors.)

1408
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,760
What is it? Name what you want.

1409
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,230
There are a lot.

1410
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,500
(Jae Seok investigates
the sponsors for Team Jong Kook.)

1411
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,870
Irresponsible Securities.

1412
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,170
(Irresponsible Securities,
Checking Jong Kook's sponsor)

1413
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:43,080
(3 stars isn't quite worth taking.)

1414
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,780
How many stars does Selline have?

1415
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,520
(Selline is better with 4 stars!)

1416
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,550
I have to wear that outfit though.

1417
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:51,950
(Seok Jin's sponsor: Selline)

1418
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,290
What is it?

1419
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,690
- What did he say?
- Hold on.

1420
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,260
(A Selline ambassador essential,
the sheer leopard look)

1421
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,160
- Selline.
- Selline has many stars.

1422
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,400
- Take that one.
- Switch to that.

1423
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,800
- Selline?
- Yes.

1424
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,300
- What's taking so long?
- What's there to talk about?

1425
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,240
- Enough with the discussion.
- Cut it short.

1426
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,970
Move it along. I'm hungry.

1427
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,240
Then,

1428
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,070
I'll swap Excuse Me...

1429
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,510
for Selline.

1430
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:15,880
- Selline.
- Selline.

1431
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,610
- I'll swap those two.
- Selline?

1432
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,850
- Selline?
- Why his?

1433
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:21,150
- This?
- Yes.

1434
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,250
(You'll willingly wear that outfit?)

1435
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,320
- You'll take this?
- Yes.

1436
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,760
You want to be funny today.

1437
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,460
- Right. I'll take Selline.
- Take off your clothes.

1438
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,690
- Sure.
- I'll do that.

1439
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,160
- Right. I'll take Selline.
- Take off your clothes.

1440
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,430
- Sure.
- I'll do that.

1441
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:35,560
Do you need
to take off your clothes?

1442
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,070
Do I need to wear that?

1443
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,070
Shoot.

1444
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,140
Kyeong Hwan, don't wear
anything underneath.

1445
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,910
- Are you kidding me?
- You wanted to be funny today.

1446
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:45,010
Don't wear anything underneath.

1447
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,440
I've been on the fence about this.

1448
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,710
- That didn't cross my mind.
- Here is Selline.

1449
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:50,110
Breaking news.

1450
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,650
Selline...

1451
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,880
has decided not to sponsor
Jee Seok Jin anymore.

1452
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,490
People were shocked to hear...

1453
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:00,320
that it was now sponsoring
Heo Kyeong Hwan.

1454
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,720
- No way.
- Dance the salsa.

1455
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,690
- You look good.
- That looks good on him.

1456
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,230
- That suits him.
- He looks good.

1457
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,800
- That looks good on him.
- Right?

1458
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,730
That looks good on Kyeong Hwan.

1459
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,800
(The cheetah shirt
found its rightful owner.)

1460
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,300
Can you get me a sweatshirt
in this color?

1461
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,370
(He glides to the center
dancing the steps.)

1462
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:17,710
Hey!

1463
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:19,880
What on earth?

1464
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,010
Kyeong Hwan...

1465
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,050
Guys, look.
Kyeong Hwan made his way...

1466
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,380
from over there while dancing,

1467
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,020
but no one saw him.

1468
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,620
(The invisible cha-cha-cha)

1469
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,720
(The performance ended
with no one paying attention.)

1470
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,060
- Kyeong Hwan...
- You saw me, didn't you?

1471
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,730
No one paid attention.

1472
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,260
If only you had made sounds.

1473
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,730
Can't you repeat that?

1474
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,200
No one...

1475
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,130
No one saw him.

1476
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,470
He made his way over here
while dancing, but...

1477
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,240
- Now it's weird.
- Attention!

1478
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,740
- No one...
- No one's interested.

1479
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,940
(The screentime hunter
didn't pick the right time.)

1480
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,280
- Oh, no.
- How is that even possible?

1481
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,010
Our team is doomed.

1482
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,210
Our team...

1483
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,880
She said she was the president
of the MZ generation.

1484
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,120
That would be Kim Ah Young.

1485
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,650
It's actually Lee Young Ji.

1486
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:05,790
You're just
the big-headed youngster.

1487
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,320
(Wailing)

1488
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,790
- The big-headed youngster.
- We all know she's faking it.

1489
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,160
- The big-headed youngster.
- The big-headed youngster.

1490
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,330
(Let me see.)

1491
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,500
(He checks the fat
on top of her head.)

1492
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,840
- I was curious.
- Weren't you curious?

1493
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,110
- I was curious.
- Seriously?

1494
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,840
It's not that.
She has a lot of hair.

1495
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,610
Why did you do that
when we only met today?

1496
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,350
(Once again, his timing was off.)

1497
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:34,420
- Team Jae Seok won that game.
- Right.

1498
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,720
You will also get the chance...

1499
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,690
to choose the company
sponsoring your lunch.

1500
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,350
- That's great.
- We'll get the menu.

1501
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,390
Two companies are sponsoring us
with special meals...

1502
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,490
so that you can recharge
your energy.

1503
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,990
Bring them out.

1504
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,560
I wonder what companies.
There are two of them.

1505
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,500
I can't see anything.

1506
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,000
(Which are the sponsors?)

1507
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,570
It's 36 Chickens.

1508
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:54,400
- See the sponsors...
- I want 36 Chickens.

1509
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,810
- and choose the one you want.
- It's 36 Chickens.

1510
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,570
- With the meal from each sponsor,
- I want Elegant Table.

1511
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,680
you will enjoy your lunch as teams.

1512
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,840
Is that fried chicken?

1513
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,380
(36 Chickens)

1514
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,650
Is that fried chicken?

1515
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,420
- It's 36 Chickens.
- You're right.

1516
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,720
(The fried chicken joint
with "chicken" in its name?)

1517
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,850
- It's fried chicken.
- That'll be delicious.

1518
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,320
Let them have 36 Chickens.

1519
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,020
I want Elegant Table.

1520
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,330
- Elegant Table?
- Elegant Table?

1521
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,460
- Let's eat with dignity.
- But...

1522
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:21,700
(Is it a fancy restaurant
as the name suggests?)

1523
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,430
- Elegant Table?
- Elegant Table.

1524
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:24,770
We can't tell which will be better.

1525
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:25,870
We should go with "elegant."

1526
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,140
- We should.
- Of course.

1527
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:29,570
We'll have the elegant meal.

1528
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:30,770
- The elegant...
- Who knows which will be better?

1529
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:33,110
- It'll at least be fried chicken.
- Who knows what we'll have?

1530
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:35,040
- What?
- It'll at least be fried chicken.

1531
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,080
- This is fried chicken.
- You made your choice.

1532
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,950
- We haven't.
- You chose and that's it.

1533
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,150
- It's done.
- You already chose.

1534
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,280
- Exactly. Ye Eun, tell them.
- You chose and that's it.

1535
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,790
Stick your head in there.

1536
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:44,990
- It's not final, right?
- Here.

1537
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,520
What if we don't get
to eat anything?

1538
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,920
- You chose and that's it.
- That's final.

1539
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,990
- Just take it.
- Yes, that's final.

1540
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,160
Take it.

1541
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,160
- You chose and that's it.
- Stick your head in there.

1542
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:56,330
- Guys, gather around.
- But they chose.

1543
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,070
You'll be forced to run...

1544
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,700
- if you choose 36 Chickens.
- It's final.

1545
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,940
- Just take it.
- Right.

1546
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,970
- Because it means to flee.
- Right.

1547
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,340
We could have to eat on a treadmill.

1548
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,470
- That's it.
- Of course.

1549
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,040
- We're done.
- We choose Elegant Table.

1550
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,210
- Elegant Table?
- Yes.

1551
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,610
Then, Team Jong Kook will...

1552
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,710
- It's 36 Chickens.
- automatically...

1553
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,580
- get 36 Chickens.
- It's fried chicken.

1554
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,550
(What will be provided as lunch
by these two sponsors?)

1555
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,790
- The sponsor 36 Chickens...
- Yes?

1556
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,990
has offered a high protein meal.

1557
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:23,430
(Is it really
a fried chicken company?)

1558
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,430
You will be served 36 boiled eggs.

1559
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:29,160
(36 boiled eggs)

1560
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:34,400
The athletes need their protein.

1561
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,440
- It's fine.
- Jong Kook only ate that back then.

1562
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,540
That's true. But it's fine.

1563
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,940
Jong Kook ate a tray of eggs
for a meal.

1564
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,680
Meanwhile Elegant Table
will provide...

1565
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,180
beef galbijjim
that is packed with nutrients.

1566
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,210
- Of course.
- Set the tables, please.

1567
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,780
- Jae Seok, how did you know?
- Nice.

1568
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,450
- Nice.
- That looks good.

1569
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,890
No way. Steam's coming from it.

1570
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:51,950
- Is that LA short ribs?
- No way.

1571
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,760
- I'd love a piece of the beef.
- Gosh, the beef galbijjim.

1572
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,690
(The sponsored food is delivered.)

1573
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:56,730
- That looks good.
- Check that out.

1574
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,260
No way. Steam's coming from it.

1575
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,290
Is that LA short ribs?

1576
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,230
This is nice.

1577
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:02,930
Good for you, Ye Eun.
You're watching your weight, right?

1578
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,900
- That's right.
- Beef helps though.

1579
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,700
It's fine to eat two egg yolks.

1580
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,970
My sponsor is Excuse Me.

1581
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:13,710
Excuse me,
get me that beef galbijjim.

1582
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:14,840
(That's what we can do.)

1583
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,810
(Excuse Me Benefit:
Send 1 person on errands.)

1584
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:18,680
- That's nice.
- Good, right?

1585
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,450
- Nice, Seok Jin.
- That's great.

1586
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,120
- I feel reassured.
- Let's do this!

1587
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,790
- Brother.
- Sure.

1588
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,150
- Please.
- Brother.

1589
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,690
- Thank you.
- How nice should you be to me?

1590
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,720
- Extremely nice.
- Ye Eun.

1591
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,790
Who's your favorite celebrity?

1592
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:32,230
Jee Seok Jin.

1593
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,360
(Seok Sam now rules the world
thanks to having Excuse Me.)

1594
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,630
This is great.

1595
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:35,930
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

1596
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,570
This is nice. It looks delicious.

1597
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:39,170
- This is incredible.
- We'll enjoy.

1598
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,670
- We'll enjoy.
- Ji Won, have your fill.

1599
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:41,670
- Sure.
- Excuse me!

1600
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,000
(Just then)

1601
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:45,170
- Excuse me!
- Enjoy.

1602
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:47,280
- Ji Won.
- Yes?

1603
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,780
The galbijjim...

1604
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,050
Bring me half of it.

1605
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,810
- Why?
- What?

1606
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,320
- Bring me half of the galbijjim.
- Bring you what?

1607
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,890
- Come on!
- Excuse me.

1608
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,050
- He's allowed.
- No way.

1609
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,420
Excuse me.
Bring me half of the galbijjim.

1610
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,260
- I'll use what I have.
- What is it?

1611
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,060
- I'll use what I have.
- What is it?

1612
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,230
I'll use my benefit
provided by Where Didas.

1613
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:06,800
(Where Didas)

1614
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,100
- Where Didas?
- What's that?

1615
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,230
(The sponsor he acquired
after the last mission)

1616
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,430
(A hidden benefit?)

1617
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,430
(Where Didas)

1618
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,540
Are you frustrated
by someone useless?

1619
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,570
- Let one member rest just for once.
- What is it?

1620
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,970
It can only be used once.

1621
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:20,010
- What is it?
- What would one need this for?

1622
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:22,710
- What's that?
- Please leave the room.

1623
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,650
(He's forced out.)

1624
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,620
- What is that?
- Is that allowed?

1625
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:29,280
- What?
- I can make one of us rest.

1626
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,850
- Leave.
- Seok Jin, leave the egg...

1627
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:33,360
and remove yourself for a while.

1628
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,590
- While we eat.
- Ji Won, wait.

1629
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,960
- The exit is that way.
- But...

1630
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,260
We're doomed.

1631
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,530
(He tried to have beef galbijjim
but ended up losing his eggs.)

1632
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:41,900
- This...
- He's of no good use.

1633
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,630
I was going to save this for later,
but you startled me.

1634
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,230
- Seok Jin, take this.
- Ji Won, go ahead.

1635
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,500
- Take yours.
- Take the egg.

1636
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,840
Get it to me later.

1637
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,810
You, Park Ji Won!

1638
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,240
- We only just met!
- Yes?

1639
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,410
- No way.
- Have your fill.

1640
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,580
- That looks great.
- That looks delicious.

1641
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,580
It's so tender.

1642
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,150
It's really good.

1643
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:02,420
(No teeth are needed
to enjoy the tender beef galbijjim.)

1644
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,450
Is it good? Is it tender?

1645
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,290
- It's really good.
- It's delicious.

1646
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,660
The beef galbijjim
is entering my mouth.

1647
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:10,890
It's really good.

1648
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:13,260
The meat is plump and juicy.

1649
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,560
(It's even tastier
since they get to tease them.)

1650
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,000
I'd love a bite of that.

1651
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:18,830
That must be delicious.

1652
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,500
(The athletes are being treated
thanks to their wonderful sponsor.)

1653
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,700
It's really good.

1654
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,210
No way.

1655
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,480
That must be good.

1656
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,110
It's so good. My gosh.

1657
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,010
- Is it good?
- Tell me about it.

1658
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:34,350
- It's really good.
- It's not bad.

1659
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:35,420
These must be soft-boiled eggs.

1660
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,290
This is enough to get our nutrients.

1661
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,650
It's way better than plain rice.

1662
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:40,890
- It's so good.
- It's nice.

1663
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:44,390
(Stacking up on protein
with 6g of protein per egg)

1664
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:46,530
- It's good.
- I'm loving the protein.

1665
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:50,300
Can we eat our meal in peace?

1666
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,430
(The actual athlete
inhales protein like Jong Kook.)

1667
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,040
How many did you have?

1668
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,270
- Three.
- We're on our third one.

1669
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:57,440
- Is it your third?
- Yes.

1670
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,010
He used to go around
having a whole tray of that.

1671
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:02,380
- I want meat.
- It's good though.

1672
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:03,810
Is it good? Is it tender?

1673
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:06,050
- It's really good.
- I'd love a bite.

1674
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,180
Give me a bite!

1675
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,050
No one has to tell her to do it now.

1676
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,920
"Just a bite."

1677
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,890
"Give me just a bite."

1678
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:16,590
Give me just a bite.

1679
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:19,360
Ye Eun can't control herself
when it comes to food.

1680
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:25,200
She's someone I care a lot about.

1681
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,370
I'll let you touch her head.

1682
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,540
- Does it promise luck?
- Yes.

1683
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,970
Hold on.

1684
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,240
It's huge.

1685
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,370
- Goodness.
- You won't believe it.

1686
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,110
- This is one big head.
- I know.

1687
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:35,180
(Touching her plump head
will bring you luck.)

1688
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,950
- Here.
- Really?

1689
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:40,080
(By wishing upon the head,
they give her a piece of meat.)

1690
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,080
(Chuckling)

1691
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,750
How can she be that delighted?

1692
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,890
Ye Eun, where's your pride? Come on.

1693
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,890
How can she look this different
before and after...

1694
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,690
she's allowed to have food?

1695
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,490
(Happy)

1696
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:53,700
It's huge.

1697
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,970
We'll move
and continue with the next mission.

1698
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:58,130
To be honest...

1699
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,670
Hey, in Kyeong Hwan's case,

1700
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:01,940
isn't he in...

1701
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,440
the Top Three with
how many catchphrases he has?

1702
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,240
Actually, comedians don't have
catchphrases these days.

1703
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,410
- Comedians...
- Only when we were little, they...

1704
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:11,180
Back in Kyeong Hwan's day,
there were lots of catchphrases.

1705
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,720
Kyeong Hwan had more catchphrases
than his popularity, actually.

1706
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,350
- That's all I did.
- In comparison.

1707
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,190
I was watching a drama,
and Cho Seung Woo said...

1708
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,460
It was a historical drama,
and he said,

1709
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,360
"Five nyangs if you're curious."

1710
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,960
- That line...
- Right.

1711
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,590
- "Are you curious? Five nyangs."
- Really?

1712
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:29,530
- "Gag Concert" was...
- It was in an MBC drama.

1713
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:32,070
- You'll go to Jincheon after this?
- Yes.

1714
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,300
Did you come up from Jincheon today?

1715
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:36,970
Back in the day,
Jang Dong Gun was...

1716
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:38,740
doing an interview,
and he was asked if he thought...

1717
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:39,870
he'd win the Grand Award.

1718
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,540
And he went, "Are you curious?"
And after that...

1719
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,350
- "Sixty cents if you are."
- That's so random.

1720
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,210
- Jang Dong Gun?
- Oh, Dong Gun?

1721
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:48,480
"Why is it 60 cents?"
And he's like, "I'm a celebrity."

1722
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,750
- He had planned that skit.
- Oh, really?

1723
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,520
- Even Jang Dong Gun...
- I saw him at the gym yesterday.

1724
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,790
- Really?
- Yes.

1725
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:57,060
(His talk show ended
as a monologue.)

1726
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,490
He was working out really hard.

1727
00:55:58,490 --> 00:55:59,990
How does it feel to be
on Running Man?

1728
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,230
- It's fun.
- Is it fun?

1729
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:02,400
- They look fascinating, right?
- Yes.

1730
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,400
They look funny, don't they?

1731
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,800
- There he goes again.
- He's acting smug again.

1732
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,170
So smug. He's the same too.

1733
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,870
- Ji Won.
- Yes?

1734
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,740
- Maybe not disappointing, but...
- Right.

1735
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:14,480
- someone who's a little...
- Is anyone kind of bad-looking?

1736
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,540
Is there anyone who seems to be
hanging in here unexpectedly?

1737
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:19,810
- Are the guests included?
- Today...

1738
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,650
- That was great.
- Nice one.

1739
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,890
- Okay, nice comment!
- I thought so.

1740
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:27,620
- Nice comment.
- Good job.

1741
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,060
Hey, man... You...

1742
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,490
- He's a variety show player.
- He totally is.

1743
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:33,230
That guy, Ji Won,
should get punched in the side...

1744
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:34,700
- Man.
- Man.

1745
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,360
I really got punched just now.

1746
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,500
I'm going to stop talking
for five minutes.

1747
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,170
Just five minutes?

1748
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:45,370
- He volunteered to stop talking.
- I'm so tired.

1749
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:46,780
- Ji Won.
- Yes?

1750
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,780
Isn't there anyone you want to meet?

1751
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,680
I...

1752
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:52,750
like WINTER.

1753
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:54,650
I see who your type is.

1754
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:57,050
- WINTER.
- She's like a puppy.

1755
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,390
- I see.
- Agreed.

1756
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,160
Hey, I'm glad we don't have
the same taste.

1757
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,390
- Why? Do you like KARINA?
- Right.

1758
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:02,560
Why are you saying that, man?

1759
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,860
Did I have competition?

1760
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,530
- What's up with you?
- That was funny.

1761
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:08,060
- I tried so hard to forget KARINA.
- You're being so...

1762
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,500
Hey, have you ever seen KARINA?

1763
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,530
I have.

1764
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:13,030
These guys are hilarious.

1765
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,600
What about you, Sung Woo?

1766
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:15,970
I like...

1767
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,340
the actress, Go Youn Jung.

1768
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,970
- I see!
- Oh, from "Moving."

1769
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:20,980
- From "Moving."
- "Moving."

1770
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,980
- Agreed.
- She was in "Moving."

1771
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,350
- Totally agreed.
- "Moving."

1772
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,950
Sung Woo is so sincere.

1773
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:29,520
- I'll throw it out there carefully.
- We agree.

1774
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,650
- Were you a huge fan?
- Yes, just as a fan.

1775
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,660
- Yes.
- None of us have seen her, though.

1776
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,760
Ms. Go Youn Jung,
please come on the show sometime.

1777
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,260
And KARINA.

1778
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,260
(aespa and Go Youn Jung,
let's meet on Running Man soon!)

1779
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,800
What type do you like, Ye Eun?

1780
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:42,060
- Me?
- Oh, what?

1781
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,330
What type do you like, Ye Eun?

1782
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,670
(This question came out of nowhere.)

1783
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:45,870
- All of a sudden?
- Hang on.

1784
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:47,540
- He's in such a rush!
- What was that?

1785
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,800
- Is this a blind date or something?
- No.

1786
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,970
- Gosh, he's in such a rush.
- No.

1787
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,610
- Why was that comment so...
- No.

1788
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:53,910
- Does he have a chance or not?
- No.

1789
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:55,040
No, right? You don't have a chance.

1790
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,480
I don't like you that much either.

1791
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:58,480
What? Can't I ask?

1792
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,320
Hey, it's an ice rink.

1793
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,520
- There's an ice rink.
- What?

1794
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,650
- There's a college in the city.
- Oh, this place is huge.

1795
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:06,150
There will be a huge ruckus
with the world champions here.

1796
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,590
Oh, I've been here before.

1797
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:08,860
An ice rink. My gosh.

1798
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,590
Gosh, this is my first time
at a place like this.

1799
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:11,860
We'll consider this
our workout for today.

1800
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,660
Yes, we should get in
our workout here.

1801
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,160
Oh, do we put these clothes on?

1802
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,970
Hey, Ji Won. They have the helmet.

1803
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:21,200
Oh, this is the helmet you wore
to become the world champion.

1804
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,670
I put that there.

1805
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,870
- This is your own?
- Oh, there's such a thing as this?

1806
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,840
- It's real gold.
- Hey, it's really...

1807
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,680
- It's so light.
- Hey, this is cool.

1808
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,880
Hey, I want a photo of this.
This is so cool.

1809
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,450
Can you show me the front?

1810
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,150
- Gosh, it's so cool.
- Towards the camera...

1811
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,750
That's awesome.

1812
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,790
Hey, these look comfortable, though.

1813
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:40,590
- They have clips for these.
- Yes.

1814
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:42,260
You don't have to lace them all up.

1815
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,330
Gosh, I haven't worn skates
in so long.

1816
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:47,530
He brought his actual skates
over there.

1817
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,330
Gosh, I can't believe I get to see
actual skates for athletes.

1818
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:54,000
- Yes.
- You guys are so cool.

1819
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,640
You grind the blades too, right?

1820
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,970
Yes, we grind them.

1821
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:59,840
Oh, the world champions are...

1822
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,980
(Their honored names are
even embroidered on their skates.)

1823
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:05,780
I should take pictures of them too.
They're so cool.

1824
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:06,980
Gosh, so cool.

1825
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:10,490
(They're all set
to get on the rink.)

1826
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:12,550
Which way do we go out?

1827
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,790
(Right then,
the first skater enters.)

1828
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:23,500
(Yu Jae Seok: Toothpick legs)

1829
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,630
(He moves smoothly with legs
that look like they might snap.)

1830
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:27,170
You're good at skating.

1831
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:28,900
Well, I'm not that bad.

1832
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:31,170
I skate well enough
to be able to film the show.

1833
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,270
How long has it been?

1834
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,640
How am I supposed to do this?

1835
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,810
(Next, two more skaters enter.)

1836
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,580
- My gosh.
- Hey, how do I do this?

1837
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,250
- Oh, man.
- I've got the hang of it.

1838
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:42,880
Oh, this is...

1839
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,850
(Yang Se Chan:
Dongducheon Diving Beetle)

1840
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,160
(He got used to skating
after a few steps.)

1841
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,220
Did you learn to skate on
frozen rice paddies in Dongducheon?

1842
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,630
I really skated on rice paddies.

1843
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:54,400
These skills are from
Dongducheon's rice paddies.

1844
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:57,870
Gosh, this is my first time.
It's hard.

1845
00:59:57,870 --> 00:59:58,870
(Heo Kyeong Hwan: Shorty)

1846
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,570
Gosh, you're good at this.

1847
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:02,500
I should move a bit... My gosh!

1848
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,240
(He staggers even with
his low center of balance.)

1849
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,770
No. My goodness.

1850
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,880
- Oh, man.
- Hey, shorty. Get out of the way.

1851
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:12,810
I'm going past you.

1852
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,420
- I used to roller skate a bit.
- Really?

1853
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,620
Hey, I'm a good skater.
I'm not joking.

1854
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,890
I have to win now.

1855
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,760
I have to get warmed up.

1856
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,260
- You're good at this.
- My goodness.

1857
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,330
Is it really slippery?

1858
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:25,860
- Okay!
- Team Jae Seok won.

1859
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:28,560
(They lost in the first mission.)

1860
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,670
(They also lost the second mission
in a row.)

1861
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:34,240
(Team Jong Kook is facing
a huge crisis.)

1862
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,240
(They must win the final mission.)

1863
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,310
Go!

1864
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:41,440
Gosh, it's been so long.

1865
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,440
(But...)

1866
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,440
It's been so long.

1867
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,980
(Jae Seok zooms past.)

1868
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,220
(Trainer Kook seems to have found
another sport he's bad at.)

1869
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:50,550
Jong Kook,
you're scraping up all the ice.

1870
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:53,550
- What did you say?
- You scraped up all the ice.

1871
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:55,890
(Another skater on Team Jong Kook)

1872
01:00:55,890 --> 01:01:00,360
(Jee Seok Jin: Weakest of the Weak)

1873
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,700
My gosh, how do I do this?
Why are they so good?

1874
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,370
- Gosh, this is hard.
- Hey, what's wrong with you?

1875
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,240
- That team is done for.
- Oh, it should point inward.

1876
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,770
- Hey, Locust.
- What?

1877
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:13,370
When did you learn to skate?

1878
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,040
Why aren't you skating?

1879
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,880
Hey, Locust.
When did you learn to skate?

1880
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:18,480
Oh, man.

1881
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:20,520
- Hey.
- Me?

1882
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,480
- Gosh, Haha looks like a beggar.
- I'm bad at this.

1883
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,650
- What's up with you?
- He's a beggar.

1884
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,060
Hey, here they come! In the back.

1885
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,490
- Hey, there here!
- My gosh!

1886
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,390
- They're so cool.
- They're here.

1887
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:32,060
(The real skaters appear.)

1888
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:36,260
(Park Ji Won,
Ranked Number 1 in the World)

1889
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:37,970
- You're so cool.
- Gosh, they're the real deal.

1890
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:40,070
- For real.
- They might fly around on the ice.

1891
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,770
- That helmet is so cool.
- Hey, you look cool.

1892
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,170
- They're so cool.
- Gosh, look at Sung Woo.

1893
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,610
- Sung Woo.
- You're so cool.

1894
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:46,610
- So cool.
- You look so cool.

1895
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:48,280
- Right. Shall we take an easy lap?
- We're doing a lap?

1896
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,810
- Okay.
- They have unique gloves too.

1897
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,650
- What should we do?
- Should we go slow?

1898
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:55,850
(With their goggles on,
they look ready for a photo shoot.)

1899
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:58,120
(With their frog gloves,
they explode with coolness.)

1900
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,890
- So cool. Look at their gloves.
- Yes, their gloves are cool.

1901
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:03,420
- Gosh, they're so close together.
- They're so cool.

1902
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,490
- This is so...
- That's awesome.

1903
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:06,960
They're so amazing.

1904
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,800
- That's so cool.
- It's just like what we saw on TV.

1905
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,170
- Exactly what we saw on TV.
- Push.

1906
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:14,600
They don't even make any sound.

1907
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:18,240
- How can they skate like that?
- Gosh, it's so cool...

1908
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,240
It's just speed. Pure speed.

1909
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,140
(Their speed pierces through the wind
without any sound.)

1910
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,880
- Do you want to see anything?
- They're so amazing.

1911
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:25,580
Anything you want to see?

1912
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,980
- What we want to see?
- What is...

1913
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,380
A relay.

1914
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,650
They asked what we wanted to see
but disappeared right away.

1915
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:31,720
It's just speed. Pure speed.

1916
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:32,920
- What?
- Push me.

1917
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,960
Can you go faster?

1918
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,360
Push his bottom.

1919
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:38,790
Ji Won, push his bottom.

1920
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,900
(He changes positions
for the touch.)

1921
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,100
- Push him in front of us.
- After he comes in?

1922
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,500
After he comes in?

1923
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,970
(Blast off)

1924
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:52,970
- That's so fast.
- They're super fast.

1925
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55,380
- It's so cool.
- It's cool. We can feel the wind.

1926
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,080
- Right?
- That's like...

1927
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,580
- It's so fast.
- You're so cool.

1928
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,050
(This is the class
of national athletes.)

1929
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,780
So awesome.

1930
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,350
That's so cool.

1931
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:07,160
Here are the rules
for the final mission.

1932
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,860
The final mission is
the Deity of Speed Skating.

1933
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:12,260
You will do a relay on the ice,

1934
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,330
and the team to finish first wins.

1935
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:15,330
- It's simple.
- Yes.

1936
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:17,500
But before the mission begins,

1937
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,370
the 2 short-track skaters
will do 2 laps.

1938
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:24,510
After they do their laps,
the team whose member comes in first...

1939
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,170
will get the benefit of
taking the inner course.

1940
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,280
- The inner course.
- The inner course, indeed.

1941
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,910
The batons for the relay...

1942
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:32,450
are tubes
with the female members on them.

1943
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:37,150
(They must tie the tubes with the girls
on them around their waists.)

1944
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,690
You must skate with the tube
around your waist...

1945
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,890
- and pass it onto the next skater.
- What?

1946
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:42,990
That's the baton?

1947
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:44,430
- Hang on. Who do we have?
- It's Ye Eun?

1948
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,760
- Nice. This sounds like fun.
- But...

1949
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,860
- We have to pull them along?
- Ye Eun is pretty heavy.

1950
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:50,030
No, I'm not!

1951
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:52,630
- She's 80kg.
- She weighs 69kg!

1952
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:53,900
My weight is in the early 50s.

1953
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,840
Our team is at a huge disadvantage.

1954
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:59,470
- It won't be fun if we're serious.
- Right.

1955
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:00,980
- Should we skate backward?
- Backward?

1956
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,980
- Or let's skate with only one foot.
- With one foot?

1957
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,080
Yes. Which foot can you do?

1958
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,850
My right foot is better.

1959
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:08,150
- With only your right foot?
- Yes.

1960
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:09,320
- Will that be okay?
- Yes.

1961
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:13,850
First, the athletes will skate
on one foot and do two laps.

1962
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,420
- What?
- Skate on one foot?

1963
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:16,960
- On 1 foot?
- How do you skate on 1 foot?

1964
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,530
They said they'd skate on one foot.

1965
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:19,730
They'll only push with one foot.

1966
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,130
How do you go forward then?

1967
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:22,800
- I did this a lot as a kid.
- You don't push with the left foot?

1968
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,630
- Hey, why do you look like that?
- What?

1969
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:26,770
Why are you saying that, Jong Kook?

1970
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:28,440
- Shall we get ready?
- You'll do two laps.

1971
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,770
- Are you starting now?
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1972
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:31,240
Don't overwork yourselves.

1973
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,340
- Yes, the right foot.
- Don't overwork yourselves.

1974
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,180
- Don't get hurt before a match.
- Right.

1975
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:36,380
- Yes, take it easy.
- We'll skate confidently.

1976
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:38,510
- Ready.
- Start with a push on the left?

1977
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:40,750
(The race begins.)

1978
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,620
- My gosh.
- Oh, they'll skate like that?

1979
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,150
(They're skating
with one foot off the ice!)

1980
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,560
- What is that?
- Gosh, that actually works.

1981
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,690
- What is that?
- What is that?

1982
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,290
(The national athletes have
incredibly strong legs!)

1983
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:54,960
- How...
- How do they do that?

1984
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,930
- Is that a part of training?
- What's that?

1985
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:59,070
- It's no joke.
- My goodness.

1986
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,370
- How do they do that?
- That's incredible.

1987
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:02,240
Can he get ahead that way?

1988
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,110
- Can he get ahead that way?
- Gosh.

1989
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:05,770
This is unbelievable.

1990
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:07,410
They're so cool.

1991
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,980
- Sung Woo!
- Ji Won!

1992
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,380
- Get ahead!
- Sung Woo!

1993
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:12,680
(Remaining laps: 2)

1994
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,680
- Sung Woo!
- Ji Won!

1995
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,120
- Get ahead!
- Sung Woo!

1996
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,220
- Good luck!
- Take the inner course.

1997
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,790
- Come on.
- There you go.

1998
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,790
- Sung Woo got ahead.
- Ji Won!

1999
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:21,920
- Let's go!
- Ji Won, no!

2000
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,090
- Sung Woo got ahead.
- Ji Won!

2001
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,230
For goodness' sake!

2002
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:30,230
- Their legs must be so strong.
- There goes Ji Won.

2003
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,600
- The outer course.
- Sung Woo!

2004
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:33,200
There goes Ji Won.

2005
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:34,700
- The outer course.
- Sung Woo!

2006
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,870
- Their legs must be so strong.
- Sung Woo!

2007
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:38,710
- Ji Won, my goodness.
- Ji Won.

2008
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:39,710
Sung Woo, you'll win.

2009
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:40,810
(He suddenly moves
to the inner course!)

2010
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:43,610
(The finish line is near!)

2011
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:47,110
(Who will be the winner?)

2012
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:50,480
(1st place: Team Jae Seok, Ji Won
2nd place: Team Jong Kook, Sung Woo)

2013
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,590
We lost.

2014
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:54,590
- We lost.
- Ji Won won.

2015
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,420
- How did they do that?
- Ji Won was faster.

2016
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,160
Ji Won finished first.

2017
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,360
Team Jae Seok gets...

2018
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,530
- the inner course.
- Okay.

2019
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:02,530
- The inner course.
- No way.

2020
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:03,960
But the inner course...

2021
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,400
Shall we let them take it?

2022
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,070
- What?
- What was that?

2023
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:10,140
They're really bad at skating.

2024
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,270
We don't want it.

2025
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:12,810
- Gosh, they have pride.
- How annoying.

2026
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,280
It's true. We're bad at skating.

2027
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:15,510
(Tapping)

2028
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:16,610
- Give us the benefit.
- You want the benefit.

2029
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:18,510
- We'll give them the benefit.
- Give us the benefit.

2030
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,250
- They're worse than us.
- We need it.

2031
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,580
- All right.
- Give us the benefit.

2032
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:24,490
- Your legs must be so strong.
- It was insane.

2033
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:26,350
How did you skate
with only your right leg?

2034
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:27,960
It must be a part of training.

2035
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,290
- I did it often in childhood.
- In childhood?

2036
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:31,630
Did you do it often in childhood?

2037
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:32,860
Se Chan, do you want to try it?

2038
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:33,860
I can't do it.

2039
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,200
It's impossible.

2040
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,730
How do they do it?

2041
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:37,830
They use their leg strength.

2042
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:39,370
That's why
they're national athletes.

2043
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,470
- By the way,
- Yes?

2044
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:41,870
- Kyeong Hwan?
- Yes?

2045
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:45,310
Since your outfit was sponsored,
you shouldn't wear a jacket.

2046
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:46,370
- Of course not.
- Really?

2047
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:48,380
- You shouldn't wear it.
- Take it off.

2048
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:49,740
(He gets asked to reveal
the sponsored outfit.)

2049
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:50,880
It's too cold.

2050
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,950
- What? He's Cha Jun Hwan.
- I wore it stealthily.

2051
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:54,250
He's Cha Jun Hwan.

2052
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,250
(An unexpected lookalike
was discovered.)

2053
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,450
Heo Jun Hwan.

2054
01:06:58,190 --> 01:07:00,050
(He's like Cha Jun Hwan
whose legs are left the length.)

2055
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,420
He's a figure skater.

2056
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,360
He's short.

2057
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,760
(Short)

2058
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:06,790
- My goodness.
- Nice.

2059
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:08,560
(The short man
suddenly gives a performance.)

2060
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,460
- My goodness.
- Nice.

2061
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,570
- No one is watching.
- No one is watching.

2062
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:17,440
No one is watching.

2063
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:19,370
I feel bad. No one is watching.

2064
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,040
He's on our team.

2065
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,080
(He shakes his waist.)

2066
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,180
He's good.

2067
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:26,710
You should react to what you see.

2068
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:28,780
(A sudden exit)

2069
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:29,950
He's on our team.

2070
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:34,090
Now, please decide on the order.

2071
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,520
Haha should go last among the three.

2072
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,630
No, I can't skate very well.

2073
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:39,230
- I'll go before Ji Won.
- I'm bad at cornering.

2074
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:40,900
- Jae Seok and Haha are similar.
- You should go before me.

2075
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,100
Kyeong Hwan should go first.

2076
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,030
- Kyeong Hwan and I are rivals.
- Okay.

2077
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:45,870
Then Seok Jin and I will go first.

2078
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:46,870
- Okay.
- It's my first time skating.

2079
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:49,170
- Kyeong Hwan and me.
- Okay.

2080
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:51,140
- Heo Jun Hwan, let's go.
- Yes.

2081
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,070
- Heo Jun Hwan.
- Good luck.

2082
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,780
- Okay.
- Good luck, Heo Kyeong Hwan.

2083
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,180
- Okay.
- Good luck.

2084
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:57,380
Let's go.

2085
01:07:58,310 --> 01:07:59,350
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2086
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:01,850
- Let's go, Seok Jin.
- Let's go.

2087
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:03,050
- Chungju!
- Let's go.

2088
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:04,490
- Go.
- Ye Eun, good luck.

2089
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:05,550
Put your feet up.

2090
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:06,550
- Yes.
- Get ready.

2091
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:07,660
Her legs are long.

2092
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,160
Are you ready to win?

2093
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,760
(They set off.)

2094
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:13,660
He can't go forward. This is bad.

2095
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,200
- Seok Jin is going.
- Kyeong Hwan.

2096
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:17,770
- You need to go.
- He's going.

2097
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:19,000
(Meanwhile, Seok Jin moves forward.)

2098
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,070
- Hey.
- Seok Jin.

2099
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,670
He's going.

2100
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:26,270
- Seok Jin, go slowly.
- He's pretty good.

2101
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,410
Seok Jin, go slowly.

2102
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:30,180
- Are you doing okay?
- Yes. Be careful.

2103
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:32,650
- I don't know who will win.
- Seriously.

2104
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:35,280
Kyeong Hwan.

2105
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,550
The inner course.

2106
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:38,090
Take the inner course.

2107
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:39,420
(My goodness)

2108
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:42,320
Hey, Kyeong Hwan!

2109
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,720
Hurry up!

2110
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,400
(While Heo Jun Hwan
can't get hold of himself)

2111
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,170
- Ye Eun.
- Yes?

2112
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,570
Are you doing okay?

2113
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:55,000
Yes.

2114
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,610
They're like
the father and daughter.

2115
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:58,610
(The father and daughter
who are pitiful for some reason)

2116
01:08:58,610 --> 01:08:59,910
Good.

2117
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:02,040
- Kyeong Hwan!
- Good.

2118
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,580
(The father and daughter
with a hunched back take the lead.)

2119
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,080
Be careful.

2120
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:10,850
- Heo Jun Hwan!
- Be careful.

2121
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:12,550
(Father Jee begins to falter!)

2122
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:13,620
Heo Jun Hwan!

2123
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:15,220
(My goodness)

2124
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:19,230
(Inching forward)

2125
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:20,460
Be careful.

2126
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,460
That's good.

2127
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:24,330
(Ji Hyo uses a new technique
of pushing the sled forward.)

2128
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:27,570
(Thanks to that, the pair
succeeds in getting ahead!)

2129
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:29,500
- They got ahead.
- Be careful.

2130
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,640
That's good.

2131
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:32,210
- They got ahead.
- That's good.

2132
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:33,740
That's good.

2133
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:35,980
(The friends who were born in
the year of the rooster get ahead.)

2134
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:38,080
They can go faster
since Ji Hyo is moving her body.

2135
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,410
- Ye Eun.
- Yes?

2136
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:41,320
- Are you following me?
- Yes.

2137
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,780
- Be careful.
- That's good.

2138
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:45,220
(Skating elegantly)

2139
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:47,320
- Hey!
- Gosh, Kyeong Hwan.

2140
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,720
It's game over.

2141
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,390
- It's a chance!
- We'll crash into each other.

2142
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:52,430
- Be funny in a natural way.
- Kyeong Hwan!

2143
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:53,890
- They'll crash into each other.
- Kyeong Hwan!

2144
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,360
- Be funny in a natural way.
- Hey.

2145
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,570
(The gap between them lessens.)

2146
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:01,200
(Team Jae Seok, Team Jong Kook)

2147
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,670
Good. They're close.

2148
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,510
Take off the belt.

2149
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:05,540
The belt.

2150
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,410
- They're close.
- Fasten it like this.

2151
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:09,010
- They're close.
- Here.

2152
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:10,040
This is fun.

2153
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,510
- Good.
- It's a fierce match.

2154
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:13,010
- It's a fierce match.
- It's so fierce.

2155
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,020
(The slowpokes' race is cutthroat.)

2156
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,080
Hurry up and go.

2157
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,920
- Balance yourself.
- Pull it out.

2158
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:19,220
- Come on.
- There you go. That's it.

2159
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:20,320
- Good luck.
- Balance yourself.

2160
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,490
- There he goes.
- Ye Eun, lift up your legs.

2161
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,590
- There he goes.
- Lift up your legs.

2162
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:24,020
Hey, Se Chan.

2163
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:25,260
All right. There he goes.

2164
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,260
- What's this?
- Hey.

2165
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,130
- I mean...
- All done.

2166
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:30,430
What are you doing?

2167
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:32,430
- Hey.
- No. Pull it.

2168
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:33,870
Hurry up.

2169
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,370
You need to go.

2170
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:36,370
Look at him.

2171
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,540
(Screaming)

2172
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:40,270
I'm scared!

2173
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:45,910
(Bumping)

2174
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:49,850
(Jong Kook doesn't care
if she bumps into the wall.)

2175
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,150
(A crazy race)

2176
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:55,990
He's fast.

2177
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:57,090
- I love it.
- Be careful.

2178
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:58,260
I love it.

2179
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:00,660
(Compared to the dad's sledding,
the horsepower is unrivaled.)

2180
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,260
Jong Kook, you're good.

2181
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,200
(She lowers the speed with her hands
because she's scared.)

2182
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,500
- Jong Kook, be careful.
- She'll fly off.

2183
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,170
(They enter the corner again.)

2184
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:08,670
He's like a monster.

2185
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:09,700
(Screaming)

2186
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:11,840
You're doing well.

2187
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:14,580
(Jong Kook's sled
turned into a bumper car.)

2188
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:17,880
Look at him.

2189
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:22,250
Hey, he's like a monster.

2190
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,420
He was so fast.

2191
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,520
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

2192
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,690
Hurry up and come.

2193
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,960
You're doing well. That's good.

2194
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:30,360
We just need to switch quickly.

2195
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:31,590
Okay. Good.

2196
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:33,990
Take off the belt.
Take off the belt now.

2197
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:36,130
- Move, Kyeong Hwan.
- Move out of the way.

2198
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:37,300
Move.

2199
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:39,500
That's good. Haha.

2200
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,440
- I'm scared.
- He's fast.

2201
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:44,040
I'm scared.

2202
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,040
(He picks up the speed
with his short legs.)

2203
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:48,640
(While Ye Eun enjoys
a bumper car ride once again)

2204
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,710
Come on.

2205
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,080
How do I put it on?

2206
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:53,950
How do I put it on?

2207
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,780
What are you doing?

2208
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:58,090
- Go.
- Gosh, Kyeong Hwan.

2209
01:11:58,150 --> 01:11:59,350
Move out of the way.

2210
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:02,860
- Good.
- Jae Seok is fast.

2211
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,360
Come on.

2212
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,430
I'm scared.

2213
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:06,690
Jae Seok is going.

2214
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:08,460
Come on.

2215
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,560
(He skates along the corner.)

2216
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:12,270
Be careful.

2217
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:14,640
- Jae Seok doesn't weigh a lot.
- That's right.

2218
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,440
(It's different from skating alone.)

2219
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,670
- Jae Seok doesn't weigh a lot.
- That's right.

2220
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:19,910
He can't pull her.

2221
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:21,180
You need strength for this.

2222
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:22,380
You can't do it without strength.

2223
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,380
- Let's go.
- You need strength.

2224
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,410
- He doesn't have strength.
- That's right.

2225
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,980
- You're going faster.
- It's nice...

2226
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:30,320
- to have strength.
- Seriously.

2227
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,020
- You did well.
- I weigh much more.

2228
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:33,520
(An unexpected factor
widens the gap between the two.)

2229
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,190
Let's go, Jae Seok!

2230
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:37,390
Jae Seok doesn't weigh much.

2231
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:38,690
(Team Jae Seok, Team Jong Kook)

2232
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:40,330
Ye Eun, are you doing okay?

2233
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:43,060
Hurry up and get on the sled.

2234
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,900
(The real skaters will pull the sled
without an elastic strap.)

2235
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,030
- What now?
- Switch to the other sled.

2236
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:47,030
- Sit on this one.
- Alright.

2237
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,470
- Come on.
- Take it slow. Don't get hurt.

2238
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:49,500
Get on.

2239
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,170
- All right.
- Take it slow.

2240
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:53,540
(The weak one comes it
as he falters.)

2241
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,710
Let's go.

2242
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:56,040
Hey, you're nearly done.

2243
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,410
If you hold on tight,
I'll get going.

2244
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:00,010
Hurry up and get on the sled.

2245
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:01,350
Hurry up and get on it.

2246
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:03,020
Be careful.

2247
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,760
(Screaming)

2248
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,920
Are you okay?

2249
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:12,260
(She slams into the wall.)

2250
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:13,630
- Okay!
- Hey.

2251
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:14,860
Okay. That's good.

2252
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:16,860
Are you okay?

2253
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:18,100
(Yes.)

2254
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,370
I'm set. Go!

2255
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:22,640
(The number 1 skater in the world
chases the others with Ji Hyo.)

2256
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:29,610
(Smooth cornering)

2257
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,080
This is fun!

2258
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,410
(It's the last lap!
Whoever comes in first will win!)

2259
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:34,550
He's different.

2260
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,480
- He's different.
- Let's go.

2261
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:38,890
- Ji Won!
- Sung Woo, you'll win!

2262
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:41,190
(Sung Woo is leading,
but Ji Won has almost caught up.)

2263
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:43,690
(Ji Won might turn the tables!)

2264
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:46,160
- Sung Woo!
- Ji Won!

2265
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:47,800
Ji Won, no!

2266
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:49,660
Ji Won!

2267
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,270
Let's turn the tables.

2268
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:53,070
(Who'll cross
the finish line first?)

2269
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:57,040
(Team Jong Kook's Sung Woo)

2270
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:00,410
(They cross the finish line!)

2271
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:02,740
(Disappointed)

2272
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:04,240
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

2273
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:06,680
- You slammed into the wall.
- He nearly made it.

2274
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,220
- In the last mission,
- It's too bad.

2275
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:12,020
- Team Jong Kook won.
- Okay!

2276
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:15,190
Hold on a second.

2277
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:17,790
- Okay!
- Hold on a second.

2278
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:19,060
That's too bad.

2279
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:21,630
I'll use a card.

2280
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:24,460
I'll use a reset card.

2281
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,600
- What?
- What?

2282
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,870
- Is there such a thing?
- Really?

2283
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:27,900
- What?
- Gosh,

2284
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,170
- Is there such a thing?
- come on.

2285
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:30,970
A reset card? That's good.

2286
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,270
Ji Won, nice.

2287
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:34,070
- Is there such a thing?
- We won.

2288
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,910
- For goodness' sake.
- We won once.

2289
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:37,480
A reset card? That's good.

2290
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,180
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

2291
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:40,250
- Gosh.
- Is there such a thing?

2292
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:41,420
(Seok Sam Life Insurance)

2293
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:42,950
Grandma, what do you do?

2294
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:44,750
I sell insurance policies.

2295
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,920
Seok Sam Life Insurance.

2296
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,520
Did you lose in a mission?

2297
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,790
Don't worry.

2298
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:51,630
With Seok Sam Life Insurance,

2299
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:54,660
you can reset the result
and have a rematch.

2300
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,000
Is that what
Seok Sam Life Insurance can do?

2301
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
- That's good.
- It's so persistent.

2302
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,230
- Congratulations.
- For goodness' sake.

2303
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:01,500
He used it for the last mission.

2304
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,340
It was our very first win.

2305
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:05,110
It was our very first win.

2306
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:06,610
- This is the worst.
- Seriously.

2307
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:07,910
This is seriously the worst.

2308
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:09,540
- You used it well.
- Let's have a rematch.

2309
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,310
- You used it well.
- I saved it for this moment.

2310
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:12,550
- You used it well.
- Ji Won.

2311
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,850
- You used it well.
- Are you insane?

2312
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:14,980
I'm glad you saved it.

2313
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:17,250
- It's okay. Okay.
- Yes.

2314
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:19,750
We can beat them again.
We're in a better position.

2315
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,290
The first skaters, come on out.

2316
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,190
Jae Seok, are you going first?

2317
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:24,420
I'm the first skater.

2318
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,460
Why?

2319
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:26,630
- We switched the order.
- Okay.

2320
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:28,130
Jong Kook, you should be...

2321
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:31,160
- the first skater. Okay.
- Okay!

2322
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:33,530
Who's the second skater?

2323
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:34,970
- We won't tell you.
- He has a lot of anger.

2324
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:36,070
Okay.

2325
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,570
Don't come near me.
I skate like this.

2326
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:40,140
Okay.

2327
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:42,710
- Be careful.
- We're starting the game now.

2328
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:43,740
Good.

2329
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,280
- Good.
- Okay.

2330
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:46,480
He has so much power.

2331
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,320
Ye Eun weighs more, so...

2332
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,050
- Hey...
- It helps.

2333
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:52,420
It just seems that way
because Jong Kook charges forward.

2334
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,690
(Will Team Jong Kook be able
to win again?)

2335
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:56,460
- Ye Eun.
- It's 69.7kg.

2336
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:58,160
You beat Jong Kook.

2337
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,060
- Good luck.
- Be careful.

2338
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:02,560
- Good.
- Be careful.

2339
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:04,360
That's good, Jae Seok.

2340
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,000
(Jong Kook charges forward
in the beginning.)

2341
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:07,800
- He's fast.
- Be careful.

2342
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,000
(At that moment)

2343
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,640
(Jae Seok trips over Ye Eun
and falls down.)

2344
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:15,110
Ye Eun, get up.

2345
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:16,310
Jong Kook, hold on.

2346
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:18,110
(Why do they keep going?)

2347
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:19,750
(Ye Eun's point of view)

2348
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,820
- Hold on.
- Get up.

2349
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:24,050
- Oh, no.
- What should I do?

2350
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:25,790
- Hold on.
- Get up.

2351
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:27,450
- He's pulling Jae Seok too.
- Hold on.

2352
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:28,460
Get up.

2353
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:30,160
- Hold on.
- Hurry up and get up.

2354
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:31,660
(One angry bull)

2355
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:33,390
- He's so strong.
- Hold on.

2356
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,960
(He can pull three people.)

2357
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,760
No one can beat that strength.

2358
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,670
- Hey.
- Hold on.

2359
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:42,200
Stop.

2360
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,440
(He hasn't seen such a sight
during 18 years of skating.)

2361
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,770
- Hold on.
- Are you okay?

2362
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,310
(Lying down)

2363
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:49,880
- Jae Seok.
- Hold on.

2364
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:54,050
(She gets dragged on her back.)

2365
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:56,580
- Gosh.
- What's this?

2366
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:58,790
- Gosh.
- What's this?

2367
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:00,290
Ye Eun.

2368
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:01,790
She fell off.

2369
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:03,790
Where are you going?

2370
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,730
- Where are you going?
- Stop!

2371
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:07,630
He's like a bull.

2372
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,360
(She can't even get up.)

2373
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:11,970
Are you okay?

2374
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:13,470
Where is he going?

2375
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:15,140
What?

2376
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,900
- Gosh.
- Mister!

2377
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,770
- What's this?
- What?

2378
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,140
Ye Eun.

2379
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,310
- You shouldn't have gotten off.
- I mean...

2380
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:24,850
- Hey.
- I mean...

2381
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:27,580
- Isn't it a foul?
- I fell off.

2382
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:29,080
He held on to me like this.

2383
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,320
She fell off.

2384
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:32,020
I pulled the sled so hard.

2385
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:33,650
Didn't you feel
that something was off?

2386
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:35,920
- Didn't you know?
- I thought she was heavy.

2387
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:37,560
- You pulled three people.
- You thought Ye Eun was heavy.

2388
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,390
"Ye Eun would weigh this much."

2389
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:40,760
Yes. I thought that.

2390
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:42,700
- I mean...
- You pulled three people.

2391
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,860
Wasn't Ye Eun on the sled?

2392
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,030
I wasn't on the sled.

2393
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:48,670
- Seriously, he's a bull.
- My goodness.

2394
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:51,770
We competed against him
for 15 years.

2395
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:54,270
- Unbelievable.
- He's like a tractor.

2396
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:55,810
Where was he? I was so surprised.

2397
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:57,840
Start over.

2398
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,550
- You guys should start over.
- Sit.

2399
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,210
I used up my strength.

2400
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,420
That's perfect.

2401
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:03,650
- Our strategy worked.
- Now, they'll match in power.

2402
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:04,890
- We were doing so well.
- Go.

2403
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:06,220
Get ready.

2404
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:10,520
- Go.
- Go.

2405
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:12,290
(Screaming)

2406
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:16,230
- That's good.
- My goodness.

2407
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,930
(They crash into each other again!)

2408
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:22,700
(Jae Seok grabs Ye Eun again!)

2409
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:25,210
There they go again.

2410
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:28,680
(The skater doubles over
in laughter.)

2411
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:33,580
(It's a déjà vu.)

2412
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:35,920
(The number of passengers
multiples by 3 again.)

2413
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,050
Come on.

2414
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:39,050
- What kind of comedy is this?
- Hold on.

2415
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:40,750
Hold on.

2416
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:42,390
- Jong Kook.
- Hey.

2417
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:44,690
He's like Santa Claus.

2418
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:46,760
- Jong Kook.
- Ye Eun.

2419
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,130
Ye Eun, take off your jacket.

2420
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:50,260
(Song Santa is getting to work
with a crazy reindeer.)

2421
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:51,870
Take off your jacket.

2422
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,970
- Hey, stop.
- Your jacket.

2423
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:00,670
- Come on.
- Let's go.

2424
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:02,640
Let's go.

2425
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,950
(It's the last corner.)

2426
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:06,850
(Screaming)

2427
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:10,120
(Thanks to the muscular Rudolph,
two teams arrive at the same time.)

2428
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,620
It's your turn. Haha.

2429
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:13,690
- Here. Do it.
- Jae Seok.

2430
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:15,520
Hurry up and come here. Go.

2431
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,660
Okay.

2432
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:19,060
I didn't use any strength.

2433
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:20,660
Hurry up and give me the belt.

2434
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:22,030
Hurry up. There you go.

2435
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:23,300
- Go.
- Fasten it.

2436
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:26,100
- Gosh. There he goes.
- All right.

2437
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,370
- Ye Eun.
- Good luck.

2438
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,600
- Wake up.
- He's fast.

2439
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,470
He's too fast.

2440
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:34,040
- Okay.
- Haha is fast.

2441
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,540
He's too fast.

2442
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:37,240
(Screaming)

2443
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,880
(Ye Eun continues to suffer.)

2444
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,010
Haha is fast.

2445
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:41,950
- He's fast.
- Good.

2446
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:44,480
- Haha is fast.
- You got this, Se Chan.

2447
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,890
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2448
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:46,990
(Se Chan is a hidden skating expert
from Dongducheon.)

2449
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:49,320
- Haha.
- Come on.

2450
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,560
There you go.

2451
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:52,690
He's closing the distance.

2452
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,630
You can do it, Se Chan.

2453
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:55,630
(He chases after Haha
in the straight part of the lane.)

2454
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:57,560
- Let's go.
- You're nearly done.

2455
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:00,130
Haha!

2456
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,330
You're nearly done.

2457
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:02,700
- No.
- That's good.

2458
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,640
That's it.

2459
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,810
This is bad.

2460
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:06,840
That's good.

2461
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:09,210
(Se Chan fails to get ahead
due to faltering,)

2462
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:10,980
(but he manages to close the gap.)

2463
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,650
- Gosh.
- Let's go.

2464
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:15,520
Fasten the belt properly.

2465
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,020
- Nice.
- Fasten the belt properly.

2466
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,620
- The belt.
- Take off the belt.

2467
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:21,520
- It's fast.
- Kyeong Hwan.

2468
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:25,460
Nice.

2469
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:27,130
- Take off the belt.
- Be careful.

2470
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:28,700
(Ye Eun gets up
since the strap gets tangled.)

2471
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,230
- Ye Eun, sit down.
- I mean...

2472
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:32,570
- Sit down!
- Just go!

2473
01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:33,970
- Go!
- Sit down, you punk!

2474
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:35,240
Go.

2475
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,870
Sit down!

2476
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:38,970
- Sit down, you punk!
- Fasten the belt for me.

2477
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:40,410
Fasten the belt for me.

2478
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:42,310
- Let's go.
- Push.

2479
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,080
Push.

2480
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:47,280
(They set off belatedly.)

2481
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,080
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2482
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:51,320
Keep skating. Go, Kyeong Hwan.

2483
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:52,520
- Hurry up.
- Be careful.

2484
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:54,490
(Roaring)

2485
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,860
- Gosh.
- Be careful.

2486
01:20:57,790 --> 01:20:59,290
(Seok Jin's legs
suddenly turn wobbly.)

2487
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:01,360
- Let's go.
- Be careful.

2488
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,600
Get on with it.

2489
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:04,160
- Hurry up.
- You know, Ye Eun...

2490
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,830
Ye Eun makes it hard
to go around the corner.

2491
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:09,140
- Go slow.
- All right.

2492
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:10,500
There's a big gap.

2493
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,710
(There's a big gap
between the two teams.)

2494
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:13,570
- This is bad.
- Raise your feet.

2495
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:18,210
(Jong Kook attempts
to block his path.)

2496
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:19,580
Hold on.

2497
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:21,880
Ji Hyo.

2498
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,720
(Team Jae Seok succeeds in
switching to the last runner!)

2499
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,890
I'm settled. Go.

2500
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:29,360
Let's go.

2501
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:31,160
- Come on.
- Be careful.

2502
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,160
You got this.

2503
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,160
(Team Jong Kook, Team Jae Seok)

2504
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,330
(Sung Woo comes to pick Ye Eun up.)

2505
01:21:34,330 --> 01:21:35,400
Let's go.

2506
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:36,800
Take it slow.

2507
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,970
Ye Eun, get on the sled.

2508
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:42,200
- Play with them.
- Let's go.

2509
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,700
Ji Hyo, play with them.

2510
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,670
Let's play with them. Come on over.

2511
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:47,010
Hurry up and come.

2512
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:49,380
- Seok Jin ruined it all.
- For goodness' sake.

2513
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,540
- Gosh.
- Seok Jin...

2514
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:52,050
- ruined it all.
- Hurry up and come.

2515
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:56,680
- Let's go.
- Ji Hyo, lift your feet.

2516
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:58,790
- Ji Won, speed up.
- Okay.

2517
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:00,750
Ji Won, speed up.

2518
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:03,020
(The two of them are relaxed.)

2519
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:05,230
- All right.
- They'll lose.

2520
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:07,160
(Sung Woo aims to come from behind
when their guards are down.)

2521
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:08,560
Play.

2522
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,800
- Ji Won.
- Hey, Ji Won.

2523
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,200
(What?)

2524
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,700
- Here they come.
- Come here.

2525
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,870
(They're right behind.)

2526
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:21,810
They're right behind us.

2527
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,180
I can't tell who'll win.

2528
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:24,680
(They'll reach the finish line
if they go around the corner!)

2529
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:27,380
I can't tell who'll win.

2530
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:29,580
(Turning)

2531
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,950
(They begin to speed up.)

2532
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,430
(Team Jong Kook's Sung Woo
chases after them fiercely.)

2533
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:43,430
(Will he be able to come from behind
and win?)

2534
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:47,570
(1st place: Team Jae Seok,
4 minutes and 5.13 seconds)

2535
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:49,770
(2nd place: Team Jong Kook,
4 minutes 5.59 seconds)

2536
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:52,670
(1st place fairy, Park Ji Won)

2537
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:56,240
(Team Jae Seok won.)

2538
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:57,380
We lost.

2539
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:58,810
(It was a neck-and-neck match.)

2540
01:22:58,810 --> 01:23:00,010
I'm annoyed.

2541
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:01,750
(Sweet)

2542
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,320
Seok Jin, why did you do that?

2543
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,390
They set off much earlier
than we did. Seriously.

2544
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:06,720
I have so much strength left.

2545
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:08,560
We were pulling a rocking boulder.

2546
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,090
All right.

2547
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:11,520
Yes.

2548
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:12,660
Let's have a rematch.

2549
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:14,690
We were winning, Seok Jin.

2550
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:16,300
(Jong Kook blames the oldest runner
with the worst record.)

2551
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,930
It was hard to change the belt.

2552
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:19,330
Don't be ridiculous.

2553
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:20,700
- I...
- I'm exhausted.

2554
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:21,870
- It wasn't like that.
- I have so much strength left.

2555
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:23,940
You guys should've helped me
put it on.

2556
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:25,210
Come on.

2557
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:26,870
You should've pulled.

2558
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:28,210
Ye Eun.

2559
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:30,310
- We lost in the end.
- For goodness' sake.

2560
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:32,350
Team Jae Seok won...

2561
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:34,950
- the last mission as well.
- Unbelievable.

2562
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:36,220
Let's go!

2563
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,320
Jae Seok, thank you
for your hard work.

2564
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,890
We only took one win.
You undid that.

2565
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,560
Team Jae Seok that won
will get the last envelope...

2566
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,960
- of the sponsor.
- Could you move aside?

2567
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:47,130
Watch them.

2568
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:48,290
Pick one, Kyeong Hwan.

2569
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:51,260
Only one envelope has a sponsor.

2570
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,300
Is that so?

2571
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:55,540
It's been a dud
three times in a row.

2572
01:23:55,770 --> 01:23:57,670
Mine's a dud too.

2573
01:23:57,670 --> 01:23:59,840
- Why are they all a dud?
- It's a dud.

2574
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:00,840
(If everyone has a dud...)

2575
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:03,440
Goodness.

2576
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,680
(Park Ji Won got a sponsor.)

2577
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,150
It's a dud.

2578
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:07,750
Ji Won.

2579
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:09,920
The world's no. 1 is different.

2580
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,290
- The luck...
- He's lucky too.

2581
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:15,090
(He was lucky 2 times in a row.)

2582
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:16,790
This team has many things.

2583
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,490
- They have 4.
- Ji Won has 4?

2584
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:20,560
- There's one with four.
- We're rich.

2585
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:22,500
(Sponsor: Clean Tortilla)

2586
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,630
(He's got 4 sponsors to brag about.)

2587
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:27,670
You picked the last envelope.

2588
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:30,840
Is there anyone who would like
to exchange with the team that lost?

2589
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,710
One person can exchange theirs.

2590
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:34,470
- Do you have something to exchange?
- I...

2591
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:35,940
I don't need to. I have three.

2592
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:37,510
I have enough.

2593
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:39,010
I have 1 with 2 stars.

2594
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:40,880
- Can I switch mine with two stars?
- You can.

2595
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,520
I have the information.

2596
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,850
- What information?
- Please tell me.

2597
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,250
Help me.

2598
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:46,750
(They check it right away.)

2599
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:48,020
Ddoddo Lottery...

2600
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,420
has five stars.

2601
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,620
I'll exchange mine.

2602
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:52,990
With whose?

2603
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:54,330
I'll...

2604
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:55,860
I'll exchange Hatred Gallery...

2605
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:58,800
- with Ddoddo Lottery.
- Ddoddo Lottery?

2606
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,900
(Sung Woo was chosen.)

2607
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,870
(Sighing)

2608
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:05,240
- Gosh.
- He's sighing.

2609
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,670
- The number of stars.
- The Gallery.

2610
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:10,480
Can I still use the gallery?

2611
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:12,780
I don't think so.

2612
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:16,450
What is with this?
The mission ability...

2613
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:18,050
is only about wearing a wig.

2614
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:20,220
- There's no ability.
- There's nothing.

2615
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:22,690
I've failed
with the number of stars.

2616
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:24,160
I can remove...

2617
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,730
- someone's star, right?
- Yes.

2618
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:27,290
(I can remove
someone's star, right?)

2619
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:28,630
(Remove someone's star?)

2620
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:29,700
From our team?

2621
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:30,960
He's been silent so far.
He's doing this all of a sudden?

2622
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,900
- He's scary.
- Why is he doing this at the end?

2623
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:34,900
(Ominous)

2624
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,070
From our team?

2625
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,300
From everyone.

2626
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:38,970
- From everyone?
- From us?

2627
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,840
Before the final announcement,
you can erase the stars...

2628
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,110
of one sponsor
of the player you want,

2629
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:44,610
regardless of the team.

2630
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:47,210
(He can erase all the stars
of 1 sponsor from 1 person.)

2631
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:49,080
- From everyone?
- From us?

2632
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,150
- But...
- He has no reason to erase ours.

2633
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:52,550
They wouldn't have many stars...

2634
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:55,190
- because they kept losing, right?
- Right.

2635
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:56,320
- We don't have many stars.
- We don't have.

2636
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,420
- You should erase theirs.
- We don't have.

2637
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:59,790
(The poor team
with nothing to take from)

2638
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,790
Winter stands for Park Ji Won.

2639
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:03,200
Park Ji Won forever!

2640
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,900
If Ji Won chooses someone,

2641
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:06,170
that person will get a penalty
no matter what.

2642
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:09,500
- Yes.
- Two, two, three.

2643
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,740
You have two, right?

2644
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,140
(He's counting the sponsors
of his team.)

2645
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:16,610
- stands for Park Ji Won!
- Then,

2646
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:19,110
things will get interesting
if I get rid of 1 with 3 sponsors.

2647
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:21,050
(Things will get interesting
if I get rid of 1 with 3 sponsors.)

2648
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:22,080
(Only Jae Seok has 3 sponsors.)

2649
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,580
You'll pick the person
with three sponsors to erase?

2650
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,390
- Ji Won.
- Applause.

2651
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:27,750
- For the team...
- Yes.

2652
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,020
- We...
- Does that include our team too?

2653
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:31,960
- We worked so hard as a team.
- Yes, I know.

2654
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:35,230
- He took care of me so well.
- Yes.

2655
01:26:35,230 --> 01:26:37,160
So maybe I could give him
the card from the last mission...

2656
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,770
as a gift.

2657
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:42,440
- That would be meaningful.
- What?

2658
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,370
What are you doing?

2659
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,070
- Ji Won.
- What are you doing, Ji Won?

2660
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,180
- That's right.
- Well done.

2661
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:51,340
- It's great.
- Well done.

2662
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:52,710
- You're the best.
- You're doing great.

2663
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:53,910
I'll erase the stars
from Big Star Coffee.

2664
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:55,520
- Then all the stars...
- Goodness.

2665
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,780
- Only one.
- of the coffee sponsor...

2666
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,050
will be erased.

2667
01:26:58,050 --> 01:26:59,320
But seriously,

2668
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,190
why are we doing this
within the same team?

2669
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:05,430
- I'll announce the final result.
- Okay.

2670
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:08,700
- Team Jae Seok has 50 stars.
- We have 50 stars.

2671
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:09,730
What about us?

2672
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:11,900
- You have 21 stars.
- That's us?

2673
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,570
- We're no match.
- We're no match.

2674
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:15,100
We lost so badly.

2675
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:17,600
I told you that three people
from the team that won...

2676
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,670
- can get the prize.
- Yes.

2677
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:20,970
- First place...
- Se Chan?

2678
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:22,710
has 19 stars in total.

2679
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:24,480
- What?
- It's Park Ji Won.

2680
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,950
- That's a lot.
- He's really a champion.

2681
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:28,250
- He's amazing.
- He's really amazing.

2682
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:32,150
And in second place is
Yang Se Chan with 12 stars.

2683
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:34,250
- Look. It's Yang Se Chan.
- It's this one.

2684
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,960
- What is it?
- It's one sponsor.

2685
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:38,960
- That's amazing.
- There was one with seven stars?

2686
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,890
Third place was originally...

2687
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:43,160
- Jae Seok with eight points.
- It was me.

2688
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:44,430
But now it's...

2689
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:45,500
(I'm sorry.)

2690
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:49,000
the person with seven stars
and a one-point difference...

2691
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,240
(The person whose rank went up
because Ji Won erased his stars)

2692
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,640
It's Heo Kyeong Hwan.

2693
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,410
(3rd Heo Kyeong Hwan)

2694
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,510
(The bronze medal performance)

2695
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:00,750
It's thanks to those clothes.

2696
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:02,620
Today's prize...

2697
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:04,980
is a Korean beef set which is good
for your health.

2698
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:06,990
- The beef is good. It's fresh.
- That's good.

2699
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,720
- I'm getting it thanks to you.
- Good.

2700
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:12,130
It's meat.

2701
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:13,990
- Okay.
- Now I'll announce the three...

2702
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:16,400
- who will get the penalty.
- This is the important part.

2703
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,300
In the last place,

2704
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:20,300
we have two people.

2705
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,270
They have three stars.

2706
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:23,900
What did they do today?

2707
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:25,410
In the last place, we have...

2708
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:27,940
- Jee Seok Jin and Ji Ye Eun.
- Okay.

2709
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:29,410
I'm tired of this.

2710
01:28:29,410 --> 01:28:31,180
- Let's do it.
- Okay!

2711
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:32,180
- Cross.
- Ye Eun.

2712
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:34,310
- Why did you switch earlier?
- But...

2713
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:36,120
- What's wrong with you?
- She switched earlier,

2714
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,220
but the number of stars
was the same.

2715
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:38,320
The number of stars was the same?

2716
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,650
- You should have switched well.
- Why didn't you switch?

2717
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:40,990
- You should have switched well.
- You should have switched with him.

2718
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:43,860
Next, this person has one more star
than them.

2719
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:44,920
(The last penalty receiver
with 1 more star than the last)

2720
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:47,490
The person with four stars.

2721
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:52,130
Haha will receive the penalty.

2722
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:54,370
- What is this? I wore a wig.
- He got it.

2723
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,800
I've done nothing today.

2724
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,440
- Your face...
- Jong Kook and Sung Woo...

2725
01:28:58,440 --> 01:28:59,510
are exempt from the penalty.

2726
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:00,770
Okay!

2727
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:03,440
- It's a relief.
- Hey.

2728
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:04,940
Today's penalty...

2729
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:09,350
is to go to your cars
while doing lunges...

2730
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:11,980
under the supervision
of Jong Kook and the athletes.

2731
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:13,590
That's nice.

2732
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:16,590
(It's a chance to pump their thighs
like the national team athletes.)

2733
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:18,460
- It's what Seok Jin hates most.
- I hate it most.

2734
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:19,990
Lunges...

2735
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:22,400
The national team athletes
can teach them how to do lunges.

2736
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,830
They teach you how to do lunges
when you learn how to skate.

2737
01:29:24,830 --> 01:29:26,570
- Ninety degrees.
- You have to go further down.

2738
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:28,230
Go further down.

2739
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:29,600
More.

2740
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,800
Go down slowly
until it becomes 90 degrees.

2741
01:29:31,870 --> 01:29:33,810
- Your back should be straight.
- That's not correct.

2742
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:35,580
- That's not correct, Ye Eun.
- That's not right.

2743
01:29:35,710 --> 01:29:37,210
Fold the back leg.

2744
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,950
You have to fold the back leg!

2745
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,150
- That's right.
- That's right.

2746
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:42,820
My legs!

2747
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:44,980
Keep going without resting.

2748
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:46,250
You have to squat further down.

2749
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:47,450
The leg behind.

2750
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:49,460
The leg behind. Well done.

2751
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:50,760
Three steps are too much.

2752
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,290
Your legs aren't long enough.

2753
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:53,690
Three steps are too much.

2754
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:54,990
Good.

2755
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:57,000
(Trainer Kook is adding muscles
to the Yeongdeok Snow Crab.)

2756
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
You have to put energy
into your legs.

2757
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,170
You can eat food.

2758
01:29:59,170 --> 01:30:01,270
(Where do you think you're going?)

2759
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:03,140
- Jong Kook.
- One, two, three.

2760
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:04,970
That's right. Again.

2761
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:06,410
Again.

2762
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:07,870
Go on.

2763
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:09,080
You can do it.

2764
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,240
Do it until the end.

2765
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:12,550
- Until the end.
- My legs.

2766
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,680
- Your legs hurt, right?
- Yes. So much.

2767
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:15,980
- Then you've done the right thing.
- Right?

2768
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:17,180
- Yes.
- Thank you.

2769
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,190
Just until the car.

2770
01:30:19,190 --> 01:30:20,950
(Laughing)

2771
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:22,090
Just until the car.

2772
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,260
(He pushes him with a smile.)

2773
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:25,630
- Haha.
- Which car are you taking?

2774
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:26,790
Bye!

2775
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:28,190
- Bye.
- My car is here.

2776
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:30,100
- Okay. Let's go there.
- See you!

2777
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:31,360
I hope you make it alive!

2778
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:32,670
Up to the door handle.

2779
01:30:33,370 --> 01:30:34,670
(He really went to his car
while doing lunges without resting!)

2780
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:35,900
Well done.

2781
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,600
- Well done.
- Okay.

2782
01:30:37,670 --> 01:30:39,570
You have to sit down.

2783
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:41,610
Fold the leg that's behind.

2784
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:42,980
You shouldn't do it like that.

2785
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:44,180
Come two steps back.

2786
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:45,710
Again.

2787
01:30:46,810 --> 01:30:48,820
You have to do it again. Go.

2788
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:50,620
Sit down. Okay. Get up.

2789
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:52,750
- Sit down. Get up.
- Seriously.

2790
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:54,590
Sit down. Get up.

2791
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:57,120
Don't lower your upper body.
Fold your legs!

2792
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,720
Sit down.

2793
01:30:58,790 --> 01:31:00,360
Fold them.

2794
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,560
- You're not using your core.
- The upper body.

2795
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,730
- You should bring it up.
- Bring up your upper body.

2796
01:31:04,730 --> 01:31:06,400
You should keep your back straight.

2797
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,500
Engage your core.

2798
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,140
- Like that.
- You could be sent back.

2799
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:10,170
- Sit down.
- Release everything...

2800
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:11,900
Stop bending forward. Come back.

2801
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:17,080
Is she going to swear?

2802
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,110
(Sung Woo seems to have watched
the clip that's going around.)

2803
01:31:18,110 --> 01:31:19,110
- Do it now.
- Get low!

2804
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:20,880
- She could swear.
- Why do you keep...

2805
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,550
Why do you keep...
Your stomach is falling down.

2806
01:31:23,550 --> 01:31:26,450
(Please keep quiet,
you amazing person!)

2807
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:28,920
(Falling down)

2808
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,420
(Foul-mouthed Ji made two
national team athletes kneel down.)

2809
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:32,060
Raise your upper body.

2810
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:33,560
Get ready.

2811
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:35,530
- I'm a real fan.
- Do it.

2812
01:31:35,730 --> 01:31:36,830
- I'm a real fan.
- Get up.

2813
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:37,930
- You're the best.
- Again.

2814
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:39,130
- My friends...
- I'm a fan.

2815
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:41,000
- Bye.
- Thank you, friends.

2816
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
- I'll cheer for you.
- Thank you.

2817
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,400
Keep going.

2818
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,770
Sit down.

2819
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:46,770
No.

2820
01:31:47,070 --> 01:31:48,710
Let's enjoy two more.

2821
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:49,710
One more.

2822
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:50,780
You're done.

2823
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:52,040
Off you go. Okay!

2824
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:53,850
- Bye.
- Bye.

2825
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:54,880
Bye.

2826
01:31:54,950 --> 01:31:56,950
Okay. Let's go.

2827
01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:58,520
- Bye.
- All the best.

2828
01:31:58,520 --> 01:31:59,650
- Don't get injured.
- I won't. Thank you.

2829
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:00,990
- Jong Kook!
- What?

2830
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:04,260
(Jong Kook wore clothes with color!)

2831
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:06,490
(It's time for a new TV
rating notice for spring!)

2832
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:09,130
(It snowed heavily the day before.)

2833
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:11,460
(The members go searching
for spring!)

2834
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:13,630
(Don't buy chrysanthemums.)

2835
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:15,800
(They buy flowers
to melt the frozen hearts.)

2836
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:20,570
(They're off to dress up
from head to toe.)

2837
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:24,840
(They're reborn as spring itself.)

2838
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,450
You're the lady in "Snowpiercer."

2839
01:32:26,450 --> 01:32:28,110
I'm going to get G-Dragon.

2840
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:30,880
(They came to the mountain
to get spring!)

2841
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:35,620
(They keep climbing,
but they can't find spring.)

2842
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:36,990
Let's rest a bit!

2843
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:41,060
(How far will they go
to find spring?)

2844
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,190
(Going Up the TV Rating Notice)
