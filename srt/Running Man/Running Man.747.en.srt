1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,610
- The weather is really nice.
- Right.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,980
This is amazing.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,340
It should definitely be
on social media.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,950
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,510
- Hello.
- This place is really cool.

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,620
It's so nice.

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,180
Should I sit here like this?

8
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,950
I love it.

9
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,820
You do? Are you done
recovering from burnout?

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
(Burnout?)

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,490
- Totally.
- Have you been working less?

12
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,230
I'm totally fine now.

13
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,800
(Ddochi said life was no fun.)

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,600
This is the best way to get over it.

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,830
You should lose all your jobs.

16
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,040
(The veteran entertainer's advice
became the talk of the town.)

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,510
- Have you been working less?
- No.

18
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,280
- Do you want to work?
- I should keep working.

19
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,210
I received a lot of direct messages
that criticized me.

20
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,410
You did?

21
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,820
"Are you being arrogant now?"

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,120
So I've come to my senses.

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,160
- Right.
- And I was scolded by my mom.

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,290
She told me to pray for repentance.

25
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,790
You should pull yourself together.

26
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,390
- You lose your job, and you will...
- No.

27
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,430
- I have to work every day.
- Okay.

28
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

29
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,530
- Hi.
- Hey.

30
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,630
- Why did you start so early?
- Okay!

31
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,140
- The view is nice.
- You look great today.

32
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,810
This is the place where I filmed
the music video for "A Jazz Bar."

33
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,940
- Really?
- Really?

34
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,340
- Right here?
- A long time ago.

35
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,650
It was a long time ago.

36
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,250
(The music video from back then
where he tried to be all cool)

37
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,750
(The jazz bar...)

38
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,850
(has changed like this.)

39
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,520
(A historic site
that should be in a history book)

40
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,820
It has changed a lot.

41
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,190
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

42
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,890
Don't talk about things
that are over 20 years old.

43
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,230
- Hey.
- My goodness.

44
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,500
It's not like a talk has
an expiration date.

45
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,030
- A talk...
- "A Jazz Bar" is...

46
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,930
- a really old song.
- You talk a lot about...

47
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,900
- when you were 20.
- "A Jazz Bar" is an old song.

48
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,510
Do you remember what you did
20 years ago?

49
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,610
- Sure.
- Of course, he remembers that.

50
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,040
- Why would you not remember that?
- This is...

51
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,340
I should watch the music video.

52
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,680
By the way, you two should
exchange your hats or jackets.

53
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,880
- Right.
- Come on. He doesn't know fashion.

54
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,420
- You should... Hey.
- You should match the colors.

55
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,520
Isn't this how a couple is dressed?

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,750
- It looks strange.
- We're a couple today.

57
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,320
You two are a couple.

58
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,430
All right. We have guests for today.

59
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,730
- We have guests? I knew it.
- Guests for today?

60
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,830
- Who are they?
- We have guests today.

61
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,430
- Hey.
- Hello.

62
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,630
It's Yuk Seong Jae.

63
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,400
- Hello.
- It's been a while.

64
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,570
- Hi. Welcome.
- Hello.

65
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,970
- Look who's here.
- It's been a really long time.

66
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,770
- Hello.
- Long time no see, Bona.

67
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,510
(From Bona of WJSN
to Actress Kim Ji Yeon)

68
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,680
("Bona, a Perfect Transformation
into an Acting Idol")

69
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,450
(Kim Ji Yeon)

70
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,620
(An all-around idol with good looks,
who is good at everything...)

71
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,220
(from singing to acting
to even variety shows.)

72
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,790
("Yuk Seong Jae, a Versatile Idol
Who Is Even Good at Acting")

73
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,430
("Yuk Seong Jae, an Acting Idol
Who Appeared Like a Guardian")

74
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,730
(Yuk Seong Jae)

75
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,330
(They are back with the SBS drama,
"The Haunted Palace.")

76
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,040
(It's a historical fantasy
with Seong Jae possessed by yimugi...)

77
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,640
(and Ji Yeon, who is a shaman.)

78
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,840
- Why is your hair so short?
- I know.

79
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,240
- Seong Jae.
- You look a lot better.

80
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,050
- Stand in the middle.
- Right.

81
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,250
- Okay.
- You look great.

82
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,650
- You should come here.
- Okay.

83
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,180
- Stand next to them.
- This is great.

84
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,220
- All right.
- Ye Eun just pushed me to the side.

85
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,490
- Why?
- Why do you keep pushing me?

86
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,030
- Because her face looks big.
- It's her face.

87
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,060
- That's true.
- Right.

88
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,230
- Seong Jae has a small face.
- It's been a while.

89
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,500
(She was staring blankly
at his small head.)

90
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,130
(Stand in the middle.)

91
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,070
(She steps back right away.)

92
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,340
(She's done distancing herself.)

93
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,840
- It's been a long time.
- Seong Jae has a small face.

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,510
- It's been so long.
- Right.

95
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,810
So we have Seong Jae
and Ji Yeon here today.

96
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,080
Hello. Nice to meet you.

97
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,420
In the drama, "The Haunted Palace,"

98
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,720
- you two are working together.
- Right.

99
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,120
What is the drama about?

100
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,820
It's about a palace
that's haunted by a ghost.

101
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,190
- It's not a valuable palace.
- I thought it was valuable.

102
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,130
So it's like a mystery thriller.

103
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,030
It's a story about resolving
the resentment of the ghosts...

104
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,600
- in the palace.
- I see.

105
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,130
- She plays a shaman.
- She's a shaman.

106
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,440
- An exorcist?
- And I'm a yimugi...

107
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,840
- who failed to ascend to the sky...
- A brave one.

108
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,240
as a dragon
because he was spotted by humans.

109
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,770
- You're a yimugi.
- A yimugi.

110
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,450
So you two end up kissing
while you try to chase him.

111
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,250
- There will be kisses. I get it.
- Come on.

112
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,420
- All right.
- What's with him?

113
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,920
- I get it.
- My goodness.

114
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,490
Why would she kiss me
while chasing after me?

115
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,560
- Haha.
- It will be fun.

116
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,830
- I'll make sure to watch it.
- Why is he so into kisses?

117
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,830
Kisses?

118
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,860
- It will be fun, right?
- He always says that.

119
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,330
- It's been a while.
- All right.

120
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,870
Her name is Kim Ji Yeon
when she's an actress.

121
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,900
- Right.
- Who?

122
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,200
- I see. She's Ji Yeon.
- Bona.

123
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,570
I see. Ji Yeon?

124
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,970
By the way, have you been
on Running Man before?

125
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,010
- She has.
- I...

126
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,140
- Never?
- was here six years ago.

127
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,880
- She was here.
- It was a long time ago.

128
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,240
- I'm sorry.
- It's been a long time.

129
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,610
- I was here six years ago.
- I remember that.

130
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,980
This is my first time here.

131
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,320
- What?
- Really?

132
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,380
- No way.
- Why is this your first time?

133
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,520
- I know.
- No way.

134
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,120
- I had a chance to be here before.
- You did?

135
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,960
But because of COVID-19...

136
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,520
That's right.

137
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,960
- It was the BTOB Special.
- The BTOB Special without BTOB.

138
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,290
- The BTOB Special without BTOB.
- Oh, right.

139
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,800
(They worked hard to prepare
for the BTOB special in 2022.)

140
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,930
- Now BTOB is supposed to show up.
- Right.

141
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,200
(BTOB had to go back
as they caught COVID-19.)

142
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,670
They caught COVID-19...

143
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,740
- on the day of the shoot.
- That's right.

144
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,440
- Because of COVID-19...
- It was Hyun Sik.

145
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,540
Right.

146
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,540
We even came to the waiting room.

147
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,310
Anyway, Seong Jae and Ji Yeon
are here today.

148
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,380
"The Haunted Palace."

149
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,850
It's "The Haunted Palace."

150
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,050
Today, we will have the How
a Yimugi Becomes a Dragon Race.

151
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,390
You guys are yimugis
who failed to become a dragon.

152
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,020
And you came from the Joseon Dynasty
to the present to find magic pearls.

153
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,730
The nine yimugis
who fell from the sky...

154
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,060
after losing the magic pearls.

155
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,130
The magic pearls they lost are
hidden all over Seoul.

156
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,470
The magic pearls have
different sizes and shapes,

157
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,770
so only the ones with the dragon
on them are the real magic pearls.

158
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,540
You will be divided into two teams,
and you will try...

159
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,640
- to find the magic pearls by 4 p.m.
- By 4 p.m.?

160
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,410
The team with the higher level of...

161
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,980
- the collected magic pearls wins.
- Okay.

162
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,980
There are different levels?

163
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,320
Yes. Each magic pearl
has a set level.

164
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,890
- Okay.
- The levels of the magic pearls...

165
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,720
are from 1 to 10.

166
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,290
- Really?
- You must place the magic pearls...

167
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,730
on the table with your name on it
to be recognized as yours.

168
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,800
Not all the members
on the winning team will get a prize.

169
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,330
The member with the lowest level
of magic pearl...

170
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,600
on the winning team...

171
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,340
- will get the penalty.
- What?

172
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,610
And the member
with the highest level...

173
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,070
will be exempt from the penalty.

174
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,340
- It's war.
- It's war.

175
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,710
(It's both a team match
and an individual match.)

176
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,510
I will announce the teams then.

177
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,410
- First, Team Yuk Seong Jae.
- Yes.

178
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,050
Yu Jae Seok, Yang Se Chan,
and Ji Ye Eun.

179
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,220
(Team Yuk Seong Jae: Yu Jae Seok,
Yang Se Chan, and Ji Ye Eun)

180
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,050
Team Kim Ji Yeon. Kim Jong Kook,
Jee Seok Jin, Haha,

181
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,420
- and Song Ji Hyo.
- Yes!

182
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,560
You have more members.

183
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,860
- Why do you have more members?
- Nice.

184
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,930
- We're going to win.
- Okay.

185
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,960
- Okay.
- We're a team.

186
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,330
- Ji Yeon is really...
- They have one more member.

187
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,900
- Good.
- Why do they have more members?

188
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,530
- It's like they have more members.
- We do have more members.

189
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,170
- You cut your hair short.
- Yes.

190
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,500
The thing is...

191
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,370
I suddenly wanted to get a haircut
at a barbershop in my neighborhood.

192
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,040
So I had to get my hair trimmed
again at a hair salon.

193
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,980
- You got it trimmed again?
- Yes.

194
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,150
He's good-looking,

195
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,920
- so his hairstyle doesn't matter.
- An idol...

196
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,920
We look terrible
when our hair is messed up.

197
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,120
We look like a wreck.

198
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,020
His hairstyle doesn't matter.

199
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,790
I'll put on a hat.
I need something dark.

200
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,700
I think this is better.
Is this better?

201
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,770
I like the size, but...

202
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,770
- I think this is better.
- This one?

203
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,870
Yes. I'll wear this.

204
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,300
What? There's no difference?

205
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,370
What's the difference?

206
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,340
I tried them on, and the fit...

207
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,180
There's nothing I like.

208
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,780
I think the problem is my face.

209
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,680
(Choosing a hat feels
somewhat sad today.)

210
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,690
Ye Eun, now that you're wearing
matching T-shirts with Seong Jae,

211
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,120
you two look like a college couple.

212
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,590
Thank you.

213
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,460
She seems really happy.

214
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,490
- She likes it.
- Seong Jae just laughed it off.

215
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,000
But with me here, it just looks...

216
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,300
like a company uniform.

217
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,330
- Right.
- It looks like a club.

218
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes. A company uniform.

219
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,040
By the way,

220
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,270
I didn't understand the rules
that you explained earlier.

221
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,010
Do we get magic pearls
when we complete a mission?

222
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,640
You have to go
and find magic pearls.

223
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,850
Will someone give us magic pearls?

224
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,080
- No.
- No, you have to find them.

225
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,420
You are quite fastidious.

226
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,650
- You will see how it goes.
- So...

227
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,850
can we find them on the streets?

228
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,690
- They are in certain places.
- You will go there.

229
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,590
- Gosh, he's a little...
- You'll see.

230
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,860
- I like his enthusiasm,
- He's like me.

231
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,630
but he's a little tiring.

232
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,960
(His eyes changed
even before the mission started.)

233
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,560
- He's a little tiring.
- He's enthusiastic.

234
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,700
Then they could be here.

235
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,230
- Just stay quiet.
- Come on.

236
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,770
I like the look in your eyes.

237
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,000
- Nice.
- He has a lot of questions.

238
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
- I like that.
- He's Nutcase Yuk.

239
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,340
- Right. I like that.
- Nutcase Yuk.

240
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,510
- I'm Handsome Nutcase Yuk.
- Handsome Nutcase Yuk.

241
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,540
He doesn't want me
to leave out the word "handsome."

242
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,040
- Handsome Nutcase Yuk.
- He's Handsome Nutcase Yuk.

243
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,110
Now we will start the mission
where you can get an item...

244
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,980
that will help you find
magic pearls.

245
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,920
It's a game
inspired by a board game.

246
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,220
It's called What's Missing?

247
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,020
- Okay.
- One member will see the keyword...

248
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,060
and draw a picture
without the given word.

249
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,000
And the other members
will see the drawing...

250
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,300
- and guess what is missing.
- Guess what's missing?

251
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,330
- Give us an example.
- I'll give you an example.

252
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,870
What's missing in this drawing?

253
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,970
A gold ax and a silver ax.

254
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,000
- The answer is an ax. Correct.
- What?

255
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,740
- An ax is missing.
- What?

256
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,340
- I had no idea.
- Seong Jae.

257
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,510
Isn't that a jump rope?

258
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,510
- I thought it was a ball.
- I had no idea.

259
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,740
That's the mountain deity.

260
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,950
Is that the mountain deity?

261
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,880
What's missing in this drawing?

262
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,420
- A stick.
- A cane.

263
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,850
"You slice rice cake."
Isn't that it?

264
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,120
I have no idea.

265
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,020
- A rice paddle.
- Yes. It's a rice paddle.

266
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,550
(Handsome Nutcase Yuk did it again.)

267
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,690
- A rice paddle?
- The answer is...

268
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,460
- I'm the ace player here.
- It's "Heungboojeon."

269
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,730
- You're good at this.
- I'm the ace player.

270
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,030
- You're good.
- He's good.

271
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,430
- Can the person who drew answer?
- No.

272
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,670
- Point...
- Ji Yeon, do you draw well?

273
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,530
- Right. You should do that.
- Ji Yeon, do you draw well?

274
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,870
- You do it.
- Good.

275
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,300
- I think I can draw that much.
- You can? Let's do that.

276
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,610
- Let's do this.
- Ji Yeon, let's start...

277
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,810
with something easy.

278
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,010
Draw Jae Seok's face.

279
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,080
We can tell if you're good or not.

280
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,840
- Draw it.
- You get seven seconds.

281
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,550
- Start. One, two,
- One, two,

282
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,650
- three, four,
- You know how to draw.

283
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,190
- five, six,
- You're good at drawing.

284
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,520
- seven. She's not good.
- Draw the most important thing.

285
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,120
- Come on.
- That's not his mouth.

286
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,060
You know what?

287
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,900
- You should draw crooked teeth.
- His protruding teeth.

288
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,800
- The thing is...
- You should draw the teeth first.

289
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,130
Seong Jae, you should try it.

290
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,470
(They test Handsome Nutcase Yuk.)

291
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,770
- Seong Jae, draw Haha's face.
- Seong Jae.

292
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,570
- Try drawing Haha or Jong Kook.
- Draw his face.

293
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,410
- I'm difficult to draw.
- Start.

294
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,010
(He starts drawing
without hesitation.)

295
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,480
(Laughing)

296
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,010
- What's with Ye Eun?
- It's done.

297
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,480
- He draws well.
- What's that?

298
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,580
(Will Handsome Nutcase Yuk
pass the performance test?)

299
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,590
(Very cunning)

300
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,060
- His hair...
- He's good.

301
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,260
This is how you look...

302
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,990
- with long hair.
- He's good.

303
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,930
- This is the point.
- He's good at this.

304
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,500
The dirty beard.

305
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,500
- The dirty beard.
- It's dirty.

306
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,630
It's the reggae style.

307
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,070
- It's dirty.
- My gosh.

308
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,170
- Good.
- Well done.

309
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,040
This is how he looks with long hair.

310
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,640
- One of you will draw first.
- Yes.

311
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,040
- Ji Yeon will do that.
- Let's go, Ji Yeon.

312
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,940
- Ji Yeon will go.
- Go ahead, Ji Yeon.

313
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,140
Ji Yeon.

314
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,380
- Point.
- Point? Okay.

315
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,680
- Can we answer too?
- Sure.

316
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,050
- Ji Yeon will go first.
- Here's the first keyword.

317
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,050
You should draw a picture
without this keyword.

318
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,520
- Please close your eyes.
- Okay.

319
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,960
- I'll show you the keyword.
- We shouldn't see it.

320
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,560
Ready, start.

321
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,200
One, two, three,

322
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,770
- Can we see her draw?
- four,

323
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,540
five, six, seven,

324
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,070
- Is it done?
- eight,

325
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,970
(Is Ji Yeon drawing
apples and a princess?)

326
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,670
- Times up. Stop.
- Stop.

327
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,510
- What did she draw?
- What's that?

328
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,580
I get it.

329
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,750
- What?
- I know what it is.

330
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,050
- Wait. What's that?
- Apples.

331
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,350
The eyes, nose,
and mouth are missing.

332
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,250
(It's Seok Sam's quick wit
that is missing.)

333
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,850
- That's...
- What?

334
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,590
- because I had no time.
- I get it.

335
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,220
- Did it get a perm?
- Let me answer.

336
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,690
There are no dwarfs.

337
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,830
(He noticed a princess
in this drawing.)

338
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,930
- Snow White?
- A pumpkin carriage.

339
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,460
Let me answer. A pumpkin carriage.

340
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,200
- Let me answer.
- What's that?

341
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,530
- It's wearing a skirt.
- Let me answer.

342
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,570
- Is it a skirt?
- Snake.

343
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,840
(Answer: Glass slipper)

344
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,170
Let me answer. Glass slipper.

345
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,570
(Correct)

346
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,710
- Our team got it right.
- What?

347
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,810
- What?
- How did you know Cinderella?

348
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,750
- What's the round thing next to it?
- What's that?

349
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,980
Is that a rock face?

350
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,250
- This is a castle.
- A castle?

351
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,490
- Castle.
- Is it a castle?

352
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,590
- Glass slipper.
- She should've drawn it well.

353
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,490
- Why does a castle look like that?
- We can't let her do this.

354
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,690
- This won't work.
- Ji Yeon.

355
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,090
- Ji Yeon didn't learn to draw.
- The castle is a little...

356
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,000
Who would think it's a castle?

357
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,460
Now I get it. I know what to do.

358
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,730
- Okay.
- So...

359
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,600
Team Seong Jae got one point.

360
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,840
- This isn't working.
- Thank you, Ji Yeon.

361
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,870
- I got it right though.
- Yes.

362
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,910
- That's true.
- I knew it was a princess.

363
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,040
- All right.
- Start. One,

364
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,210
two, three, four,

365
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,780
five, six,

366
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,080
- It's fast.
- seven, eight,

367
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,490
nine, ten. Hold it up.

368
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,250
- Let me see.
- What's that?

369
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,250
- What is it?
- Hang on.

370
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,260
A ghost.

371
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,260
- What's that?
- It's a ghost. What's that thing?

372
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,390
Let me answer. Soul.

373
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,130
Hang on. That's...

374
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,430
- Spirit.
- Let me answer.

375
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,300
- Body.
- Ghost.

376
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,470
What do you think this is?

377
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,570
- That thing?
- It's like a spirit.

378
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,110
(The sweet potato ghost Genie
and a flying carpet)

379
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,670
(What's missing is the magic lamp.)

380
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,510
What do you think this is?

381
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,710
Let me answer.

382
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,110
(Will they be able to find
the missing magic lamp?)

383
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,280
Blanket.

384
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,350
Let me answer. Towel.

385
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,750
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

386
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,120
- Pillowcase.
- No.

387
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,020
You shouldn't guess what that is.

388
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,720
- What's missing.
- Guess what's missing.

389
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,220
- What's missing here.
- That's right.

390
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,190
- Something missing here.
- What's missing in the drawing.

391
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,260
Right.

392
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,530
Let me answer. Water.

393
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,060
(Handsome Nutcase Yuk
keeps running the sketchbook.)

394
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,730
Let me answer. Genie.

395
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,000
(Genie!)

396
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,370
(He's almost there!)

397
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,270
- Okay!
- What?

398
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,940
- Magic lamp.
- That's it.

399
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,040
That's it!

400
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,510
- I see.
- Well done. You got it right.

401
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,340
- You did it.
- No.

402
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,710
- That's the magic carpet.
- You almost did it.

403
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,180
- How could you draw that?
- How could you draw Genie?

404
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,080
- I'm better, right?
- What?

405
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,320
- No, he's a lot better.
- He's better.

406
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,590
Seong Jae is better.
We got it right.

407
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,890
You think so?

408
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,420
- Do you want me to go?
- Yes. You go.

409
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,860
- But...
- Haha is good at drawing.

410
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,630
- Just draw the point.
- Okay.

411
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,760
I'll show you the keyword.

412
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,230
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

413
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,170
(Keyword)

414
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,400
Start. One, two,

415
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,140
(The tip of the pen moves freely
without hesitation.)

416
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,340
eight, nine, ten.

417
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,540
- Let's go.
- Tim'es up.

418
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,210
- He draws well.
- Hurry and show us.

419
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,850
- Let me answer. Dooly.
- Dooly.

420
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,080
(Obviously, it's Michol.)

421
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,450
(What's missing is Dooly?)

422
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,620
Ddochi!

423
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,990
Yes!

424
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,090
Ddochi!

425
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,220
(Correct)

426
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,290
You did it.

427
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,560
- Yes.
- I didn't draw Dooly on purpose.

428
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,660
- Good.
- If I draw Dooly,

429
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,060
- they would've got it.
- Ddochi answered Ddochi.

430
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,070
- Okay.
- Ddochi.

431
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,100
They get to see it
two seconds faster than us.

432
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,440
It's not like that.
You should give us an advantage.

433
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,170
- We should move our seats.
- They see it before us.

434
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,640
- No.
- They are two seconds faster.

435
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,910
- They're closer.
- Come on.

436
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,010
- They are closer, so...
- What are you talking about?

437
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,110
- Let's switch seats.
- Let's switch seats.

438
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,780
- Okay. Let's do that.
- We should switch seats.

439
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,310
- The thing is...
- Right?

440
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,180
- He should pick it up right away.
- This isn't just right.

441
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,050
While you were drawing the hair,
they were peeping here.

442
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,220
Don't look at the drawing...

443
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,460
- while she counts down.
- Okay.

444
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,620
- Cover your eyes.
- We didn't look.

445
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,560
- Of course.
- I'll show you the keyword.

446
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,830
- The rest should cover their eyes.
- I'm nervous.

447
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,560
- It's better to be bad at drawing.
- Right.

448
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,500
You drew Michol too well.

449
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,770
We should get it this time.

450
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,970
One, two, three,

451
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,670
- four, five, six,
- My gosh.

452
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,680
(Ye Eun is drawing
the squid Santa Claus.)

453
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,780
- Okay. Come on!
- My goodness.

454
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,550
(You're unbelievable.)

455
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,620
(Answer: Rudolph)

456
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,690
- Okay. Rudolph.
- Let me answer. Rudolph.

457
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,820
Okay!

458
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,990
(Rudolph!)

459
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,620
- See? It's easier here.
- This seat is a lot better.

460
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,760
- It's faster here.
- It's a lot faster.

461
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,960
Isn't it a squid?

462
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,700
The score is tied now.
We have one question left.

463
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,730
- Then the seating must alternate.
- What?

464
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,170
All of a sudden?

465
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,640
- We should alternate.
- Mister.

466
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,940
- Excuse me.
- We should alternate.

467
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,570
- Why all of a sudden?
- Let's just do that.

468
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,940
- Mister.
- You said...

469
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,010
- the seats didn't matter.
- What?

470
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,080
- Earlier...
- Why is he being like that?

471
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,250
- All of a sudden?
- Let's alternate.

472
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,650
- Alternating all of a sudden?
- Let's do that.

473
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,120
- You should draw in the center.
- It's really...

474
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,650
- Why are you going there?
- Let's alternate.

475
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,990
- Why is he here?
- Alternate seats.

476
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,730
But I'll be seated at the end.

477
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,390
- Go.
- All right.

478
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,730
- Alternate.
- Okay. Sit here.

479
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,030
- All right.
- Good.

480
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,030
Go, Ssaebssaeb.

481
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,030
I can answer it a lot faster...

482
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,470
- when I'm closer.
- That's true.

483
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,140
- Okay.
- This is all about reasoning.

484
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,310
- Okay.
- Please cover your eyes.

485
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,080
Se Chan and Jae Seok are
on the same wavelength.

486
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,710
I'll show you the keyword.

487
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,280
What's this?

488
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,750
I don't know what this is.
What is it?

489
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,220
(A princess with really long hair)

490
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,850
- Is that it?
- All right. Start. One,

491
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,020
(He barely remembers Rapunzel.)

492
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,020
You should draw it
without that thing. Four,

493
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,430
- Right. Without it.
- five, six,

494
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,830
(He even has 3 seconds to spare.)

495
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,030
(Keyword: Rapunzel)

496
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,070
(He draw Rapunzel without the hair.)

497
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,340
(Keyword: Rapunzel)

498
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,840
He doesn't know what this is.

499
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,240
- Let me answer.
- Head.

500
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,640
Let me answer. Brain.

501
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,680
Let me answer. Hair.

502
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,510
- Hair.
- Let me answer. Hat.

503
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,550
- Ear.
- Let me answer.

504
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,650
- Hair whorl.
- I'll give you a hint.

505
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,120
- It's the name of a character.
- Yes.

506
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,420
- The name of a character?
- Character.

507
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,590
Let me answer.

508
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,720
"Black Rubber Shoes."

509
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,560
- Isn't that it?
- Let me answer. Gi Yeong.

510
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,690
- It's something like that.
- Gi Yeong.

511
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,060
It's about what's missing.

512
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,460
What is this character?

513
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,960
It's a character
from another country.

514
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,060
- From another country?
- Does he know what it is?

515
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,930
- A foreign character?
- It has...

516
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,800
something to do with what's missing.

517
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,470
A foreign character
with something missing.

518
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,740
- Something missing?
- Let me answer.

519
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,940
Bruce Willis.

520
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,610
It's a woman.

521
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,710
(The final hint)

522
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,710
- Female?
- A woman?

523
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,840
Let me answer. Is it Rapunzel?

524
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,510
(Answer: Rapunzel)

525
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,520
(How did he guess correctly?)

526
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,820
- All right!
- Nice!

527
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,220
(The viper only guessed it
with the clues that were given!)

528
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,320
I don't know who this is.

529
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,790
- Rapunzel.
- We won.

530
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,890
(Team Seong Jae
couldn't answer the last question.)

531
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,120
- Nice.
- We won.

532
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,260
Okay. The answer was Rapunzel.

533
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,030
- Okay.
- Team Ji Yeon won this game.

534
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,760
- We won.
- Nice.

535
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,200
(Team Ji Yeon came from behind
and won with a score of 3 to 2.)

536
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,230
- Good job.
- Okay. The answer was Rapunzel.

537
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,500
The magic pearl can't be found
by just searching for it.

538
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,440
You will be given a chance...

539
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,410
to select an item
that will be of help.

540
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,140
The winning team...

541
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,850
will receive two special items
that will be of help.

542
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,910
- Okay!
- The losing team...

543
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,850
- will only get one.
- It's not that bad.

544
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,250
You will randomly choose items
which will belong to an individual.

545
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,090
- We're playing as individuals.
- Have it prepared.

546
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,390
- All right!
- It's every man for himself.

547
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,790
I prefer playing as a team.

548
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,030
(Who will obtain which item?)

549
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,500
(For the winning team,
2 of the 5 are special items.)

550
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,400
(What did Ji Yeon get?)

551
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,800
Tease-ya.

552
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,740
This is a useless piece of paper...

553
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,710
stating that you didn't obtain
any special items.

554
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,480
How many of these are duds?

555
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,240
Three? That's a relief.

556
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,950
If I had chosen the only one...

557
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,610
(Seok Jin is up next.)

558
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,620
- What's this?
- Hey.

559
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,180
- "Magic pearl..."
- See?

560
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,190
A speaker that emits a louder noise
as it approaches a magic pearl.

561
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,360
(Seok Jin obtained an item?)

562
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,760
Magic Pearl Detector.

563
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,990
The beeping will get louder
as it approaches a magic pearl.

564
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,100
(Magic Pearl Detector)

565
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,700
(A speaker that emits a louder noise
as it approaches a magic pearl)

566
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,600
(It can only be used for 2 minutes
at every location at any time.)

567
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,300
Is there one left?

568
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,210
Can I use it whenever I want to?

569
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,440
- Can I check it here?
- Okay. This will be my choice.

570
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,740
You must've picked something good.

571
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,310
It's not that good, but...

572
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,480
Put on these glasses and earphones,

573
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,720
and you'll hear information
regarding the magic pearls.

574
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,780
- No way.
- I see.

575
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,890
It's like a VR headset.

576
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,290
(The state-of-the-art VR headset...)

577
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,690
(that tells you
where the magic pearls are)

578
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,660
- I'll put these on.
- Last time...

579
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,790
(He tries them on to test them out.)

580
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,430
You look great in them.

581
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,790
Transform into a baby octopus.

582
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,400
Hold on.

583
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,800
- Magic pearls have appeared.
- What now?

584
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,040
Magic pearls have appeared.

585
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,170
Five magic pearls...

586
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,340
have been detected
at Yanghwa Han River Park.

587
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,340
(5 magic pearls have been detected
at Yanghwa Han River Park.)

588
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,480
Seven magic pearls...

589
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,610
have been detected
around the Mapo Tour Train Bus.

590
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,950
(7 magic pearls have been detected
around the Mapo Tour Train Bus.)

591
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,820
The magic pearls will disappear
after a set time,

592
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,950
so the yimugis should hurry out
to find the pearls.

593
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,360
Do you see anything?

594
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,590
There are seven magic pearls
on the Yeouido Tour Train Bus.

595
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,260
- The tour train bus?
- And...

596
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,730
there are five
at Mangwon Han River Park.

597
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,770
Magic pearls have appeared.

598
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,340
He can't pronounce the words.

599
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,700
- That's where we are.
- Yanghwa Han River Park.

600
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,710
There are five
at Yanghwa Han River Park.

601
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,410
Five. And then
you mentioned a beltway.

602
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,980
There are seven on a tour train bus.

603
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,850
- Seven on a tour train bus.
- Do we get on a train, then?

604
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,850
Seven on a tour train bus.

605
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:11,880
What's that?

606
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,780
And... Mangwon...

607
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,250
- Yanghwa.
- Yanghwa?

608
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,290
- Five at the Han River Park.
- Five at the Han River Park?

609
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,560
I know what these glasses are.

610
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,960
- What are they?
- What?

611
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,330
Wasn't it released by Google?

612
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,030
- Does it show you something?
- It was. Of course.

613
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,030
- Really?
- For real?
Yes, they show you an image.

614
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,330
- It exists.
- He says it exists.

615
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,570
- Really?
- I love gadgets like these.

616
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,700
- He was to wear them for a reason.
- Exactly.

617
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,940
So that's what they look like.

618
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,070
- I see.
- They look like plain sunglasses.

619
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,640
- They're pretty.
- But...

620
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,770
They're nice sunglasses.

621
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,340
- It's true.
- Stay put, will you?

622
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,510
They released one.

623
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,550
- Goodness.
- Okay.

624
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,780
- Do you have it?
- That was crazy.

625
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,120
Did you get the information?

626
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,620
- I did.
- Why was he given the glasses?

627
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,090
- He's the dumbest.
- He's the dumbest.

628
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,550
Why did he get it?

629
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,720
- What is it?
- Why did you get to wear it?

630
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,590
- What do you know anyway?
- You need to share the information.

631
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,130
- This must be shared.
- Of course.

632
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,630
- That, I should.
- What did you see?

633
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,960
To show us the beauty of Mapo,
a tour train bus...

634
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,700
is being operated.

635
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,270
- Aren't I right?
- What?

636
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,840
- It's new.
- A tour train bus.

637
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,170
Would you like to ride that
or go to Han River Park?

638
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,740
- Why was it given to him?
- There's more to it,

639
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,010
judging by the fact
you're not giving us everything.

640
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,110
- Don't keep anything from us.
- Of course there's something there.

641
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,280
Magic pearls are there.

642
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,380
Tell us everything.

643
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,210
Tell us everything you heard.
What was it?

644
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,180
- Don't try to fool us.
- Should we get on a train?

645
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,020
- Magic pearls.
- We need to join forces.

646
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,220
Magic pearls have appeared.

647
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,790
- Right, they appeared.
- Also,

648
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,990
there are a few...

649
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,190
- at a Han River Park.
- And?

650
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,690
- On the tour train bus.
- And a few on the tour train bus.

651
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,290
- I see.
- Let's go to the bus.

652
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,530
- Sure.
- Let's go there.

653
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,200
- Is that all you heard?
- There are four on the bus.

654
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,230
- Okay, let's go.
- Four?

655
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,470
Why are you only telling us now?

656
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,200
I told you not to lie to us.

657
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,440
Stop trying to fool us.

658
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,440
- Work with us at first.
- There are four?

659
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,610
How many are there
at the Han River Park?

660
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,380
- Three.
- We should go there then.

661
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,380
Why are we debating this?

662
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,250
To be honest,
there are five at the park.

663
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,180
Haha, come on.

664
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,780
I can't believe you.

665
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,190
- What's wrong with you?
- I swear to the Almighty.

666
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,890
- This should be a group effort.
- There are five at Han River Park.

667
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,090
- But on the bus...
- There are four.

668
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,290
Since there are four of them.

669
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,460
The tour train bus
is way better though.

670
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,530
- Let's go there, then.
- Go there.

671
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,560
- Where to?
- The tour train bus.

672
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,630
It's way better.

673
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
(Without any suspicion)

674
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,030
- Where to?
- The tour train bus.

675
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,330
Is this our ride? Okay.

676
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,770
- You're trying to fool us.
- Haha, please.

677
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,440
- That's not the case.
- You're not even...

678
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,840
- that smart enough.
- Why though?

679
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,810
Why would you try to fool us
when you're not smart enough?

680
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,840
Why would you leave out
what's important until the end?

681
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,510
- Haha.
- I'd understand...

682
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,750
if the mind game
was by someone smart.

683
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,820
If we search the tour train bus,

684
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,720
one of us won't get a magic pearl.

685
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,590
- How many are there on the bus?
- Four.

686
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,590
- Four, but...
- Shouldn't we go after five?

687
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,690
- Of course not.
- No. Because...

688
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,360
- we won't be able to find them all.
- Han River Park is huge.

689
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,630
We won't be able
to find all of them.

690
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,930
Haha, why did you say
there were 3 when there are 5?

691
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,770
- Why?
- So that I could find two more.

692
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,670
(Proudly saying it)

693
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,610
What if the other team
searches the tour train bus too?

694
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,810
Does that mean no one will be
at Han River Park?

695
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,340
Right. If the other team
goes to search the bus,

696
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,750
no one will be at Han River Park.

697
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,880
(It'll be even more cutthroat
if they search the same location.)

698
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,710
But we can't tell
where they will go.

699
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,020
(What matters is
where Team Seong Jae went.)

700
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,250
Let's head there for now.

701
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,820
Off we go.

702
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,850
(Team Seong Jae
is headed somewhere.)

703
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,690
- I mean it.
- Is the train bus...

704
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,790
Is the train bus a subway ride?

705
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,860
No, it's a bus...

706
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,230
that goes around Mapo.

707
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,800
Wouldn't it be easier
to find what's on a bus?

708
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,870
- Seong Jae.
- I think you'll have...

709
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,770
- to find pearls while on the bus.
- We already have a destination.

710
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,170
Where should we go?

711
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,740
- Where the seven pearls are.
- Seven?

712
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,110
Think about what's closer.

713
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,740
Isn't Yanghwa Han River Park closer?

714
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,280
It's important to occupy
a location first.

715
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,380
Let's go to the Han River Park then.

716
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,810
- Let's go.
- Han River Park.

717
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,580
Seong Jae, didn't you...

718
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,750
- have breakfast today?
- I didn't.

719
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,790
- Why not?
- Of course.

720
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,090
I came as soon as I woke up.

721
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,590
Are you trying to get into shape?

722
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,960
No, I came as soon as I woke up.

723
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,090
- Really?
- Yes.

724
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,890
Eating must not be
the first thing you do.

725
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,530
No, I came as soon as I woke up.

726
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,660
How many times
must he repeat himself?

727
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,600
- How many times?
- Can't you say "yes..."

728
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,400
- at least once?
- Sure thing.

729
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,200
I came as soon as I woke up.

730
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,170
- There's a good response.
- I didn't have the time.

731
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,870
- I see.
- Is that so?

732
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,470
I bet you're fastidious.

733
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,640
No, I'm not. I'm not fastidious.

734
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,550
- I bet you got that...
- Right.

735
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,680
- from this brief conversation.
- He's not exactly my type.

736
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,420
I'm not fastidious at all.

737
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,490
You can tell that Seong Jae
doesn't like to lose.

738
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,120
I don't like people
who want to win all the time.

739
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,120
You find Seong Jae to be exhausting.

740
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,230
Do we spread out from here?

741
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,530
Do we search individually?

742
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,330
Can I get running?

743
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,830
- Is that necessary?
- Come on.

744
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,500
What on earth?

745
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,670
(Jae Seok runs off first.)

746
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,710
Jae Seok!

747
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,540
(They split up
to look for the magic pearls.)

748
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,480
The real one has a dragon on it.

749
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,250
(A dragon is
on the real magic pearls.)

750
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,120
I bet one is inside. I'm sure of it.

751
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,720
(The passionate Seong Jae
seems sure...)

752
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,460
(which is unusual
for a newcomer on Running Man.)

753
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,230
Could it be in a claw machine?

754
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,630
Did he say
there were five in total here?

755
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,000
(He quickly scans the area
with his eyes.)

756
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,540
Hold on. There are arrows.

757
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,340
- That's not ours.
- No?

758
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,880
(His deduction skills are weak
compared to his passion.)

759
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,410
I'll check places
that people won't check.

760
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,350
Right here.

761
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,020
(There's nothing.)

762
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,120
Well...

763
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,990
(While the passionate
Handsome Nutcase Yuk...)

764
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,850
(checks places
without any pearls...)

765
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,490
I doubt there's one over there.

766
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,160
(The veteran instinctively knows.)

767
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,860
(He doesn't bother
searching indoors like Seong Jae.)

768
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,300
Wait.

769
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,500
What's this?

770
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,300
What's this? Hold on.

771
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,570
There's something on the boat.

772
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,940
(Duck boats are out on the river
looking suspicious.)

773
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,170
My gosh.

774
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,780
Can I get on this boat?

775
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,880
Hold on. I need a life vest.

776
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
Hello.

777
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,480
I'll put on a life vest.

778
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,550
(While Jae Seok prepares
to get on a duck boat)

779
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,950
I doubt there will be one
in a trash can.

780
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,320
I have a feeling
one will be around here.

781
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,290
(The newbie searches everywhere
without a strategy.)

782
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,090
I think one will be around here.

783
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,460
My gosh.

784
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,730
Could it be this?

785
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,070
(She found something?)

786
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,470
It's a pearl. My gosh!

787
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,070
- I found one.
- Crystal Bead.

788
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,310
I can't believe I did it.

789
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,610
First magic pearl found.

790
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,810
(Team Seong Jae's
Han River Magic Pearl Collection)

791
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,710
I'm so good at this!

792
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,280
(Surprisingly enough,
Ddochi scored.)

793
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,620
This is where the camera is.

794
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,980
(Being the veteran he is,
he uses logic and science.)

795
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,390
The camera being here means...

796
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,650
(Being the veteran he is,
he uses logic and science.)

797
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,360
(He checks the angle
of the camera first.)

798
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,660
This is what he's filming.

799
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,930
Wouldn't it be
around here somewhere?

800
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,390
(He searches around the tree
that is in range of the camera.)

801
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,300
See?

802
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,100
Se Chan, nice. What's this?

803
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,900
Am I to keep this from breaking?

804
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,970
What's this?

805
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,540
- Am I to keep this from breaking?
- Duck Egg.

806
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,210
- This can be tricky.
- A fragile magic pearl.

807
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,280
(Duck Egg,
Easily breakable, Caution required!)

808
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,340
How do I carry this around?

809
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,910
(The magic pearls are
all different in shape and size.)

810
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,350
Second magic pearl found.

811
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,350
(Team Seong Jae's
Han River Magic Pearl Collection)

812
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,380
(Crystal Bead, Duck Egg)

813
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,920
- Jae Seok, what are you up to?
- What?

814
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
Are you water-skiing?

815
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,120
- No, it's not that.
- Then?

816
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,190
I'll get on it, sir.

817
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,190
(He hurries onto the boat,
worried Se Chan might follow.)

818
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,230
I need my cameraman...

819
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,060
to help me with the pedals.

820
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,430
Jae Seok, where are you going?

821
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,700
- Where are you going?
- What?

822
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,600
All right.

823
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,640
(He refuses to tell Se Chan.)

824
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,300
Help me operate the boat.

825
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,770
- Where are you going?
- Why are you asking?

826
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,840
(Jae Seok's boat leaves.)

827
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,110
- Seong Jae!
- What?

828
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,150
Get over here!

829
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,020
What's up?

830
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,980
You found something?

831
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,720
- Put on a life vest.
- What for?

832
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,290
I think Jae Seok found something.

833
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,820
- We must go over there?
- Yes, let's go.

834
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,660
- Put on a life vest.
- Gosh.

835
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,960
(Jae Seok set off first.)

836
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
My gosh.

837
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,600
Come on.

838
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,830
(Pedal to the metal)

839
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,500
It's not even that fast.

840
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,900
(Holding tight)

841
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,770
(Jae Seok makes slow progress.)

842
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,840
My goodness.

843
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,940
Shall we take this?

844
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,680
This? This is...

845
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,850
This might be faster.

846
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,210
Okay. Let's take this, then.

847
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,350
This might be faster.

848
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,380
(They choose
a speedy-looking kayak.)

849
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,450
What's this? Goodness.

850
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,990
You'll actually row that?

851
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,490
- Are you ready?
- Yes. Let's start on the right.

852
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,530
One. Left.

853
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,100
Right.

854
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,530
How far do we have to go?

855
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,300
That far. One.

856
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,670
- One.
- Two.

857
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,140
- One.
- One.

858
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,370
- Two.
- Two.

859
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,540
Right, left. This is fast.

860
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,740
Let's go!

861
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,380
(Panting)

862
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,680
We're almost there.

863
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,180
Nice.

864
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,750
(Jae Seok is close
to the duck boat.)

865
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,750
(Panting)

866
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,120
(Panting)

867
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,620
(Giggling)

868
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,760
(Snorting giggle)

869
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,790
Stay strong.
What are you even doing?

870
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,530
(He urges his cameraman
until they reach the duck boat.)

871
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,070
There it is.

872
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,440
There it is.

873
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,440
(There's something
inside the duck boat?)

874
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,580
(He hurriedly picks it up.)

875
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,980
Is this it? This is a magic pearl?

876
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,850
(Cotton candy?)

877
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:06,920
Here it is.

878
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,150
(A dragon sticker)

879
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,390
Cotton Candy.
It melts in water, so beware.

880
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,390
(Cotton Candy, Melts in water)

881
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,560
Here it is.

882
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,690
The magic pearl
must retain its normal appearance.

883
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,260
- This?
- Yes. It must look like that.

884
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,430
The magic pearl is
falling off the stick.

885
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,800
(It'll melt when it touches water.)

886
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,770
(Squishing)

887
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,470
(Jae Seok squishes it
so it won't get wet.)

888
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,440
Third magic pearl found.

889
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,740
How am I to carry this around?

890
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,350
Jae Seok found something.
He found cotton candy.

891
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,480
(Just then, the kayak approaches.)

892
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
You found something?

893
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,650
(Keeping quiet)

894
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,620
What's that up there? On the roof.

895
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,590
What's that up there? On the roof.

896
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,990
- On the roof.
- Round Bell.

897
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,760
(There was a magic pearl
on each boat.)

898
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,330
(Jae Seok left
without noticing the bell.)

899
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,370
(The Man of Passion found it.)

900
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,240
Hang on. Here we go.

901
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,700
(They slowly approach the bell.)

902
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,470
(Swinging)

903
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,010
Here.

904
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,110
How do we get it off?

905
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,610
I can get it off.

906
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,520
Grab it. I'll hold on.

907
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,720
(He sticks his paddle
between the knots.)

908
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,750
Snap it off.

909
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,820
- Can you hold this for me?
- Okay.

910
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,490
(He leaves his paddle
to try to climb on.)

911
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,130
Move slowly. Be careful, Seong Jae.

912
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,330
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to reverse.

913
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,810
Hey, I have motion sickness!

914
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,480
(Duckie Yuk suddenly surges ahead.)

915
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,880
- Goodbye, Se Chan.
- Where are you going?

916
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,250
- Goodbye, Se Chan.
- Where are you going?

917
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,590
You scumbag. Darn you!

918
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,320
How am I to get back alone?

919
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,820
See you!

920
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,290
What the... That punk.

921
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,290
(Ssaebssaeb got duped
by a first-timer on the show.)

922
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,860
I don't believe this.

923
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,400
(Seong Jae's paddle is spinning.)

924
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,500
My gosh.

925
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,270
I haven't been on a duck boat
in so long.

926
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,470
Can I manage on my own?

927
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,770
(Zero will to help)

928
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,510
This is no joke.

929
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,040
Let's go straight ahead.

930
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,780
(Panting)

931
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,950
(Help me.)

932
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:21,280
(Ye Eun moves forward on her own.)

933
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,950
Which way do I go? Left.

934
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,360
(She comes across Jae Seok
who is returning.)

935
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,860
We might crash.

936
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,760
Who is it? Jae Seok.

937
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,670
Did you find... I see cotton candy.

938
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,930
Jae Seok, you have cotton candy.

939
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,400
(She saw the squished cotton candy.)

940
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,570
Did you find that?

941
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,310
(He never answers.)

942
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,410
Let's keep going.

943
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,310
There's something over there.

944
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,250
Hang on. What's this?

945
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,250
(Something is on the water?)

946
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,150
Beach Ball.
Make sure it doesn't burst.

947
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,620
(Jae Seok finds the last magic pearl
on his return.)

948
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,530
- Fourth magic pearl found.
- I got it.

949
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,700
Why is he so fast?

950
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,600
My legs ache.

951
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,870
(She's returning empty-handed.)

952
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,040
I haven't eaten.

953
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,410
(While Ddochi is working out
on an empty stomach...)

954
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,510
(One guy is paddling furiously.)

955
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,580
(Grunting)

956
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,780
(Moving at high speed)

957
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,050
This isn't easy.

958
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,160
It's exhausting.

959
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,690
(Just then)

960
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,030
- Hey!
- My goodness!

961
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,130
(Determined Mr. Kayak caught up.)

962
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,570
- Seong Jae.
- What?

963
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,670
- Hey.
- What?

964
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,570
- We were meant to stick together.
- You scared me.

965
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,610
- Jae Seok!
- How did you get here?

966
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,340
We were a team, and you left me?

967
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,380
- I didn't leave you. I...
- How could you?

968
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,050
I'm drenched.

969
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,350
(They argue
all the way to the dock.)

970
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,450
Seong Jae.

971
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,260
(Seong Jae's the last
to obtain a magic pearl.)

972
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,790
- My leg workout...
- This...

973
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,060
- The search is over.
- Seong Jae.

974
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,290
All the magic pearls were found.

975
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,760
(Team Seong Jae's
Han River Magic Pearl Collection)

976
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,660
How am I to carry this around?

977
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,670
This is...

978
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,700
- What is that?
- Does it have a dragon?

979
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,740
Oh, shoot!

980
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,370
(Falling in pieces)

981
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,070
- Is there a dragon picture?
- The dragon...

982
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,410
- Where is it?
- There's a dragon picture.

983
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,740
(The cotton candy
magic pearl is shattered.)

984
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,910
It's in pieces.

985
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,880
You broke your magic pearl.

986
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,780
(A magic pearl that loses
its shape disappears.)

987
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,690
It took so much work to...

988
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,320
The magic pearls
range from Level 1 to 10.

989
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,930
We'll tell you the level
of just one of your magic pearls.

990
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,090
- Just one?
- Just one?

991
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,860
We'll tell you
if it's above or below...

992
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,200
Level three or Level seven.

993
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,930
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?

994
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,170
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

995
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,440
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

996
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,870
Rock-paper-scissors!

997
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,170
(Jae Seok won.)

998
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,270
Jae Seok's magic pearl.

999
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,670
- The beach ball?
- Yes.

1000
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,550
This magic pearl
is above Level Seven.

1001
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,280
(Beach Ball, Above Level 7,
No sharp objects, can lose air)

1002
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,980
- That's really high.
- Above seven.

1003
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,480
(Jae Seok found
a high-level magic pearl.)

1004
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,890
This is incredible.

1005
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,190
Is the level higher
the harder it is to carry around?

1006
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,160
- I think so.
- It's hard to carry around.

1007
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,060
The cotton candy
would've been really high, then.

1008
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,960
- This would be high too.
- What level was the cotton candy?

1009
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,860
The cotton candy that disappeared...

1010
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,000
was Level Nine.

1011
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,670
That's it.

1012
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,330
(The cotton candy they lost
was a massive Level 9.)

1013
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,840
How did this happen? Look.

1014
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,840
(They lost a Level 9 magic pearl.)

1015
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,510
- It was tough.
- It was impossible to carry around.

1016
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,510
- Right.
- That's true.

1017
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,780
- It melts and falls apart.
- It crumbles.

1018
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,780
- Level seven is better.
- Right.

1019
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,520
Does this go above ground
and not underground?

1020
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,980
- Yes.
- It's above ground.

1021
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,190
Hang on. Where is the bus?

1022
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,320
- Why are we in an alley?
- Why is it in a corner?

1023
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,260
- That must be it.
- That must be it. The pink thing.

1024
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,330
Is there a bus?

1025
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,360
- That's it.
- What bus...

1026
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,060
- Oh, this is it.
- This is the bus?

1027
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,770
- It's cute.
- I like it.

1028
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,670
- It's cute.
- Do we search inside it?

1029
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,300
- That's...
- It's not on the bus.

1030
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,870
- We must look when we get off.
- Is that it?

1031
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,540
Do we get on board
and it drops us off?

1032
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,580
That bus is cute.

1033
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,340
- It's cute.
- It's pink.

1034
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,350
Hey, look at the bus stop.
It's pretty too.

1035
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,150
This train bus
goes to my neighborhood too.

1036
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,620
- The bus stop's a pretty pink.
- There's a stop.

1037
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,790
(It's Jong Kook's personal color.)

1038
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,320
It's pretty, isn't it?

1039
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,520
What's this?

1040
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,360
- Sit in the far back.
- How cute.

1041
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,360
There are a few bunnies.
They aren't it, are they?

1042
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,770
Is this a train?

1043
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,170
There's water.

1044
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,340
- Is this a train?
- I guess so.

1045
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,870
Are they here or...

1046
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,140
- I think...
- Are they around the stops?

1047
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,880
- Are they on this train...
- Let's see.

1048
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,280
or are they where this train goes?

1049
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,050
For safety reasons,

1050
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,750
- you can search when we stop.
- Okay.

1051
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,990
- You can't search on the move.
- I see.

1052
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,760
- They must be in here.
- Then...

1053
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,690
- How is it different from a bus?
- Haneul Park.

1054
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,360
- It goes to Haneul Park.
- It's like...

1055
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,590
What is this?

1056
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,030
Do we keep looking
as we travel around?

1057
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,970
He said we could look
only when we stop.

1058
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,840
- The cushion?
- Where did the bunny go?

1059
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,400
- The cushion?
- I don't get it.

1060
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,870
It fell.

1061
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,010
I think our staff brought
these stuffed animals.

1062
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,080
Right? It's weird
that there are dolls here.

1063
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,680
(Detective Kook spots
the stuffed rabbit.)

1064
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,150
But there wasn't anything on here.

1065
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,680
That's noisy over there.

1066
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,850
Whether you're a magic pearl or not,
you're cute.

1067
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,950
(Jong Sook's muscles melt away
whenever he sees cute things.)

1068
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,060
- Jong Kook, you love cute stuff.
- I really do.

1069
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,690
- I like cute things.
- That's because...

1070
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,230
(While the pink bunny is
forcibly being adopted by the bag girl...)

1071
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,030
- Jong Kook loves them so much.
- Back in the day, he...

1072
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,200
- Haha, are you sure this is it?
- Yes?

1073
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,630
- Are we going the right way?
- I don't know either. I only heard.

1074
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,070
We're going pretty far.

1075
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,900
This feels so weird.

1076
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,710
Finding it must be the main part.
We're here.

1077
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,580
- Are we getting off?
- We're getting off here.

1078
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,110
- We have to get off.
- We are getting off here.

1079
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,310
- See? Why would there be cameras?
- Gosh, we're getting off.

1080
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,850
Yes, we're here at the bus stop.

1081
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,720
We'll be leaving again
in three minutes.

1082
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,320
- What?
- Do we get off? It stopped.

1083
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,490
- Let's get off.
- I see something.

1084
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,520
- Let's get off.
- It's that thing.

1085
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,720
- Which one?
- I got it.

1086
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,360
- What is it?
- What?

1087
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,420
- What is it?
- It's right there.

1088
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,030
- I got it. Hey.
- Everyone's getting off so fast.

1089
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,130
(Spotted by Jong Kook,)

1090
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,830
(there's a huge gym ball
next to the bus stop.)

1091
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,230
- What is it?
- I got it.

1092
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,500
- Everyone's getting off so fast.
- Hey.

1093
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,770
- Hey, the gym ball. Isn't this it?
- Hey.

1094
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:14,940
(Is the gym ball a magic pearl?)

1095
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,370
- Here it is.
- See?

1096
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,810
- Oh, no. That's not it.
- No.

1097
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,140
- Isn't this it? The magic pearl?
- Hey.

1098
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,310
(There's an R sticker
instead of a dragon one.)

1099
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,450
That's just...

1100
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,050
Are we looking for things
that look like balls?

1101
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,550
It's not in here, right?

1102
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:32,090
(Everyone searches for the magic pearls,
casting the gym ball aside.)

1103
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,060
(Picking it up)

1104
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,660
Hey, it's this.

1105
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,760
- We'll leave soon.
- Are we looking for these?

1106
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,330
(The dragon sticker appeared
when he flipped the ball over.)

1107
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,770
Hey, it's this.

1108
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,340
Gym Ball.

1109
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,540
A magic pearl
that's an easily spotted size.

1110
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,310
(Gym Ball, An easily spotted size)

1111
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,880
First magic pearl found.

1112
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,640
(Team Ji Yeon's
Train Bus Magic Pearl Collection)

1113
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,480
(Holding it tight)

1114
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,720
- There's another one here.
- What?

1115
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,150
- My gosh.
- This rabbit.

1116
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,650
- Jong Kook, did you find that one?
- Yes. Okay, I got this one.

1117
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,590
(Jong Kook found his magic pearl
at the bus stop.)

1118
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,890
Is it in here?

1119
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,990
(Are there any inside?)

1120
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,560
- May I look through here?
- Sure.

1121
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,590
(Smiling)

1122
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,570
All of a sudden, this is here...
Hey, I found it!

1123
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,900
All of a sudden, this is here...
Hey, I found it!

1124
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,170
Really?

1125
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,740
- Hey, that's awesome.
- Bowling Ball.

1126
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,940
- Is that for real?
- Magic pearl that's heavy to carry.

1127
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,140
Second magic pearl found.

1128
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,310
(Team Ji Yeon's
Train Bus Magic Pearl Collection)

1129
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,780
- Oh, it is.
- A circle.

1130
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,110
This is it, right?

1131
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,450
Let's find it.

1132
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,650
(I want one too.)

1133
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,190
Hang on, this is too...

1134
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,390
(Seok Sam uses the lucky item
he drew earlier.)

1135
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,490
(Magic Pearl Detector)

1136
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,030
(The sound gets louder
as he gets closer to a magic pearl.)

1137
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,670
(When he gets farther away from it,
the sound gets softer.)

1138
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,310
The others will hear it
even if I put it in here.

1139
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,440
Is that the sound?

1140
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,550
It's around here somewhere.

1141
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,850
This is mine.

1142
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,620
It's around here.

1143
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,620
(The sound is pretty loud.)

1144
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,880
Where is it?

1145
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:12,560
If it's this loud,
the others will totally notice.

1146
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,560
Oh, it's getting louder.

1147
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,230
The sound is
getting louder and louder.

1148
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,730
But didn't they say
there were some on the car too?

1149
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,400
It's around here somewhere.

1150
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
(While fighting with the sound
by himself...)

1151
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,700
(Right then)

1152
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,630
(The detector's sound
definitely got louder!)

1153
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,140
(It seems to be at the back
of the bus for sure.)

1154
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,340
The magic pearl is...
The sound is really loud here.

1155
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,840
It's here.

1156
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,350
- Smile Magnet.
- It's really loud here.

1157
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,810
(Smile Magnet,
Easy to fold and conceal)

1158
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,650
The magic pearl is...

1159
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,180
The sound is really loud here.

1160
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,380
(He's just leaving.)

1161
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,520
The sound is so loud.

1162
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,590
(He's just leaving.)

1163
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,820
Hang on. Should I go that way?

1164
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,660
(Hang on. Should I go that way?)

1165
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,160
I can't hear the sound.

1166
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,930
Hang on. Let's go this way.

1167
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,500
It's going away. It's this.

1168
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,770
(So focused on his hearing,
Seok Sam forgot about his sight.)

1169
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,570
I mean, you guys said
to find it like this, but it's...

1170
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,140
- Seok Jin, you need to get on!
- What?

1171
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,740
- Aren't you getting on?
- Seok Jin, you need to get on!

1172
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,810
What?

1173
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,340
What? Are we taking off?

1174
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,010
- Hey.
- What's this?

1175
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,810
Where did Haha go?

1176
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,580
Hey, Haha isn't there either.

1177
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,920
- Hang on! Are we just leaving?
- Hey, you have to get on!

1178
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,390
- No, but what about Haha?
- Hey! Wait!

1179
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,820
Hey!

1180
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,160
Wait!

1181
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,560
Where are you going?

1182
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,160
I'm in big trouble.

1183
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,900
Hey, how could they leave me behind?

1184
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,830
Hang on. The sound is...

1185
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,770
(The sound disappears
as the bus leaves.)

1186
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,000
Hey, what do I do?

1187
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,300
(The sound disappears
as the bus leaves.)

1188
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,170
Seok Jin, your two minutes
for your hint are now up.

1189
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,310
- Please return it.
- I can...

1190
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,710
I can use it again, right?

1191
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,940
- No.
- Only once?

1192
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,240
You can use it once at each spot.

1193
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,750
I can use it again
at a different spot?

1194
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,250
Oh, right? Not here, though.

1195
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,150
The bus has already left now,

1196
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,520
so I think...
It was at the bus stop.

1197
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,250
I think it's at each stop.

1198
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,090
Wouldn't that be right?

1199
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,060
Where else would they put it?

1200
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,190
(About to return to the starting point
after realizing common sense)

1201
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:58,060
Then, where did we start off,
not the final destination?

1202
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,260
I'll try going there.

1203
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,760
Where are you going now?

1204
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,530
Hey, over here...

1205
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,430
There are lots of bus stops here.

1206
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,140
Let's go to the next one first
and find them.

1207
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,640
(The Mapo-gu Sheriff plans to go to
Bus Stop 3 and find the pearls 1st.)

1208
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,210
There are lots of bus stops here.

1209
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,940
Just forget about that one.

1210
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,810
The members think...

1211
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,610
there are only four there.

1212
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,880
Actually, there are seven of them.

1213
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,620
I should get them first.

1214
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,650
(Scammer Ha plans to find the ones
that he tricked the others about.)

1215
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,920
Gosh, I'm dying.

1216
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,550
Gosh, what is this?

1217
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,190
Jong Kook,
are we just leaving like this?

1218
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,220
- Are we just leaving? Are they out?
- We're just leaving...

1219
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,690
I have to hurry.

1220
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,890
If I hurry...

1221
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,860
(Will Scammer Ha
or the tour train arrive first?)

1222
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,800
Haha is here. Behind us.

1223
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,030
Here it is.

1224
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,900
(Haha arrives first.)

1225
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,070
Where is it?

1226
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,540
There it is.

1227
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,970
Here it is.

1228
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,170
What does it look like?

1229
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,740
(Panting)

1230
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,220
(What?)

1231
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,750
Hey.

1232
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,750
- This is an actual ball.
- Crystal Bead.

1233
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,260
Hey. Bring another one.

1234
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,860
Can I go? Can I do whatever I want?

1235
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,390
They are magic pearls.

1236
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:07,000
(Excited after finding a magic pearl
in secret, he starts running again.)

1237
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,560
(The bus arrives at the stop
that's already been raided.)

1238
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,800
- Let me find 1 this time too.
- Yes, you should find 1.

1239
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,800
(The bus arrives at the stop
that's already been raided.)

1240
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,100
- Did you find it?
- Did you find it?

1241
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,440
Did you find it?

1242
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,880
- I think that was just trash.
- I think there's something here.

1243
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,140
I think it's right.

1244
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,710
I think I found trash.

1245
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,850
I don't think that's it.

1246
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,220
I'm anxious.
I should just stay on the bus.

1247
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,550
- I know. I'll stay on too.
- Don't leave me.

1248
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,750
Hey, Ji Hyo. Try to find it.
I'm sure it's here, for sure.

1249
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,220
There should be at least one.

1250
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,660
Is it perhaps something you can see
by flashing a light here?

1251
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,660
- No way.
- Gosh, these guys are so...

1252
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,100
You have great ideas.

1253
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,600
That's not it.

1254
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,900
(The Running Man prop team is
being overrated.)

1255
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,600
That does seem like
a round object, though.

1256
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,600
I don't think there's anything here
besides that.

1257
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,310
Hey, you should really try
holding it up to the sunlight.

1258
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:53,680
What if you can see a dragon
when you do that?

1259
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,910
- Let's take it with us for now.
- No, it's not.

1260
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,080
Darn it.

1261
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,610
(Running again)

1262
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,150
It truly feels like Running Man
for the first time in a while.

1263
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,650
(Although he may be chunkier
than 14 years ago,)

1264
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:09,160
(Little One still gets drunk on
being the cool guy.)

1265
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:15,100
(The member with the 2nd best legs
is still alive.)

1266
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:22,300
(As he runs to the first station to
find the magic pearl in secret...)

1267
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,240
Gosh, I'm running
for the first time in a while!

1268
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,540
(Another guy heads to
the first station as well.)

1269
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,880
Where is the bus stop?

1270
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,080
Isn't this it?

1271
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,680
(He's even wandering about
as he doesn't know Hongdae very well.)

1272
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,780
Where is it?

1273
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,350
Hey,
I don't even have a camera on me.

1274
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,790
(He set off before Haha,)

1275
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:40,790
(but will he be able
to arrive first?)

1276
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:41,990
Hello.

1277
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,530
(Right then, Haha shows up first.)

1278
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,300
(He enters the first bus stop.)

1279
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,470
Okay.

1280
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,370
- Got it.
- Snow Globe.

1281
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,840
(Snow Globe,
Beware of breaking glass)

1282
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,740
Fourth magic pearl found.

1283
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,310
This is...

1284
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:03,950
(Haha found two by himself.)

1285
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,680
Where is it?
Gosh, you found another one!

1286
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,250
Hey, just give me one.

1287
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,480
Let's share.

1288
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,220
- Yes, thanks.
- No, Seok Jin. Not this one.

1289
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,390
- Seok Jin, but...
- No.

1290
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,760
- You can't do this.
- No.

1291
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,260
- What do you mean, no?
- No!

1292
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,290
You can't steal it like this.

1293
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,790
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- No!

1294
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:19,960
- Then I'll steal it back.
- No, you can't.

1295
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,360
- I was just showing it to you.
- You already have one.

1296
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,730
- Seok Jin, just give it back.
- No.

1297
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,330
Then, I'll tell you.

1298
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,400
- Give this back. I have one more.
- No, I...

1299
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:27,840
Hurry up and give it back.

1300
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,370
- No!
- Give it back now!

1301
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,110
Do you know how hard I ran here?
Give it back!

1302
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,170
No!

1303
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,410
(Ripping)

1304
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,580
What?

1305
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,450
(They react like Pavlov's dog
when their name tags get ripped off.)

1306
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,550
Just let go.

1307
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,180
- Just give it back now.
- No.

1308
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,550
- You can't just say no.
- No!

1309
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,520
But it's mine.

1310
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,990
- It's not that.
- Hurry up.

1311
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,590
- But it's mine. Why are you...
- No.

1312
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,660
(Laughing)

1313
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,190
Hey, you can't steal it.

1314
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,190
(It gets taken back by force
in the end.)

1315
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,430
My gosh. Seriously.

1316
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,490
Sit down.

1317
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:52,560
Calm down and have a seat, Seok Jin.

1318
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,200
Why are you keeping two?

1319
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,300
I have two because the person
who finds more of them wins.

1320
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,030
- Then what is this?
- Stick it back on.

1321
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,070
(My name tag)

1322
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,140
- I mean, sure, I'll stick it on...
- Yes, put it back on. Quickly.

1323
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,780
Seok Jin, I...

1324
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,780
(He stole it.)

1325
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,250
- Seok Jin, I...
- Yes?

1326
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,550
(They say even a schoolyard dog
will learn to speak after 3 years.)

1327
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,780
I'll give you this.

1328
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,150
Stick mine on.

1329
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,320
(After 15 years on Running Man,
Jee Seok Sam finally steals.)

1330
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,660
Seok Jin,
I'll tell you the next spot.

1331
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,290
- Okay, then tell me the next spot.
- Okay.

1332
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,060
- Tell me.
- The next spot is...

1333
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,360
- Just follow me.
- Okay.

1334
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,800
- Tell me, you punk!
- Just follow me.

1335
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,670
- You're lying again!
- Follow me.

1336
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,130
It's there. Hurry up.

1337
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,540
Does he know I took this out?

1338
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,140
No way. I took it out.

1339
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,310
(He's not the same old Seok Sam
who was always picked on.)

1340
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,370
He doesn't know. No way.

1341
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:40,910
This is unbelievable.

1342
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,180
I didn't think
I could pull it off either.

1343
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,380
How did this work?

1344
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,410
(Seok Sam,
who's proud of himself...)

1345
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,250
We ran like crazy for
the first time in a while, right?

1346
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,650
(And Haha, who thinks he's so cool)

1347
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,050
Jong Kook, come and pick me up.

1348
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,220
(The two men who are
so into themselves meet again.)

1349
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,530
- Yes, you're coming, right?
- Okay, just wait.

1350
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:57,830
We have to take a round.

1351
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:00,100
Okay, I'll keep waiting.

1352
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,660
- I can't run anymore. I walked.
- You have to stay there.

1353
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,230
Hurry up and give it back.

1354
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,770
- Hurry up and give it here.
- Oh, Haha...

1355
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,040
Gosh, you have such quick hands now.

1356
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,740
That was nimble of you.
Now, give it back.

1357
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:11,270
- No.
- Give it back.

1358
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:13,240
- No!
- You stole it.

1359
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,080
- No way.
- Stealing isn't allowed today.

1360
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,410
- You can't help it.
- As if.

1361
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,250
- Give it back.
- Wait.

1362
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,950
How could you?

1363
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,280
Give it back.

1364
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,490
- No way.
- Give it back.

1365
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,020
- There's a reason.
- Tell me, then.

1366
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,190
- There's a reason for this.
- I can give it back, but...

1367
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,220
Sure.

1368
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,730
- Wait.
- When did you take it?

1369
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,230
As if that's important.

1370
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:33,330
But it's mine!

1371
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,560
Come on. Why are you so greedy?

1372
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,570
- This isn't greed.
- Hey!

1373
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,540
Darn you, Haha!

1374
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,040
- Haha, you're out!
- Why?

1375
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,770
I didn't know you'd check.

1376
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,510
- Give it here.
- They're here.

1377
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,180
- They're here.
- Darn.

1378
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,280
Keep this a secret for now.

1379
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,110
I can't believe you.
Why would you take two?

1380
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,510
Don't tell them how many I have.

1381
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,180
This is hilarious.

1382
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,380
- Haha.
- Yes?

1383
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,990
You even left your jacket behind.

1384
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,020
(Ji Hyo doesn't have a magic pearl,)

1385
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,090
(and she exits the bus
to search the first station.)

1386
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:00,290
I laughed so hard just now.

1387
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:01,960
You'll get another minute to search.

1388
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,960
- A minute?
- And then we'll leave.

1389
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,960
Go out there and find one.
Why aren't you finding it?

1390
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,300
(But why isn't Jong Kook
searching for the pearls?)

1391
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,100
(When the tour train bus
stopped at the second station)

1392
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,270
- Is there more?
- Where?

1393
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,470
There must be some out there.
Go ahead, Ji Hyo.

1394
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:15,140
(While the ladies exited the bus
to look for pearls)

1395
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,540
I'm highly suspicious of all this.

1396
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:18,770
What about this cushion?

1397
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,610
There's water.

1398
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,780
Wait. There's a water bottle.

1399
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,810
There's something in the water.
What's this?

1400
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:25,850
Is it lemon?

1401
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,820
Wait. Why is there a ball in this?

1402
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:32,150
- Marimo.
- I saw this when I first got on.

1403
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,290
(Marimo,
Might be in trouble without water)

1404
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,160
- Exactly. Same here.
- I don't want it to leave.

1405
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,760
I don't think there's anything here.

1406
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,630
Did you find one?
Am I the only one without one?

1407
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,530
There aren't any here.

1408
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,330
(Ji Hyo hasn't been able
to find a magic pearl.)

1409
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,770
(Glancing)

1410
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:51,370
(She rummages through
the key storage box.)

1411
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,210
- Key Ring.
- Can I keep this?

1412
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,550
(Key Ring, Very small)

1413
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,410
Sixth magic pearl found.

1414
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,020
Nicely done, Ji Hyo!

1415
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,680
- Did you find one?
- Ji Hyo.

1416
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,680
- Gosh.
- She found one.

1417
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,120
- Did you find one?
- There was one on the bus.

1418
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,350
(Seok Sam managed
to be near one earlier.)

1419
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,890
Earlier...

1420
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,390
The device beeped
when I was at the back of the bus.

1421
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,830
It beeped louder
at the back of the bus.

1422
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,600
I heard it beep louder
at the back of the bus.

1423
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,610
(He puts it back down.)

1424
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,380
This is crazy. My gosh.

1425
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,010
No way.

1426
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,350
(The witty Seok Sam
finally found it!)

1427
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:31,880
I can't believe that peeled off.

1428
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,150
Goodness.

1429
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,020
You have no idea how startled I was.

1430
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:36,790
I can't believe that peeled off.

1431
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,820
My gosh. Who knew that'd come off?

1432
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,790
- Seventh magic pearl found.
- This is crazy.

1433
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,360
(Team Ji Yeon's
Train Bus Magic Pearl Collection)

1434
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,200
End of search.

1435
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:49,670
All magic pearls were discovered.

1436
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,000
Out of the magic pearls you have,

1437
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,070
the level of one of them
will be revealed.

1438
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,270
Sure. Ask about yours.

1439
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,470
- This.
- Should we ask about that?

1440
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:56,670
- Yes, let's do that.
- Let's find out.

1441
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:57,940
- Let's check its value.
- Sure.

1442
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,080
Maybe it's more valuable
the heavier it is.

1443
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,810
- That could be true.
- I hope that's true.

1444
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,310
- Is it the Bowling Ball?
- Yes.

1445
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,480
This magic pearl...

1446
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,550
This magic pearl
is below level three.

1447
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:11,850
(The heavy Bowling Ball
is below level three.)

1448
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,660
- Below?
- It's nothing good.

1449
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,820
- The smaller the better, then.
- That sounds like it.

1450
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:18,730
Hold on a second.

1451
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,960
- Ji Yeon.
- Did we find all of them?

1452
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,230
- Can you be honest?
- Sure.

1453
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,670
- Will you deceive us like him?
- Really?

1454
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,170
- Guys, hear me out.
- What is it?

1455
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:30,040
More people have them.

1456
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,610
- Have what? Magic pearls?
- Yes.

1457
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,410
- Let's be honest.
- You found one, right?

1458
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:34,440
- Yes.
- How many did you find?

1459
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,180
- One.
- One.

1460
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,480
- I have two.
- Right.

1461
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,710
- That's five.
- Sure.

1462
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,380
- To be honest...
- How many were there?

1463
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,980
- What now?
- There are two more.

1464
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,220
- What? There are two more?
- No way.

1465
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,090
Just tell us how many there were!

1466
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:46,890
There are seven among us.

1467
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,120
- Did we find them all?
- What she has.

1468
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:49,590
- That's not true.
- Didn't we find them all?

1469
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,630
- No way.
- You did.

1470
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,860
Someone hasn't been forthcoming.

1471
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,800
You're wired in the weirdest way.

1472
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,060
- I can't believe you.
- He's the weird one.

1473
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,070
- What's the matter with him?
- I think they all have one.

1474
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,600
You have to come clean
later on anyway.

1475
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,270
- Right.
- Sure, I get it now.

1476
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,710
Canoeing was fun.

1477
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,910
Right. Additional magic pearls
have been detected.

1478
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:08,710
- Please check the locations.
- Then let's...

1479
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,010
I'll listen to it.

1480
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,310
(Unlike the opposing team,
things are peaceful.)

1481
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:13,980
(Looking good)

1482
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,220
You look good.

1483
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,590
- Goodness.
- Where are they?

1484
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,560
Magic pearls have appeared.

1485
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:22,890
Magic pearls have appeared.

1486
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:25,360
(Yanghwa Han River Park,
Mapo Tour Train Bus)

1487
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,530
Three magic pearls...

1488
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,460
have been detected
in a Western restaurant in Mapo.

1489
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,970
Three magic pearls
have been detected...

1490
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,870
in a barbecue restaurant in Mapo.

1491
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,640
- Right.
- Where are they?

1492
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,410
Three magic pearls...

1493
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,070
- in a Western restaurant in Mapo.
- A Western restaurant?

1494
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,010
Three magic pearls
in a barbecue restaurant in Mapo.

1495
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:42,240
(Precise)

1496
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,850
(She beams at the sound
of a Western restaurant.)

1497
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,550
- In Mapo.
- A Western restaurant.

1498
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,250
- A Western restaurant.
- Ye Eun beamed after hearing that.

1499
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,320
Western or barbecue?

1500
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,420
How about Western?

1501
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,590
How many are
at the Western restaurant?

1502
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,690
- Western...
- There are three each.

1503
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,830
Let's go
to the Western restaurant then.

1504
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:58,890
We'll head
to the Western restaurant.

1505
00:50:58,890 --> 00:50:59,900
- The Western restaurant?
- Yes.

1506
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,100
It sounds delicious!

1507
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,130
The other team could also choose...

1508
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,370
- the Western restaurant.
- That's right.

1509
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,670
But since Jong Kook is on that team,

1510
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:09,670
- they'll...
- It's barbecue for sure.

1511
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:10,810
- Not Western.
- They'll choose barbecue.

1512
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,670
But Seok Jin loves Western cuisine.

1513
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,180
- Right. I...
- You're right about that.

1514
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,880
- We have similar tastes in food.
- I don't know what Ji Yeon likes.

1515
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,180
- Ji Yeon...
- They'll go for barbecue.

1516
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,780
Ji Yeon loves her meat.

1517
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,050
- Really?
- We've been friends for 15 years.

1518
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,080
And?

1519
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,990
While filming a series,

1520
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,190
we're given an hour each...

1521
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:27,660
- for lunch and dinner.
- Right.

1522
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,860
She always has grilled pork belly.

1523
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:30,890
- Really?
- Yes.

1524
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:32,160
- Really?
- Even when on a tight schedule,

1525
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,860
she spends 15 to 20 minutes
eating grilled pork belly.

1526
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,730
- How so?
- She must like pork belly.

1527
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:38,830
She can't do her work
unless she has a proper meal.

1528
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,440
- This must be it. Goodness.
- Where?

1529
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,270
- Hold on. To the right?
- Should we get off?

00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,110
Let's go.

1532
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,340
(Western restaurant in Mapo,
Barbecue restaurant in Mapo)

1533
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,050
- This is the place.
- What is this place?

1534
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:51,880
Pasta and risotto!

1535
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,350
Where can they be
in this small restaurant?

1536
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:54,750
Where in this restaurant are they?

1537
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,520
- What is this?
- Where are they?

1538
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,250
We were told there were three here.

1539
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,820
- We must find them.
- Our team has to win.

1540
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,920
What could be
in a small restaurant like this?

1541
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,690
There aren't any places
to hide objects.

1542
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:05,690
Tell me about it.

1543
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:06,960
- I'm at a loss.
- There are only three here.

1544
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,600
Where in this place
did they hide them?

1545
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,800
I don't see
where they could've been hidden.

1546
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,800
I can't find anything.

1547
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,500
Maybe there's something here
that doesn't belong to the staff.

1548
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,970
Did they leave
anything behind in here?

1549
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,740
No?

1550
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,210
Are these onions yours?

1551
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,540
(- Are these onions yours?
- Yes.)

1552
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,140
Is this yours?

1553
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,250
Sorry about that.

1554
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:25,810
Is this yours?

1555
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,020
Sorry.

1556
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,380
I should just leave.

1557
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,820
- Jae Seok. Everything is theirs.
- Did you find one?

1558
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:32,620
Why can't I find a single one?

1559
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,890
There isn't anything here.

1560
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,220
I'm clueless.

1561
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,930
How can they be this good
at hiding objects?

1562
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,690
This is tough.

1563
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,460
Where did they hide them?

1564
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,230
(One has a cover while one doesn't.)

1565
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:47,140
(Only one of the lamps has a cover?)

1566
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,600
(I get it.)

1567
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,340
(He checks the golden veil.)

1568
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,970
My gosh.

1569
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:55,110
You people are unbelievable.

1570
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:56,710
Beaded Wig. It will be destroyed...

1571
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,250
if taken off the head
for more than one minute.

1572
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,250
(Team Ji Yeon's
Restaurant Magic Pearl Collection)

1573
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,580
They're impossible to find.

1574
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,980
(He found the magic pearl
that wasn't a cover but a wig!)

1575
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:03,990
Is there one?

1576
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,420
What? Is there one?

1577
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,720
(Only two magic pearls remain.)

1578
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,760
- What is it?
- What?

1579
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,090
Jae Seok, it was this.

1580
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:11,330
- What was it?
- Really?

1581
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,860
- It was this.
- The sticker is tiny in this case.

1582
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,700
Can you believe the staff?
How can one even see this?

1583
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,370
- Unbelievable.
- That's an impressive find.

1584
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:19,500
This is how it is
in this restaurant.

1585
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,340
Does he have to wear it?

1586
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:22,570
Do I have to wear it?

1587
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,310
- No way.
- The sticker's tiny.

1588
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:25,370
Is this it?

1589
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,840
(Wearing the golden magic pearl)

1590
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,710
- Jae Seok...
- Does he have to wear it?

1591
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:30,010
Isn't this the same as a penalty?

1592
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,950
- It's nice though.
- Wear the cap too.

1593
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:34,550
Like that. That's good.

1594
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,150
- That looks good.
- I agree.

1595
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:39,550
I had only been looking
for big stickers.

1596
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,290
So that's how it is.

1597
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:43,190
(Team Seong Jae is now aware
of how hard they must look.)

1598
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:44,430
I get it now.

1599
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,130
Where on earth are they?

1600
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:50,100
(Checking deep inside the kitchen)

1601
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:54,900
(He even searches through the items
in the fridge.)

1602
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,000
Where could they be?

1603
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:58,710
This is a good hiding spot.

1604
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:02,580
Wait!

1605
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,320
(He finds the second magic pearl
inside the freezer!)

1606
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,980
Seriously?

1607
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,090
Did you find one?

1608
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,720
Are you kidding me?

1609
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:15,090
Ice Ball. No more
than half of it should melt.

1610
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:16,990
This...

1611
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,630
How am I supposed
to carry it around?

1612
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,660
(Team Seong Jae's
Restaurant Magic Pearl Collection)

1613
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:20,900
This...

1614
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,970
(He found one,)

1615
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:28,540
(but the magic pearl looks brutal.)

1616
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,540
What the...

1617
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,810
- Did you find one?
- Did you find one?

1618
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,210
- Is that ice?
- Is this for real?

1619
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,410
How can I carry this around?

1620
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:37,480
(He brought it out for now but...)

1621
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,180
- How...
- That's insane.

1622
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,320
How am I supposed
to carry this around?

1623
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,950
- Is that real ice?
- This is crazy.

1624
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,690
(Half of it must be intact
for it to be valid.)

1625
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,220
I wouldn't want
to carry that around.

1626
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,160
- But it'll melt.
- It's freezing to the touch.

1627
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:52,230
- No way.
- That's crazy.

1628
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:53,760
Hey, check out Jong Kook.

1629
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,500
He's carrying something this huge.

1630
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,300
No way.

1631
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,670
Are you kidding me?

1632
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,970
How am I supposed
to carry this around?

1633
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,200
- Do we look for more here?
- Is it this place?

1634
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:04,940
Is this the place?

1635
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,270
- Can I start searching?
- Okay!

1636
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,540
There are three
magic pearls in here?

1637
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,980
Start searching.

1638
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,750
(They head to the window to watch.)

1639
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:11,850
Are you kidding me?

1640
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,010
- Where is he?
- What is he carrying around?

1641
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:15,220
Something big like a balloon.

1642
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,690
(Quietly)

1643
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,420
(Was Seong Jae trying
to take a photo?)

1644
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,460
(Pretending
not to have done anything)

1645
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,890
I can't believe it.

1646
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:24,030
- You...
- Can't we search over there?

1647
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:26,460
- You could.
- Did you just take a photo?

1648
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:29,660
- I've been taking one of them all.
- We can search that place too.

1649
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,770
Why did you take a photo of it?

1650
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,400
- I've been taking one of them all.
- What is it?

1651
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,100
He took a photo out of the blue.

1652
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:35,440
- I took one of all of them.
- That must be a hidden mission.

1653
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,540
Why are you acting strange?

1654
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,140
- You... Get over here.
- Is that his task?

1655
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,370
(He moves away from them for now.)

1656
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,680
- I've been taking photos of them.
- What do you make of this?

1657
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,680
- Why is he taking photos of them?
- You...

1658
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,850
- Get over here.
- I've been doing that all day.

1659
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:45,210
Why are you red in the face?

1660
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,820
- Get over here.
- Delete the photos.

1661
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:47,820
Delete them.

1662
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,320
- This is a violation of our rights.
- Bring it here.

1663
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:53,560
(Actually, he drew an item
earlier on!)

1664
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,720
Magic Pearl Level Scanner.

1665
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,530
Take a photo of a magic pearl...

1666
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,730
to check its level.

1667
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:02,960
(Cotton Candy, Level 9)

1668
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,070
Hold on.
I should take a photo of it first.

1669
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:06,670
I need to take a photo
of Jae Seok's.

1670
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:07,770
Hey!

1671
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:10,070
(He failed
because Se Chan interfered.)

1672
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,210
(He took a photo of his bell
in the car while on the move.)

1673
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,810
(Round Bell, Level 10)

1674
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:17,180
(Keeping a poker face
even with the high level)

1675
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,780
- Can I try it on too? Yes.
- Do you want to try it?

1676
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,380
(He checks the wig naturally
as if taking a memorable selfie.)

1677
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,450
(Beaded Wig, Level 3)

1678
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:27,520
(He tried taking a picture
of the Ice Ball too,)

1679
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,830
(but he couldn't take it
and got caught by Jae Seok.)

1680
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:33,260
- Delete it.
- Hey, come over here. Delete it.

1681
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,000
- This is a violation of our rights.
- Bring it here.

1682
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
- Delete it.
- You have a mission, don't you?

1683
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,270
- Come here.
- I'll tell you.

1684
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,200
- This is advantageous for our team.
- What is it?

1685
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,970
Every picture I take...

1686
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,700
(Eyes shaking)

1687
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,370
They tell me
the total points they're worth.

1688
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,470
(The level)

1689
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,480
- You're lying.
- Stop lying.

1690
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,010
- No, for real.
- Delete them.

1691
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:51,810
- Delete everything you took.
- Just delete them.

1692
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:52,910
- The total points...
- Delete them all.

1693
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,520
- Delete them all.
- I knew it. He suddenly...

1694
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,420
asked if he could try this on.

1695
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:57,490
- "This?" So, I said, "Go on."
- You...

1696
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:58,520
- He took a selfie, didn't he?
- Delete them.

1697
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,820
- He took a selfie.
- Hurry up and delete them.

1698
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:01,820
- No, but really. For our team...
- How am I...

1699
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,690
- You seriously...
- We can win this mission.

1700
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,160
- But are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1701
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,830
- Isn't it only good for you?
- No.

1702
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:09,430
Our team should win first.

1703
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:11,030
- I can't tell if you're honest.
- We have to win.

1704
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,370
If you just let me take photos
of the egg and that magic pearl,

1705
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:16,200
we can find out the total points
that our team has.

1706
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,810
And if you let me take photos
of the other teams' pearls too,

1707
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:21,310
- I can tell you their total. Yes.
- Really?

1708
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:22,310
- Are you certain?
- Yes.

1709
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:24,650
- I'm not even blushing now.
- Why didn't you say so before?

1710
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,110
Why would you take photos
behind our backs?

1711
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,180
Right, you should've just told us.

1712
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,450
- Show us all the photos you took.
- I mean...

1713
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:31,120
- Ye Eun, take a look. Show her.
- Just give it to me first.

1714
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,920
- Show us first.
- You have to show us.

1715
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,120
Really? Honestly?

1716
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,320
- Yes.
- Yes, be honest.

1717
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,890
- What did it say?
- I'm allowed to share, right?

1718
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:38,460
- Yes.
- It doesn't matter.

1719
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:41,460
First, it's true
that I get to know the points.

1720
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,030
- If you show them the photo?
- Does that perhaps make it yours?

1721
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:45,500
- Yes.
- What?

1722
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,170
- Yes.
- What?

1723
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,970
Then, is this yours now?

1724
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,240
Yes.

1725
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,440
Jae Seok, this guy is a jerk.

1726
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:53,980
- What's up with this guy?
- What is he doing?

1727
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,110
So, he just made me wear this thing,

1728
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,550
and he's just going to take it
in the end.

1729
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,010
So, if he takes photos,
they just become his.

1730
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,350
They become his
when he takes photos.

1731
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,350
But in the end,
our team will win, no matter what.

1732
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:07,090
But you mean you'll win
with or without us.

1733
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:10,060
Oh, then I... Well,
you didn't get a picture of mine.

1734
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,990
So, if you help me get photos
of the other team's items,

1735
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,800
our team will definitely win.

1736
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,560
- That's true.
- If I have a photo on my own,

1737
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,600
our team can win
by taking all of the total points.

1738
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,470
- Then, take pictures in secret.
- That's what I mean.

1739
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:21,500
Seong Jae, hurry over there.

1740
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,570
- Go.
- Go and take photos.

1741
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,270
- Take your phone and go.
- Go and get photos.

1742
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:25,610
- Take photos of everything.
- Do I go by myself?

1743
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,180
If we all go,
they'll just be on guard.

1744
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,310
If I go by myself,
I think they'll steal my phone.

1745
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:31,850
- Then, I'll go with you.
- Good.

1746
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:34,320
Do you have a show here today?

1747
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:35,850
(They set off with Yangleopatra.)

1748
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,550
Hey, let's go.
Let's take some photos.

1749
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,550
All right. Go on.

1750
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:39,590
Seong Jae, come on.

1751
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,960
Hey, but you...
I'm actually really upset.

1752
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,030
Just tell me.
I'll betray the others too. Okay?

1753
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:49,500
- I just know the points...
- Yes?

1754
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,470
- of the photos I take. Yes.
- The points?

1755
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:52,570
- They don't become yours?
- No.

1756
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,970
- Oh, they don't become yours?
- No.

1757
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:54,970
Oh, okay.

1758
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:58,010
So, there are three in here, right?

1759
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,640
There's no way they hid them
in places like these,

1760
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,610
- right?
- I checked all of these.

1761
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,810
(Beeping)

1762
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:07,180
What is this? What's going on?

1763
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,380
- What is that sound?
- Here.

1764
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,420
What is that sound?

1765
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,850
It's here.

1766
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:13,860
(The sound got louder
as he entered the kitchen.)

1767
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:16,760
Here it is. Darn it.

1768
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,090
- Seok Jin!
- He found it.

1769
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:20,090
- Where is it?
- This is mad. How do I carry this?

1770
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,500
- Is it ice?
- It's ice. Darn it.

1771
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:23,700
This will melt.

1772
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,900
- Oh, my gosh!
- That could be valuable.

1773
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,100
- How do I carry this around?
- That must be why they said...

1774
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,340
- to maintain it well.
- Right, they said that.

1775
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,910
They said to maintain it
so that more than half of it's left.

1776
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,640
- How do I carry this around?
- Gosh, Seok Jin, that's so funny.

1777
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,840
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1778
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,110
Goodness,
that's the hardest one ever.

1779
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:37,950
This isn't supposed to melt, right?

1780
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:40,620
- So, you should...
- There has to be more than half?

1781
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,080
It'll last enough for there to be
more than half left.

1782
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,550
I can't let it shatter.

1783
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,090
- What? Hey! Darn it!
- What?

1784
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:53,030
- Hey! What a weird guy.
- Seong Jae!

1785
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,630
- Hey!
- It's Se Chan.

1786
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:56,300
- Look at this weirdo. Hey.
- Why?

1787
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:59,600
(Se Chan snatches the magic pearl
just like that.)

1788
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,970
- Hey! What a weird guy.
- Seong Jae!

1789
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:02,400
(Snapping a photo)

1790
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,570
(He successfully gets a photo
of the Ice Ball he failed with Jae Seok.)

1791
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:06,810
Ice Ball.

1792
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:08,910
Level Nine.

1793
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:14,320
(Ice Ball, Level 9)

1794
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,850
(It's a whopping Level Nine.)

1795
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:20,290
- Hey! What a weird guy.
- Seong Jae!

1796
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:22,390
- Take it. Smash it.
- Hey!

1797
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:25,290
Look at this weirdo. Hey.
When did you get here?

1798
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:26,730
- Just go and smash it.
- Hey!

1799
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:28,800
- Throw it on the ground.
- Hang on. Hey.

1800
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,430
- Wait, what is this?
- Bring it here. Quickly. Hey!

1801
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:31,900
- What is this?
- Don't do that.

1802
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:33,170
Seong Jae, you just...

1803
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:35,600
- But what is this?
- You're just... What do you think?

1804
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,640
Take a photo of it first.

1805
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:39,710
(Screaming)

1806
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,110
(A sigh of relief)

1807
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,810
(His heart nearly sank.)

1808
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,810
- Gosh, I only have this one.
- Did you get it?

1809
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,010
Oh, right. The photo.
Take the photo first.

1810
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,750
- I took it.
- I only have this one.

1811
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,620
- Good. Smash it.
- Let's go.

1812
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,650
- What are you doing, Seong Jae?
- Throw it over there.

1813
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:54,760
- Gosh, my hands were freezing!
- Hey, where...

1814
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,590
(He takes it right away...)

1815
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,630
Hey, don't!

1816
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:59,630
(Smashed)

1817
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:03,330
(The Level 9 Ice Ball gets
smashed to bits.)

1818
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,330
(Screaming)

1819
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,700
- Oh, my.
- They smashed it.

1820
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,870
- Gosh, when did they get here?
- When did they get here?

1821
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,640
(The magic pearl gets
horribly shattered before his eyes.)

1822
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,970
- They smashed it.
- Oh, no!

1823
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,740
- Darn it.
- Oh, no!

1824
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,810
(Picking up the remains)

1825
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:20,150
Gosh, I only have this one.
Seriously.

1826
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,520
Hey, Seok Jin only has one.

1827
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,220
(They don't care and run off.)

1828
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,090
What? What now?

1829
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,790
(Making sure it's really dead)

1830
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,190
- It's already...
- I think it's done for.

1831
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:33,590
- done for.
- No.

1832
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,400
- That little...
- Oh, no.

1833
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,170
- Seok Jin.
- You're done for, Seok Jin.

1834
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,430
- Oh, no.
- Seok Jin.

1835
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:40,600
Farewell.

1836
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,070
- Jae Seok, hurry up and hide this.
- Did you...

1837
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:44,110
Because we just smashed Seok Jin's.

1838
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:46,470
- Hide it where? Hurry up.
- Just hide it where he can't see.

1839
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:48,710
- Just hide it here.
- Give it here. I mean...

1840
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:51,950
Seong Jae got photos
of Seok Jin's magic pearl.

1841
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,080
- Did you get photos?
- I did.

1842
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,650
So, we can figure out
what level that is too.

1843
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,920
But if you took a photo,
that means this is yours too.

1844
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,560
He told me honestly
on our way there.

1845
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,120
When he takes photos,
he just knows the points.

1846
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,230
It doesn't become his.

1847
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:06,290
- I see.
- How can you tell them that?

1848
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,330
- Tell them what?
- How can you tell them that?

1849
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:10,260
We're a team. We should all know.

1850
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,130
He just finds out the points?

1851
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,500
- So, let's just win first.
- Let's win.

1852
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:17,940
Jae Seok, still, we smashed one
of Seok Jin's and won points.

1853
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:19,070
Oh, thank you.

1854
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,380
Oh, there's bread!

1855
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,110
"Oh, there's bread!"

1856
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,280
Shall we order some food first?

1857
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,580
It could be in the food.
We could cut into a pork cutlet...

1858
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:31,390
(They're guessing the magic pearl
will be hidden in the food.)

1859
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:34,520
(They start ordering right away.)

1860
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:35,790
- Pasta?
- Do you want this?

1861
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:36,890
They have pasta.

1862
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:39,190
- The Cheongyang chili sounds good.
- Yes, this one.

1863
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,830
- Can I have this one?
- The risotto?

1864
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,160
- Shall we order a pizza to share?
- A pizza?

1865
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,300
Oh, they must give it to us
if we eat everything.

1866
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,070
- What?
- If we eat everything,

1867
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,570
- they might...
- But why are you so happy?

1868
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:53,210
(Anyway, they decide to look for
the magic pearls in the food.)

1869
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:54,610
Did we find two here...

1870
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,510
It must be so tasty
to dip the bread in this.

1871
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:58,480
- Thank you for the food.
- It's warm.

1872
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,280
Bushman bread. Oh, my.
The salad looks like a flower.

1873
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:02,480
Is there something here?

1874
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:06,120
(She looks for a magic pearl
out of courtesy.)

1875
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,520
Dip it in butter.

1876
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:10,420
It's delicious.

1877
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,590
Hey, if you take all the butter...

1878
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,360
Right.

1879
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,960
You took half the butter.

1880
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,270
(Practically spreading bread
on butter)

1881
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,600
Gosh, this is so good.

1882
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,870
- What? Do you eat it like this?
- I think so.

1883
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:27,180
(He tastes the salad
like an animal chews on hay.)

1884
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,510
- Jae Seok.
- It's butter.

1885
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,480
- Try the salad. It's so good.
- Really?

1886
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:31,810
Totally.

1887
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:33,310
(Taking a bite after Se Chan)

1888
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,350
I love bread.

1889
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:36,350
This is really good.

1890
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:37,850
- Really?
- Is it?

1891
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,120
(They boost their appetites
with the appetizers.)

1892
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,420
- Oh, my.
- What's this?

1893
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,790
(The 2nd course is pasta.)

1894
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:47,430
There are so many clams in here.

1895
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:49,430
- This is the Cheongyang...
- Cream pasta with bacon...

1896
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,460
Cheongyang chilies.

1897
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,370
I haven't had Western food
in a while.

1898
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:55,100
- Hey, don't lie. Seriously.
- No...

1899
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,600
It's been a while
since I've had Western food.

1900
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,010
(Trying the spaghetti alle vongole)

1901
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,710
- Is it so good?
- Yes.

1902
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,480
- Is it so good?
- Yes.

1903
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:04,650
I'm sorry, but are you my mom?

1904
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:08,380
You were so soft-spoken
during the opening.

1905
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:10,590
Oh, this...

1906
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:12,650
I love spaghetti alle vongole
so much.

1907
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:15,320
Can I try a bite
of the spaghetti alle vongole?

1908
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,430
- Go ahead.
- I haven't used this fork.

1909
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:19,460
Sure, go ahead.

1910
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:21,430
I haven't had spaghetti alle vongole
in so long.

1911
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:23,000
- Gosh, this is so good.
- This is delicious.

1912
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:29,100
Try this too.
The cream pasta with bacon.

1913
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,810
(A big bite)

1914
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:35,410
(Exclaiming)

1915
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:37,980
I think this one... It's so good.

1916
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:41,150
- The cream pasta.
- It's so thick and creamy.

1917
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,580
It is thick. It's good, right?

1918
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,590
Yes.

1919
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,120
(Food Fighter's recommended dishes
never fail to impress.)

1920
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,590
Isn't it good?

1921
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,960
- Gosh, what's that?
- What is this?

1922
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,630
It's the soft tofu thing.
No, what is it?

1923
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:55,260
It's so fascinating.
It just looks like cheese.

1924
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,270
I haven't seen anything like it.
The soft tofu looks fluffy.

1925
01:04:58,270 --> 01:04:59,700
Gosh, they cook so quickly.

1926
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,270
They do cook really fast.

1927
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,640
I feel like I'm eating
with Zhu Bajie.

1928
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,210
It's nice that I can speak softly
since she'll repeat it loudly.

1929
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:07,380
Are you that excited?

1930
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,340
(Ji Bajie doesn't miss a single comment
when it comes to food.)

1931
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,110
- Let me have a bite.
- Oh, sure.

1932
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:15,720
(Of course, she doesn't miss out
on the food either.)

1933
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,490
Gosh, Ji Ye Eun is so funny.

1934
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,520
You're not thinking of
enjoying the food here quickly...

1935
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,220
and going there for more, are you?

1936
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:26,590
If you do,
I won't let you get away with it.

1937
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:28,630
- You must've been really hungry.
- Hey, she's always like that.

1938
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:30,460
- What is that?
- The risotto. My gosh.

1939
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,000
I should take a bite of that too.

1940
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,070
(The third course is a risotto.)

1941
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,670
They serve the food
so beautifully here.

1942
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:37,740
The abalone...

1943
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:39,840
(Detective Yuk doesn't forget
to look for the magic pearl.)

1944
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,680
- The intestines look tasty.
- Is that not it?

1945
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,110
Abalone intestine risotto... Oh, my.

1946
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:44,510
Abalone intestine risotto?

1947
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:46,610
Seong Jae, you don't miss a thing,
do you?

1948
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:49,220
(Looking through the whole abalone)

1949
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,520
- Hey, this looks good.
- Yes, it does.

1950
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,120
- It's nothing.
- It's not there.

1951
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,520
Then shall we try it?

1952
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,460
- Shall we?
- Yes, it looks like it'd be good.

1953
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:59,790
(They stop their search
and eat comfortably.)

1954
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,260
It's kind of like abalone porridge.

1955
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,160
(She catches his comment.)

1956
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,430
This is totally abalone porridge.

1957
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:06,170
Gosh,
it's pretty much abalone porridge.

1958
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:07,170
Just dig in.
(Detective Yuk relaxes
and begins to eat.)

1959
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:10,140
- We'll get a salmon steak.
- That's right.

1960
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,810
We ordered so many dishes.

1961
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:14,040
- There's a salmon steak.
- Salmon.

1962
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,380
You ate very neatly.

1963
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:16,410
(The fourth dish is a salmon steak.)

1964
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,080
Gosh, Jae Seok.

1965
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:21,950
- Gosh.
- Is it amazing?

1966
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,050
Is it really tasty?

1967
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,290
The doneness is even. I'm serious.

1968
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:28,160
(They forget about the magic pearls
and inhale the dish.)

1969
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,490
- It's so juicy.
- Really?

1970
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,290
- There really is juice.
- Seriously.

1971
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:33,590
I can't eat anymore.

1972
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,000
- Pizza.
- But we nearly ate everything.

1973
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:38,900
- We ordered too many dishes.
- Yes.

1974
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:39,930
(They grow tired
of the never-ending meal.)

1975
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:41,440
I don't think I can eat pizza.

1976
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,170
I think I can eat a slice of pizza.

1977
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:45,210
The pizza is here. We're ruined.

1978
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:46,540
My stomach is about to burst.

1979
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,680
(The last dish, pizza appears.)

1980
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,710
There's some left.

1981
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,340
(Grinning)

1982
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,050
Ye Eun, why did you order this?

1983
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,250
- Would you like a slice?
- No, I'm full.

1984
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,150
Once the dish gets served,

1985
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:57,890
someone will eat it.

1986
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:00,420
You can eat it since it's sweet.

1987
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:03,360
(Everyone is finished,
but Food Fighter eats pizza.)

1988
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,490
(She savors the taste.)

1989
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:05,560
It's tasty.

1990
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,590
Jae Seok,

1991
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:08,660
let's take that pizza to go.
We'll ride the bus with the others.

1992
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,100
I'm certain Haha will eat it.

1993
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,670
I'm certain
Seok Jin will eat it as well.

1994
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:13,530
- They'll definitely eat it.
- That's right. They'll love it.

1995
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:14,840
Jae Seok, let's do this.

1996
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,370
If we carry that pizza,

1997
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:18,340
they'll mistake it
for a magic pearl.

1998
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:19,510
Then they'll eat it.

1999
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:23,140
Let's take it to go.
Please put it in a box for us.

2000
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:24,810
- Let's carry it around.
- That's perfect.

2001
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:26,580
- That's perfect, right?
- They'll get the wrong idea.

2002
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,020
- Can we get that sticker anywhere?
- Seriously.

2003
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,220
Isn't it a great idea?

2004
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,220
- The dragon sticker.
- They'll definitely eat it.

2005
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:34,220
If we carry it,
they'll definitely eat it.

2006
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:35,360
(The meal ends with pizza.)

2007
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,920
- I love vongole pasta.
- Where is the other one?

2008
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,360
- We can't find the other one.
- There's one more.

2009
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,460
Can you tell us where it is?

2010
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,000
- It's in here.
- It's in here.

2011
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,370
- Where is it?
- We can't see it anywhere.

2012
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:47,230
- Seriously.
- Where is it?

2013
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,040
It might be something small.

2014
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,870
Hold on. Is it in here?

2015
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:53,640
We haven't checked the photos.

2016
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,510
It'll be nice to have a small one...

2017
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:57,310
- that's easy to carry around.
- Seriously.

2018
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:59,910
- For the team, we must find it.
- We must find it.

2019
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,350
(Ye Eun checks the dishes again.)

2020
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:03,620
(Staring)

2021
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,550
Stop worrying about us and eat.

2022
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:06,920
(Stop worrying about us and eat.)

2023
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,360
- Eat. Don't pretend to look for it.
- That's right, Ye Eun.

2024
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,130
It's okay.
We were just joking around.

2025
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:13,630
Just eat.

2026
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:15,300
- She's stressed out.
- There's nothing to find.

2027
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,460
Why are you pretending
to look for it?

2028
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,370
- Stop it.
- Sit down and eat.

2029
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,000
It's okay, Ye Eun.

2030
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:24,040
(She keeps searching.)

2031
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:26,410
- It can't be a plate.
- I found it.

2032
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,610
Where?

2033
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:29,080
- It can't be a plate.
- I found it.

2034
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:30,340
Abalone.

2035
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:32,010
- Half of the meat must remain.
- Really?

2036
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:33,110
(There was an abalone garnish
next to the salmon steak.)

2037
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,480
This isn't easy.

2038
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,680
I can't believe it.

2039
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,320
- I found it.
- Where?

2040
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:38,820
- Really?
- Abalone.

2041
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:40,350
Don't lie.

2042
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,790
You shouldn't eat it.

2043
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:43,390
(Why did she eat the abalone?)

2044
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:44,990
I can't believe it.

2045
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:48,360
I can't believe it.

2046
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,530
Ye Eun.

2047
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:51,100
You weren't supposed to eat it.

2048
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:52,770
- It's over.
- It's over. It's gone.

2049
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:54,870
(Abalone Magic Pearl is gone.)

2050
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:57,540
- Are you serious?
- Why on earth did you eat it?

2051
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:59,510
- Are you serious?
- Why did you eat it?

2052
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,180
(The magic pearl
disappeared into her mouth.)

2053
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,510
Hey, Ye Eun.

2054
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:06,210
- Why did you eat it?
- Why on earth did you eat it?

2055
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:08,550
- Food Fighter.
- Stop it.

2056
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:10,220
- It won't work.
- It's over.

2057
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,250
- Chew and swallow.
- Hold on. Did you chew it?

2058
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:13,150
- We can't use it. She chewed it.
- Did you cut it in half?

2059
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,960
- She chewed it.
- No, I didn't cut it in half.

2060
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:15,990
- We can't use it.
- It's over.

2061
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:17,290
- I didn't cut it in half.
- Ye Eun, we can't use it.

2062
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:18,830
- Seriously.
- Stop. We don't want to see it.

2063
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:20,830
It can't be aired.

2064
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,460
- Listen.
- Of course, it can't be aired.

2065
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:24,470
- It can't be aired. Just eat it.
- I'm serious.

2066
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:25,930
- I've only chewed it twice so far.
- Ye Eun.

2067
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:27,640
- It's over.
- It hasn't been broken down yet.

2068
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,170
Why did you eat it...

2069
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:30,700
before showing it to us?

2070
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,310
I thought
that I'd still have the shell.

2071
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:34,540
- You thought it was the shell?
- Yes.

2072
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:36,480
It was the abalone.

2073
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,780
- Eat what's in your mouth.
- Eat it.

2074
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,750
I can save it.

2075
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,980
We don't want to see it.

2076
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:46,120
- It's over. Eat it.
- Chew it. It's over.

2077
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,290
What was the level?

2078
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:49,390
If it's high, I won't stay still.

2079
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:50,930
The abalone was...

2080
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:51,990
- Level Eight.
- We're ruined.

2081
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:54,400
(The abalone was Level 8.)

2082
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,500
(The level was quite high.)

2083
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,800
We already lost 17 points.

2084
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,540
- Jae Seok.
- Why did you eat it right away?

2085
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,640
Hurry up and eat it.

2086
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,110
- Is there no way?
- Food Fighter is scary.

2087
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:08,980
- How strange...
- Jae Seok, here's the thing.

2088
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,910
Let's say the magic pearl was here.

2089
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:12,750
Then she should've just gone,
"I found it!"

2090
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,420
How did she think to eat it?

2091
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:15,750
That's what fascinates me.

2092
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:17,080
Why did she eat it?

2093
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,190
- Besides, it wasn't before a meal.
- She wasn't full yet.

2094
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:20,390
She wasn't full yet.

2095
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,920
It wasn't before a meal.
It was after a meal.

2096
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,690
- Just now...
- The silken tofu let me know...

2097
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:26,460
what she was like.

2098
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:27,860
Is it tasty?

2099
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:29,830
- Is it tasty?
- It's really tasty.

2100
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:30,860
- Now,
- Is it tasty?

2101
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,800
let's take off the sticker
and put it on the pizza box.

2102
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,540
- Here you go.
- All right.

2103
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:35,900
(The dragon sticker goes
to the pizza box for a feint.)

2104
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,370
Don't make it so obvious.

2105
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,610
It doesn't matter.

2106
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,280
You found the two magic pearls
in the restaurant.

2107
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,680
- One was eaten and destroyed.
- Yes.

2108
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,080
- We enjoyed it.
- It was tasty.

2109
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:48,350
(Ji Yeon found
the second magic pearl.)

2110
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:49,450
What?

2111
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,950
- Is that it?
- Candy.

2112
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:53,190
(Candy, Lv. ??,
Must contain 2 or more)

2113
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:56,860
We should start getting hung up
on the bowling ball.

2114
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:58,490
You can eat all of it.

2115
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,290
No. I just want the fried egg.

2116
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,330
It's so tasty.

2117
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,630
(He ate the fried egg.)

2118
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,130
(Jong Kook found something
belatedly.)

2119
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:08,170
How is this... What's this?

2120
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:10,140
How is this...
Is this a magic pearl?

2121
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:12,870
- There's a sticker here.
- A fried egg.

2122
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:14,010
Was it a magic pearl?

2123
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,080
- It was.
- I'm sorry.

2124
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,240
- Haha.
- He ate it.

2125
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,310
(Fried Egg Magic Pearl
was already getting digested.)

2126
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:20,880
I stayed on guard until the end.

2127
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:24,080
You can check the level
of one magic pearl?

2128
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,190
Which one will you check?

2129
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:26,920
- The small one.
- Ji Hyo's.

2130
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,060
Mine.

2131
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:29,860
We'll check my magic pearl.

2132
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,860
It'll be perfect
if the level is high.

2133
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:33,660
This magic pearl is...

2134
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,430
above level three.

2135
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,330
The level is lower than I expected.

2136
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,330
- Yes. It's 7 or below.
- It's 7 or below.

2137
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:41,340
- Then...
- It's lower than I expected.

2138
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,570
It's lower than I expected.

2139
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:43,900
- It isn't about the size.
- Seriously.

2140
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:44,940
- Isn't it about the size?
- Let me see it.

2141
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:46,340
- It isn't about size or weight.
- Let me see how big it is.

2142
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,840
- Shall we check the egg?
- That's a good idea.

2143
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,210
- This one.
- Let's check the egg.

2144
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:51,950
I bet the level is high.

2145
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:55,950
This magic pearl
is above level three.

2146
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:58,120
- It's low.
- It's low.

2147
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:00,520
- I'm curious about mine.
- It's 3 or higher, 7 or lower.

2148
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,790
It's low. If it's easy to carry,
the level is low.

2149
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:06,290
- Now,
- My goodness.

2150
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:08,630
a new magic pearl has been detected.

2151
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:10,830
- Please check the location.
- Ye Eun, go and check.

2152
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,430
I can't believe Food Fighter.

2153
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:14,940
I thought it was the abalone shell.

2154
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:16,700
Let's transform into Zhu Bajie.

2155
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,040
(Chuckling)

2156
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:19,610
"Don't be like that."

2157
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:20,940
She probably wants to eat.

2158
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:22,640
Grab it. What do you see?

2159
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,940
(Surprised)

2160
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,380
Press the play button.

2161
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,610
- I feel like I've seen her before.
- Seriously.

2162
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,780
(Where did a magic pearl appear?)

2163
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,650
- It's an emergency.
- An emergency.

2164
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:34,820
Emergency!

2165
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,120
At the soccer field
in the Mangwon Han River Park,

2166
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,890
a level-ten magic pearl
has been detected.

2167
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:42,300
(The magic pearl
of the highest level...)

2168
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,500
(is at the Han River!)

2169
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,400
Both teams, please gather
at the Han River Park.

2170
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,000
(Both teams, please gather
at the Han River Park.)

2171
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,310
At the soccer field
in the Mangwon Han River Park,

2172
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:53,170
a level-ten magic pearl
has been detected.

2173
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:54,440
- Ten?
- The soccer field.

2174
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,440
- Let's hurry.
- The Han River Park?

2175
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,940
- A level-ten magic pearl?
- Ten.

2176
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,150
- Let's go.
- We need to hurry.

2177
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:00,010
A level-ten magic pearl
has been detected.

2178
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:01,120
- Ten?
- Yes.

2179
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,080
- We need it no matter what.
- We must obtain it.

2180
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,950
- Okay. Let's go.
- Why am I nervous?

2181
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:07,250
Let's hurry.
We don't have much time.

2182
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,920
We need to hurry up. Run.

2183
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,060
(Which yimugi will get
the level-10 magic pearl?)

2184
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,660
What's that?

2185
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:14,730
- What's that? That must be it.
- That's the level-ten magic pearl.

2186
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:15,830
Dragon Bead.

2187
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,460
- The highest-level magic pearl.
- That's it.

2188
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,670
- It's pretty.
- It's the level-ten magic pearl.

2189
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,000
- That's it.
- Hurry up.

2190
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:22,700
What's this?

2191
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,040
- That's an American football.
- That's an American football.

2192
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,210
Isn't that ball used in the NFL?

2193
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:32,910
The level-ten magic pearl sits here.

2194
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:34,010
- Is that it?
- Yes.

2195
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:36,350
For your information,
there's a guardian...

2196
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:38,450
who protects this magic pearl.

2197
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:40,620
So you can't take it as you want.

2198
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,590
- What?
- Will someone come?

2199
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,590
- Is someone here?
- Who is it?

2200
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:45,890
- What?
- There's a car.

2201
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:46,890
- It's a Carnival.
- That's right.

2202
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,160
- That's right.
- Someone is coming out.

2203
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,560
(Someone enters the field
from a corner.)

2204
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,000
- That's right.
- What's this?

2205
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,600
- That's right.
- What? Who is that?

2206
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,730
- He's a foreigner.
- Who is that?

2207
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,500
Isn't his last name Murray?

2208
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,440
- Kyler is here.
- Is he an American football player?

2209
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:02,040
(Singing)

2210
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,180
(He enters while singing
his own background music.)

2211
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:06,710
- Kyler Murray.
- Is Kyler Murray here?

2212
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,950
- The Arizona Cardinals.
- Kyler Murray.

2213
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:10,980
- All right.
- Are you serious?

2214
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,520
- The Arizona Cardinals.
- To protect the magic pearl...

2215
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,790
- Kyler Murray.
- Kyler Murray.

2216
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:15,490
- To protect the magic pearl,
- Are you serious?

2217
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:17,320
- an American football player came.
- Really?

2218
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,730
- He was on "Gym Jong Kook."
- Hold on.

2219
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,660
His annual salary is
300 million dollars or something.

2220
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:22,660
- Hey.
- Hey, Kyler.

2221
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:24,900
- Kyler Murray!
- Welcome!

2222
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:29,440
(He ranked 1st in Arizona in 2019.)

2223
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,740
(He's a superstar of the NFL
with a 60-million-dollar salary.)

2224
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:34,980
(He visited Korea
for the first time in his life.)

2225
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,510
(Murray signs
a 332-million-dollar contract!)

2226
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:38,750
(The star of Arizona, Kyler Murray)

2227
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:39,780
(Maternal grandma, mother, Mi Sun)

2228
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:42,320
(Mi Sun's son,
Kyler Murray is partly Korean.)

2229
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,550
(A quarterback of the NFL protects
the ball with his quick feet.)

2230
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:50,990
(He has been hired
as the guardian of the magic pearl.)

2231
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:53,490
(The guardian of the magic pearl,
Kyler Murray)

2232
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:57,100
- Kyler Murray!
- Kyler!

2233
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,130
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

2234
01:14:58,130 --> 01:14:59,200
- Kyler.
- No way.

2235
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,700
- My friend.
- What's up?

2236
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,370
He knows Jong Kook.

2237
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:04,370
He's going to Jong Kook.

2238
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:05,540
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?

2239
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,880
(He says hello to Jong Kook first
as they've met before.)

2240
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:09,780
- Nice to meet you.
- Kyler.

2241
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:11,010
Hello.

2242
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:12,780
- Hello.
- What's up?

2243
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:14,080
- My friend.
- Kyler. Hello.

2244
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,720
- Nice to meet you.
- Okay.

2245
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:18,590
Yes. Kyler. My goodness.

2246
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:20,390
- NFL.
- Kyler.

2247
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:23,120
- Welcome.
- He's in the Arizona Cardinals.

2248
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,460
- He's a quarterback.
- A quarterback.

2249
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,090
- Right now... Hey.
- Seriously.

2250
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:28,760
Kyler's annual salary...

2251
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,500
He signed
a 300-million-dollar contract.

2252
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,100
- My goodness.
- Hey.

2253
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:34,500
- My goodness.
- Hey.

2254
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,170
Jae Seok must know him well.

2255
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:37,270
- I know him very well.
- He...

2256
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,410
- Jae Seok must know him well.
- Is his salary 300 million dollars?

2257
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:41,170
(He signed a 5-year contract
for 300 million dollars.)

2258
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,240
- He likes the Arizona Cardinals.
- He's like a big company.

2259
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,380
I like the NFL.

2260
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:45,710
He looks very cute.

2261
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:48,350
- Seriously. In 2019,
- He should've visited properly.

2262
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,950
he was selected first overall
by the Arizona Cardinals.

2263
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,390
That's his current team.

2264
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:55,590
The Arizona Cardinals selected him.

2265
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:57,220
He still plays for the same team.

2266
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,890
He's the surprising thing.

2267
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,130
At the same time as the NFL...

2268
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:04,430
- The MLB.
- The MLB selected him first.

2269
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:06,300
- He's good at baseball too.
- Between the two...

2270
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,170
- The MLB selected him ninth.
- He had to choose one.

2271
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:10,400
He chose 1 out of the 2.

2272
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,970
Gosh, he's a genius.

2273
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:14,980
- I heard that he came to Korea.
- Yes.

2274
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,310
- I heard that.
- Yes.

2275
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:17,680
Can we hear Kyler's voice?

2276
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,880
- Please say hello to the viewers.
- Say hello.

2277
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,150
I'm Kyler Murray.

2278
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,580
I'm 27 years old.

2279
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:26,420
I'm a quarterback
for the Arizona Cardinals.

2280
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:30,660
- He's 27 years old.
- Yes.

2281
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,030
- He's younger than me.
- It's so nice.

2282
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:33,960
- He studied a lot.
- He's an older brother.

2283
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,730
- That's right.
- With that salary, he is.

2284
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:37,660
I think Running Man is...

2285
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:40,200
the first Korean variety show
for Kyler.

2286
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,040
Yes.

2287
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:44,500
- Yes.
- Have you watched Running Man?

2288
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,970
Have you ever seen Running Man?

2289
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,510
- My mom loves Running Man.
- Your mom.

2290
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:52,150
His mom watches it.
Thank you, ma'am.

2291
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,750
- He's good.
- His mom watches it.

2292
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:55,380
- His mom loves Running Man.
- Does she know us?

2293
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,480
Ma'am, we love you.

2294
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,350
The thing is,
you filmed a YouTube video...

2295
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:01,290
- with Jong Kook.
- That's right.

2296
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:03,120
- Yes.
- How was it?

2297
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,160
How was it during the shoot?
How did you like JK?

2298
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,360
I love JK. JK, I love you.

2299
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:09,500
- He's my friend.
- My goodness.

2300
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:11,300
- JK.
- Not your friend. Your big brother.

2301
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,000
- No.
- JK is 50!

2302
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:14,530
- No.
- JK is 50!

2303
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:16,170
Fifty!

2304
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:17,640
- Big brother.
- He called me that last time.

2305
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,740
It's embarrassing to hold
these things in front of Kyler.

2306
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,910
There's a reason for these items.

2307
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:25,080
- There's a reason. A mission.
- Please be understanding.

2308
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,310
- A mission.
- Okay.

2309
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,280
The mission to acquire
the level-ten magic pearl,

2310
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:31,850
the Touchdown at a Distance...

2311
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,250
- will begin.
- What's that?

2312
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:34,390
- Touchdown?
- Three members per team...

2313
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:35,490
will come out.

2314
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:37,790
One member will wear a tail.

2315
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:41,430
Then he or she'll quickly pick up
the ball Kyler Murray threw...

2316
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:43,160
and get a touchdown at the zone...

2317
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,930
- with the R logo.
- I see.

2318
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:47,830
If the tail gets ripped off
before the touchdown,

2319
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:48,840
he or she must return,

2320
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,500
- get a new tail,
- Oh, my goodness.

2321
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,410
- and touch down.
- It'll be so hard.

2322
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,670
The remaining two members...

2323
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:58,950
will run away
from Kyler Murray's toy hammer.

2324
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:00,610
If the teams succeed in
the touchdown...

2325
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:02,720
in the time limit of two minutes,

2326
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,090
the time it takes to succeed in it
will determine the rankings.

2327
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:06,820
If all teams fail,

2328
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:09,860
- the team with fewer hits will win.
- So I'm going in...

2329
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:11,560
- Yes.
- I want to...

2330
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:13,490
- Kyler Murray will hit us...
- He must be...

2331
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:14,530
with a toy hammer.

2332
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:16,830
- He must be so fast.
- You know, Kyler...

2333
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:17,830
Is he fast in his team?

2334
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:19,500
He's the fastest in the league.

2335
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,230
- He's the fastest in the league.
- How many seconds?

2336
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,700
(They must go against
the best runner in the US!)

2337
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:25,710
- Really?
- Yes.

2338
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:27,310
Please decide
which team will go first.

2339
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:28,640
This is important.

2340
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,180
- You can go 1st.
- Go 1st.

2341
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,310
- Go first.
- Seong Jae can run fast, right?

2342
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:34,750
- I...
- You.

2343
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:36,150
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- "You."

2344
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,320
"You."

2345
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:39,750
- He went, "You."
- "You."

2346
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,620
(He chose Se Chan
based on his looks.)

2347
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:43,390
- "You."
- You.

2348
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:45,190
- Does he know me?
- You first.

2349
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:46,760
- Okay.
- No.

2350
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,060
- Okay.
- He wants you to go first.

2351
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,530
- Okay. We'll go 1st.
- We'll go 1st.

2352
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:51,160
- Okay.
- Murray.

2353
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:53,330
- Hammer punch, please.
- Okay.

2354
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:56,140
- Hammer punch.
- Excuse me.

2355
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:58,170
Can we destroy
each other's magic pearl even now?

2356
01:18:58,170 --> 01:19:00,210
- Let's stop during the game.
- Okay. During the game,

2357
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:02,110
- you can't touch each other's ball.
- Okay.

2358
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:03,780
- Okay.
- It's only during the ball.

2359
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,610
Seriously, this is...

2360
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:06,610
(Ji Yeon is freed
from a bowling ball.)

2361
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:08,080
It's like a penalty.

2362
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,580
- I'll put it here.
- What's this?

2363
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:13,290
(She puts the pizza box
next to the ball.)

2364
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,120
- No one is taking it.
- No, Ye Eun.

2365
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,690
- Put it by the chair.
- The chair?

2366
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:21,330
- Come on.
- The chair.

2367
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:23,030
(The expert conman, Se Chan
teaches her how to con people.)

2368
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:24,260
You should wear it.

2369
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:27,170
We won't touch it.
Put it over there.

2370
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:30,170
- I don't trust you guys.
- The production crew said it.

2371
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:31,540
(She begins to lie
to the naive Ji Hyo.)

2372
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,370
- The production crew said it.
- Still...

2373
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:35,640
- No, Ji Hyo.
- Ye Eun, it's more dangerous...

2374
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,780
- to put it here.
- No, Ji Hyo.

2375
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:39,310
Will you wear it?

2376
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:40,680
- Shall I wear it?
- Go ahead.

2377
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:42,520
Is he going first?

2378
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,190
- Yes. First.
- First.

2379
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:46,990
- He'll run from Murray.
- Yes.

2380
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:48,490
(Defense, Yang Se Chan)

2381
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,190
- It's so scary.
- Okay.

2382
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:51,190
(Defense, Yuk Seong Jae)

2383
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:53,060
- We need to block him, right?
- That's right.

2384
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,160
Block him...

2385
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,760
- so that I can touch down.
- Okay.

2386
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,270
Okay, Kyler.

2387
01:19:58,270 --> 01:19:59,600
(When the guardian throws the ball,
the game begins.)

2388
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,500
Get ready.

2389
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,510
(2 minutes start.)

2390
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:06,570
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2391
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,740
(The legendary NFL player's throw!)

2392
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,340
- What? What happened?
- What?

2393
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,350
- What?
- Gosh.

2394
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:13,580
- Impressive.
- Gosh.

2395
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:15,780
(He threw it haphazardly.)

2396
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,020
- Gosh.
- What should we do?

2397
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,420
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2398
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,450
(The ball goes over 40m!)

2399
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:22,990
(While Jae Seok picks up the ball)

2400
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:24,930
- Gosh.
- What should we do?

2401
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:26,460
(The defense players
need to dodge the toy hammer.)

2402
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:28,400
Run!

2403
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:31,160
Kyler, come on!

2404
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,500
- Hey!
- Get close to him!

2405
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,130
(Laughing)

2406
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:35,940
- Six, seven, eight,
- Hey.

2407
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:37,140
- nine...
- Run faster.

2408
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:39,570
(The superstar runs diligently
on the dirt court.)

2409
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:42,280
- Get close to him!
- Run faster.

2410
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:45,380
(They've already taken
20 blows to the heads.)

2411
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:47,380
Jae Seok, hurry up.

2412
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:50,320
(Jae Seok picks up the ball
at a distance of 40m.)

2413
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:53,520
(He returns at full speed.)

2414
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,160
Jae Seok, hurry up.

2415
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:56,390
- Oh, no.
- He's here.

2416
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:57,490
- There he is.
- He's back.

2417
01:20:57,490 --> 01:20:59,260
- Screen.
- Can you guys block him?

2418
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:01,060
- Screen.
- Screen.

2419
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:03,500
(Light touches)

2420
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,770
(Light touches make them fly off.)

2421
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,040
(At that moment)

2422
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:13,540
(Jae Seok gets caught!)

2423
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,680
- Hey.
- It's over.

2424
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,550
- Come on.
- Okay.

2425
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:19,850
- Jong Kook should do it.
- Get...

2426
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:20,880
- a new tail.
- Yes.

2427
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,750
One minute has passed.

2428
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,280
Hold on!

2429
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,920
(The world-class athlete,
Kyler hits them merrily.)

2430
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,220
He hits too hard.

2431
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:31,060
- Hold on.
- Halftime.

2432
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:32,530
Isn't there a halftime show?

2433
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:35,530
- Slow down.
- Thirty seconds remain.

2434
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:37,030
(30 seconds remain.)

2435
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:39,530
(Jae Seok tries to get through
on the left side!)

2436
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:41,030
Kyler, you're good.

2437
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,870
- Nice, Kyler.
- Let's go.

2438
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:44,140
(Hitting)

2439
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,570
- Nice, Kyler.
- Let's go.

2440
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:47,510
(Stop.)

2441
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:49,240
Grab him. Grab Kyler.

2442
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:51,280
Grab him. Grab Kyler.

2443
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:54,350
(There's an opening
on the left side!)

2444
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:55,420
Jae Seok.

2445
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:56,920
Grab him. Grab Kyler.

2446
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,190
(Will he get through...)

2447
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:00,420
(for a touchdown?)

2448
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:01,520
Please.

2449
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:03,190
- I mean...
- The tail got removed.

2450
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,630
Jae Seok.

2451
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:07,730
- It's impossible to touch down.
- It's impossible.

2452
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:09,030
- Time's up.
- It's impossible.

2453
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:10,360
- It just can't be done.
- The touchdown failed.

2454
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,430
Give it a try.

2455
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:12,930
(Touchdown: Fail
Toy hammer: 58 hits)

2456
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:14,200
My body...

2457
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,640
- Did we win?
- Good job.

2458
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:17,970
- Hello.
- Hi, Kyler.

2459
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:20,110
- Welcome.
- I heard you were funny.

2460
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,280
- Fight on.
- Fight on.

2461
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:23,510
(They can't communicate in English.)

2462
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:24,880
- He's no joke.
- I like it.

2463
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,450
- Do you like it?
- I like it.

2464
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:28,550
Murray, go easy on us.

2465
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,350
- Go easy on us.
- Be strong.

2466
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:32,720
- Strong.
- Murray.

2467
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,720
- Full power.
- Full power.

2468
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:36,760
- Full power.
- Sixty.

2469
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,660
- Full power.
- Sixty. Fifty.

2470
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,190
- Sixty.
- I'll take it easy.

2471
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:42,560
- I have three kids.
- I'll take it easy.

2472
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,960
- I'll take it easy.
- I have three kids.

2473
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,030
(They beg him to go easy on them.)

2474
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:46,130
Break his head.

2475
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,500
Sixty.

2476
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,270
- Tell him to break it.
- Kyler.

2477
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:51,370
You can do whatever you want, man.

2478
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:53,010
- I got you.
- Yes. It's okay.

2479
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,070
Just make it fun.

2480
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:55,740
Kyler, I'm your fan.

2481
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:57,410
I'm your big fan.

2482
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,610
- Seok Jin, you'll be surprised.
- Seok Jin.

2483
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:00,850
Where is his team based?

2484
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:02,380
- What?
- Where is his team based?

2485
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:03,650
San Francisco.

2486
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:05,850
- It's Arizona.
- It isn't San Francisco.

2487
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:08,190
(Seok Jin messes up the team name.)

2488
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:10,820
- It isn't San Francisco.
- It's Arizona.

2489
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,090
- Oh, no.
- Kyler.

2490
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:14,530
- He's angry.
- Murray.

2491
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:16,460
- Full power.
- He's angry.

2492
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:18,370
- You should've checked.
- What's wrong with you?

2493
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:19,530
What's wrong with you?

2494
01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:21,200
- It was a joke.
- Arizona.

2495
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:23,070
- It was just a joke.
- A mistake.

2496
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:25,110
- It's Arizona.
- He's an old man.

2497
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:26,270
- Seok Jin.
- I don't like him.

2498
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:27,440
- He doesn't like you.
- I don't like him.

2499
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,080
- He doesn't like you.
- It was a joke.

2500
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,280
(Seok Jin gets on his bad side
for running his mouth.)

2501
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,580
- Sorry.
- Your head.

2502
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:34,380
- A joke.
- Your head will hurt.

2503
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:35,850
Your head will hurt.

2504
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:37,180
- "Your head will hurt."
- "Your head will hurt."

2505
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:39,020
- "Your head will hurt."
- It's over for you.

2506
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:41,020
He's the bad man.

2507
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,620
Get ready.

2508
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,020
Full power.

2509
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,560
- Sorry.
- Full power.

2510
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,560
(Defense, Haha and Seok Jin)

2511
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:48,400
- Let's go.
- Don't get nervous.

2512
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,500
Lower your body.

2513
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,170
(It goes further than earlier!)

2514
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:54,300
- No way.
- Gosh.

2515
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:55,640
He threw it gently earlier.

2516
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,040
- Why did he throw it so far?
- Full power!

2517
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:02,580
(His eyes are on Seok Jin.)

2518
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,210
(He begins to massage
Seok Jin's brain.)

2519
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:06,950
- Sixty.
- Full power.

2520
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:09,420
- It really is full power.
- It's so funny.

2521
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,720
Father.

2522
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:16,490
(Mr. San Francisco gets beaten up
by a man who's his son's age.)

2523
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,590
(Haha has it easy thanks to that.)

2524
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:19,630
Oh, no.

2525
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:21,090
He's coming.

2526
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:23,760
He's coming. Jong Kook is coming.

2527
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:24,960
- Protect him.
- He's coming.

2528
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,070
(The excited Jong Kook appears.)

2529
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:27,330
Protect him.

2530
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,900
Even with Jong Kook, you never know.

2531
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,070
- Okay. Let's go.
- It's a face-off.

2532
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:33,410
(A match between a Korean bull
and a buffalo)

2533
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:37,010
- They went over the line.
- You can't go over the line.

2534
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:38,180
You can't go out.

2535
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:41,080
- Cowards. Look at those cowards.
- You can't go out.

2536
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:42,980
- Why did you go out?
- You can't go out.

2537
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:44,880
- We can't go out.
- You can't go out.

2538
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,790
- The line.
- You need to stay inside.

2539
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,120
Oh, no.

2540
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:49,220
It really hurts.

2541
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:52,960
(Jong Kook and Kyler get started.)

2542
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:54,230
Okay.

2543
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:58,200
(The orange Smurfs
are stuck in the middle.)

2544
01:24:58,530 --> 01:24:59,830
Run!

2545
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,570
(At that moment)

2546
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,370
(Haha blocks Murray.)

2547
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:10,680
Murray is going easy on them.

2548
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:14,580
(Raising suspicions
about the fairness)

2549
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,120
What's going on?

2550
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,290
(What's wrong with him?)

2551
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:22,390
Come on, Murray!

2552
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:24,660
(It's a touchdown.)

2553
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:29,430
(They easily succeed in the mission,
thanks to Kook's friend Murray.)

2554
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:31,760
(Team Jong Kook wins.)

2555
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:33,670
(Exclaiming)

2556
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,300
- Connections!
- What is this?

2557
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:37,140
Murray is using connections!

2558
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:38,440
(Se Chan makes
an official complaint.)

2559
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,470
Connections!

2560
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:40,740
- Hey, you!
- Kyler!

2561
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,580
- Do you know "connections?"
- What happened?

2562
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:44,480
- Connections!
- He was so biased.

2563
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,750
Kyler.

2564
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:47,380
- Well done.
- Well done.

2565
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:49,280
- Our team did well.
- Well done.

2566
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:53,050
What happened, Kyler?

2567
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:54,490
Hate me all you want.

2568
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:55,890
- Connections!
- What happened?

2569
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:57,990
- Friend.
- Friend.

2570
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,260
Family.

2571
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:02,000
Yes. Friend!

2572
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:03,830
- What are you doing?
- Right.

2573
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:05,870
They use connections
in the States as well.

2574
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:07,100
Hey.

2575
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:09,400
- Good job.
- I need water.

2576
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:10,840
- Water.
- "I need water."

2577
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,570
- Water.
- Water.

2578
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:13,670
- He's so good.
- It's tiresome.

2579
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:16,710
Kyler is exhausted from
playing with us.

2580
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,010
- Thank you.
- I'm your fan.

2581
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:20,080
I'm your fan.

2582
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,550
No. San Francisco was a joke!

2583
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:25,690
I've never seen him
open a bottle for someone.

2584
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:27,390
Arizona.

2585
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:32,030
We prepared a name tag as a gift.

2586
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:33,530
- Name tag.
- Kyler Murray.

2587
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:34,590
Here you go.

2588
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,460
- Kyler Murray.
- Kyler Murray.

2589
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:37,530
- It's your name tag.
- It's an original.

2590
01:26:37,530 --> 01:26:39,170
- Thank you.
- Yes.

2591
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:41,470
- Thank you.
- Can you read your name?

2592
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:42,870
- Yes, sir.
- Are you sure?

2593
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:44,400
"Kyler Murray."

2594
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,210
- Nice.
- Not yet.

2595
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:47,770
- Not yet?
- Okay.

2596
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:49,580
- Bye.
- It was a magic pearl...

2597
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:50,840
of level ten.

2598
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:54,110
Team Ji Yeon won,
so they will take it.

2599
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:57,980
You need to decide the owner
of the magic pearl.

2600
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:59,590
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Do we just take the pearl?

2601
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:00,920
- This one.
- Just the pearl.

2602
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,420
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2603
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,560
- Okay.
- The winner takes it.

2604
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,490
- Just once.
- Let's be fair.

2605
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:07,790
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2606
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,200
- Okay!
- Okay! You're out.

2607
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,560
I'm the only one...

2608
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,630
- No.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2609
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:13,800
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2610
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:14,870
- Okay!
- Okay!

2611
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:16,270
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors. Gosh.

2612
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:17,970
Okay. Rock-paper-scissors. I...

2613
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:19,540
(Ji Hyo won.)

2614
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:21,070
(Song Ji Hyo will get it.)

2615
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:22,480
- That's Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

2616
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,140
Ji Hyo. You're really...

2617
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:25,780
- Nice.
- That's Ji Hyo.

2618
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:26,880
- Amazing.
- Keep it safe, Ji Hyo.

2619
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,650
- We will win if we have this.
- I'll protect it.

2620
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:29,680
- I'll use it for the team.
- It's ice.

2621
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,680
Okay.

2622
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:33,950
The level ten magic pearl
is owned...

2623
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:35,890
- by Ji Hyo.
- Goodness.

2624
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:38,160
- She's amazing.
- After each group gathers,

2625
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:41,430
we will tell you the level
of the magic pearl you want.

2626
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:44,730
- Okay.
- Ask and we will tell you.

2627
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:45,770
- Let's ask about the ice pearl.
- Mine.

2628
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:46,800
Okay.

2629
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:50,040
- Which one...
- It's not the size.

2630
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:51,200
- Also...
- I don't think it's the size.

2631
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,040
The one Ye Eun has is a pizza.

2632
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,970
- If we eat a piece...
- It's at the back.

2633
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:57,480
- It's at the back.
- Let's do that.

2634
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,580
- It's at the back.
- Ye Eun...

2635
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,050
(They run toward the pizza.)

2636
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:03,520
We should protect ours.

2637
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:05,790
Hey... My pizza!

2638
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:08,290
(They're eating it.)

2639
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:09,490
Hey! What are you doing?

2640
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,320
Seriously.

2641
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:15,190
- Pizza...
- Hey.

2642
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:16,660
- Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun.

2643
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:19,500
(Crying)

2644
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,170
(Holding her laughter)

2645
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:23,340
- Hey, Ye Eun!
- Ye Eun.

2646
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:25,170
(Laughing)

2647
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:26,910
- Ye Eun.
- It worked, Ye Eun.

2648
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:29,810
- That was good acting.
- They ate it all.

2649
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:31,540
- It worked.
- Why did they eat this?

2650
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:32,650
Why...

2651
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:36,320
- This is tasty.
- Why...

2652
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,380
Put it there!

2653
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:39,590
- This is so funny.
- I could eat more.

2654
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:41,090
- Goodness.
- It is what it is.

2655
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:42,390
(They high-five the production crew
and celebrate.)

2656
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:46,390
- The leftovers...
- Why did you leave it there?

2657
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:48,260
So is this how you'll stop us?

2658
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:51,630
- You can't leave uneaten food...
- Why...

2659
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:53,670
- You crushed our ice.
- Right.

2660
01:28:53,670 --> 01:28:54,670
That's right.

2661
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:56,870
Don't do that from now on
since you ate ours.

2662
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:59,270
- Seriously.
- Don't do it.

2663
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:00,640
Now... Come here.

2664
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:04,080
- What do we ask?
- We can ask mine.

2665
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,780
The size, right?

2666
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:08,980
- We're geniuses.
- Right.

2667
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:11,350
- The one in his pocket.
- Mine.

2668
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:12,750
Be quiet.

2669
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:15,820
This magic pearl
is above level seven.

2670
01:29:17,090 --> 01:29:20,230
- It's high.
- It's great. We should protect it.

2671
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:23,930
We'll check the ice.

2672
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:25,570
(They check the level 9 ice ball
that Seong Jae already knows.)

2673
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:26,970
- Ice?
- Yes.

2674
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:30,470
This magic pearl
is above level seven.

2675
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:32,770
- It's high.
- We need to protect it.

2676
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:34,670
Really? Is it the size, then?

2677
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:35,980
I don't think so.

2678
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:37,840
What's the standard?

2679
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:40,910
- Water?
- I don't think there is.

2680
01:29:40,910 --> 01:29:42,780
- Water.
- Water?

2681
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:43,950
- Water?
- Look.

2682
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:45,280
Mine has water in it as well.

2683
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:48,190
In our drama,
the yimugi is a water ghost.

2684
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:49,690
Right!

2685
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:52,560
In our drama,
the yimugi is a water ghost.

2686
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,790
Right!

2687
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,090
I guess that's it.

2688
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:57,230
Hey. Look at this.

2689
01:29:57,530 --> 01:29:59,870
- There is water in here as well.
- It's in here.

2690
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:02,400
This was on water as well.

2691
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,600
They were all on top of water.

2692
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:06,070
The duck boat as well.

2693
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:09,180
- Ji Hyo's was on water too.
- Right.

2694
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:11,640
I think the ones found on water
are valuable.

2695
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,650
It's done.

2696
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:14,550
That was why this was a low level.

2697
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:16,050
That's right.

2698
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:19,150
- This was in water too.
- Right.

2699
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:20,420
(Se Chan puts on the AR glasses.)

2700
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:22,560
- Okay.
- What is that?

2701
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,160
The last pearls have appeared.

2702
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:25,190
- Where?
- The last pearls have appeared.

2703
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:26,230
Where?

2704
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:27,690
Three magic pearls were detected...

2705
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:29,160
- in Seoul Battleship Park.
- There are three.

2706
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:30,160
- How many?
- Three.

2707
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:33,400
Three magic pearls were detected
in Seoul Battleship Park.

2708
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,570
They will be in water.

2709
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:35,570
Three pearls
in Seoul Battleship Park.

2710
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:38,670
Seoul Battleship Park is on water.
The levels would be really high.

2711
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:39,970
Let's go.

2712
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:42,180
Goodness. What is it?

2713
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:44,840
- What is it?
- On the left!

2714
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,050
(They expect to find valuable pearls
in the battleship that's on water.)

2715
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:48,110
Where's my hat?

2716
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:50,020
(They start running.)

2717
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:51,550
Why are they so fast?

2718
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:53,590
- Hurry!
- Run!

2719
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:55,250
Why is the pearl so heavy?

2720
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:59,490
Leave it somewhere.
How are you going to carry that?

2721
01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:01,690
I ate too much.

2722
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:04,160
One, two.

2723
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:07,270
We have so many high-level pearls.

2724
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:08,530
- Hurry up!
- Right?

2725
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,400
When we combine ours,
it's above level 17.

2726
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,640
- Right.
- Right.

2727
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:15,780
We also know that
it has to be on water.

2728
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:16,780
Right.

2729
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:19,010
- On the battleship?
- At the Soul Battleship Park.

2730
01:31:19,010 --> 01:31:20,050
In the battleship.

2731
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:21,750
We have to get there first.

2732
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,350
- There are three here.
- We will lose...

2733
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:24,580
if we don't find them here.

2734
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:26,920
- There are three here?
- Yes.

2735
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:29,690
- We should find the three quickly.
- Right.

2736
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:31,320
It's so big.

2737
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:35,660
(Will there be high-level magic
pearls on the Seoul Battleship?)

2738
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:37,130
I think they would be on top.

2739
01:31:39,170 --> 01:31:41,370
They wouldn't put them up there,
would they?

2740
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:43,900
(No way.)

2741
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,910
We're too late. Let's hurry.

2742
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:50,280
I don't see anything.

2743
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:54,380
(Jae Seok rushes to search.)

2744
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:00,150
(Panting)

2745
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:01,190
It's...

2746
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:05,930
(Exclaiming)

2747
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:09,630
I found it.

2748
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:12,030
I found it.

2749
01:32:12,030 --> 01:32:13,130
Crystal Bead.

2750
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:15,530
Found on the Seoul Battleship
and is related to water.

2751
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:16,570
I found it.

2752
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:19,240
It was worth coming here.

2753
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:20,740
I bet it has a high level.

2754
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:21,770
(Seoul Battleship Park
Magic Pearl Collection)

2755
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:23,840
(Who will find
the last 2 magic pearls...)

2756
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,880
(that will determine the victory?)

2757
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:29,420
What? There's a button.

2758
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:30,950
(Why is there a button?)

2759
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:35,450
Where is Yeouinaru Station?

2760
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,220
(She presses it
and a frivolous voice plays.)

2761
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:39,260
What's this?

2762
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:42,760
What's this?

2763
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:44,260
This...

2764
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:47,530
Is there anyone around?

2765
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:50,140
What? What's this?

2766
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:51,470
(It keeps playing
with the word "magic.")

2767
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:53,270
They hid them really well.

2768
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:54,570
(It seems like the real button
would say "magic pearl.")

2769
01:32:54,570 --> 01:32:56,080
You hid them so well.

2770
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,180
This side...

2771
01:32:58,180 --> 01:32:59,850
(Se Chan heads to the bow.)

2772
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:03,450
What's this?

2773
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,550
- Do you see anything?
- What is this?

2774
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:08,920
What is this? This is a button.

2775
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:12,360
- This is a magic pearl.
- What?

2776
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:14,060
This is a magic pearl.

2777
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:15,430
(It's a real one.)

2778
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,060
- Circular Bell.
- Se Chan!

2779
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:18,100
- Where did you find it?
- Found on the bow of the ship.

2780
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:19,830
I thought
you weren't supposed to press it.

2781
01:33:19,830 --> 01:33:20,830
It's amazing, right?

2782
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:23,070
(Only one pearl is left!)

2783
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:25,500
The toilet.

2784
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:26,910
It has water.

2785
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:27,970
(Jong Kook is searching everywhere
related to water.)

2786
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:30,180
(Seok Sam follows
the magic pearl detector.)

2787
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:31,180
Here.

2788
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,410
(They don't have any magic pearls
related to water.)

2789
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:33,750
This is interesting.

2790
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:36,380
Is it this side?

2791
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:37,580
(They will have a chance
if they find one now.)

2792
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:40,190
There it is!

2793
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:44,020
Bring that down. Hey, can you...

2794
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:47,430
Please bring it here.

2795
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:48,590
(It's being dropped to the ground!)

2796
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:50,000
Here! Hurry!

2797
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,360
- Go down.
- It's going down.

2798
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:52,830
- Did you find it?
- Go down.

2799
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:54,270
- Did you not find it yet?
- Go down.

2800
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:56,340
- The helicam.
- It's going down.

2801
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:58,140
- It's going down there.
- It's on the helicam?

2802
01:33:58,670 --> 01:34:00,740
I could throw the ball
if it's all right to break it.

2803
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,740
(Seok Sam got down first.)

2804
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:09,380
(He jumps toward
the last magic ball.)

2805
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:12,280
(Ji Hyo came down too.)

2806
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,520
Please! You have one
with ten points.

2807
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:16,490
This...

2808
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:17,560
(That moment)

2809
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,160
This...

2810
01:34:20,490 --> 01:34:22,030
Please!

2811
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:23,630
(Who will be the winner
of the big match?)

2812
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:26,370
All the magic pearls
have been found.

2813
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:28,770
You all came
with the magic pearls...

2814
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:31,500
- you have collected.
- Yes.

2815
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:32,640
The magic pearls.

2816
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,170
Should we leave it
in front of our names?

2817
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,880
(He won after a fierce
shoulder fight against Ji Hyo.)

2818
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:42,420
Round Bell.
It was dropped from a drone.

2819
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:45,650
There's someone
with a duplicating item.

2820
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:48,290
Do you plan to use the item?

2821
01:34:48,290 --> 01:34:49,320
- There's another one?
- Duplicating?

2822
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:50,860
- There's something else?
- Who is it?

2823
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:52,020
Yes. I'll use it.

2824
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,390
- Kim Jong Kook.
- He had one.

2825
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:55,900
You can duplicate any magic pearl...

2826
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:57,760
except the one you received
from Tyler Murray.

2827
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:59,870
We could get rid of the pink
and duplicate the water tank.

2828
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:03,240
- I'll get rid of the pink ball...
- As yours...

2829
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,470
and just duplicate mine.

2830
01:35:05,470 --> 01:35:07,140
- The pink ball doesn't seem high.
- So,

2831
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:08,670
- this pink gym ball magic pearl...
- You don't know about that.

2832
01:35:08,670 --> 01:35:10,710
was a Level Three.

2833
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:12,510
- That other one was better.
- Nice.

2834
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:14,410
- That one was high.
- Then it's 14.

2835
01:35:14,410 --> 01:35:15,410
(He duplicated his own item
and had a huge success!)

2836
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:16,720
Among the winning team,

2837
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:19,320
the person with the lowest
magic pearl level...

2838
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:20,890
- will get the penalty.
- Please.

2839
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:23,260
The person with the highest level
among the losing team...

2840
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:25,720
will be exempt from the penalty.

2841
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:29,230
Which team's magic pearl level
is higher?

2842
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:30,900
- Please reveal...
- Okay.

2843
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,100
the results.

2844
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:33,770
- We have more items.
- Yes, we do.

2845
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:35,000
It's us, 100 percent.

2846
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:37,400
- Isn't it us, for sure?
- I think so.

2847
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:38,570
I think we will win.

2848
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:40,110
- We have more.
- It's us.

2849
01:35:40,410 --> 01:35:41,510
It's us.

2850
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:44,980
(Team Ji Yeon found
more magic pearls.)

2851
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:49,010
(They even found the Level 10
Dragon Bead.)

2852
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:51,420
- Please.
- It's us.

2853
01:35:51,650 --> 01:35:53,390
I think it'll be us.

2854
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:55,490
- The team who gets blasted wins?
- The number of items...

2855
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:59,290
(Team Seong Jae has many
magic pearls related to water.)

2856
01:35:59,290 --> 01:36:02,160
(But they lost a total of 17 points
in magic pearls.)

2857
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:04,160
Which team's magic pearl level
is higher?

2858
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:05,760
- It's us, 100 percent.
- Please reveal...

2859
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,270
(Which team will win with a higher total
of magic pearl levels?)

2860
01:36:07,330 --> 01:36:08,770
Please reveal the results.

2861
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:10,500
Does the team who gets blasted win?

2862
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,800
- What?
- Do they win?

2863
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:13,140
(Team Seong Jae wins.)

2864
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:15,070
- What?
- It's us!

2865
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:16,980
- Is it us?
- Is it us?

2866
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,210
They won?

2867
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:19,450
- No way.
- Congratulations.

2868
01:36:19,450 --> 01:36:21,980
With a total of 52 to 46...

2869
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:23,320
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

2870
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:25,720
Team Seong Jae won.

2871
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:27,690
Hurray!

2872
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:29,920
- We did it!
- How did this happen?

2873
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,960
Jae Seok,
we even lost two that were high.

2874
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:33,090
- Which 1 is high?
- This is a 9.

2875
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:34,230
This is a ten.

2876
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:36,960
The magic pearls had
higher levels...

2877
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,030
- if they were related to water.
- Gosh, then mine...

2878
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:42,000
Jong Kook, you successfully
duplicated your item...

2879
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,370
and have a total of 14.

2880
01:36:43,370 --> 01:36:45,140
- You have 14 points.
- That's good.

2881
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:46,740
Haha,

2882
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:48,410
you have ten points.

2883
01:36:48,410 --> 01:36:51,940
And Ji Hyo, you have 14 points.

2884
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,310
Seok Jin, you have four points.

2885
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:55,580
Why? I have two.

2886
01:36:55,610 --> 01:36:58,580
You found them from places
that didn't have to do with water.

2887
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:00,320
Someone who likes water will smile
when they see water.

2888
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:02,190
- That was funny.
- Right?

2889
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:03,620
- That's just...
- It is, right?

2890
01:37:03,790 --> 01:37:05,760
- Gosh, this was a ten.
- And Ji Yeon...

2891
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,490
(She has to get over 14 points
to be exempt from the penalty.)

2892
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:09,300
You have four points,
just like Seok Jin.

2893
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:10,960
Oh, dear.

2894
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,670
- But it's blue. Water is blue.
- What was this?

2895
01:37:13,670 --> 01:37:16,200
- What is this?
- This was so heavy to carry around.

2896
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,370
So, with the highest level,

2897
01:37:18,370 --> 01:37:20,510
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo...

2898
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:22,110
will be exempt from the penalty.

2899
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,980
I got that, at least!

2900
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:25,380
- That's nice.
- That's all I need.

2901
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:27,010
Now, for the winning team's...

2902
01:37:27,010 --> 01:37:30,050
- individual magic pearl levels.
- Yes.

2903
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:32,790
- Jae Seok,
- The ice is...

2904
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:35,320
- you have a total of 25.
- I have 25?

2905
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:36,520
- Why?
- This is awesome.

2906
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,590
(Jae Seok's 3 magic pearls
all had to do with water.)

2907
01:37:38,590 --> 01:37:40,360
- Why?
- Water.

2908
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:43,230
- You found all of them in water.
- Right, I got this from the water.

2909
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:44,500
Which one is the highest?

2910
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:46,830
- The Ice Ball is a 9.
- It's 9.

2911
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:47,930
- Oh, this is a nine?
- Hey!

2912
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:49,200
You smashed my ice.

2913
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:51,200
- Yes, we broke his Ice Ball.
- You would've won with that.

2914
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:53,970
- If I had the ice, we would've won.
- That's right.

2915
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:56,480
And Seong Jae,

2916
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:59,080
you got the bell from the duck boat.

2917
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:01,210
- It's a Level 10.
- Oh, it's a 10.

2918
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:04,820
- Se Chan, you have 16 points.
- Oh, that's high.

2919
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:06,290
How many points was this one?

2920
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:08,420
That one is a ten.

2921
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:10,920
And as for Ye Eun,

2922
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:12,930
you found one bead.

2923
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:15,160
That's a total of one point.

2924
01:38:15,230 --> 01:38:16,900
- I mean, she just...
- Hey, this is the important part.

2925
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,560
- She has an abalone in her belly.
- She's getting the penalty.

2926
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:21,630
- If you add that, she'd have more.
- She would. Can't you do that?

2927
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:23,040
- It's in my belly.
- She's getting the penalty.

2928
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:27,510
So, Ye Eun, the person with
the lowest level on the winning team...

2929
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:29,040
will get the penalty...

2930
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,080
- with the losing team.
- Okay!

2931
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:34,010
- All you did was eat all day, kid.
- Ye Eun, come here.

2932
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:35,180
This is so nice.

2933
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:38,150
We'll give the other members
of the winning team their prizes.

2934
01:38:38,150 --> 01:38:40,290
- Bring in the prize.
- What's that?

2935
01:38:40,450 --> 01:38:41,490
Today's prize looks like...

2936
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:43,160
- magic pearls...
- What are they?

2937
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,420
- Don't you know these?
- and called fruits from above.

2938
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:45,660
- They are setoka oranges.
- They're so good.

2939
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:47,090
- Setoka oranges.
- Nice, setoka oranges.

2940
01:38:47,090 --> 01:38:48,160
Gosh, setoka oranges are nice.

2941
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,130
Then, today's penalty will be...

2942
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:52,870
for Haha, Ji Yeon, Seok Jin,

2943
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:54,070
and Ye Eun.

2944
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:56,600
- Ye Eun, come here.
- It will be the four of you.

2945
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:58,540
- What is it?
- Today's penalty is to hope for...

2946
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:00,570
the rise of the yimugi
who couldn't become a dragon.

2947
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:03,040
You must fly a dragon-shaped kite
high in the sky...

2948
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,440
- before you can go home.
- Flying a kite?

2949
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,110
- That's easy.
- I like flying kites.

2950
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:07,380
- We can't leave unless it flies?
- Oh, flying a kite.

2951
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:08,750
- No, you can't.
- It's nice and breezy.

2952
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:10,050
- All right.
- I want to watch them do it.

2953
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:11,120
It just has to lift up a bit.

2954
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:12,890
- Gosh, Seok Jin, you're so good!
- I flew mine.

2955
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:14,290
That's how you do it.

2956
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:15,450
They're flying so well.

2957
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:17,460
- Isn't it amazing? How nice.
- It's up so high.

2958
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:18,590
(Thank you, Seong Jae and Ji Yeon.)

2959
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:19,830
- My gosh.
- It could've gone higher.

2960
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:21,330
- Look at mine.
- It caught the wind.

2961
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:23,200
- Here.
- Why are we doing stuff like this?

2962
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,430
(It's the day
a new rental member is coming!)

2963
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:25,830
(But Daniel is nowhere to be seen?)

2964
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:27,000
- How does that make sense?
- How does that make sense?

2965
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:30,740
(He appears looking ridiculous.)

2966
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:32,340
(The pick-up service that starts
at 10 a.m.)

2967
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:33,440
But why are you here?

2968
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:34,470
It's supposed to start at 2 p.m.

2969
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:36,680
(They must take Daniel soon
before he catches on?)

2970
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:39,080
(But instead of catching on,
he has zero wits.)

2971
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:40,110
Shave your stubble!

2972
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:42,150
(A rough welcome carried out
in Running Man style)

2973
01:39:42,150 --> 01:39:43,580
- Why are you walking around naked?
- Please make...

2974
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:45,080
(Did they arrive at
the welcome ceremony on time?)

2975
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:46,320
Please look kindly upon me.

2976
01:39:46,490 --> 01:39:50,060
(The new rookie gets
the ultimate authority just for today?)

2977
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:51,460
I don't weigh 58kg.

2978
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:52,460
Do you weigh more?

2979
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:54,160
(The seniors can't get
their heads straight...)

2980
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:55,760
(with this oddball rookie.)

2981
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:57,330
I'm having so much fun.

2982
01:39:57,330 --> 01:39:59,700
(Will the new rookie safely finish
his first shoot?)

2983
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:00,900
(Let There Be a New Family)
