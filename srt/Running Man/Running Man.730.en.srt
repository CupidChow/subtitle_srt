1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:08,550


2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,580
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,050
- Let's go. - Okay!

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:10,360
(Just coming to the airport makes your heart flutter!)

5
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,350
Where are we going?

6
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,020
So this is the place.

7
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,890
- It says "departures" here. - What?

8
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,630
(Are the members going on an overseas trip?)

9
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,230
I know this one.

10
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,660
I'm wearing shorts for the airport today.

11
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,900
Jong Kook is dressed for the airport.

12
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,130
I really am.

13
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,000
Is this the airport?

14
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,470
(The members, who are in airport style clothes, come to find...)

15
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,570
It's the airport. So it looks like this.

16
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,340
- The airport... - Is this the airport?

17
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,270
- Welcome, everyone. - My gosh.

18
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,440
- Hey. - May I check your passport?

19
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,440
(Director Jong Seo, acting as today's captain)

20
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,440
Why is the captain here?

21
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,510
- The captain... - Are you getting paid for this?

22
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,780
We will play along if you do.

23
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,250
(The captain is out to greet them.)

24
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,210
Gosh, what is this?

25
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,990
(They don't need to check in at this airport.)

26
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,990
This is unique. I like the theme.

27
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,920
I like the theme.

28
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,490
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

29
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,930
(It is an airport-theme cafe where you can pretend to go abroad.)

30
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,860
On behalf of the captain and the entire crew,

31
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,030
welcome aboard, Running Man Flight.

32
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,960
(He's wearing achromatic-colored shorts as always.)

33
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,230
Welcome, everyone.

34
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,000
- Why is the captain here? - Are you getting paid for this?

35
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,630
(The airport thief look in different colors)
- We will play along if you do. - Hey.

36
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,170
We will play along if you do.

37
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,470
(Then the next person shows up.)

38
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,700
Don't do it if you don't get paid.

39
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,240
- Don't do it if you don't get paid. - Power

40
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,280
Power

41
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,940
(The fake GD imitated GD's outfit for the airport.)

42
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,280
- Grandma. - Power

43
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,780
She's an old lady from Dongmyo.

44
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,450
- Grandma. - Oh, hello.

45
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,420
(Not anyone can pull it off.)

46
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,920
(He just looks like a happy grandma.)

47
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,220
- Yes, Grandma. - Power

48
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,050
- What? - I love you, Grandma.

49
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,860
What is this?

50
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,090
- It's just a woman's jacket. - Is it?

51
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,060
- Se Chan tries so hard. - Yes.

52
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,630
- He's even wearing a fake cap. - Right.

53
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,330
I bought this for 16 dollars at Dongdaemun.

54
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,030
- I couldn't find the real one. - It's like Chanel.

55
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,870
(GD from Temu is born.)

56
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,000
(Fake cap and handkerchief)

57
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,000
It's like Chanel. But I couldn't find the real one.

58
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,040
(Candy ring, designer-looking women's clothes)

59
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,840
I bought this online.

60
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,010
I was told to bring my passport.

61
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,580
- Yes. May I check your passport? - Then...

62
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,810
The seat for the elderly...

63
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,320
(The fake GD disciplines the fake captain.)

64
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,010
I should give him my passport.

65
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,320
The lady is famous at Dongmyo.

66
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,250
Give me some pocket money, Grandma.

67
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,450
Hold on. I should do this first.

68
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,620
Let me see. This is it.

69
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,730
(The captain checks the passport.)

70
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,860
He's wearing an imitation cap too.

71
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,660
- Thank you. - This is fun.

72
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,630
- It's not expired yet. - What?

73
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,370
(Charismatic)

74
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,400
Does my face look different?

75
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,700
All right.

76
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,640
Do you want to see something funny? The visa looks hilarious.

77
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Here.

78
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,610
Are you Korean?

79
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,580
(An ad-lib)

80
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,180
Yes, I am.

81
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,180
- Are you Korean? - Yes, I am.

82
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,950
(Flustered)

83
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,950
- He's... - You should do this.

84
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,990
(The variety show blue-chip Jong Seo is even good at improvising.)

85
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,460
I'm not good at improvising.

86
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,890
Please have a seat.

87
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,690
(He asks them to sit down without checking for tickets.)

88
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,030
- Where? - Have a seat?

89
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,760
- How many people are we? - Grandma, where do you want to sit?

90
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,330
- The front seat. - The front seat? Okay.

91
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,370
(The grandma likes the emergency exit row.)

92
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,570
- Sit here, Grandma. - She should sit in the front seat.

93
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,700
Grandpa from Dongmyo will be here soon.

94
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,940
You'll see.

95
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,800
- Right. From Dongmyo. - Please have a seat.

96
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,470
We're always in the back seat.

97
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,180
- What's this? - Jae Seok.

98
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,510
This is an airport.

99
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,450
(He's in a neat airport style today.)

100
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,080
This is how Jae Seok is actually dressed.

101
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,520
Welcome.

102
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Who are you?

103
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,950
What is the captain doing here?

104
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,890
- I said the same thing. - The captain...

105
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,660
should be in the cockpit. Why would he...

106
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,260
(He is taking care of the guests, and not the handle.)

107
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,260
- Jae Seok. - Why would he greet us?

108
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,930
He's a pilot, but this is his side job.

109
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,960
- Really? - It's a sideline.

110
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,670
- Who are you, ma'am? - She's from Dongmyo.

111
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,330
Power

112
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,840
(He shows only one move.)

113
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,270
- Power - Power

114
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,170
- May I check your passport? - Pardon?

115
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,210
My passport?

116
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,180
No! The photo...

117
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,210
Thank you.

118
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,350
- The slippers... - Do you know how to check it?

119
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,610
(Distrust)

120
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,050
- This is my personal information. - I'm comfortable without it.

121
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,390
(Laughing)

122
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,890
Why are you laughing? What...

123
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,050
- Why is he being like that? - What?

124
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,550
- Why? - That's not your face.

125
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,890
(He forgets that he is the pilot and laughs.)

126
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,890
- I want to laugh too. - Let me see.

127
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,890
- I want to laugh. - I want to laugh.

128
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,090
- What is it? - What?

129
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,360
You're so rude.

130
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,400
- But that's... - You're rude.

131
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,830
Why are you laughing at my photo?

132
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,930
- Let me see. - Who is this person?

133
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,070
- Let me see. - What does it look like?

134
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,100
Hang on.

135
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,200
- It's not like that. - I want to laugh too.

136
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,670
(He couldn't help but laugh.)

137
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,740
- Just let me see. - Show me.

138
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,370
(What is wrong with the picture?)

139
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,810
Is it that bad?

140
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,740
- We won't laugh. - Just let me see.

141
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,240
- Let me see. - I think it's cute.

142
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,280
My mom said it was cute.

143
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,310
Let me see.

144
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,610
- Why? - My gosh.

145
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,180
- But... Your jawline... - Who is this?

146
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,550
- Hey. - Her jawline looks like this.

147
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,190
- What's this? - Hey, this is...

148
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,150
(It looks like she took it when she was very sleepy.)

149
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,890
- Hey. - Ye Eun.

150
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,120
If you go looking like this, you can't go abroad.

151
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,420
Her eyes look strange.

152
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,360
- What happened to your face? - The jawline is too...

153
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,730
- Oh, dear. - Did you take this photo...

154
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,160
after your mom scolded you?

155
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,430
Why are your eyes slanted downwards?

156
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,830
Why are your eyes like that?

157
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,100
- The grandpa from Dongmyo? - Yes.

158
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,640
(She successfully went through the immigration.)

159
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,010
The president of the association of Korean residents in LA will come.

160
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,010
He'll be here soon.

161
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,240
The president?

162
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,810
Hi, Auntie.

163
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,180
- Hello. - My goodness.

164
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,880
(Next, Ji Hyo arrives, and...)

165
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,250
(A man in a suspicious outfit shows up.)

166
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,120
What?

167
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:40,330
(A red jacket and cheetah-print pants)

168
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,260
The president of the association of Korean residents in LA. Yes.

169
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,490
- He's the president. - Stay quiet.

170
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,690
- Everyone. There are... - Yes.

171
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,430
(He insists that it is a celebrity airport look.)

172
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,130
a lot of fans at the airport, so I need to cover my face like this.

173
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,570
The grandpa from Dongmyo is popular on social media.

174
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,000
- Grandpa from Dongmyo. - Yes.

175
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,570
- The grandpa from Dongmyo. - He's really popular.

176
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,740
(He looks the same.)

177
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,140
- He looks so similar. - He really does.

178
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,510
(Moved)

179
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,880
- Here you are. - Are you eloping with your wife?

180
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,540
(Ji Hyo gets screened.)

181
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,310
Make sure to cover it.

182
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,810
(Sparkling eyes)

183
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,750
- He looks so similar. - He really does.

184
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,180
- Are you dressed like that? - What's wrong with this?

185
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,190
(The president has his passport checked.)

186
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,750
- I look natural but pretty. - Here you are. You look familiar.

187
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,490
- You gained a lot of weight. - Yes, I did.

188
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,420
Why is the captain checking the passport?

189
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,990
(3rd time)

190
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,300
(Both the captain and the passengers are weird.)

191
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,060
I've never seen a captain do this before.

192
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,000
- Mr. President. - Yes.

193
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The president...

194
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,870
Do we have a standing seat in an airplane?

195
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,440
- Have a seat, Ji Hyo. - We don't have enough seats.

196
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,140
Why don't we have enough seats?

197
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,170
We will take off soon. Please have a seat.

198
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,380
- Okay. - We don't have enough seats.

199
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,240
(The captain runs away after overbooking the flight.)

200
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,040
- Sit. - The seat is for you.

201
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,680
- That makes me look bad. - No.

202
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,450
(Quarreling)

203
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,950
- What do you mean? - You always look bad.

204
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,120
(He puts on a show to look like he's being considerate.)

205
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,380
- You don't look bad. - We don't have enough seats.

206
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,180
- The grandpa from Dongmyo. - The grandpa from Dongmyo.

207
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,990
Before we take off, I have good news to share with you.

208
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,190
- What? - What is it?

209
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,490
(Ranking, Celebrity Brand, Reputation Index)

210
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,890
Every week...

211
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,990
- Oh, yes. - That's it.

212
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,930
(Yu Jae Seok, Kim Jong Kook, Haha, Song Ji Hyo)

213
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,690
- Jong Kook is in 2nd place. - Jong Kook is 2nd.

214
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,130
Haha came in 25th. Ji Hyo came in 29th.

215
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,430
(Yang Se Chan, Jee Seok Jin)

216
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,000
- Se Chan came in 30th. - Yes!

217
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,870
And Seok Jin came in 40th place.

218
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,300
(Can't see)

219
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,000
- Thank you. - How many celebrities are there?

220
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,170
- Why does it have all our names? - We all are there.

221
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,010
- Coming in 40th... - Jae Seok.

222
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,080
- When you stay on top like that, - He's the first.

223
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,740
do you feel nervous?

224
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,880
- No. Not at all. - Afraid of being the second.

225
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,310
- Don't you feel like that? - No.

226
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,820
(He picks at Jase Seok in 1st place wearing sunglasses and a mask.)

227
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,480
When you are in the 40th place, you feel at ease.

228
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,550
- I see. - In 40th or 60th...

229
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,890
But staying on top is better than feeling at ease.

230
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,430
(Backing off)

231
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,620
It's better to be the first.

232
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,490
- That's not true. - Right.

233
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,330
Seok Jin, take off your mask now.

234
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,860
I'll take it off. Don't worry.

235
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,430
- Take it off now. - Now.

236
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,570
It's okay to wear it all through the shoot though.
(Slowly)

237
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,140
I think he forgot to take it off.

238
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,070
- I didn't... - You forgot it, right?

239
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,640
- The grandpa from Dongmyo. - Yes.

240
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,010
See? He forgot.

241
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,940
(He thought it was a real airplane.)

242
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,940
- And the sunglasses... - He forgot.

243
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,440
My goodness.

244
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,280
It is so bright.

245
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,050
Today, we will go to exotic places in Seoul...

246
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:51,060
(Today's race is revealed.)

247
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,120
- Really? - as if enjoying trips overseas.

248
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,060
It's called the Such an Intimate Overseas Trip Race.

249
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,300
You will pick a destination and a theme.

250
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,200
Then you will take a photo that looks like...

251
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,130
- you are at the destination. - It sounds fun.

252
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,800
Let's say you picked the keyword,

253
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,070
"Hawaii where people are harvesting rice."

254
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,810
You will take a photo looking like the keyword.

255
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,380
You will show it to citizens,

256
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,380
- We have to fool them? - and the citizens guess...

257
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,180
(Harvesting rice in Hawaii)

258
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,310
the theme and the destination correctly for you to succeed.

259
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,950
(Success)

260
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,880
But if the citizens fail to give the correct answer,

261
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,250
(If the citizen gets it wrong, they will add a modifier.)

262
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,180
(Harvesting rice in Icheon, wrong)

263
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,620
you will get an extra modifier at a time and try it again.

264
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,190
(Harvesting rice on a rainy day in Hawaii)

265
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,060
You will travel to three countries...

266
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,430
- within six hours. - Three countries?

267
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,330
We need to make it look like we are overseas.

268
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,930
(It doesn't look easy...)

269
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,430
We have to fake it.

270
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,430
- But it will be obvious. - That's difficult.

271
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,440
You will pick the first destination through a mission.

272
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,570
If you succeed, you will pick a country from level easy.

273
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,070
If you fail, you'll pick one from level hard.

274
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,240
- Oh, dear. - Vietnam and Thailand are easy.

275
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,810
(Which country will they get to travel to?)

276
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,380
- Right. - Vietnam and Thailand.

277
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,180
- That sounds good. - It's easy.

278
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,950
All right. Here's the first mission for the level of difficulty.

279
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,920
(Mission 1, You Get 3 Seconds To Say It)

280
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,550
It's called You Get Three Seconds To Say It.

281
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,920
You Get Three Seconds To Say It.

282
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,560
The production crew will give you the first word.

283
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,690
(School, textbook)

284
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,620
Within the given time of three seconds,

285
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,190
(Textbook, Seoul, Ulsan, wild greens, object)

286
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,830
five of you need to succeed in Word Chain.

287
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,830
(Success)

288
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,060
You will have three chances.

289
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,870
If you succeed at least once, you get to pick...

290
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,240
- Okay. - from the easy level.

291
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,870
If you fail all three times, you will pick from the hard level.

292
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,170
- Once you press the button there, - We should press it.

293
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:19,880
(They will time the start and end by pressing on the button.)

294
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,680
- it's over. - Haha, your role is important.

295
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,580
- You have to press it. - But this is...

296
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,980
My gosh.

297
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,180
(It's hard.)

298
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,610
- Number of syllables don't matter? - No.

299
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,950
It's hard.

300
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
It's difficult for me.

301
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,820
- We have to do it quickly. - The Word Chain game.

302
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,190
- Word Chain... - Let's practice once.

303
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,560
- The rhythm. - You're a fool if you can't do it.

304
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,320
(Confident)

305
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,060
- Why is it hard? - Car.

306
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,560
Ticket.

307
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,660
- It's over. - Ticket...

308
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,660
- It's over already. - Ticket.

309
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,330
(Stupid)

310
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,100
- Gourd dipper. - What was that?

311
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,200
- See? - Gourd dipper.

312
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,800
- Then what? - Your turn.

313
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,300
- Gourd... - Bowl.

314
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,070
- Bowl. - Earthworm.

315
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,400
- Bowl is not correct. - What?

316
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,770
- What did you say? - Clap.

317
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,070
- Watermelon. - Watermelon.

318
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,470
Watermelon?

319
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,610
Clap.

320
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Watermelon.

321
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,150
(Their skills are terrible even without a time limit.)

322
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,280
You can't say the same word again.

323
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,350
- We can't? - No?

324
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,550
Rhythm.

325
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,810
- This is... - It's hard to say it quickly.

326
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:01,190
(Is it possible to do it within 3 seconds?)

327
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,320
- Three seconds is tough. - It's hard to do it quickly.

328
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,420
Can we even do this?

329
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,020
My goodness.

330
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,420
Let's give it a try.

331
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,790
(Groundless confidence)

332
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,690
Three seconds is tough.

333
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,720
Why don't you practice with the first keyword?

334
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,460
(Practice time to get used to the game)

335
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,330
- Okay. - Only five of you need to do it.

336
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,430
- I'll press the button here. - Don't screw up.

337
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,830
(Haha to Seokjin)

338
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,730
When Seok Jin finishes, I'll push it again.

339
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,930
- Sounds good. - Okay.

340
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,030
(Keyword: Airplane)

341
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,200
- Go, Haha. - Ready.

342
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,830
- I say the first word, right? - Start... Yes.

343
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,300
- Train. - Start.
(Whispering)

344
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,840
- Train. - Pyo In Bong.

345
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,670
(Train)

346
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,100
- Hey, I said train. - Hey.

347
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,410
- Train. - Pyo In Bong.

348
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,440
- Hey, I said train. - Hey.

349
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,080
- Train? - What's wrong with her?

350
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,480
(Picking)

351
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,310
- What was that? - She thought I said ticket.

352
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,080
(She got Pyo In Bong out of "train.")

353
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,680
- He said train. - What did you do?

354
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,320
She was thinking "ticket."

355
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,220
(Dumbfounded)

356
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,420
What just happened?

357
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,150
- What did you just do? - Well...

358
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,450
- He said it would be train. - What's wrong with you?

359
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,420
So I thought, "train, ticket, Pyo In Bong."

360
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,330
(How she got to Pyo In Bong)

361
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,520
That's what happened.

362
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,690
- Right. - You went too far.

363
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,730
- I'm sorry. - Just sit.

364
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,160
(Ji Hyo's brain is way ahead.)

365
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,330
- That was good though. - Let's sit.

366
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,260
Shouldn't Ji Hyo be out?

367
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,830
- The thing is, she's a little... - I'm here.

368
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,300
(Out: Haha, Ji Hyo, In: Jae Seok, Se Chan)

369
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,430
- Earthworm, barber, manager. - The two should be out.

370
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,470
Let's begin.

371
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,600
(They change players and practice one more time.)

372
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,440
- This is a practice. - What will you say?

373
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,340
- This is hard. - This is a practice.

374
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,810
- All right. An easy one. - Should I go first?

375
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,810
- Let's do this. - Go.

376
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,840
- Just do it. - This is a practice.

377
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:00,650
(Keyword: Luggage)

378
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,680
- Let's just do it. - I'll say mother.

379
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,810
Start.

380
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,550
Mother.

381
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,010
(Mother?)

382
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,080
- Gosh. - Hey.

383
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,080
(Wrong)

384
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,820
Why did you say mother?

385
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,020
(He got nervous while playing the game again.)

386
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,420
- It's too hard. - Should he say hello?

387
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,650
- I'll do it again. - It should start with "Yi."

388
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,320
- It should end with "Yi." - I'll say an easy one.

389
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,790
(For sure)

390
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,660
- It has to end with "Yi." - Do it again.

391
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,160
- End with "Yi?" Okay. - Yes.

392
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,190
It has to end with "Yi."

393
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,660
- One more time. - We will practice one more time.

394
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,930
(It's their third practice.)

395
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,830
- Practice? - Now...

396
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,200
- Just say anything. - Start.

397
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,530
(Keyword: Lion)

398
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,200
Xi.

399
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,070
- You punk. - You punk.

400
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,570
- You punk. - You punk.

401
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,480
(He got nervous and just added "yi" this time...)

402
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,670
- Hey. - That doesn't work.

403
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,580
- You can't do that. - You said it should end...

404
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,140
with "Yi," so it was difficult.

405
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,810
There's one way...

406
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,310
to succeed in this mission.

407
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,580
- What is it? - Do you want to hear it?

408
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,720
Here's the thing.

409
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,950
First, we should guess what the keyword would be.

410
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,790
Then we should come up with our answers.

411
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,920
(Seok Sam's strategy: Add "yi" on the first word,)

412
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,060
- With the guess? - Yes.

413
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,590
The first person has to succeed though.

414
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,230
(and the rest of the team will prepare words beforehand.)

415
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,720
Only the first person needs to make it.

416
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,390
- Barber, manager. - Barber.

417
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,830
- Manager. - Finish it with "Yi."

418
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,160
Im Chang Jung, Jeongbalsan.

419
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,300
- All right. - Mountain, bear foot.

420
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,930
(They practice this plan.)

421
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,300
- Say bear foot. - Bear foot.

422
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,530
- Start. - Barber.

423
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,530
- Manager. - Im Chang Jung.

424
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,530
- Jeongbalsan. - No.

425
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,800
- It has to be faster. - We're still late.

426
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,170
(They still exceeded 3 seconds.)

427
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,900
- We're still late. - Okay.

428
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,200
It should be faster. We should speak faster.

429
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,210
- Faster. Let's do it. - Start.

430
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,270
- Earthworm. - Barber.

431
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,270
- Manager. - Im Chang Jung.

432
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,940
Jeongbalsan.

433
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,310
(It took them only 1.74 seconds.)

434
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,580
- That's it. - We did it.

435
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,150
- That's it. - We did it.

436
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,210
- It should be this fast. - Okay.

437
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,950
- I have to finish it with "Yi." - Yes.

438
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,350
- Okay. - Yi.

439
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,850
- This is the first attempt. - I have to finish it with "Yi."
(Finally, their first try)

440
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,850
- Let's do this. - Ready.

441
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,320
(Will the plan to add "yi" succeed?)

442
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,690
- Watch carefully. - He has to finish it with "Yi."

443
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:27,170
(Keyword: Hawaii)

444
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,200
- Yi I. - Yi I?

445
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
- That works. Yi I works. - It does.

446
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,300
Yi I counts.

447
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,770
- Yulgok Yi I. - Yulgok Yi I.

448
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,840
- Yulgok Yi I. - It counts!

449
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,900
(They already pressed the button.)

450
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,900
It works.

451
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,110
- Yes. - We should've continued. Hey.

452
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,840
Whether he's correct or not, you should continue.

453
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,040
- Okay? - Just do it.

454
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,950
(Their plan is to just do it.)

455
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,440
- Just continue. - It counts.

456
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,940
- You should continue. - I will.

457
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,080
- All right. - It worked.

458
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,780
- Yi I counts. - It does.

459
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,180
- Yes. - The first attempt failed.

460
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,420
(They failed the first try.)

461
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,350
- This is it. - It failed.

462
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,420
Let's do it again.

463
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,850
- Yi I counts. - I'll finish it with "Yi" again.

464
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,090
He's important. He should come up with the correct answer.

465
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,560
(Go past the "yi" part...)

466
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,190
- I can say a person's name. - You should do well.

467
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,300
(and continue on within 3 seconds to succeed.)

468
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,330
We have to finish it in three seconds.

469
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,390
- Right. - Just finish it with "Yi."

470
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,960
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

471
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,460
Ready.

472
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,600
(The second attempt)

473
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,340
(Keyword: Kim Jong Kook)

474
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,430
- Kook Jong. - Barber.

475
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,430
- Manager. - Im Chang Jung.

476
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,440
- Jeongbalsan. - We got it.

477
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,470
- Im Chang Jung. - Jeongbalsan.

478
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,340
- We did it. - A person's name counts.

479
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,670
(They did finish within 3 seconds.)

480
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,670
- It's okay. - Kook Jong.

481
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,670
- Kook Jong. - We did it.

482
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,640
- Kook Jong. - Kook Jong.

483
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,710
- Kook Jong. - Kook Jong.

484
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,080
(Walking on eggshells)

485
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,810
- It's okay. - Kook Jong.

486
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,010
A person's name counts.

487
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,220
(They start to insist together.)

488
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,280
- Kook Jong. - Kook Jong.

489
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,150
- Kook Jong. - I'm Kook Jong.

490
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,150
It's a byword.

491
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,860
(Kook Jong, pronoun)

492
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,820
- Seok Sam. - Kook Jong.

493
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,420
- Ssaebssaeb. - Ssaebssaeb.

494
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,920
(Ssaebssaeb, pronoun)

495
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,820
- There are a lot. - Ye Eun.

496
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,190
- I agree. That was very clever. - Right.

497
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,060
(Changing his stance)

498
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,830
I actually have the same...

499
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,330
- on my phone. - Right.

500
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,200
(Jae Seok shows his phone and insists.)

501
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,700
- Kook Jong. - Kook Jong.

502
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,830
- Right. Kook Jong. - Don't say it doesn't count.

503
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,940
- It's a noun. - It can be controversial.

504
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,540
- One more time? - This is your last attempt.

505
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,070
This is the important part.

506
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,340
It's the most important spot.

507
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,780
- Should I try? - No.

508
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,440
- I'll do it. - It worked well earlier.

509
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,050
(They have one more chance, so they choose carefully.)

510
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,680
- Okay. - Then I'll be here this time.

511
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,150
- Barber, manager. - You should say manager.

512
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,220
- Manager? - Barber.

513
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,320
(They keep failing even though they planned it ahead.)

514
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,580
- Manager. - Jeongbalsan.

515
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,050
- Just say it at the same time. - Right.

516
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,860
- This is hard. - Let's do this.

517
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,060
- Barber. - Manager.

518
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,190
- Im Chang Jung. - Jeongbalsan.

519
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,330
- You have to say it faster. - Faster.

520
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,460
Should it be faster?

521
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,560
- Just overlap. - Overlap. Right.

522
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,200
I'll do it first.

523
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,070
- Barber. - Manager.

524
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,170
- Im Chang Jung. - Jeongbalsan.

525
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,070
(Even AI will be shocked at their speed.)

526
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,940
- We should do this. - This is too hard.

527
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,570
- Say it right away. - Overlap.

528
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,610
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

529
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,710
(Last attempt)

530
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,810
Ready.

531
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,410
- This is our last attempt. - Yes, it's your last chance.

532
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,950
(They have to succeed this time in order to get the easy country.)

533
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,140
You have to do it well. Listen carefully.

534
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,310
Make sure to do it well.

535
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,680
Make sure to do it well.

536
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,780
(Keyword: Camera)

537
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,550
Make sure to do it well.

538
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:29,190
(It should start with "Ra" and end with "Yi.")

539
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,020
Ra and yi.

540
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,920
(Keyword: Camera)

541
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,520
- Ratatouille. - Barber.

542
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,830
- Ratatouille. - Barber.

543
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,960
- Manager. - Im Chang Jung.

544
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,030
Jeongbalsan.

545
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,760
- Im Chang Jung. - Jeongbalsan.

546
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,830
(Did they succeed?)

547
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,560
Manager.

548
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,830
- Im Chang Jung. - Jeongbalsan.

549
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,930
- Okay. We did it. - Yes!

550
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,800
(2.63 seconds)

551
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,700
- Ratatouille counts. - Ratatouille.

552
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,670
Okay.

553
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,800
- We did it. - Ratatouille counts.

554
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,940
(They succeeded within 3 seconds.)

555
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,100
- Ratatouille. - Ratatouille.

556
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,170
- Ratatouille was a good one. - Ratatouille.

557
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,840
(The miracle started with Ratatouille.)

558
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,780
- Ratatouille. - Yes, Ratatouille.

559
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,780
- Ratatouille was really good. - We did it.

560
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,150
- I thought you'd make a mistake. - Ratatouille.

561
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,150
- I thought he would fail. - Ratatouille.

562
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,280
- Ratatouille. - Ratatouille is insane.

563
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,450
Ratatouille is a word.

564
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,590
- Ratatouille was a good one. - Ratatouille.

565
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,850
(Satisfied)

566
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,190
- Ratatouille counts. Good. - That was good.

567
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,220
It wasn't an easy one.

568
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,060
Your last attempt was successful.

569
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,590
So you will get to pick a destination from the easy level.

570
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,560
- We should pick one. - Mr. President.

571
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,200
(You can choose.)

572
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,660
All right.

573
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,830
The president of the Korean resident association.

574
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,070
(The presidents comes up to pick for them.)

575
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,070
- The president... - This is really...

576
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,170
It's been 34 years since I moved to this country.

577
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,070
By the way...

578
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,670
- Yes. - President Trump...

579
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,410
- Yes. - Really?

580
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,170
- Come on. - I knew it.

581
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:27,550
(His red jacket seems to have a meaning.)

582
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,280
Look at this.

583
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,480
- It has the American flag. - My goodness.

584
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,550
- That's it. - You're a Trumpster.

585
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,820
(An unexpected supporter, even the White House was shocked!)

586
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,320
- You drive a Tesla for a reason. - He drives a Tesla.

587
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,820
- I didn't even know about this. - Tesla.

588
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,350
(Baffled)

589
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,850
He drives a Tesla.

590
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,320
- As expected. - I knew it.

591
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,830
(What is the first destination?)

592
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,360
He's a supporter.

593
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,720
He suddenly...

594
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,330
Yes.

595
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,430
- Oh, right. - You should open it.

596
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,800
"Paris in summer." Is this a good one?

597
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,840
(Paris in summer)

598
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,670
"Paris in summer." Is this a good one?

599
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
- It's good. - Paris?

600
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,940
- France. - The Eiffel Tower.

601
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,100
(Paris doesn't seem to be hard,)

602
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,940
- Paris in summer. - The Eiffel Tower.

603
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,410
- If it's summer, our clothes... - We should get changed.

604
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,440
(but they will need summer clothes.)

605
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,810
- We should wear summer clothes. - Short sleeves.

606
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,080
The first destination and theme is Paris in summer.

607
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,210
(Paris)

608
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,450
You need to get in the outfits and props...

609
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,780
(They need to get props and a place to take the picture.)

610
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,450
for the given destination and theme to take a photo.

611
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,320
We should buy clothes.

612
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,180
(Summer clothes)

613
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,190
We shouldn't just pretend that it's Paris.

614
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:14,230
(The person needs to believe that it is taken in summer in Paris.)

615
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,420
- Paris... - Those who see the photo...

616
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,160
- should think... - It should look like Paris.

617
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,920
- that we took it in Paris. - Paris in summer.

618
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,830
Paris in summer. That's how it should look.

619
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,830
- Paris in summer. - There's a famous baguette place.

620
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,430
- Where? Paris Baguette? - Yes.

621
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,300
- No. - We can't do that.

622
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,800
- The Eiffel Tower is there. - The Eiffel Tower.

623
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,200
- We can go to a transmission tower. - No.

624
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,440
- We can't do that. - This is hard.

625
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,770
- We should find a place? - All right then.

626
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,670
Then we should go...

627
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,310
to a cafe in Cheongdam-dong that looks like Paris.

628
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,780
- Terrace. - London Bagel.

629
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,680
- Terrace. - London Babel.

630
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,080
- Terrace. - Hang on.

631
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,520
- I know a place. - Hang on a second.

632
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,690
- Wait. I can't believe my ears. - Why?

633
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,290
London Bagel for Paris?

634
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,290
Oh, you're right.

635
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,920
- London Bagel for Paris? - Wait.

636
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,960
- If you go to Paris... - Ye Eun. That's it.

637
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,690
- Have you been to Paris? - No.

638
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,800
- And... - If you go to Paris,

639
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,330
- there's this street. - I know.

640
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:59,570
(Find a place that looks like a street in Paris.)

641
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,700
- There's this street. - Right.

642
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,270
Those who see the photo should think it's Paris.

643
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,300
- Right. - "This is Paris."

644
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,570
- A cafe that looks like Paris... - Exactly.

645
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,810
- It has to be the Eiffel Tower. - The Eiffel Tower?

646
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,070
(For Paris)

647
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,940
By the way...

648
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,910
When you think of Paris...

649
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,940
(The symbolic representation is important.)

650
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,310
- We're not in Paris. - It would be nice...

651
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,680
if we took a photo of the Eiffel Tower.

652
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,080
(The place matters more.)

653
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,080
- But that's not... - It's not easy.

654
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,450
Or we could buy a toy that looks like a fly.

655
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,090
Like a small blowfly.

656
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,790
That's not a good idea.

657
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,920
Hey, why do you...

658
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,860
keep making things ugly?

659
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,060
(The ugly Blowfly gets scolded.)

660
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,700
- Paris isn't easy. - If you search on the Internet,

661
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,200
- you can find a cafe... - Right.

662
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,570
- that looks like Paris. - He's right.

663
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,300
We should find a cafe with a terrace.

664
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,770
(They narrow it down to a cafe that feels like Paris.)

665
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,570
- A terrace. - And the chairs.

666
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,800
- Right. The chairs. - That doesn't represent Paris.

667
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,710
- The unique-shaped chairs. - Right.

668
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,940
- We should buy summer clothes. - We should.

669
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,440
(Short-sleeved shirts are a must for summer in Paris.)

670
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,140
- First... - Paris...

671
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,810
Let's go to Myeong-dong and buy short-sleeved shirts.

672
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,710
The Summer Games took place in Paris this summer.

673
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,450
- So the souvenir of... - No.

674
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,790
- Souvenir? - No.

675
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,950
- The shirts... - No.

676
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,220
- No. - No.

677
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,820
(A 2nd conflict in opinions)

678
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,420
It sucks.

679
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,520
All right. Let's do this. The Eiffel Tower.

680
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,530
- Buy a miniature Eiffel Tower. - We will buy the Eiffel Tower.

681
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,930
(Only talking about the Eiffel Tower)

682
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,060
Then we will buy white shirts.

683
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,430
We will write it down with a marker.

684
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,430
- "I love Paris." - That wouldn't work.

685
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,930
That wouldn't work.

686
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,900
- Just buy white shirts. - Just buy white shirts.

687
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,170
(They only shout out what they have to say.)

688
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,670
- And we will write it down. - Okay.

689
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,370
- And with a baguette. - This is difficult.

690
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:13,080
(Will they be able to express Paris in Summer well?)

691
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,840
"I love Paris."

692
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,040
We should show that it's summer.

693
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,610
(They wait for the car.)

694
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,150
It has to be a place we can find in this neighborhood.

695
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,750
The rings are impressive.

696
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,150
(Se Chan)

697
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,020
The rings.

698
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,580
- This is a candy. - It looks like 80 million dollars.

699
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,350
(His fake GD style is well-received.)

700
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,620
This is crazy.

701
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,220
I thought it was a pacifier.

702
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,490
- That's it. It's a candy. - This is a candy.

703
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,220
What? Is this a candy?

704
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,560
- I bought this online. - I see. Really?

705
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,590
It's 2,000 carats.

706
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,130
- Really? - Is it 2,000 carats?

707
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,830
- Is that true? - Yes. It's 2,000 carats.

708
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,000
I like his attitude.

709
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,070
- Me too. - You should learn from him.

710
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,570
- Has it been 7 years? - This is my 8th year.

711
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,040
(Instead of the youngest one on his 7th year,)

712
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,570
- That's right. - You can't be doing this.

713
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,710
(he attacks the newbie.)

714
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,210
He bought the stuff online.

715
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,570
- That's amazing. - Look.

716
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,810
Seok Jin is also dressed...

717
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,080
- like the old man from Dongmyo. - Right.

718
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,080
- He's dressed like a celebrity. - Exactly.

719
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,050
(Their love for the newbie makes her ears hurt.)

720
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,350
The president of the Korean residents association.

721
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,080
- Seriously, Ye Eun, this is it. - What?

722
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,220
(They go off to find "Paris in Summer.")

723
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,120
What do we do? It's Paris.

724
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,290
(By the way)

725
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,460
We should buy the clothes first.

726
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,820
Seok Jin, we can't do this without the Eiffel Tower.

727
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,590
It's impossible without the Eiffel Tower.

728
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,830
(Blowfly keeps insisting on the Eiffel Tower.)

729
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,790
They won't know it's Paris.

730
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,060
I think we should make it simple and go to Paris Baguette.

731
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,130
No.

732
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,230
- Paris Baguette won't work. - We need a baguette though.

733
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,340
(He opposes the sneaky trick.)

734
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,770
- A baguette is good. - It's too obvious...

735
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,600
- for those who see it. - Right.

736
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,310
They might think it's fake.

737
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,780
(Glaring)

738
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,070
It should look natural.

739
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,310
They won't say Paris Baguette.

740
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,880
- They will just call it a bakery. - Right. It's just a bakery.

741
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,080
- Look to the front! - It's just a bakery.

742
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,320
When taking the photo,

743
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:29,950
(Jae Seok's guard started his work.)

744
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,320
- there could be a blowfly. - What on earth?

745
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
- What was that? - Seriously. What was that?

746
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,250
- You were being a baby. - What was that?

747
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,090
- Look ahead. - What do you mean?

748
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,620
- Don't look at me... - "Look ahead!"

749
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,630
- for something ridiculous. - "Look ahead."

750
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,660
- We'll go to Myeongdong... - Unbelievable.

751
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,260
- and buy clothes. - Sure.

752
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,170
- Summer clothes. - Then, where should we go?

753
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,270
There's a church in front of Jeongdong-gil Road.

754
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,140
- Ye Eun, come on. - Does it look like Paris?

755
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,210
(A place with the Paris vibe recommended by Jae Seok)

756
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,570
- Yes, it'll look like Paris. - Let's go there.

757
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,510
- It has a European vibe. - The writer...

758
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,840
- Yes? - Her hair is blonde.

759
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,010
- Staff members like her... - From behind.

760
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,710
- From behind. - We'll shoot them from behind,

761
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,020
to make them look like foreigners.

762
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,580
(Blowfly suggests various tricks.)

763
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,880
- That's good. - Could I be cleverer?

764
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,120
That won't work.

765
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,320
(Will he get to push at least one of his ideas?)

766
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,890
I don't think it'll work either.

767
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,120
Ye Eun...

768
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,390
Hey, it's Myeongdong!

769
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:11,730
(They arrive in Myeongdong to buy items related to Paris.)

770
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,060
The weather is nice to be in Myeongdong.

771
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,060
- I know. - The weather is divine!

772
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,330
The weather is perfect.

773
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:16,000
(Will they find hidden Paris in the summer at this place?)

774
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,730
- We have great weather today. - Let's hurry up and buy clothes.

775
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,470
- The weather is divine! - Clothes?

776
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,070
- We do have incredible weather. - I haven't been here in a while.

777
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,900
(Moving in search for Paris)

778
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,210
The sky reminds me that of the sky in Los Angeles.

779
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,410
The smell is incredible. I smell snacks.

780
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,640
- Hey. - Yes?

781
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,750
Didn't you smell ginkgo nuts just now?

782
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,550
- No, gukbap. - Who stepped on one?

783
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,520
It's obviously the smell of ginkgo nuts.

784
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,490
(The food fighter smells gukbap among ginkgo nuts.)

785
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,620
- Ginkgo nuts. - No, I smell gukbap.

786
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,720
- Gukbap? - Yes.

787
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,390
- Hey, it's Paris! - The back alley of Myeongdong...

788
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,550
(At that moment)

789
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,790
- "De Paris." - Paris!

790
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,020
- "De Paris." - Where?

791
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,160
(The word Paris appears before their eyes.)

792
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,560
- De Paris. - De Paris.

793
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,160
- De. - It's pronounced "deu."

794
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,830
- It's pronounced deu, not de. - De Paris.

795
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,770
- De Paris. - The pronunciation was off.

796
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,570
(The new Empty Head isn't familiar with French either.)

797
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,900
De Paris. You're killing me.

798
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,340
All right. Jae Seok, hold on.

799
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
(They continue to walk aimlessly.)

800
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,310
- We have different opinions. - And?

801
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,210
Raise your hand if you agree...

802
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,040
with writing words on a white T-shirt.

803
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,210
- A white T-shirt. - On a plain T-shirt,

804
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:06,050
(Write "I Love Paris" on a white T-shirt to look like a tourist.)

805
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,580
- Haha will write something. - Exactly.

806
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,910
- We can write the word. - That's the way to go.

807
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,820
- Write on a white T-shirt. - Write on a white T-shirt.

808
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,550
- It won't be like Paris. - It won't.

809
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,490
It won't give you that vibe.

810
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,020
(Opposing opinions)

811
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,490
- Exactly. - But Paris...

812
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,890
It'll only seem like a T-shirt with the word Paris on it.

813
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:16,560
(Wear clothes like someone who lives in Paris)

814
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,660
The photo itself should look like it was taken in Paris.

815
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,660
We can write Paris in red on a white T-shirt, you fool.

816
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,270
- But that's... - Get lost. Off you go.

817
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,270
(It's difficult to compromise.)

818
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,900
- Take your stupid ideas away. - As if you know anything.

819
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,370
- What do you know? - Blowfly, go away.

820
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,070
- It's like this. - Blowfly as in Paris.

821
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,040
(That's me.)

822
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,540
- Get lost, Blowfly. - It'll say Paris.

823
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,970
All we have to do is write "I love Paris."

824
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,310
(In the end, they move without agreeing on anything.)

825
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,540
- Here we go. - Where...

826
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,310
- Where is she going? - At a store like this?

827
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,080
(They finally find a clothing shop on the street.)

828
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,310
- Let's take a look. - I love...

829
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,110
- What are you going to buy? - Let's take a look.

830
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,410
- Let's buy some clothes. - Right.

831
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,720
Paris... These are pretty.

832
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:43,650
(Will there be outfits with the Paris vibe?)

833
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,050
There will be one with Paris written on it.

834
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,290
- Then... - These are cheap.

835
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,960
It's set in the summer, so buy shorts.

836
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,260
- Kook Jong. - Why?

837
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,520
- Kook Jong. - Yes?

838
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,060
(Did he find something within 5 seconds?)

839
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,130
Aren't these the pants you like?

840
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,530
- These are the best. - You like these kinds of pants.

841
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,600
(Gray sweatpants, Kook Jong's winter outfit)

842
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,260
- They're the best in the winter. - They're your favorite.

843
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,570
They're perfect for winter.

844
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,670
- They're soft too. - They're lined with fur.

845
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,500
- Napping pants. - They are napping pants.

846
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,140
- These are nice. - They're lined with fur.

847
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,370
- I quite like these. - I'll buy a pair for you.

848
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,640
- Really? - Yes.

849
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,480
(Suddenly, it becomes a Christmas gift.)

850
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,310
I'd appreciate that.

851
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,110
This is totally you.

852
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,110
- They're in black. - Black.

853
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,350
Should I buy them in black?

854
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,380
You should get both.

855
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,420
(Get both.)

856
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,520
- Both? Really? - You should get both. Of course.

857
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,450
(The Grand Award brothers are on good terms.)

858
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,990
- How big are those? - I see bracelets.

859
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,390
What sizes do they come in?

860
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,760
Why are you shopping for pants? Come on.

861
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:24,560
(Showing off their friendship instead of searching Paris outfits)

862
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,630
- Medium and extra large. - Large. I'll take these.

863
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,560
- These are in large. - Choose what you want.

864
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,560
Wait. These are joggers.

865
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,400
(Joggers)

866
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,560
I don't wear joggers.

867
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,000
(He's clear about his preference.)

868
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,270
- These aren't for you, then. - There's nothing to buy.

869
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,800
- There aren't any sweatpants. - There's only a size XXL.

870
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,840
They're pretty which is why there aren't any in my size left.

871
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,340
- These are in trend, you see. - They're already sold out...

872
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,640
- being pretty and all. - These are in trend.

873
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,080
- Unbelievable. - There are more options over here.

874
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,050
I never go out to shop for clothes.

875
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,350
(Fascinated)

876
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,050
They're all joggers, though.

877
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,790
(Meanwhile, other members came inside.)

878
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,020
- This is pretty. - Buy one that gives a Paris vibe.

879
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,250
One with a Paris vibe?

880
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,590
This looks like a good choice.

881
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,990
- A university in Paris... - That's pretty.

882
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,890
- That's pretty. - It's like Nagoya University.

883
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,660
- Really? - But these...

884
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,630
- They'd wear this in Paris. - Let me see.

885
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,360
- That's pretty. - Like a university student.

886
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,800
- There's nothing French about this. - Really?

887
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,670
- What are the colors of Paris? - I...

888
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,040
- Isn't it pretty? - I'll say this again.

889
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,800
- A white T-shirt and... - Guys, get choosing...

890
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,240
- for now. - It's at half price.

891
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,740
We'll buy seven...

892
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,210
We'll buy seven white T-shirts...

893
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,880
(Getting angry)

894
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,740
- and write on it with a marker. - This is pretty.

895
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,110
- Let's check downstairs. - We should head downstairs.
(To the basement)

896
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,120
(In the end, their opinions have dispersed.)

897
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,580
I can't believe that blowfly's ideas.

898
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,780
What a nuisance.

899
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,350
- He thinks he's so smart. - There should be a lot of...

900
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,820
- I see Paris written on it. - There are a lot here.

901
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,590
- Where? - Over there.

902
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,090
- Where does it say Paris? - Here. It says Paris.

903
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,590
(Did she find a sweater with "Paris" written on it?)

904
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,090
- Paris. - Paris. You're right.

905
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,390
(Paris sweater)

906
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,330
- Hey. - It says Paris.

907
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,330
- It has to be short-sleeved. - The cap says Paris!

908
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,730
(Paris in summer)

909
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,000
- It has to be short-sleeved. - Right, short-sleeved.

910
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,100
It's summer, remember?

911
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,530
I'll put this cap on that says Paris.

912
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,340
This isn't short-sleeved, and that has fur lining.

913
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,070
(It's okay if there's Paris written on it.)

914
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,070
You're right about the fur.

915
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,270
- But it says Paris. - We'll find something else.

916
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,610
(Finding summer items is key.)

917
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,580
Look. This is the blue from the French flag.

918
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,210
How would anyone link that to France?

919
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,320
(The impressionists: French, blue, and an overall vibe)

920
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,980
I'm saying we should create the right vibe.

921
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,490
No way. I didn't expect the store to extend to the basement level.

922
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:56,120
(Jong Kook just entered the store.)

923
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,650
- Where... - I thought that was it.

924
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,090
You should get around more.

925
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,960
Does it also have a basement level?

926
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:05,160
(The newbie: Shopping for the first time, easily fascinated)

927
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,460
It's massive.

928
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,630
The T-shirts are less than 20 dollars.

929
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,560
Check this out. It's a plain T-shirt.

930
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,800
This is totally me.

931
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,570
Wait, the back. It has words written on it.

932
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,570
There are too many words on the back.

933
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,140
(Jong Kook heads to the basement level.)

934
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,080
(Jong Kook is fascinated by the massive size.)

935
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,910
This clothing store is massive.

936
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,110
Over there. They're offered at a 70-percent discount.

937
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,780
How much will it be at a 70-percent discount?

938
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,050
How can they be at a 70-percent discount?

939
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,250
(There are traps for Stingy Jong Kook everywhere.)

940
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,650
No way, 70 percent?

941
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,820
This is incredible.

942
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,050
If my stylist bought these when getting me my clothes,

943
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,520
(Stylist)

944
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,020
I'd be set for all the shows I'm on.

945
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,120
(They've forgotten about Paris a long time ago.)

946
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,860
Isn't there a sweatshirt that seems European?

947
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,330
(The impressionist is still trying to express Paris.)

948
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,060
Here's one.

949
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:42,000
(He finds a T-shirt with Paris written on it.)

950
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,900
- Ji Hyo. - Yes?

951
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,040
But all it has is the word Paris on it.

952
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,140
On top of that, it should have the French vibe.

953
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,140
(He's still looking for the Paris vibe.)

954
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,110
Also, when we put on these clothes,

955
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,810
the last thing I want...

956
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,810
is for us to look like a group.

957
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,320
It'll seem awkward if we end up...

958
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,220
(A Paris T-shirt for a group is embarrassing.)

959
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,850
in matching clothes.

960
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,090
(Jae Seok wants a natural vibe of Paris.)

961
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,090
Hold on a second.

962
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,830
- Maybe we should buy this. - As in what?

963
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,160
(What caught his attention?)

964
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,730
To make it look like we're in Europe.

965
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,100
But that's...

966
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,040
(How does this embody the vibe of Paris?)

967
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,970
Are you sure you have the right intention in mind?

968
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,340
- Because it's summer. - You've lost your purpose.

969
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,310
(It's just a T-shirt for Yu Jae Seok.)

970
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,710
This is more me.

971
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,070
I wear a lot of clothes like this.

972
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,410
People need to know just by looking at the photo,

973
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,340
so we need it to say Paris. What's that over there?

974
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,980
It'd be off for everything to have the word "Paris" on it.

975
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,150
(Firm)

976
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,320
Haha, let's go with these.

977
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,390
(The Mapo Siblings are plotting something.)

978
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,550
Exactly. Buy a few T-shirts.

979
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,990
- Where is he? - Jae Seok will throw a fit...

980
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,360
if I suggest it, so...

981
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,590
- Haha, hold on. - These are 5.9 dollars.

982
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,490
(White T-shirts)

983
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,160
We should get them. Let's buy these, Ji Hyo.

984
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,760
- Let's buy those. - Can you pick out seven of them?

985
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,560
(He gets Ji Hyo to buy white T-shirts...)

986
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,400
(to avoid getting told off.)

987
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,770
That's six.

988
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,100
(She moves discreetly.)

989
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,870
Hello, can I keep them on the side for now?

990
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,740
(7 white T-shirts)

991
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,870
- Sure. - Good.

992
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:01,310
(Will their white T-shirt plan succeed?)

993
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,110
Can I get some sweatpants while we're at it?

994
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,880
- Go ahead. - Can I?

995
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,480
Everyone else is buying, so let's buy some too.

996
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,610
Jae Seok, the pants...

997
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,620
Jae Seok, who's paying for all this?

998
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,550
- It'll be on me. - You?

999
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,920
Can I try this on, Jae Seok?

1000
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,390
- Sure, go ahead. - You're all shopping.

1001
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,720
(Tempted by the opportunity to shop for free)

1002
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,390
- This is pretty. - Wait.

1003
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,590
I should buy the Trevis Scott T-shirt.

1004
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,830
Let's buy one each.

1005
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,160
(Whispering)

1006
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,060
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

1007
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,460
(Let's do that.)

1008
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,830
- Jae Seok's buying. - I know.

1009
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,560
Let's get out there and buy one.

1010
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,800
(With white T-shirts on hold, they start shopping for themselves.)

1011
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,500
- Buy one. - Add it to his tab.

1012
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,730
I'm too angry not to get one.

1013
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,870
This looks decent.

1014
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,870
It'll be cute on us.

1015
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,340
This is Paris itself.

1016
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,770
They actually performed in Paris.

1017
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,470
(Being forceful)

1018
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,580
It's the same person, Se Chan.

1019
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,110
(While American rappers are relocated to Paris)

1020
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,350
Weren't they a group?

1021
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,550
This is adorable!

1022
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,020
This is cute. Come on.

1023
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,550
- It has a Paris vibe. - It's adorable.

1024
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,890
(Everyone starts using up all of Jae Seok's money.)

1025
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,460
- Kitty looks so cute. - I like the pink.

1026
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,720
Jae Seok!

1027
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,890
Jae Seok, this screams Paris for sure.

1028
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,360
Think of Montmartre.

1029
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,300
- Let me see. - This is cheap and pretty.

1030
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:56,000
(He's obviously trying to buy a winter coat for himself.)

1031
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,770
- Hey, that's pretty. - It must be summery.

1032
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,800
- Montmartre. - Think of it being summer.

1033
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,400
(The credit card owner dismisses it.)

1034
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,830
This won't do.

1035
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,640
- This isn't summery. - Haha!

1036
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,010
- Hold on. Aren't these... - Yes, I just checked.

1037
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:07,710
(Now, he's shopping for someone else.)

1038
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,610
- This is in size large. - Is it?

1039
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,810
- It's in size large. - Okay, nice.

1040
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,080
- Wait. - Isn't it short on you?

1041
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,550
Does that scream Paris?

1042
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,750
- What? I'm shopping for clothes. - Well, he...

1043
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,520
(The idea of Paris is getting dim in their shopping craze.)

1044
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,320
XL. I should get one.

1045
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,590
- That you should. - It's a plain T-shirt.

1046
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,350
- It's pretty. - Weren't you going to buy one?

1047
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,490
Why are you shopping for your own clothes?

1048
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,460
- We have a mission to complete. - What about our mission?

1049
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,060
We're running out of time.

1050
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,800
- A black T-shirt. - Don't shop for your own clothes.

1051
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,260
- I need a plain black T-shirt. - Seok Jin,

1052
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,500
- it's been a while... - Exactly.

1053
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,800
- since he was in Myeongdong. - This was unexpected.

1054
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,070
- But... - Exactly.

1055
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,300
Stop shopping for yourselves.

1056
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,500
This one's pretty.

1057
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,340
This is the one.

1058
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,970
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

1059
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,880
(Buy this for me.)

1060
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,310
I want to wear this.

1061
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,640
The colors are too similar and would look off.

1062
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,880
- How's that? - The print will hurt your eyes.

1063
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,820
(The colors look dizzy.)

1064
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,750
But this is only 39 dollars.

1065
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,520
The pattern makes you dizzy.

1066
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,320
Who cares when I want to wear it?

1067
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,090
A shirt for 39 dollars...

1068
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,620
- Wouldn't this... - That's pretty!

1069
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,820
(Jae Seok's recommendation for clothes)

1070
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,790
- Is this better? - This is better.

1071
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,860
- It's pretty. - I'll take this instead.

1072
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,990
- Seok Jin, this... - Wear it on any occasion.

1073
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,660
Even when you go grocery shopping.

1074
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,230
Wouldn't this...

1075
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,330
- Does it scream Paris? - It looks trendy. Let's wear that.

1076
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,600
(Hairtail silver T-shirt with the Paris vibe)

1077
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,900
- Wear that instead. - That one's better.

1078
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,670
- Seok Jin. - That one's prettier.

1079
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,800
I'm only looking for something because I'm too hot.

1080
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,800
(I'll wear that.)

1081
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,300
How about this?

1082
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,310
(Like someone from Paris?)

1083
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,970
- Yes, I should wear this. - Let's wear matching T-shirts.

1084
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,070
- This is really pretty. - Doesn't it look like a foreign...

1085
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,340
- A foreign soccer club! - That's right.

1086
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,280
A foreign soccer club or a rugby club.

1087
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,020
- A rugby club? - A soccer and rugby club?

1088
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,980
Paris is known for playing rugby.

1089
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,050
- Not rugby clubs... - Do they play rugby in Paris?

1090
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,660
- Rugby in Paris? - They probably do, but...

1091
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,290
- Is that all you know? - You didn't see the movie.

1092
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,720
(My goodness)

1093
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,790
- What movie? - Come back here.

1094
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,730
- Don't sulk. - What movie are you talking about?

1095
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,260
Movies that are based in Paris.

1096
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,300
- Like? - Movies like "Mean Girls."

1097
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,800
- Does it have a rugby club? - Does it have a rugby club?

1098
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,870
People cheer for the rugby club.

1099
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,300
- With charming athletes. - That's a Hollywood movie!

1100
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,470
- Is that so? - Of course.

1101
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,510
- Of course it's a Hollywood movie. - Didn't you know?

1102
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:46,210
(Chuckling)

1103
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,810
To me, all foreign countries are the same.

1104
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,280
- How is Europe and the US... - Unbelievable.

1105
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,580
(The mind of global Empty Head who treats two continents as the same)

1106
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,210
- Right, they're different. - Of course they're different.

1107
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,750
- You're killing me. - I know that.

1108
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,550
- Are you buying that? - No.

1109
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,150
I should wear that instead.

1110
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:59,020
(Only 5 hours remain.)

1111
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,520
- What? - I'll cut this up and wear it.

1112
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,290
My face brightens up when I wear this color.

1113
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:02,290
(Now, they start shopping carelessly for something with the Paris vibe.)

1114
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,060
I'll cut this up and wear this. The one with Paris on it.

1115
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,160
That's good.

1116
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,630
I'm wearing the strangest outfit.

1117
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,730
Really? How would I know that?

1118
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,470
That was the first time I saw myself from head to toe.

1119
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,370
I exited my car wearing what my stylist gave me.

1120
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,310
(He saw himself in the leopard print for the first time.)

1121
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,610
- We'll take these too. - Yes, those too.

1122
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,340
(Anything that could be related to Paris)

1123
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,980
That screams Paris for sure.

1124
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,850
(They put it in the shopping cart.)

1125
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,780
Snoopy is a famous character in Paris.

1126
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,350
Just the three of you, then.

1127
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,380
(White T-shirts)

1128
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,820
You and...

1129
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,250
Return the other four.

1130
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,050
- We'll leave four tees. - What...

1131
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,490
(He tries to take out some items from the shopping cart.)

1132
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,090
We'll drop four of them.

1133
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,760
Okay, guys. We're about to close.

1134
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,820
We're shutting down the cashier!

1135
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,560
(When the cashier is about to close)

1136
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,560
Run!

1137
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,160
- This feels like Paris. - This Paris feel...

1138
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,100
(The last-ditch effort for Paris)

1139
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,160
- That's just perfect. - This is Paris.

1140
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,470
- With bread, it would be perfect... - Hold onto this.

1141
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,800
if you were to have a baguette.

1142
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,270
(The last item to complete the look, a newsboy cap)

1143
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,100
- A baguette. Yes, I could get one. - Yes.

1144
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,270
- Do you have one? - We can buy one.

1145
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,770
(He tries it on.)

1146
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,970
A cap like that... That's one, yes.

1147
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,110
It looks perfect.

1148
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,410
Seriously.

1149
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,580
- Does it look Paris enough? Okay. - Totally.

1150
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,320
Okay. If you say it looks like Paris. Are you sure?

1151
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,380
Why are you laughing, then?

1152
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,490
The way she laughs offends me.

1153
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,290
(Giggling)

1154
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,960
- Did you lie to me? - No.

1155
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,130
Why are you laughing?

1156
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,900
- Because you look cute. - You can't stop laughing.

1157
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,760
(Avoiding his eyes)

1158
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,330
Wait. It's annoying how you can't stop laughing.

1159
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,530
(In the end, he tries on another hat.)

1160
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
How about this?

1161
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,240
Take a look.

1162
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,410
Oh, that's nice. It looks Parisian.

1163
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,810
- What do you think? - It's great.

1164
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,310
- Is it? Okay. - Yes.

1165
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,610
Then why are you...

1166
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:32,750
(He falls for it and heads to the others.)

1167
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,110
Why are you laughing?

1168
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,350
- I'm just... - It's offensive.

1169
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,550
I'll stop.

1170
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,250
- I'm not sure. - Seok Jin. Gosh.

1171
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,450
- What? - That's China.

1172
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,390
- China? - It's China. This is better.

1173
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,320
(Shopping...)

1174
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,060
You look like Rapper Woo Won Jae.

1175
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,890
(while changing his nationality and occupation)

1176
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,290
It's not bad. Do you have shorts?

1177
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,530
- Do you sell shorts? - Shorts?

1178
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,900
The shorts are gone.

1179
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,130
(He tries to change his leopard print pants.)

1180
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,600
They're sold out?

1181
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,870
Get that cap.

1182
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,030
If you didn't like that, how about this?

1183
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,200
You know that Paris goes for the unisex look, right?

1184
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,810
- That's perfect. - No, wait.

1185
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,310
- The pants... - It works.

1186
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,810
(Quickly putting on the perfect hat)

1187
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,740
- This is it. - Seok Jin.

1188
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,480
You look like the comedy character Yeong Goo.

1189
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,580
Seok Jin!

1190
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:06,280
(He instantly becomes an artist in Paris.)

1191
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,280
- You're Yeong Goo. - Hey.

1192
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,410
- Stand right here. - Seok Jin.

1193
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,480
- You're... - Is that a wig?

1194
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,550
- Wear this on top of your pants. - Is that a wig?

1195
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,890
It's worn in layers.

1196
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,350
- I like this. - Seok Jin.

1197
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,820
This is so Paris.

1198
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,820
- This is Paris. We must get this. - Like this.

1199
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,090
- Hey. - Get it.

1200
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:20,260
(It has the most Paris vibe than any other clothes.)

1201
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,830
- It looks like you have hair. - You look like Dennis Rodman.

1202
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,330
It's like you have thick hair.

1203
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,630
- But I look like a beggar. - This is a Paris look.

1204
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,830
This is fashion.

1205
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,600
- Your hair looks thicker. - This...

1206
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,900
- Get rid of that. - Wear this on top.

1207
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:27,800
(The street artist goes back to browse pants.)

1208
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,070
- You should wear this. - Seok Jin.

1209
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,010
Let's check out the pants. Where are the men's pants?

1210
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,540
This is pretty. Isn't this for men?

1211
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,710
This is pretty. Isn't it nice?

1212
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,380
What you're wearing looks nicer.

1213
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,580
No, this is nice.

1214
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,480
(The answer is set in stone.)

1215
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,820
This, Jae Seok. I want to buy this.

1216
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,020
Why do you like pockets so much?

1217
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,820
Seok Jin loves white clothes with pockets.

1218
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,830
(He goes back to the Korean fashion style.)

1219
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,560
- He loves pockets so much. - Isn't this pretty?

1220
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,790
It's for summer, and this is corduroy.

1221
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,730
There are no other pants.

1222
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,570
- There's nothing else. - It's summer.

1223
00:30:55,070 --> 00:31:00,340
(Making a fuss because he wants to buy them)

1224
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,670
- You want this, right? - I do.

1225
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,070
You wanted it so much that you whined that there was nothing else?

1226
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,470
There's nothing else and these...

1227
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,810
- Buy him something. - Okay.

1228
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,910
Buy this for me.

1229
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,740
- Are you serious? - You people...

1230
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,010
That's for free.

1231
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,550
- It's for free? - Why?

1232
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,020
(The beanie is given for free for a purchase over 30 dollars.)

1233
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,150
If we spend over 30 dollars? Let's get some more.

1234
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,550
- Over 30 dollars. - Just one?

1235
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,820
- We just get one. - Pay 30 dollars multiple times.

1236
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,050
- Hey. - That's what to do.

1237
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,160
(Despite the groundbreaking yet shameless method of payment,)

1238
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,820
- Yes. - That's what to do.

1239
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,760
- That's only right. - I'll give you enough to cover it.

1240
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,360
(the clerk is happy to give them additional free items.)

1241
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,090
- We can get a few more? - How much is our total?

1242
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,900
- You get about eight? - Goodness.

1243
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,030
- We need seven. - This color...

1244
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,330
(Blowfly is excited.)

1245
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,070
- For men... - I'll wear mine now.

1246
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,800
We bought so many things,

1247
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,340
(They bought as many as 27 items.)

1248
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,600
- and the total is just... - Seriously.

1249
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
It's so cheap.

1250
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:39,810
(Saint Yu buys them with his personal card.)

1251
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,610
- How much is it? - Be cool.

1252
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,740
- Simple is best. - It's 340 dollars?

1253
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,210
- It's 340 dollars. - Also...

1254
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,040
You know...

1255
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,350
We should save the TV station's budget.

1256
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,550
The white tees.

1257
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,920
- Hey. - They're all here.

1258
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,020
(It's time to write "I Love Paris.")

1259
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
- Spread it out. - Okay. "I."

1260
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,750
- "Love" goes here. Then P... - The red heart.

1261
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,320
Let's get seven white tees and markers...

1262
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:57,230
(How will confident Haha's DIY Paris tees come out?)

1263
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,060
and write on them. I'll write on them.

1264
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,100
They shouldn't look so crude.

1265
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,060
(Crude)

1266
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,770
They shouldn't look so crude.

1267
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,870
Would he do a good job? Just look at what he's doing.

1268
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,000
(Goodness)

1269
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,540
- What? - Oh, my gosh...

1270
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,340
He just never listens.

1271
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,310
(The Parisian goes to change.)

1272
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,340
The A should be the Eiffel Tower.

1273
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,150
Yes, right. It should.

1274
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,050
(The DIY T-shirt gets made in the midst of criticism.)

1275
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,710
I won't color this in.

1276
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,710
Okay.

1277
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,750
- That's one done. - Hey.

1278
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,550
- What an amazing Paris look. - How is that Paris?

1279
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,750
(Just then)

1280
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,750
What an amazing Paris look.

1281
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,050
(The Parisian appears at last.)

1282
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,360
I'm so Paris.

1283
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,130
- What's Paris? - How is that a Paris look?

1284
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,560
(What are you talking about?)

1285
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,960
It's Paris if I say it is.

1286
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,560
- How is that a Paris look? - What's Paris?

1287
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,570
(No one pays attention to him.)

1288
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,270
I just need to dress for summer.

1289
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,340
I'm so Paris. It's perfect.

1290
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:41,200
(The Parisian fashion show continues.)

1291
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,070
I look like I'm in Paris.

1292
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,540
This is Paris.

1293
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,110
(It's just what they'd wear in summer...)

1294
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,310
(with Paris written on it.)

1295
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,310
- I'm dressed for Paris. - Let's see.

1296
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,710
- "Paris." - It'll be short-sleeved.

1297
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,720
- Well done. - That'll do.

1298
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,220
(The DIY T-shirts are being made next to them.)

1299
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,820
- Well done. - We need just one more.

1300
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,320
- Where did one of the tees go? - Short sleeves for summer.

1301
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,090
- The tees... - We only bought three.

1302
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,890
(White T-shirts)

1303
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,060
Then me, Jong Kook, Ji Hyo...

1304
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,320
- and Haha wear them? - Yes.

1305
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,260
- Okay, let's do that. - Okay. I'll wear one.

1306
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,590
(They're short of one T-shirt.)

1307
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,330
Let's do that.

1308
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,330
- You wore yours? - You don't have one, right?

1309
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,830
(Flustered)

1310
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,960
- This is my tee. - It's yours.

1311
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,230
Didn't we buy one more?

1312
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,600
- The season... - Let's draw on your tee.

1313
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,340
- On mine? - Yes.

1314
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,470
- Is it expensive? - No, it's not.

1315
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:18,040
(He's sacrificing his tee for this?)

1316
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,540
Here goes.

1317
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,710
(He donated his clothes.)

1318
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,910
I'm sacrificing my own clothes now.

1319
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,750
That's before summer when it's cold.

1320
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,550
(This time, Jong Kook writes on it.)

1321
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,280
You should switch caps.

1322
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,820
- What? - Wear it back to front.

1323
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,050
Yes, wear it back to front.

1324
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,050
You're going straight for my nipple.

1325
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:35,160
(He includes the actual feel of Paris.)

1326
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,290
It's not that.

1327
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,960
- Stop it. - It says "Paris."

1328
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,360
- Here. - Is this it?

1329
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,230
(Ringing)

1330
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,630
- Is that it? Sorry. - Did you just ring the doorbell?

1331
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,360
- I rang it. - You're enjoying it, though.

1332
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,070
I felt him ring the bell.

1333
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:46,600
(After many ups and downs, the sensual T-shirt is made.)

1334
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,130
- You enjoyed it. - That's it.

1335
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,300
What a surprise.

1336
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,900
- Okay. - Okay. "I love Paris."

1337
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,710
We can stretch the tee to show the writing and smile.

1338
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,970
(He's satisfied with it.)

1339
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,280
- It doesn't feel like summer. - It feels like summer, doesn't it?

1340
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,250
- Let's see. It looks like summer. - It's totally summer.

1341
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,810
- It looks like summer. - Shall I wear sunglasses?

1342
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,520
(When he puts on sunglasses,)

1343
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,420
- Yes. - You should.

1344
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,750
- Good, nice. - It's totally summer.

1345
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,250
(he's ready to perform.)

1346
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,120
- It looks like it's summer. - Yes, summer.

1347
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,720
The "Paris" writing is a bit...

1348
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,220
- We want this feel. - I look weird.

1349
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,460
- The writing is a bit... - It doesn't feel like summer.

1350
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,290
It doesn't look too bad.

1351
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:12,660
(More and more poverty-stricken Paris tourists join the group.)

1352
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,260
Haha's... Hey, Jae Seok.

1353
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,930
- It's Batman. - Hey.

1354
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,000
Bo Sung.

1355
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,840
- With that beanie... - Stay loyal.

1356
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,600
- Stay loyal. - Stay loyal.

1357
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,970
- Stay loyal. - Bo Sung.

1358
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,710
- Stay loyal. - Me?

1359
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,880
Stay loyal. You look like Bo Sung.

1360
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,680
(The result of his shopping equals Bo Sung.)

1361
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,180
- Stay loyal. - Kim Bo Sung.

1362
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,310
- Stay loyal. Let's go. - We're done.

1363
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,680
- There are none left. - Let's go.

1364
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,180
- Paris... - Hey.

1365
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,290
(Otherwise, it's embarrassing.)

1366
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,850
It's embarrassing, so cover up for now.

1367
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,090
- Thank you. - Take care.

1368
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:40,060
(They spent 1.5 hours on their Parisian look.)

1369
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,120
Goodbye.

1370
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,590
- Have a good day. - Bye.

1371
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,620
The smell... I smell something tasty.

1372
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,490
(Meanwhile)

1373
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,260
We should eat kalguksu since we're in Myeongdong.

1374
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,560
- Yes. - Myeongdong Kyoja!

1375
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,660
It's so tasty.

1376
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,330
Myeongdong Kyoja!

1377
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:52,670
(Will they recreate Paris with their homeless look in Paris?)

1378
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,200
Ye Eun also keeps trying to eat...

1379
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,040
- if possible during the shoot. - That's not true.

1380
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,940
Where are we headed to now?

1381
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,340
Jeongdong Theater's entrance looks just like a place in Paris.

1382
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,210
- Okay! - It totally feels like Paris.

1383
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,010
(They decide to go to Jeongdong Theater.)

1384
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,380
- Let's go. - Where did you get the baguette?

1385
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,750
What about a baguette?

1386
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,780
(Seok Sam even bought a baguette.)

1387
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,250
Where did you get it? That's awesome.

1388
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,650
- I bought it. - Nice.

1389
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,420
- I'd love to have some. - Me too.

1390
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,350
- I want a bit from the end. - Eat some.

1391
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,690
- I can flip it around. - Don't do that.

1392
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,720
(Do you want some?)

1393
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,360
- We shouldn't do that. - I can show the other end.

1394
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,230
We should change the way we think.

1395
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,460
- Change what? - Hearing "Paris..."

1396
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,830
and automatically thinking of posing with a baguette.

1397
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,430
- The archetype... - We must break free of that.

1398
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,600
(A simplistic item)

1399
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,770
What's modern Paris like?

1400
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,100
This isn't easy, though. If we're to succeed...

1401
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,610
Can we try three times? If we're to succeed just once...

1402
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,240
- Yes. - That would be fortunate.

1403
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,980
(Glancing)

1404
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,910
It's hard. It's not easy.

1405
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:33,980
Bo Sung.

1406
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,210
- Stay loyal. - Stay loyal.

1407
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,250
Bo Sung.

1408
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,780
- Stay loyal. - Stay loyal.

1409
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:43,020
(They're teasing Ha Bo Sung again.)

1410
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,820
Stay loyal to us.

1411
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,790
- It suits you. - Stay loyal to Running Man.

1412
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,290
- Stay loyal. - Stay loyal.

1413
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,360
Ha Bo Sung.

1414
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,320
- Bo Sung's my age. - "Ha Bo Sung."

1415
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,830
- "Ha Bo Sung." - I lost quite a few years.

1416
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,560
You used to call me Lee Duk Hwa.

1417
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,260
- Right. - That's a jump.

1418
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,770
(He's happy with the younger nickname.)

1419
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,330
- I got younger. - You lost about 20 years.

1420
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,270
- Yes. - You went down to Bo Sung's age.

1421
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,040
Ha Bo Sung.

1422
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,440
- Bo Sung. - Stay loyal.

1423
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,610
My father wasn't insubordinate. He wasn't there for six years.

1424
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,140
- What? - Your father?

1425
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,310
The Marines.

1426
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,980
- He told you off? - I got scolded.

1427
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:11,510
My dad was a Marine for six years.

1428
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:16,790
(Haha started a rumor about his dad 2 weeks ago.)

1429
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,680
Why did he serve for six years?

1430
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,290
I guess he was insubordinate.

1431
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,890
I think I exaggerated with hopes of making him famous.

1432
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:22,190
(It turned out to be a lie.)

1433
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,060
- To make him look good. - To make him look good.

1434
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,260
- I correct that. - But...

1435
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,400
- Where we're going to... Ye Eun. - Yes?

1436
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,430
- Does it actually feel like France? - Totally.

1437
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,200
- I was there recently to film. - Were you?

1438
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,440
- Is it France-like? - It's perfect.

1439
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,710
- It's perfect. - Good.

1440
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,380
- Oh, it's a cathedral. - I said it was a cathedral.

1441
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,110
(The spot Jae Seok vouches for...)

1442
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,640
Why don't you believe me?

1443
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,010
(where he filmed "Whenever Possible")

1444
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,080
- There's Jeongdong Church. - Ye Eun.

1445
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,780
- The Eiffel Tower... - I want to visit France.

1446
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,320
- The Eiffel Tower... - We could...

1447
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,850
hold a model of the Eiffel Tower to accentuate the look.

1448
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,290
- We should have electric fans. - Since it's summer...

1449
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,860
- Electric fans or paper fans. - Yes.

1450
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,630
Right? Electric fans.

1451
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,230
(Theme: Paris in summer)

1452
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:02,600
("Summer" is also important.)

1453
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,000
- Electric fans. - Do you have one?

1454
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,400
- It's not here. - Right?

1455
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,170
It's too cold to have one.

1456
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,000
We can make fans out of torn sheets of paper.

1457
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:08,270
(Haha's opinion)

1458
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,970
- To fan ourselves with? - We can make fans.

1459
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:07,970
- Yes. - Yes.

1460
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,870
Can't you draw in a fan if we pose like this in the photo?

1461
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,210
(Seok Sam's opinion)

1462
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:14,310
- There's a fan emoji. - Get a grip.

1463
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,140
(Everyone shares their ideas.)

1464
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,280
Ye Eun, say something.

1465
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,150
- Stop eating. - Ye Eun. Are you eating?

1466
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,020
- She got something, - What are you eating?

1467
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,350
(Is Ddochi chewing on something?)

1468
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,820
and she didn't even offer to share.

1469
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,590
- What is it? - No wonder...

1470
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,460
- I smelled something. - Come on.

1471
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,360
- I can't stand it. - You can't?
(Rustling sound)

1472
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:33,400
(Ji Hyo passed candies to Ye Eun.)

1473
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,830
Seok Jin, why would you say that?

1474
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,230
- Because of that. - Why say that?

1475
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,330
- It's like a baby octopus. - Seok Jin.

1476
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,170
- That's harsh. - I used to...

1477
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,430
(Inhaling it immediately)

1478
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,900
- What are you eating? - My blood sugar's low.

1479
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,800
- Ye Eun, get a grip. - What?

1480
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,440
- Well... - For a while now...

1481
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,540
She must be hungry. She mentioned Myeongdong Kyoja.

1482
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:50,910
(She keeps saying that she's hungry after skipping breakfast.)

1483
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,210
- Eat before the shoot. - Myeongdong Kyoja!

1484
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,380
- You must be hungry. - She smelled gingko nuts...

1485
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,150
- and said it smelled like gukbap. - I smell gukbap.

1486
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,150
- I smell gukbap. - What's wrong with you?

1487
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,750
- I'm... - Even if you're on a diet...

1488
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,350
(Don't skip breakfast.)

1489
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,020
- She's hungry. - My diet...

1490
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,450
- You should still eat. - Hey.

1491
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,090
She's been lethargic since she started to lose weight.

1492
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,720
I'm intermittently snacking.

1493
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,230
- "Snacking?" - "Snacking?"

1494
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,490
Do you need sugar?

1495
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,260
(She proudly announced her snacking regime.)

1496
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,260
- You intermittently snack? - Intermittent fasting.

1497
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,260
You should still eat.

1498
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,730
Who wants zero-sugar coffee?

1499
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:12,040
- Me! - Who wants zero-sugar coffee?

1500
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,440
Me!

1501
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:17,540
(Desperately hoarse)

1502
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,470
If you're going to be like this, don't go on a diet.

1503
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,980
Why try to eat less if you'll end up like this?

1504
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,980
- Her diet is to overeat. - My diet...

1505
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,410
- Eat enough breakfast. - You have to eat breakfast.

1506
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:27,750
(She insists on being on a diet when she's not.)

1507
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,750
- But... - We have to be very active,

1508
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,920
- I'm doing intermittent fasting. - so you can eat breakfast.

1509
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,350
- Thank you. - Intermittent snacking for you.

1510
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,790
(She accepts the coffee candy.)

1511
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,450
- Recharge your blood sugar level. - Again?

1512
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,360
- Is it not good? - It's good.

1513
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,090
- Is it good? How is it? - It's coffee flavored.

1514
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,460
Ha Bo Sung, loyalty!

1515
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,490
- Loyalty! - Loyalty!

1516
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,530
But you know, now,

1517
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,760
I think Duk Hwa is better.

1518
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:47,200
(Ha Bo Sung complains about his nickname.)

1519
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,340
- I don't know why... - Why? What's wrong with Bo Sung?

1520
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,840
- I mean, I like Bo Sung, - Yes.

1521
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,970
- but Duk Hwa just seems more... - But today...

1522
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,870
(Sniffing)

1523
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,610
But your beanie makes you Ha Bo Sung today.

1524
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,240
- Yes, your beanie is... - Here.

1525
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,210
- Is that your beanie? - Smell this.

1526
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,150
- It smells so good. - Isn't it?

1527
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,180
(Dizzy)

1528
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,480
- It smells so good. - It does.

1529
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,920
- Yesterday, - It's tasty.

1530
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,080
- I had hot pot. - Hot pot?

1531
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,090
Hot pot!

1532
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,950
Hey,

1533
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,120
if you're going to be like this, just stop dieting.

1534
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,890
(Reacting enthusiastically at the sound of food)

1535
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,730
- She's not on a diet. - Whenever someone mentions food...

1536
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,730
Hey,

1537
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,130
do you want to go to a hot pot restaurant sometime?

1538
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:13,930
(Hot pot restaurant)

1539
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,160
Yes!

1540
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,660
I love mala...

1541
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,670
(Mala Tang Wei is crazy about mala.)

1542
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,930
- Do you like it? - Yes.

1543
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,670
- I love it so much! - Hey, let's have that today.

1544
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,300
- Why not? - That place has a good dish.

1545
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,300
- What? - Candied sweet potatoes.

1546
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,940
(The restaurant)

1547
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,800
- Candied sweet potatoes are good. - You know, that's good too.

1548
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,110
- You know? - Oh, candied sweet potatoes.

1549
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,310
- You know... Sweet and sour pork. - Sweet and sour pork.

1550
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,580
- Sweet and sour pork is good too. - Sweet and sour pork.

1551
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,080
I seriously want to eat it so badly.

1552
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:30,010
(As Ye Eun is drooling, they arrive at their destination.)

1553
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,610
We're here.

1554
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,880
We're here.

1555
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,910
Here.

1556
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,910
- Oh, what? - It's this place!

1557
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,320
- Are we here? - It's pretty. What is this place?

1558
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:37,050
(The view Jae Seok mentioned)

1559
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,680
- Is this... - This is a Catholic church.

1560
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,790
Is this Paris?

1561
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,050
- It feels like Paris, right? - Is this the Paris vibe?

1562
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,360
- What are you talking about? - It doesn't at all.

1563
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,490
- Look over there. - How is this a Paris vibe?

1564
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,860
- With the bell tower. - Oh, here?

1565
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,560
- It kind of does. - It doesn't feel like Paris.

1566
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
But...

1567
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,160
it has Korean traditional roof tiles.

1568
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,160
- I think they're roof tiles. - Come on.

1569
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,930
Look before you talk.

1570
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,600
- They are roof tiles. - This is famous. Cecil Theater.

1571
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,100
We should leave our bags.

1572
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:55,610
(Half in doubt, they get off the bus.)

1573
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,870
- I can't see Paris because of it. - Oh, really?

1574
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,940
Shall we leave our bags?

1575
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,470
- We can put it to the side. - This looks so good.

1576
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,410
(Grabbing)

1577
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,740
- Smell it. - It's the perfect day for a picnic.

1578
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,310
- Do you want some? - Oh, the smell...

1579
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,910
- The bottom part? - In secret?

1580
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,080
- But the others will chew me out. - You should take it.

1581
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,280
- It's fine. - My clothes.

1582
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,920
I'll get in trouble, then.

1583
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,920
- No, you can't. - Just take it.

1584
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,350
I'll get in trouble.

1585
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:13,560
(She ends up munching on it.)

1586
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,460
Ye Eun!

1587
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,630
You can't eat that!

1588
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,730
You're eating candy and bread.

1589
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,170
- You call that a diet? - Why are you doing this?

1590
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:25,330
(Ms. Diet Ji ends up eating the item.)

1591
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,000
- Just eat breakfast before coming. - She eats so well.

1592
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,470
- Why are you doing this? - My gosh. Seriously.

1593
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,610
- This is so good. - Why is it so good?

1594
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,810
Are baguettes normally this good?

1595
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,910
- Try it. - Seriously, try it.

1596
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,250
(Writer)

1597
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,750
- Isn't that a prop? - It is a prop.

1598
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,380
- It's fine. Just go like this. - Yes, turn it around...

1599
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,180
- The other way around. - If it goes inside like this...

1600
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,950
- If you do that, it looks new. - It's good, right?

1601
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,560
(They take the elevator to get to the view of Paris.)

1602
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,120
Right here.

1603
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,990
- Gosh, isn't Deoksugung so pretty? - Where does it look like Paris?

1604
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,620
- Look at this. - The sunshine is great today.

1605
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:51,890
- Right here. This vibe. - Notre Dame de Paris.

1606
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,900
Notre Dame, the cathedral.

1607
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,930
(Magnificent and romantic buildings in Europe)

1608
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,770
- I love Paris. - It's Paris!

1609
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,430
Summer Paris.

1610
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,670
Gosh, it's Paris.

1611
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,700
What do you think?

1612
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:04,470
(The exterior of Seoul Anglican Cathedral with that vibe)

1613
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,800
- Doesn't this feel like Paris? - It does.

1614
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,740
We need to have a French vibe.

1615
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,570
Isn't this so pretty?

1616
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,940
- It's pretty. - No way.

1617
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:08,740
(Known as an exotic photo spot on social media)

1618
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,910
It really looks like Paris.

1619
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,640
This looks like a tourist site.

1620
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,410
Notre Dame, the cathedral.

1621
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,650
What? This isn't a cathedral.

1622
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,420
- Just be quiet. - Hey, Ji Ye Eun ate...

1623
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,120
(Reporting her)

1624
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,180
about half of the baguette.

1625
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,720
- It's so good. - Gosh, seriously.

1626
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,720
See? They're roof tiles. Is that right?

1627
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,190
- It feels like summer. - I mean...

1628
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,960
- They're roof tiles. - It's Notre Dame Cathedral.

1629
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,960
(Notre Dame Cathedral, Seoul Anglican Cathedral)

1630
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,000
- But they're roof tiles. - I mean,

1631
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,260
just look at it that way.

1632
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,400
(They look different, but will they succeed?)

1633
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,530
- But they're roof tiles. - Seok Jin.

1634
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,070
If you take a photo,

1635
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,540
you can't tell if they are roof tiles or not.

1636
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:40,510
(Theme: Paris in summer)

1637
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,870
All right. Let's go like this in front of the backdrop.

1638
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,140
You and I are a couple.

1639
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,440
Haha, fan yourself.

1640
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,140
Go like this, so it looks like you're hot.

1641
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,510
But if you go like this...

1642
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,680
(Fanning to express "summer")

1643
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,650
This? Well, yes. It would look okay.

1644
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,810
We have to show them this.

1645
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:50,690
(Expressing "Paris" with their T-shirts)

1646
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,050
The four of us are really important.

1647
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,180
Yes, come over here.

1648
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,680
- To the center. - Come to the center.

1649
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,350
- Isn't it odd to be in the center? - We can't see it.

1650
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,190
- At least one of us should be... - My shirt says "Paris" too.

1651
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,360
(Munching)

1652
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,460
And should we pull up our pants?

1653
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,630
That's good.

1654
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,730
- Isn't that good? - Pull it up.

1655
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,730
(Making their outfits look more refreshing)

1656
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:57,860
Should I pull mine up too?

1657
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,130
I should pull up my sleeves instead.

1658
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,260
- It looks like we're hot. - That's good.

1659
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,570
Jae Seok, we have to take the photo at an upward angle, like this.

1660
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:07,700
We can't include that sign that says "Health checkups."

1661
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,210
Right, don't let that show in the picture.

1662
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,610
(The view of the health examination center could be shown.)

1663
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,970
- But are the roof tiles okay? - Come on.

1664
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:14,240
(He's worried about the roof tiles.)

1665
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,310
The roof is covered in roof tiles.

1666
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,110
- And you can't tell at this angle. - Really?

1667
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,010
- It's just the background too. - Oh, the background?

1668
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,480
(It will be fine.)

1669
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,520
Jae Seok, it feels pretty good.

1670
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:22,420
(He tries to figure out the composition.)

1671
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,180
- See? It looks like France, right? - It does.

1672
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,190
But if we take it like this, the background doesn't show up.

1673
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,590
- Go farther back. - Go back.

1674
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,290
- Go back. - Go back.

1675
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,890
Good. Right now...

1676
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,130
- I'll take one really quickly. - Okay.

1677
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,630
There.

1678
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,660
- Jae Seok. - Does it have the right vibe?

1679
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:36,100
- It looks like Paris. - Hey!

1680
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,430
(This might make the cut.)

1681
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,170
It's Paris.

1682
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,770
- Just cut this out later. - It's totally Paris.

1683
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,940
It does look like Paris.

1684
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,670
- It looks like summer. - It's totally Paris.

1685
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,970
(Suddenly, they feel more confident.)

1686
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,240
- We just need to cut that out. - So, now...

1687
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,040
There is good sunlight now.

1688
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,880
The sunlight is great right now.

1689
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,210
Does this feel too fake?

1690
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,880
- Well, let's do this once. - No, it's not too fake.

1691
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,320
- Something like this. - But it's...

1692
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,350
Then, am I not in the picture? I want to...

1693
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,550
Jong Kook, I...

1694
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,360
- Hey, someone should take... - Someone should take this.

1695
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,820
Se Chan, join us.

1696
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:03,560
(The staff member decides to take the photo for them.)

1697
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,360
- I'll take it for you. - I'll show you the composition.

1698
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:03,890
Look at this.

1699
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,730
- Se Chan, come sit next to me. - Okay. Hang on.

1700
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:08,160
- Here. Okay? - Okay.

1701
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,770
(He explains the composition that he wants.)

1702
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,400
You have to cut this out in the back.

1703
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,570
That's it.

1704
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:12,030
All right. This is it.

1705
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,940
(Se Chan joins the group.)

1706
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,100
All right. Our shirts have to show.

1707
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,570
In 1, 2, 3.

1708
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,510
(Clicking)

1709
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,610
How does it look? Let's see.

1710
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,710
But this has to show.

1711
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,480
- The building has to show. - Hang on.

1712
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:28,180
(There's less of the building in the second photo.)

1713
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,250
And my face is in the shadow.

1714
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,180
Ye Eun, you can't be eating something.

1715
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,190
Hey, Ji Ye Eun!

1716
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,590
- Paris is all about coffee... - Hey, Ye Eun.

1717
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,190
You're blocking the sun and eating bread?

1718
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,490
You're blocking the sun and eating bread?

1719
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,060
What are you doing?

1720
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:39,000
(Ji Ye Eun just ate some bread.)

1721
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,860
I was going to eat bread so that...

1722
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,830
I mean, what are you doing?

1723
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,670
- This is the real Paris. - What is she eating?

1724
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,400
It doesn't look right.

1725
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,600
The background has to show.

1726
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,270
But we need to block that in the back.

1727
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,610
- The buildings in the back there. - Right.

1728
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:51,710
Let's take the photo...

1729
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:52,810
- so we're blocking that. - Right.

1730
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:56,010
(They change the details and try again.)

1731
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,710
- We should sit a bit in the back. - Right.

1732
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,310
- The back row should bend down. - I know, right?

1733
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,150
The building in the back should be hidden.

1734
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,250
There we go. Wait.

1735
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,280
Come here. Soo Wan, come here.

1736
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,850
(Did he find the right composition?)

1737
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,290
- Just like this. Grab it. - Hold it just the way he has it.

1738
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:06,390
- This is it. There. - Let's take five in a row.

1739
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:07,560
- There. - Let's go.

1740
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,860
In 1, 2, 3.

1741
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,260
(He's just a fan of baguettes.)

1742
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,330
In 1, 2, 3.

1743
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,060
(Just Yu Jae Seok making a V sign)

1744
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,430
In 1, 2, 3.

1745
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,560
(Just having a meal)

1746
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,000
- In 1, 2, 3. - Right there.

1747
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:20,970
(Will the photo show the vibe of Paris in the summer?)

1748
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,500
- Okay! - Okay.

1749
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,170
- That's all right. - Does it seem like Paris?

1750
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,370
- Really? - It feels pretty good.

1751
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:22,870
- Let me see. - Jong Kook and I blocked it well.

1752
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,640
(It looks good!)

1753
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,710
- It worked well, right? - But your face is a bit hidden.

1754
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:25,710
- It's fine. - It feels like...

1755
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,310
- an old castle in Europe. - Right.

1756
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,410
- Look at it like this. - It's an old castle in Europe,

1757
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,150
- but we're wearing "I love Paris." - It's all right.

1758
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,380
- We can assume it's France. - In the end,

1759
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,920
- "I love Paris" made the photo. - It did. These words...

1760
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,850
(It's my artwork.)

1761
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,950
- If not for this, the roof tiles... - In the end.

1762
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,950
- In the end, this made the photo. - In the end.

1763
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,460
Hey, but you guys really did a good job.

1764
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:44,990
(They're happy with the result.)

1765
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:43,130
- "I love Paris" was a good idea. - Right? Of course.

1766
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,360
- You did a good job. - This made the photo.

1767
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,930
- We needed these shirts. - This made the photo.

1768
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:50,100
- Show one citizen the photo... - Yes.

1769
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,570
And you have to say this exactly.

1770
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,700
"We're traveling abroad."

1771
00:44:52,270 --> 00:45:00,240
(The question they're required to ask)

1772
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:57,740
"When and where was this photo taken?" That's all you can say.

1773
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,480
- When? - Okay, got it.

1774
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,310
We can't mention the word "season?" Just when?

1775
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,750
- "When and where?" - "When and where?"

1776
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,250
But if they say July or August, that would be summer, right?

1777
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,520
But what if they say this?

1778
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,650
During the Paris Summer Games.

1779
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,690
- That would be summer. - But that's not exact.

1780
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:17,130
(The answer must include "summer" and "Paris.")

1781
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,020
It has to be just "summer" and "Paris?"

1782
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:14,820
You have to get the answer "Paris in Summer."

1783
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,760
- But it's the Summer Games. - What if they say...

1784
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,330
The "when" part...

1785
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,500
(Getting ready for a scheme)
Just say it like we mean a season.

1786
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,730
"When?"

1787
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,670
(Citizen)

1788
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,530
"You can just tell us a season."

1789
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:28,600
(That's cheating.)

1790
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,700
They just said we couldn't do that.

1791
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,110
If you get the wrong answer,

1792
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:33,580
more modifiers will be added on.

1793
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,650
You might have to take another picture for that.

1794
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:38,750
(Every time they fail, a modifier will be added.)

1795
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,250
We'll add another modifying word.

1796
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:44,020
(If they don't succeed in 3 tries, everyone will get a penalty.)

1797
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,920
- It will become harder. - It won't be easy.

1798
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,520
Gosh, "Paris in Summer?"

1799
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,050
It will be hard to get that answer.

1800
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,550
But if we ask people in this neighborhood,

1801
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:46,720
they'll know this place.

1802
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,460
(They set off to ask the question.)

1803
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,620
- Right, they'll know. - We can't do this here.

1804
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,560
We can't ask someone who knows this place.

1805
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,630
And we can't ask people who look too mischievous.

1806
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:56,530
But it also can't be someone who's too by the book.

1807
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,100
Well, it's because...

1808
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,440
(It's important to pick the right citizen.)

1809
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,340
- they might think it's a quiz. - Gosh, this is...

1810
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,540
- They might get flustered. - They might get flustered.

1811
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:03,940
We have to ask them lightly.

1812
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:05,940
Have you watched Running Man a lot?

1813
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,740
- Yes! - Have you watched Running Man?

1814
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,980
- Yes! - I'm a fan!

1815
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,380
Are you really confident?

1816
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:11,910
Telepathy!

1817
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,180
(Screaming)
- Oh, nice. - Telepathy!

1818
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,090
- Loyalty! - Loyalty, Haha.

1819
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,420
- Loyalty! - Loyalty!

1820
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,420
- Loyalty! - I don't think they'll do it.

1821
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,220
Their faces look way too mischievous.

1822
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,730
Yes, thank you!

1823
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,330
- Should we ask someone older? - Should we?

1824
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,560
(Looking for someone else)

1825
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,060
Hey, hang on.

1826
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,400
Jae Seok, did you get a feeling?

1827
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,670
Hello.

1828
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,670
Could we talk for a minute?

1829
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,340
Oh, is this not a good time?

1830
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:39,140
(He looks busy because it's lunchtime.)

1831
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:38,110
- His face was just... - Oh, hello.

1832
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:39,810
His face looked serious.

1833
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:40,910
Someone among them...

1834
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,380
- Hello! - Hello.

1835
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,650
- Hello. - Hello.

1836
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,180
Could we do an interview?

1837
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,350
Who can be on TV?

1838
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,920
- It's a short interview. - Anyway, it's...

1839
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,090
We can just ask as we walk along.

1840
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,320
Should we ask this person?

1841
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,720
That person looks good.

1842
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,060
Oh, hello.

1843
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,230
- Hello. - Hello.

1844
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:58,390
Where are you headed now?

1845
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:02,230
(One man shook his hand in a relaxed manner.)

1846
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:00,400
That person looks good.

1847
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,030
Oh, hello.

1848
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,800
(He joins them naturally like a friend.)

1849
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,400
- Hello. - Hello.

1850
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,600
Where are you headed now?

1851
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,100
I'm going to the gym. I'm skipping lunch.

1852
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,610
(Citizen)

1853
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,110
- That's so cool. - You're not eating and working out?

1854
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,740
Office workers have to lose weight too.

1855
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:14,510
(Citizen)

1856
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,240
I ate a lot on the weekend.

1857
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:15,310
So, you're not eating lunch...

1858
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,650
You look like you're at the perfect weight. Why...

1859
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,750
- You look like you stay fit. - Yes.

1860
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,520
He looks good because he stays fit.

1861
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,680
I should live a long life...

1862
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:23,920
(Citizen)

1863
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:22,590
- to see Jae Seok for a long time. - "I should live a long life."

1864
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,790
You should live a long life.

1865
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:26,060
- Gosh, I was so touched just now. - Why?

1866
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,560
(An extraordinary comment)

1867
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,620
"I should live a long life to see Jae Seok for a long time."

1868
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,490
- Goodness. - Thank you.

1869
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:30,990
- Could we... - Yes?

1870
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:33,830
(The interview is in full swing.)

1871
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:33,900
We'll ask you a question. Could you come here for a moment?

1872
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,060
What is your name?

1873
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,770
My name is Jin Jo Pyeong.

1874
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,500
- Oh, Jin... - Jo Pyeong.

1875
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,540
Jin Jo Pyeong.

1876
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,800
You have a unique name.

1877
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,140
- I'm the only one in Korea. - Gosh, that's cool.

1878
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:44,570
(Jin Jo Pyeong)

1879
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:48,510
(He's the one and only Jin Jo Pyeong.)

1880
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,480
Jin Jo Pyeong.

1881
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,010
- In Korea... Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.

1882
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:50,480
Is there only one person named Jo Pyeong?

1883
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,480
Just one.

1884
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,180
- Then, are you... - Someone bet me 1,000 dollars...

1885
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,920
to find someone else with my name,

1886
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:59,560
(He even made a bet of 1,000 dollars.)

1887
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,450
but it's not even in the phone book.

1888
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,950
Back in the day?

1889
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:02,690
Even when you search online, it's just me.

1890
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:03,960
There's one other person in China.

1891
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,230
- At Beijing University. - No way.

1892
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:06,400
- At Beijing University? - Yes.

1893
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:09,930
(Mr. Jin Jo Pyeong doesn't seem like the culprit.)
But you even looked up that person at Beijing University.

1894
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,770
- Of course. - Just the two of you in the world?

1895
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,070
- Gosh, that's fascinating. - And only you in Korea?

1896
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:14,170
- That's amazing. Jin Jo Pyeong. - That's right.

1897
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:15,200
By the way,

1898
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,370
it seems like you're pretty high up at your job. Am I right?

1899
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,740
I work in the design and industrial planning industry...

1900
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,740
as a CEO.

1901
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,150
- He's the CEO. - He runs the place.

1902
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,010
- Of course. - He's the CEO.

1903
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:28,180
(Will he answer without hesitation just like how he talked?)

1904
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:28,250
He hasn't eaten anything and went to work out instead.

1905
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,850
- Let us first ask him. - Sure.

1906
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,290
- Take a look at this photo. - Right.

1907
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:38,560
(He should say, "Paris in summer.")

1908
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:32,420
Make sure the question is right.

1909
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,460
- We'll ask you a question. - That's right.

1910
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,620
- Just answer it. - Look at the photo...

1911
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,130
- and give us your answer. - Right.

1912
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,890
- Answer the question. - The question.

1913
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,760
Yes, answer the question correctly.

1914
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,130
- The photo... - Please pay attention to the words.

1915
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:44,930
The photo is quite hectic.

1916
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:46,940
The photo is quite hectic.

1917
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,200
- Hold on. - Goodness.

1918
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,210
(Laughing)

1919
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,610
- That's not what we're asking. - It's not like that.

1920
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:52,540
- That's... - That's not what we're asking.

1921
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,210
(The Parisians are perplexed.)

1922
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,880
It's not like that.

1923
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,010
- We'll ask the question. - The building is familiar.

1924
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:59,750
- Gosh, no. - The building is familiar.

1925
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,150
Gosh, no.

1926
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:03,950
(He knows the cathedral!)

1927
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:02,690
- Oh, dear. - That has nothing to do with it.

1928
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,620
- Of course. - On your way to the gym...

1929
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,360
Feel the vibe of the photo.

1930
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:06,720
(That's not what it's about.)

1931
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,290
- That could happen. - We'll ask a question.

1932
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:10,130
- Listen to the question carefully. - We'll...

1933
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,760
(He starts asking the same question.)

1934
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,960
- We'll ask the question. - Sure.

1935
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,000
- All right. - Here it is.

1936
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,500
We are traveling abroad.

1937
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,770
- This is that photo. - I see.
(Realizing)

1938
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:21,270
- When and where was this taken? - When and where was this taken?

1939
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,370
- The photo. - When and where?

1940
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:24,970
You only need to guess when and where.

1941
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:26,640
When? Our tops are short-sleeved.

1942
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,080
- In August. - Yes?

1943
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,310
- In August. - Yes?

1944
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:30,750
- In the summer. - Right.

1945
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:31,750
In the summer?

1946
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,780
(He said "Summer!")

1947
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:33,420
In the summer?

1948
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:40,160
(Will he say "Paris" as well?)

1949
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,650
- Where? - Where could we be?

1950
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,220
- Where is this? - Where were we?

1951
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,490
- Where is this? - Where were we?

1952
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,390
(He noticed it was summer. He should say it's Paris.)

1953
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,490
- Where? - Where could we be?

1954
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:44,230
- Where is this? - Where were we?

1955
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,460
- Well, Seoul... - We're traveling abroad!

1956
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,430
- We're traveling abroad! - We're overseas!

1957
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,570
(He will never say it's Seoul now.)

1958
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,770
- We're overseas. - It's a foreign country.

1959
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,100
- You traveled to Paris. - Yes.

1960
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,470
(Noticing)

1961
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,540
- You traveled to Paris. - Yes.

1962
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,040
All right.

1963
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,610
- Can you make it a sentence? - Yes, make it a sentence.

1964
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,150
You guessed when this was taken.

1965
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,780
(Hinting)

1966
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,410
- It was August. - August is...

1967
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,280
- When was it again? August. - August.

1968
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,280
- That's summer. - Yes!

1969
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,450
- Can you put them together? - Please say it in one sentence.

1970
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:18,390
(The final answer)

1971
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:12,590
Ready, go.

1972
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,890
In August, so in the summer,

1973
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:17,660
the seven of you went to Paris.

1974
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,560
- In the summer, - Summer...

1975
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,260
the seven of you went to Paris.

1976
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,270
(The mission is completed!)

1977
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,540
- Go, sir! - Nice!

1978
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:28,940
(They made it at the first try with a little trick.)

1979
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,100
- Jin Jo Pyeong! - Jin Jo Pyeong!

1980
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,470
- Jin Jo Pyeong. - Jin Jo Pyeong.

1981
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,140
(Shout, "Jin Jo Pyeong.")

1982
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:31,840
- You're the best. - Jin Jo Pyeong!

1983
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,880
- That was clever of you. - That wasn't easy.

1984
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,740
- You were so clever. - Jin Jo Pyeong!

1985
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,510
We didn't consider that someone who works around here...

1986
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,020
- could know... - Of course he knew.

1987
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,250
He knew the building.

1988
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,190
- That was clever of him. - I once taught there.

1989
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:45,590
- Is that so? - That's how I knew.

1990
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:49,090
(The 1st destination is ticked off after 2 hours and 20 minutes!)

1991
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:46,720
- Goodness. - Today...

1992
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,320
Your trip to Paris was successful.

1993
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:56,000
(Paris in Summer: Success)

1994
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,330
It's now time to see where you'll travel to next.

1995
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:52,490
- Will he choose for us? - Yes.

1996
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:53,900
- Please draw one for them. - Go ahead.

1997
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,900
- Mr. Jin, can you pick one for us? - Right.

1998
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,430
- There you go. - Mr. Jin, my gosh.

1999
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:02,200
(He got it right at once. Will he pick an easy destination as well?)

2000
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,340
That was quick of you.

2001
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,600
- No wonder he's a CEO. - Please open it.

2002
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,240
(What's the second travel destination?)

2003
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,470
Where will it be?

2004
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,910
Where will it be?

2005
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,150
"Hong Kong on Christmas Eve."

2006
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,010
Congratulations. Have a safe trip.

2007
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:14,420
"Hong Kong on Christmas Eve." Congratulations.

2008
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,290
(Merry Christmas!)

2009
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,420
Have a safe trip.

2010
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,960
- Jin Jo Pyeong! - Jin Jo Pyeong!

2011
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,290
It's like going from 0 to 100.

2012
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,130
Christmas Eve. That's in winter.

2013
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:26,260
The travel destination he chose for you...

2014
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,260
(Paris)

2015
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,830
(They should find a place that resembles Hong Kong in Seoul...)

2016
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,330
is Hong Kong on Christmas Eve.

2017
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,770
(and take a picture that looks like it's taken on Christmas Eve.)

2018
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:30,070
Please find Hong Kong in Seoul...

2019
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:32,030
- and take a photo. - Does a place like that exist?

2020
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,840
It's Christmas Eve.

2021
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,840
- Hong Kong's an easy one. - There are places.

2022
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,040
- We can go to Yongsan. - There are many options.

2023
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,540
- Let's eat at a Chinese restaurant. - Right.

2024
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:38,970
- Let's go. - That's a great idea.

2025
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,140
- Mr. Jin. - Yes?

2026
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,210
- Thank you for your assistance. - Thank you!

2027
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,080
Aren't you at least getting me a bowl of jjajangmyeon?

2028
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,250
- Thank you. - Be happy, sir.

2029
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:49,690
(They happily say goodbye to the cheerful gentleman.)

2030
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,180
- Thank you. - Jin Jo Pyeong!

2031
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,450
- Jin Jo Pyeong! - Jin Jo Pyeong!

2032
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:50,850
- Have a great day. - Thank you.

2033
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:52,190
- He's so cool. - He's admirable.

2034
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,860
I was deeply touched by him.

2035
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,460
People like him give us strength.

2036
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,490
- You should live a long life too. - That I should.

2037
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,330
- He was quick to read the cues. - For me to live long,

2038
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:01,730
- Seok Jin must live long as well. - Of course.

2039
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:02,930
- Us all. - You too, Jong Kook.

2040
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:04,770
(They suddenly wish for their longevity.)

2041
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,030
- Absolutely. - We should all live long.

2042
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,070
We should all be healthy.

2043
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:06,270
Hold on.

2044
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:07,840
When were you going to let that baguette go?

2045
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,200
- She ate it all. - Wait.

2046
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,610
(She almost finished the baguette.)

2047
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,370
- Who loses weight like that? - I can't believe you.

2048
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:12,710
You successfully completed...

2049
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:16,750
(There are only two destinations left now!)

2050
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,110
- your first trip. - Right.

2051
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:16,380
You have two more destinations to travel to.

2052
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,010
- For it to be a success, - We must hurry.

2053
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,250
- you must get it done in six hours. - Let's hurry.

2054
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,750
- Two and a half hours have passed. - No way.

2055
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:22,850
- We must hurry. - So...

2056
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:25,450
Since buying new clothes can take too much time,

2057
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:26,860
we'll provide you...

2058
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:29,860
(She suggests they use the staff chance.)

2059
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,220
- with a staff chance. - Sure.

2060
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,990
You can either go to a chosen location...

2061
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,490
(1. They can use a place booked by the staff members.)

2062
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,660
- or use the props we have. - Nice!

2063
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:36,500
(2. They can use a prop car.)

2064
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,830
- Props. - Props.

2065
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:37,530
- For every time we help you, - We can decide on a location.

2066
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,900
you will pay with 20 minutes of your time.

2067
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,100
That'll still save us time.

2068
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,470
- We don't have time to shop. - That'll be faster.

2069
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:46,310
(They think it's better to use the staff chance.)

2070
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:44,570
There are many places we can go.

2071
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:45,870
- But... - Especially since it's Hong Kong.

2072
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,110
- Okay. - Okay.

2073
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:49,310
(They have a bathroom break before moving.)

2074
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:48,480
Are you handing out our clothes?

2075
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,780
- I'll keep yours here. - The plain T-shirt.

2076
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,780
(They're organizing the clothes they bought earlier.)

2077
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,180
Where are the socks?

2078
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,920
(A plain black T-shirt)

2079
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,680
- Right. Let's hand them out. - I'll hand you yours.

2080
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,920
- My socks. - Right.

2081
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:58,920
- Is that long-sleeved? - It is.

2082
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:00,460
(Another plain black T-shirt)

2083
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,220
- Okay. Keep it there. - Is it a plain sweatshirt?

2084
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,860
If it has nothing on it, it's mine.

2085
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:04,760
If you wear clothes that have no design features,

2086
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,560
you don't have to worry about what to wear.

2087
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,430
(Another black one)

2088
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,630
It makes your life easier.

2089
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,430
You don't have to think about what to wear tomorrow.

2090
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:10,500
You're right.

2091
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,670
Is this yours too?

2092
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:12,940
Yes, the T-shirt is also mine.

2093
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,100
(Black)

2094
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,340
- It's soft. - I know.

2095
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,340
Why am I only pulling out the same kind of clothes?

2096
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,340
- The gray pants are also mine. - All of them.

2097
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,640
- Are these yours? - Yes.

2098
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:23,480
(Steve Jobs in Running Man collected all his clothes.)

2099
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,140
- Nice. - They're all yours.

2100
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,650
For your information, this is the only place...

2101
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:26,680
- you can go through the prop truck. - Really?

2102
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,020
(The prop car is waiting right next to it.)

2103
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,750
- If you want to use the props, - Let's go.

2104
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:31,790
(20 minutes of prop car usage time have been deducted.)

2105
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,920
- you must search for items here. - We'll go through it.

2106
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,350
Even in December, Hong Kong...

2107
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:34,090
- It's not as cold there. - is still warm.

2108
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:37,160
(The lowest temperature in Hong Kong in December is around 16℃.)

2109
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:35,860
- Clothes won't matter. - We can wear anything.

2110
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,560
Their winters aren't snowy like ours.

2111
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,000
To make it seem like Christmas,

2112
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:42,260
(Seok Sam's opinion)

2113
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,170
- you know what we need. - A tree.

2114
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,270
(Let's get Christmas items without getting changed.)

2115
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:45,070
- Right. - Green and red.

2116
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:47,300
Santa, Rudolph,

2117
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,040
- antlers... - A tree.

2118
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,140
Don't forget that it's Christmas Eve and not Christmas Day.

2119
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,480
- What do you mean? - Yes, it's Christmas Eve.

2120
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:58,180
(The theme of the picture: Hong Kong on Christmas Eve)

2121
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,580
- Is it Christmas Eve? - That's right.

2122
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,010
- How can we express that? - How about a calendar?

2123
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:59,650
Should we point to a calendar?

2124
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:00,920
Here's what I think.

2125
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,750
- We can buy a cake, - Right.

2126
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,920
- and make it look like a party. - On the 24th?

2127
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:08,060
(Jae Seok's opinion)

2128
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,720
- With candles reading 24? - Yes.

2129
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,320
- We'll stick 24 on it. - The number 24.

2130
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:12,130
(Let's show it's Christmas Eve with number candles.)

2131
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,130
- That'll be our clue. - We'll use the cake...

2132
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,660
- rather than making it obvious. - The number 24.

2133
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,660
- So let's buy a cake. - I love that idea.

2134
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,730
- Isn't it great? - Right?

2135
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,330
- A Christmas cake. - It's perfect.

2136
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,770
- You now have to go... - Right.

2137
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:19,400
(They should decide on the place.)

2138
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:17,830
- to the next location. - Sure.

2139
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,170
Is there a place you have in mind?

2140
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:20,970
Restaurants serving Hong Kong cuisine...

2141
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,600
- look like Hong Kong. - They have everything.

2142
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,540
- They look authentic these days. - I agree.

2143
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:28,240
(Their destination is a nearby Hong Kong restaurant.)

2144
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,210
- Go to a Hong Kong restaurant. - These days,

2145
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,410
- in Seoul... - There are many.

2146
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:28,610
- How they're decorated... - There are many.

2147
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:30,680
The staff will have to help us...

2148
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:34,780
(They'll use the staff chance instead of searching!)

2149
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,810
- The staff chance. - book a restaurant...

2150
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,680
- for us to use. - That's right.

2151
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,020
- You're using our props... - Sure.

2152
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:38,550
(As they used the chance to use the prop car and the place,)

2153
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,590
and going to the restaurant we booked in advance.

2154
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:41,560
(40 minutes have been deducted from the time limit.)

2155
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:40,060
In total, I'll deduct 40 minutes.

2156
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,460
- Sounds good. - Let's hurry.

2157
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,190
- Let's go. - I can't wait.

2158
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,730
(They have 2 hours and 50 minutes left.)

2159
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:44,990
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2160
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,730
Hey, we're in Hong Kong!

2161
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,260
- No way. - We're in Hong Kong.

2162
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,770
(Even the sign reminds them of Hong Kong.)

2163
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,930
- This is Hong Kong. - My gosh.

2164
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:54,340
(Walking along the street that looks like a backstreet in Hong Kong,)

2165
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:52,930
Guys, this is Hong Kong.

2166
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,470
- What? - This is Hong Kong for real.

2167
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:55,840
This really is Hong Kong.

2168
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,110
(little Hong Kong in Seoul unfolds before them.)

2169
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,110
- It's Hong Kong. - No way.

2170
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:59,740
- It has that vibe. - We're in Hong Kong.

2171
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,640
I can already smell it.

2172
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,250
(The fancy neon signs...)

2173
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,380
- Is this Hong Kong? - Check this out.

2174
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:07,020
(turn this place into the night streets of Hong Kong.)

2175
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,650
It's Hong Kong!

2176
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,020
- This is Hong Kong. - We're in Hong Kong.

2177
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,450
Here. This looks like Hong Kong too.

2178
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:10,950
(You can enjoy the night view of Seoul...)

2179
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,590
- We're in Hong Kong. - This is also Hong Kong.

2180
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:14,060
(as if you're in Hong Kong, the city that never sleeps.)

2181
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:13,590
It'll look incredible at night.

2182
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:16,490
- The night view will be incredible. - We should come back here.

2183
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,630
(Hong Kong-dong in Seoul is already famous among Gen Z.)

2184
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,230
- The night view will be incredible. - We should come back here.

2185
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,930
(How will they take a picture...)

2186
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,130
- We should come here again. - Ye Eun, look.

2187
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:22,900
- The night view will be crazy. - Ye Eun, no way.

2188
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:24,400
(like they're in Hong Kong on Christmas Eve?)

2189
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,770
The stairs look exactly like those in Hong Kong.

2190
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,100
My gosh. No way!

2191
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:28,600
(What welcomes Jae Seok inside...)

2192
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,440
My gosh. No way!

2193
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,110
Check this out. I'm reminded of Chow Yun Fat.

2194
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,480
(is a red telephone booth like the one in "A Better Tomorrow.")

2195
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:34,080
- Gosh, Chow Yun Fat. - Yes, Chow Yun Fat!

2196
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,240
Gosh, Chow Yun Fat.

2197
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,480
Is the boss here?

2198
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,410
Boss.

2199
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:41,020
I miss Chow Yun Fat.

2200
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:42,580
It's just as nice on the inside.

2201
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,420
- This is just as good. - Because it's winter?

2202
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,220
Check out this shutter door.

2203
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,890
Let's take one outside...

2204
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:49,290
(Including the roller shutter you can see at night markets,)

2205
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:49,690
- and also one inside. - But it's winter.

2206
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,130
(everything you see here reminds you of Hong Kong.)

2207
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:50,660
Why don't we take a shot...

2208
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,830
where there are many Chinese characters?

2209
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:53,900
Sure. That's a good idea.

2210
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,730
- This is nice. - I like it here.

2211
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,530
(A photo spot with many Chinese characters)

2212
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,330
- Isn't this perfect? - This is great.

2213
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:59,400
- This is the place. - It looks just like Hong Kong!

2214
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,700
I love this spot.

2215
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,040
- Isn't it decent? - We can sit here...

2216
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,710
and take the photo diagonally.

2217
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,440
(Like a night market)

2218
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:04,970
- Nice. - It should be Christmas.

2219
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,440
- This is Hong Kong. - Check it out from here.

2220
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,910
(Excited)

2221
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,710
- It's Hong Kong. - I feel like I'm in Hong Kong.

2222
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,150
(They're motivated by the place that looks legitimate.)

2223
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,580
- This is Hong Kong. - The six of us can sit here.

2224
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,580
That's right.

2225
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,950
No one would imagine that this was taken in Korea.

2226
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,680
No one will guess that.

2227
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,690
I'm in Hong Kong just like that.

2228
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,050
I'm in Hong Kong.

2229
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,990
- Look. I'm in Hong Kong. - That's a nice photo.

2230
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:21,990
(Writer)

2231
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,190
Right? All the Chinese characters should show.

2232
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:24,060
(It looks quite real.)

2233
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,890
It's pretty.

2234
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,760
It's nice.

2235
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:33,700
(It seems he's really in Hong Kong.)

2236
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,530
It's really nice.

2237
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,840
- Jong Kook, how's this? - What?

2238
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:39,240
The people in the back will be partying...

2239
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:42,980
(Haha is thinking about the composition of the picture.)

2240
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,910
while one takes center stage.

2241
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,080
- What do you think? - Can you move...

2242
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:46,880
(Not interested)

2243
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,080
so I can take a photo?

2244
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,650
Seriously?

2245
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,580
Jong Kook.

2246
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,120
(While Kook Jong is taking pictures for himself,)

2247
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,080
- Yes? - We're not here to take photos.

2248
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,950
I know, but check this out.

2249
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:52,190
No way.

2250
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:53,960
This place is incredible.

2251
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:56,890
(they're looking at the menu inside.)

2252
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,460
- No way. - What?

2253
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,730
Ji Hyo, look.

2254
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:57,860
Let's eat first.

2255
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:00,660
Let's eat, gather some...

2256
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,530
(They have around 2 hours and 30 minutes left!)

2257
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,500
- of our ideas, and take it. - Sure.

2258
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,830
Everyone must order...

2259
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:05,670
(They're going to eat lunch while they're here.)

2260
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:05,070
- one noodle dish each. - Right.

2261
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:08,100
Why don't we also order 2 to 3 main dishes?

2262
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:07,840
(She can't take her eyes off it.)

2263
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:09,840
- Sure. - Sweet and sour pork...

2264
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,640
- and Dongpo pork. - That sounds great.

2265
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,040
Where should we eat?

2266
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,750
(They order quickly and decide to eat outside.)

2267
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,480
I want to sit outside.

2268
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,380
Let's eat outside since we have nice weather.

2269
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,380
I really believed I was in Hong Kong.

2270
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,880
It looks like Hong Kong.

2271
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,680
We need to make it feel like Christmas Eve.

2272
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:23,690
(It looks like Hong Kong now.)

2273
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,350
We have the hairbands and stuff. If we wear those,

2274
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:26,590
(They can portray it with the props they brought.)

2275
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:26,290
- it'll feel like Christmas. - Right, like Rudolph and stuff.

2276
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,960
- Here comes the food. - Thank you.

2277
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,060
(The dishes are served 1 by 1.)

2278
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,060
That was so quick.

2279
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,160
Thank you.

2280
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,560
- That was so quick. - Goodness.
(Exclaiming)

2281
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,230
- It was so fast. What is it? - What is this?

2282
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:35,900
(The new food fighter is excited to see the food.)

2283
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:36,400
But seriously...

2284
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,830
(Ecstatic)

2285
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:39,030
- Ji Ye Eun is so annoying. - Goodness.

2286
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,170
- Whenever there is food... - No.

2287
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:44,210
(The dieter goes crazy whenever she sees food.)

2288
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:42,470
You should just not go on a diet.

2289
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:44,370
- No, my diet... - Ye Eun, earlier,

2290
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:45,870
- you almost ate the whole baguette. - No.

2291
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,080
- Will you please listen to my idea? - Oh, the smell!

2292
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,480
Yes.

2293
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,180
- Will you please listen to my idea? - All right.

2294
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:53,520
(Director Ha wants to brief them on the theme before they eat.)

2295
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,580
- Yes, your idea. - Tell us.

2296
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,650
Hey, what are you...

2297
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,750
We could go like this. Like the photo the staff took...

2298
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:58,350
(Disorderly)

2299
00:57:56,750 --> 00:58:00,190
Gosh, it's Dongpo pork, right?

2300
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:01,220
(Not interested)

2301
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:01,960
It's Dongpo pork.

2302
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,730
- Will you please listen to my idea? - It's Dongpo pork.

2303
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,860
- This is insane! - It's Dongpo pork.

2304
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:07,630
(She can't hear anything.)

2305
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:06,900
You should eat that one.

2306
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,330
- I have to take a picture. - The Dongpo pork looks amazing.

2307
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:10,230
(The food is getting all their attention.)

2308
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:09,560
- I have to take a picture. - The Dongpo pork looks great.

2309
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,530
- So, Haha says... - Yes?

2310
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,900
- What's this? - Sweet and sour pork!

2311
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,270
It's sweet and sour pork.

2312
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:16,470
- Fried rice! - Fried rice and Dongpa pork.

2313
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:18,340
- Why are all the dishes over there? - This is insane!

2314
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,710
Please give Ji Ye Eun a warning.

2315
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,880
Whenever a new dish comes out, she goes, "Sweet and sour pork!"

2316
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,980
(Upset)

2317
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,910
Dongpa pork.

2318
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,580
Will you please take a photo with my composition?

2319
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:29,320
(Trying again)

2320
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,320
- Hey, Haha, why won't you talk? - What did you say?

2321
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,420
- Will you allow that? - Allow what?

2322
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,920
- Everyone, if we... - It's Dongpo pork.

2323
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,450
put a cake here with December 24 on it,

2324
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:33,990
(He finally starts briefing them.)

2325
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:33,990
- it won't show well. - Okay.

2326
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:37,390
- A Christmas tree in the back. - Yes.

2327
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:40,230
We could act like we're decorating for a party.

2328
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:41,400
- I'm sorry, but... - Let's just eat for now!

2329
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,430
(Cutting in)

2330
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,630
Just eat!

2331
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:44,570
- Let's just eat for now! - Just eat!

2332
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:45,930
Just sit down.

2333
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,370
(Boiling with anger)

2334
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:47,540
Just shut your mouth and eat.

2335
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:51,710
(It's not a good time for announcement.)

2336
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,800
Seriously, what are you doing?

2337
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,340
Gosh, this looks good.

2338
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:53,810
No one will listen to me.

2339
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:55,210
The sweet and sour pork looks good too.

2340
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:56,650
- Gosh, this looks good. - Let's eat.

2341
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:59,410
(What are today's dishes that made them forget about the mission?)

2342
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:57,910
The Dongpo pork looks good too.

2343
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,480
Shall I try the Dongpo pork?

2344
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:01,520
It's Dongpo pork!

2345
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,520
You can cut it.

2346
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,620
- The Dongpo pork looks amazing. - The Dongpo pork looks great.

2347
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,420
(Dongpo pork that is cut easily)

2348
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:08,620
- What is this? - Sweet and sour pork!

2349
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,860
(Sweet and sour pork Ddochi goes crazy over)

2350
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,060
What's this? Is this chicken?

2351
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,230
(Dry chili chicken with a generous amount of cumin)

2352
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,130
- It's fried rice! - Fried rice.

2353
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:13,760
(Egg fried rice)

2354
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:13,760
Gosh, this looks delicious.

2355
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:15,130
- It literally... - I'll cut it up.

2356
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:18,030
smells like a restaurant in Hong Kong.

2357
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:21,600
- I'll try the Dongpo pork. - I won't have to go to Hong Kong.

2358
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,700
(He tries the Dongpo pork first.)

2359
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,700
The Dongpo pork is so good.

2360
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,940
- This is... - My gosh!

2361
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,980
- The Dongpo pork is good, right? - Yes.

2362
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:28,380
This place makes it well.

2363
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,650
- Gosh, the bok choy is... - It's so good.

2364
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:33,580
(The bok choy is cooked nicely.)

2365
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,180
The Dongpo pork is so good.

2366
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,220
(More food is served.)

2367
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,290
Is there more?

2368
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,290
- Beef noodles! - Here it comes.

2369
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:42,320
Beef noodles!

2370
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:46,360
(A dopamine rush)

2371
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:45,490
What are you doing?

2372
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:47,630
Why is she even on a diet?

2373
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:48,900
Are you even on a diet?

2374
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,330
- Jjajangmyeon! - Is there jjajangmyeon?

2375
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:53,030
- I'll mix the jjajangmyeon. - What are you doing?

2376
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:53,940
(The jjajangmyeon that made Ddochi go crazy...)

2377
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:54,700
- It's not Korean jjajangmyeon. - What?

2378
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:58,210
(is Cantonese jjajangmyeon that is different from the Korean one.)

2379
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,710
- Is it Hong Kong jjajangmyeon? - It's not Korean jjajangmyeon.

2380
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:57,870
Yes, it's Hong Kong style.

2381
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:01,240
- Beef noodles! It looks so good. - Here it comes.

2382
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,640
(Beef noodles with a generous amount of meat)

2383
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,640
Hong Kong has beef noodles,

2384
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,750
Sichuan noodle soup, and jjajangmyeon.

2385
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,480
(Sichuan noodle soup that relieves stress)

2386
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,780
(The 3 best noodle dishes in Hong Kong)

2387
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:07,420
That's awesome. Running Man is so great.

2388
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,850
- Why is it great? - They give you good food.

2389
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:10,950
- Will you eat... - Hey, what's the difference...

2390
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:11,950
between you and me?

2391
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:13,890
- She's more of a beggar than you. - She's a beggar.

2392
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,790
(Ms. Free Meals is threatening Mr. Free Meals' position.)

2393
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:15,360
I lost my character.

2394
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:18,060
You should just work out.

2395
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:21,000
(Noodle lover Jae Seok tries the beef noodles first.)

2396
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,160
I am working out too.

2397
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,900
Then come on my show.

2398
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,030
- It's not that. She eats so much. - No, I don't.

2399
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,840
Gosh, the beef noodles!

2400
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,100
Why? Is it insane?

2401
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,540
- It's so good. - Okay.

2402
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,480
(Ye Eun tries the beef noodles Jae Seok recommended.)

2403
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:32,710
Should I try it?

2404
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,880
- Hey, this is the best. - My gosh!

2405
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,080
The beef noodles are the best, right?

2406
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,310
The Dongpo pork.

2407
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:39,480
(Hitting)

2408
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,020
- Why? - Is there only one left?

2409
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,750
(It's so good!)

2410
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,190
- Why? - It's so good.

2411
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:47,460
This is so good! The beef noodles.

2412
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,500
Gosh, what's this?

2413
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:55,730
(Jong Kook's favorite is spicy Sichuan noodle soup.)

2414
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:58,270
Gosh, Jong Kook is just...

2415
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:00,440
This is good.

2416
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,840
It's so delicious.

2417
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,040
Gosh, look at the noodles.

2418
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:07,980
(Staring)

2419
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:07,510
It's amazing.

2420
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:12,080
(Her eyes are fixed on his food.)

2421
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,680
- The noodles look so peculiar. - What should I do?

2422
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,680
The food here is...

2423
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,250
Jong Kook, is that malatang?

2424
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,950
- No, it's Sichuan noodle soup. - Sichuan noodle soup.

2425
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,420
Can I have a bite of that later?

2426
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,090
- It's right here. - You have one there!

2427
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:20,620
You don't eat other people's food.

2428
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,720
No!

2429
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,060
(She said she can't eat the food someone ate,)

2430
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,560
- You said you didn't share food. - I don't eat other people's food.

2431
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,260
(but she wants to try it.)

2432
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,390
You don't eat other people's food. What's wrong with you?

2433
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,930
Hey, this is beef knee cartilage.

2434
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:31,330
Beef knee cartilage? I love that stuff.

2435
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:35,300
(Automatically reacting to food)

2436
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:35,440
- Hey, she literally loves food. - I keep hearing...

2437
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,110
(Embarrassed)
Ji Ye Eun's voice through a filter.

2438
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,210
"Beef knee cartilage? I love that stuff."

2439
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:41,380
(Sounding like Zhu Bajie)

2440
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:41,480
- Ye Eun. - Yes?

2441
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,810
Ye Eun has such great reactions. I don't think she can lose weight.

2442
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:44,880
No, I'm losing weight.

2443
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,750
You should just work out.

2444
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:47,920
I am working out too.

2445
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,550
Seriously, she's talking back to Jong Kook every single time.

2446
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:51,190
(She always has the last word.)

2447
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:52,920
No...

2448
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,720
I thought Kang Hoon was the Retorter, but it's actually her.

2449
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,290
- No. - She's even worse.

2450
01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:58,330
Then, after...

2451
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:59,960
Hey, where are you going?

2452
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,400
(Peeking)

2453
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,130
Can I have the sweet and sour pork?

2454
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:03,400
- Yes, go ahead. - Eat it.

2455
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:05,670
(The new food fighter wants food on another table.)

2456
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:04,930
Take it.

2457
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,670
- Just take it. - Use my voice.

2458
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,770
"Can I have the sweet and sour pork?"

2459
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,340
- But you... - Use this voice instead.

2460
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:14,310
(The original version, the dubbed version)

2461
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,570
Can I have the sweet and sour pork?

2462
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:13,370
"Can I have the sweet and sour pork?"

2463
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:18,410
(Jiglet is on a diet where she eats a lot of food as always.)

2464
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:16,380
Ye Eun, are you sure you're on a diet?

2465
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,180
Yes, I'm on a diet right now.

2466
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:19,510
"I'm on a diet."

2467
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:21,020
(Having fun)

2468
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:21,520
- Intermittent fasting. - Shouldn't you not eat...

2469
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,920
I've lost my character.

2470
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:25,950
(As Haha isn't Mr. Free Meals anymore,)

2471
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:24,690
She has bigger feet than me too.

2472
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:26,220
It's so good.

2473
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:29,460
(he wants to call her Zhu Bajie.)

2474
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,360
"It's so good."

2475
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:30,960
By the way, Jong Kook, you look like you're in Hong Kong now.

2476
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:32,390
- Look behind you. - Seriously.

2477
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,260
- Really? - Yes.

2478
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,770
(He doesn't look out of place at all.)

2479
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,330
This is Hong Kong.

2480
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:37,270
- Seriously. And your outfit too. - Look behind you.

2481
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:39,100
And you usually dress like that when you go abroad.

2482
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,040
Right. I always dress like this.

2483
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,270
He thinks he might get into a fight when he goes abroad.

2484
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:47,210
(An outfit for overseas trips)

2485
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:45,710
- I dress simply. - Yes, simply.

2486
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,080
Really, people who are watching TV right now...

2487
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,150
Since we're wearing short-sleeve shirts, they might think,

2488
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:55,580
(They're enjoying shooting in Hong Kong in Seoul in November.)

2489
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,880
- Right. - "Did they go to Hong Kong?"

2490
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:53,880
"Is it an overseas special?"

2491
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,680
- I really think so. - Right.

2492
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:59,420
Ji Ye Eun, don't you want to go on an overseas trip with us?

2493
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:00,960
- I want to go. - How badly?

2494
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,460
- So much! - Then make some noise.

2495
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:06,130
(Screaming)

2496
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:09,030
(Her voice is hoarse.)

2497
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,500
What's wrong with your voice?

2498
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:11,200
- What's wrong with her voice? - What's up with your voice?

2499
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,770
Is someone tugging on your throat?

2500
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,840
It would be fun to go on a trip with Ye Eun.

2501
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,970
She likes to eat.

2502
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:18,210
I love to eat.

2503
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:21,080
Then, be honest. Can you eat with these on?

2504
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:22,880
Why?

2505
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,180
- Just because. - Because I'd look like Zhu Bajie?

2506
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:26,010
Hey, you catch on quickly.

2507
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:28,180
(She's quick-witted now.)

2508
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,920
- She's quick-witted. - I am quick-witted.

2509
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,450
Then, since you're quick-witted, try them on.

2510
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:35,720
What's up?

2511
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,360
What's up?

2512
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,390
(She's good!)

2513
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,560
Don't say anything and just eat.

2514
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:42,530
- Hey, you somehow look like him. - Keep eating.

2515
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,660
(She looks like Zhu Bajie even more with the beanie.)

2516
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,430
(Oink)

2517
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,930
Keep eating.

2518
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:50,340
Oh, that's delicious.

2519
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,370
Goodness!

2520
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:55,810
(He punishes him instead.)

2521
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:56,880
Stop teasing her!

2522
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,750
(The annoying 45-year-old is scolded for teasing her.)

2523
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,250
(Serves you right.)

2524
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:03,320
- I'm sorry. - Oh, no. Were you sad?

2525
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,620
(Apologizing suddenly)

2526
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,590
I'm sorry.

2527
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:07,620
Gosh, every week... Yes.

2528
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:10,460
(He learned what goes around comes around.)

2529
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:09,360
I just hope we don't cause any public disturbances.

2530
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:11,230
Love gets passed down, you know?

2531
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:12,960
- Yes. - Love gets passed down.

2532
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:14,560
I must've been hungry. I ate so much.
(Full)

2533
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:17,270
(Starting from Seok Sam, the light eater,)

2534
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,500
- What was your favorite? - The beef noodles.

2535
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,770
(they put down their chopsticks.)

2536
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,170
- Fried rice for me. - Mine was the Sichuan noodle soup.

2537
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:21,470
- The beef noodles for me. - The beef noodles were...

2538
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,040
(Mr. Free Meals has finished eating as well.)

2539
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,870
The viewers who watch carefully must know.

2540
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:27,880
(Kim Muscles is eating until the end...)

2541
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,610
(probably because he'll work out after the shoot.)

2542
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:33,410
(And Ye Eun, the food fighter,)

2543
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:38,450
(is eating as well.)

2544
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,590
Ye Eun, eat your fill.

2545
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:38,690
Right, eat your fill.

2546
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:39,790
It's so chewy.

2547
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:41,290
(Laughing)

2548
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,390
- It's so delicious. - The food here is great.

2549
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:48,130
(The two of them keep eating until the end.)

2550
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:45,730
- This jjajangmyeon is good too. - It's so good.

2551
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:47,660
I'm watching who wins now.

2552
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:50,730
The last ones with their chopsticks in hand are Ye Eun and Jong Kook.

2553
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,770
- Gosh, that's amazing. - I'm done.

2554
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:53,330
(Neck and neck)

2555
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:56,040
She had about two-thirds of the baguette.

2556
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:56,870
(The new food fighter is catching up with him.)

2557
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,110
It's so good.

2558
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:00,380
She had about two-thirds of the baguette.

2559
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,340
(At that moment,)

2560
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:02,510
(Jong Kook wipes his lips after he's done eating.)

2561
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:02,380
- Look at her double chin. - Seriously.

2562
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,610
It's so delicious.

2563
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,750
(How about Ye Eun?)

2564
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:05,910
- Seok Jin must've really liked it. - Yes.

2565
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,650
(Getting up)
- You really ate a lot. - Ye Eun.

2566
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:09,920
- Ye Eun. - The sweet and sour pork.

2567
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,520
- Where are you going? - Just take it!

2568
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:14,290
(I'm still hungry.)

2569
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,920
- The sweet and sour pork. - No.

2570
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,220
Just take it.

2571
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,720
(Ye Eun wins an overwhelming victory.)

2572
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,130
- Just eat all of it. - Stop eating the... Hey.

2573
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:19,230
I worked so hard to create my Mr. Free Meals character.

2574
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:21,630
- Hey. - Ye Eun.

2575
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,260
(He finds something.)

2576
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:23,670
There is the most food around your seat.

2577
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:24,700
You call this a diet?

2578
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,900
The dishes are surrounding you.

2579
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:28,170
(The plates are gathered in front of her.)

2580
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:28,940
It's not that.

2581
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,710
What's the most delicious dish here?

2582
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,880
- The sweet and sour pork? - The beef noodles.

2583
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:33,740
(Almost throwing up the food)

2584
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,140
That's the best.

2585
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:38,410
(She's pressing the food in her throat with sweet and sour pork.)

2586
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,880
It's nice to see you enjoying your food, Ye Eun.

2587
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,080
- Gosh, I sat in the wrong spot. - Why?

2588
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,250
My back is so hot.

2589
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,580
(The sun is bright.)

2590
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:43,450
It's really hot now.

2591
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:44,950
Will Ye Eun switch seats if I ask her to?

2592
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:46,520
- It's meaningless now. - Right?

2593
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,060
- Yes, it's meaningless. - But should I at least ask?

2594
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:49,360
Sure, go ahead.

2595
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:54,260
(Meanwhile, Ye Eun is busy eating.)

2596
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,060
What did you grab?

2597
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,060
The pork rind.

2598
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:55,900
Ye Eun, sit here and eat.

2599
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:57,670
- No, I'm fine. - Don't sit over there.

2600
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,330
(He suggests she sit under the sunlight.)

2601
01:05:57,670 --> 01:05:59,170
Seok Jin, stop acting like you're being generous.

2602
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:00,670
You're just trying to avoid the sun.

2603
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,200
- How did you know? - You were...

2604
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,340
- Really? - Come on.

2605
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,110
(He's immediately caught.)

2606
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:06,570
- My back is so hot, I might die. - The sun is shining...

2607
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:07,810
You should sit here and eat, Ye Eun.

2608
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,740
(Not giving up)

2609
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:09,740
- My back would get hot... - Just sit there if I tell you to.

2610
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:10,750
(Laughing)
This is so nice.

2611
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,680
Ye Eun, this seat has lots of food to eat. Sit here.

2612
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,150
(He tries to persuade her with food.)

2613
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,190
Hurry. Just sit there if I tell you to! Please!

2614
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:18,590
(Yelling)

2615
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:18,690
Okay. Just a moment.

2616
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:20,050
- You're just scolding her. - Okay.

2617
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:22,060
- Sit here. - I'm just kidding.

2618
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:23,290
What does that make me?

2619
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,990
- Become something. - Fine.

2620
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:26,230
- "Become something." - Her shoulder...

2621
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,430
(She gives him her seat while holding the beef noodles.)

2622
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:27,230
- "Become something?" - You practically...

2623
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:28,830
pulled her by her shoulder.

2624
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:30,730
I was just kidding.

2625
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,770
(He feels uncomfortable as they switched seats.)

2626
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:32,430
You're going to sit anyway. Just sit down.

2627
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:33,570
No, it's not that.

2628
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:35,100
- I... - Traveling is all about food.

2629
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,110
- Ye Eun, I think... - Work out after you eat, kid.

2630
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:40,810
(Timid)

2631
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:38,540
- I'll get chewed out. Go back. - I'm full,

2632
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:39,570
- Why? - but I can't stop my chopsticks.

2633
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,080
- There's a lot here. - This is so good.

2634
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:46,480
(He has taken his seat.)

2635
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,480
This is so good.

2636
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,780
(Sighing)

2637
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:50,920
Hey, the guy who just sat down. Get up.

2638
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,550
Quickly.

2639
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:55,190
Honestly, I didn't sit there because I thought I might get cursed out.

2640
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:56,190
But if you sit there,

2641
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:58,990
I'll get cursed out, but you'll reap the benefits.

2642
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,930
(Cackling)

2643
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:02,260
That makes me very angry, okay?

2644
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:04,030
- Get up right now. - Come on, Seok Jin.

2645
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:05,070
- I should sit there. - Seok Jin!

2646
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:06,100
Come here.

2647
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,170
Sit here.

2648
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,870
Hey. His seat is a dangerous one.

2649
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:10,200
(Jae Seok offers his seat.)

2650
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:10,940
Sit.

2651
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,210
He has lots of fans.

2652
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:14,110
(Laughing)

2653
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:16,610
There is no chair.

2654
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:17,910
Did you take the chair?

2655
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,480
- His seat is a dangerous one. - Sit.

2656
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:21,680
(Jae Seok took the chair.)

2657
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,080
He has many fans.

2658
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,350
(It even hit Seok Jin's hand.)

2659
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,690
There's no chair.

2660
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:27,090
(He was blatantly fooled today as always.)

2661
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:25,850
Did he take the chair?

2662
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:27,560
I can't believe him.

2663
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,560
(The root of Seok Jin's annoyance, the mischievous Jae Seok)

2664
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:32,260
It's annoying. But if I get angry,

2665
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:34,230
I'll appear petty. Isn't that right?

2666
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,430
(Shouting)

2667
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:37,570
I can do that, right?

2668
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:38,900
It's allowed, right?

2669
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:39,530
(Shouting)

2670
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:40,030
Gosh, Yu Jae Seok!

2671
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:41,770
Gosh, Yu Jae Seok!

2672
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:43,840
- Seok Jin, stop it. - A noise complaint.

2673
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,340
- They will make a noise complaint. - Will I get scolded for the noise?

2674
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:47,110
Is there anything I can do on a Korean variety show?

2675
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:49,380
(He suddenly speaks up for himself.)

2676
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,710
- You're being loud. - I can't do anything.

2677
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:49,980
Jae Seok,

2678
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:51,580
I think we should take Ye Eun's chopsticks away.

2679
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:52,580
- Why? - Hey!

2680
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:53,750
- Ye Eun. - She's eating so much.

2681
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,680
- Ye Eun, stop eating. - I don't like leaving food behind.

2682
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,190
- Ye Eun eats so much. - Ye Eun.

2683
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,720
(In the end, Ddochi finished everything.)

2684
01:07:58,290 --> 01:07:59,690
- It's so tasty. - It's so tasty.

2685
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:00,860
- Let's take a photo. - Next.

2686
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:03,090
(They have less than 2 hours left!)

2687
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:01,860
- Come here. - We don't have much time.

2688
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:02,860
- Let's buy a cake. - It's too...

2689
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,460
- Let's hurry up and take a photo. - We need to hurry up.

2690
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:05,630
(The theme of the picture is Hong Kong on Christmas Eve.)

2691
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:05,560
- Let's go. - That's right.

2692
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,860
- All right, Ye Eun. - All right.

2693
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:09,400
(They should hurry up to complete the mission.)

2694
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,260
Put a tree here...

2695
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,560
- and pretend to decorate it. - Okay.

2696
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,170
It'll be nice to turn this sign into a tree.

2697
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:14,540
- Good thinking. That's a good idea. - Right?

2698
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,840
The person who wins in rock-paper-scissors...

2699
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:19,040
(Haha leads the photoshoot.)

2700
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,340
will hold up a cake that says December 24...

2701
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,770
- and take a selfie here. - Okay.

2702
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:21,710
- Why is he acting up? - A cake that says December 24...

2703
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:22,780
- Why is he acting up? - Hold on.

2704
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:25,210
- Mister. - You can ignore those in the back.

2705
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:27,780
(They can't stand him acting like a leader.)

2706
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:26,780
- Mister, why are you acting up? - Why are you acting up?

2707
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,880
Who put you in charge?

2708
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,780
- I'm so stressed out today. - Who do you think you are?

2709
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:30,990
Who put you in charge?

2710
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:33,450
I led the group so far.

2711
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:35,960
I'm the actual leader.

2712
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,630
- No, you aren't. - I bought you this top.

2713
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:39,690
(Childish)

2714
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:39,790
- I'm thankful for that. - We can do this.

2715
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:41,860
- I'm thankful for that, but I... - As for this beanie,

2716
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:44,200
(They're bickering when they don't have time.)

2717
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,700
you got it for free since I spent over 30 dollars.

2718
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:47,000
- You need to change your mindset. - Excuse me.

2719
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,340
- Is this wig too much for a party? - It's too much.

2720
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,640
Excuse me. Is this wig...

2721
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,440
(The theme of the picture: Hong Kong on Christmas Eve)

2722
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,010
- too much for a party? - It's too much.

2723
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,570
(The clown came to the wrong place.)

2724
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:53,210
- It isn't too much. - It isn't too much, right?

2725
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:54,240
- It's perfect for a party. - I love it.

2726
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:55,740
(We don't have time. Just go!)

2727
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,440
Stand at the very back.

2728
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:56,880
- Hurry up and do it. - It suits you.

2729
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,280
- I'm Rudolph. I don't want it. - Don't you want it?

2730
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:59,610
(They stop fighting briefly...)

2731
01:08:58,410 --> 01:08:59,750
I'll be cute Rudolph.

2732
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:04,720
(and work on the Christmas decorations.)

2733
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,480
Hold up the gift boxes.

2734
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:03,990
Hang it here. There you go.

2735
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:05,450
- It's nice. Well done. - We're done.

2736
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:07,160
This completes the decorations. Hey.

2737
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,090
(They use the number candles to make 24 for the Christmas Eve.)

2738
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,690
This completes the decorations.

2739
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,320
Is it famous?

2740
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:12,430
Seriously.

2741
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:14,000
- Seok Jin, I'm sorry, - Right?

2742
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,460
but you should take off your wig.

2743
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:17,500
You stand out too much.

2744
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:19,330
(Standing out too much)

2745
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,200
- It suits the party. - No, it doesn't. It looks strange.

2746
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,340
- It overshadows everything. - Seriously.

2747
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:24,540
(The clown is kicked out in the end.)

2748
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:22,870
If it's too much... All right.

2749
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:24,870
- Let's hold the cake at the front. - Come on.

2750
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:27,210
- Today, the main character is... - Okay.

2751
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,040
- Seok Jin. - Okay.

2752
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,250
- Twenty-four. - Twenty-four should be visible.

2753
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,410
Show the number, 24.

2754
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:34,780
Seok Jin's birthday isn't December 24. Why does he get to...

2755
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:36,380
(Attacking)

2756
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,950
It isn't a birthday cake, but a Christmas cake.

2757
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,490
(Mad)

2758
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:40,620
Why are you acting like it's your birthday?

2759
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:42,820
(Bickering)

2760
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:41,790
Are you stupid?

2761
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:43,690
- You shouldn't be in the middle. - No.

2762
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:44,990
(Trying to mediate)

2763
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:44,960
- You should be at a corner. - Yes.

2764
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:46,690
Who are you to order me around?

2765
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:48,960
(Since earlier)

2766
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:48,800
I'm the one who is fixing all the problems.

2767
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,500
- For goodness' sake. - Which problems have you fixed?

2768
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,330
Listen, everyone. I'm the main character today.

2769
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,970
(A big misunderstanding)

2770
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:54,770
Mister, get lost.

2771
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:55,770
- Stand here. - Okay.

2772
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:59,570
(They have many opinions, and the photoshoot isn't progressing.)

2773
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:57,070
Stand at a corner like this.

2774
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:59,170
Then people in the back won't be visible.

2775
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:00,410
That's why we need to come up with a good angle.

2776
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:01,780
- Hold on. Listen. - I...

2777
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:02,880
Let's do this.

2778
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:05,780
Those who are popular in Hong Kong should stand in the middle.

2779
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:08,250
- I'm Mala Tang Wei. - In Hong Kong...

2780
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:09,350
That's right. Go ahead.

2781
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:10,790
- I'm Mala Tang Wei. - Go ahead.

2782
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,290
- Mala Tang Wei. - Let's decide by popularity.

2783
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:14,620
- Ji Hyo is popular abroad. - Ji Hyo is popular abroad.

2784
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:13,960
(Ye Eun and Ji Hyo who are the most popular outside Korea...)

2785
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,420
(are in the center.)

2786
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,120
- Smile cutely at the camera. - All set.

2787
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:19,030
(They're finally ready to take a photo.)

2788
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,130
- Jae Seok, where will you stand? - That's good.

2789
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,490
Move out of the way. Come on.

2790
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:22,200
(It rarely snows in Hong Kong, but he suddenly sprays fake snow,)

2791
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:22,830
Move out of the way. Come on.

2792
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:25,030
- For goodness' sake! Come on! - The tree is the main item.

2793
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:26,230
(It got on him.)

2794
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:27,840
Why did you spray it on my face?

2795
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:30,340
(Arguing for the 2nd time)

2796
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,270
Don't get angry.

2797
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:30,710
Seriously, don't get angry.

2798
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:32,370
- It's Christmas, after all. - Let's try it.

2799
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:33,840
Why are you holding this?

2800
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:34,910
It's a gift.

2801
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:35,940
(Serious)

2802
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,710
It'll be better to put it there.

2803
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:42,580
(They catch him for holding an empty box.)

2804
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,780
- Seok Jin, it looks so fake. - It's a gift.

2805
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:43,350
- It looks so fake. - I'll hold this instead. Satisfied?

2806
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:44,350
(Replacing it with a bigger box)

2807
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:45,250
Seok Jin, it doesn't seem like Hong Kong.

2808
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,520
It doesn't seem like Hong Kong.

2809
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:47,920
- The background should be included. - The background should be included.

2810
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,320
- It doesn't seem like Hong Kong. - Move to the back.

2811
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,960
Move to the back so that we can have a full shot.

2812
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:52,460
Stick to the wall.

2813
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:55,500
(They stick to the wall to make the background stand out.)

2814
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,790
- Come to the front. - Stick to the wall.

2815
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:55,500
Let's try it. Let me see how it looks.

2816
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,830
The street should be included.

2817
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:00,170
(They manage to compose the photograph after a long argument.)

2818
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:00,000
- The street should be included. - Okay.

2819
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,470
- There are Chinese characters. - Chinese characters. Good.

2820
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,900
Look over here.

2821
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,370
(The photoshoot finally begins.)

2822
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,010
Wake up!

2823
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:06,840
Shall we make 24 with our fingers?

2824
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:08,710
Hey, you need to count to three so that we can make the expression.

2825
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,540
(With all kinds of Christmas decorations...)

2826
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,610
This one looks natural.

2827
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:14,180
(and number 24 that hints that it's Christmas Eve)

2828
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:11,750
- Really? - Yes.

2829
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:13,610
Does it look like we're in Hong Kong?

2830
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:15,080
- Totally. Take a look. - A cake photo.

2831
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,820
(What do the pictures look like...)
- There are Chinese characters. - We need Chinese characters.

2832
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,220
(with a background that looks like Hong Kong?)

2833
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:18,920
Take a look.

2834
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:20,090
- It's Hong Kong. - Hey.

2835
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:21,120
- Hey. It's Hong Kong. - It's Hong Kong.

2836
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:26,030
(The theme of the picture: Hong Kong on Christmas Eve)

2837
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,190
- It's Hong Kong. - Let's see.

2838
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:24,960
- It's Hong Kong. - It has that vibe.

2839
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,130
- Let's go with this one. - Yes. Let's go with this one.

2840
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:28,330
- It won't be easy, right? - You'll use this photo.

2841
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:30,500
- Okay. - You need to hear the answer,

2842
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,030
- "Hong Kong on Christmas Eve." - Hey.

2843
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:35,400
- Is 24 visible? - I think 24 is too small.

2844
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,340
- Jae Seok, when we show it, - Number 24 is only on the cake.

2845
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,440
why don't we go, "Look over here?"

2846
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,640
- Then we can zoom in. - "Look closely."

2847
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:43,380
(Zooming in himself)

2848
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,740
- We can do that. - Okay.

2849
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:43,110
- Let's do that. Let's use a tactic. - That's right.

2850
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:44,680
- Let's zoom in. - There's the zoom-in feature.

2851
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:45,750
- "Look closely." - No.

2852
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,920
(After the strategy preparation is complete,)

2853
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:47,080
- It's okay. - It's okay. Let's use this one.

2854
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,220
- Let's go. This will be the photo. - Let's go.

2855
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,250
(they go to interview people.)

2856
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:49,420
- Let's proceed. - Let's go.

2857
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:52,120
We should go down. We should go someplace far.

2858
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,250
Are we going this way?

2859
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,620
There's a staircase.

2860
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:58,490
(They're walking down the alley to find people.)

2861
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,120
Hurry up.

2862
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:58,330
All right.

2863
01:11:58,330 --> 01:12:00,860
- You know, - Each alley has many things to see.

2864
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,700
we need to be quiet since this is a residential area.

2865
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,830
Gosh, the alleys are pretty.

2866
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:08,670
There are so many pretty alleys here.

2867
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,670
(A quiet and cozy alley)

2868
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,210
Ye Eun's vlog.

2869
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:12,370
(Ye Eun's camera)

2870
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:13,070
- Don't shake it so much. - Vlog.

2871
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,180
(Ddochi is happy because she's full.)

2872
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:14,510
Hello.

2873
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,380
What are you doing today?

2874
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:17,850
(Trying to interview her)

2875
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:20,920
- We're near Changsin-dong now. - Okay.

2876
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:19,280
(Ye Eun's camera)

2877
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,650
We're going to show travel photos.

2878
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:24,920
What's up with your tone?

2879
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:27,290
There are...

2880
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:28,420
- so many pretty alleys here. - Donuts.

2881
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:29,790
- It's a cafe. - A donut cafe.

2882
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,790
You're right. Donuts.

2883
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:33,190
(There is a donut cafe in the alley.)

2884
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:33,330
Okay. Good.

2885
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:35,600
- Donuts? - Jae Seok.

2886
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:38,730
(She reacts to the dessert even though she has eaten a lot.)

2887
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:37,870
- Jae Seok. - In that case...

2888
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,000
- Only three people should enter. - Okay.

2889
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,900
We shouldn't send her in. She wants to eat again.

2890
01:12:42,970 --> 01:12:45,010
- People who are dressed the same... - She went, "Donuts?"

2891
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,570
Jae Seok, let's see how well Ye Eun can do.

2892
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:49,840
- I'm not in the photo, right? - That's right. Go alone.

2893
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,380
You should go. Go alone.

2894
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:52,910
(Jae Seok, who isn't in the picture,)

2895
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:52,550
Jae Seok do it alone.

2896
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:53,910
- Go with Ye Eun. - With me?

2897
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,380
(and Ye Eun will ask.)

2898
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,580
- Say, "Why don't you zoom in?" - We need to succeed in it.

2899
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,320
- Stress that it's an overseas trip. - That's right.

2900
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:02,120
(If they fail, more modifiers will be added.)
- "We're on an overseas trip." - That's right.

2901
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:04,290
- "We're on an overseas trip." - Ye Eun, go.
(Example: Hong Kong on Christmas Eve where G-DRAGON is shopping)

2902
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:08,300
(Will people say, "Hong Kong on Christmas Eve?")

2903
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:06,490
Please. We'll know by looking at their facial expressions...

2904
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:07,830
if it's a success or failure.

2905
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:12,370
(They enter the cafe.)

2906
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,170
Hello.

2907
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,700
(Surprised)

2908
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,870
Hello.

2909
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:16,840
- Hello. - Hello.

2910
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,040
- Please sit comfortably. - My goodness.

2911
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:19,910
- It's so nice. - Gosh.

2912
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:24,250
You're enjoying your time at a cafe, right?

2913
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,280
- Yes. - Yes.

2914
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:27,210
(He naturally approaches them while saying hi.)

2915
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:27,050
Would it be okay...

2916
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,280
- if we ask a question? - Sure.

2917
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,120
(Calm)

2918
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,250
We're on an overseas trip.

2919
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:32,950
- Yes. - Which country are you visiting?

2920
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,690
We're on an overseas trip.

2921
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:37,960
There's a photo from the overseas trip.

2922
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:43,730
(The theme of the picture: Hong Kong on Christmas Eve)

2923
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,990
- Please take a look. - Here.

2924
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:43,460
- Where and when was it taken? - When...

2925
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,170
- Where and when was it taken? - When...

2926
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:48,070
- was it taken? - Say, "Why don't you zoom in?"

2927
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:50,040
(He zooms in on the number candles as they strategized ahead of time.)

2928
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,710
- You see these things, right? - Yes.

2929
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,540
(A wall with Chinese characters that makes it look like Hong Kong)

2930
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:54,140
(Frowning to focus)
- When... - Where was the photo taken?

2931
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:56,740
As for when...

2932
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:00,750
(Ye Eun points to 24.)

2933
01:13:57,780 --> 01:13:59,080
When...

2934
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:01,180
When...

2935
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:03,220
- Don't point. - When was it taken?

2936
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,650
- You see these things, right? - When...

2937
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:07,890
(After showing 24, he zooms in on the Santa headband.)

2938
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:07,920
You see these things, right?

2939
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,960
(Did they understand the hints?)

2940
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,690
- You see these things, right? - When and where...

2941
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:12,960
- Please answer now. - Christmas.

2942
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,960
- That's right, but... - Christmas.

2943
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,330
- That's right, but... - Christmas.

2944
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:17,530
(Jae Seok interjects before she finishes answering.)

2945
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:17,830
- Please hold on. - Please hold on.

2946
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:19,830
(Is that not the answer?)

2947
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:19,330
Please look carefully.

2948
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:20,970
- Please hold on. - When...

2949
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:22,970
(It seems she noticed it's Christmas.)

2950
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:23,840
- Please look carefully first. - The details are there.

2951
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:27,410
(But she needs to say "Christmas Eve" exactly.)

2952
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,710
It isn't very difficult.

2953
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:27,740
Right here, you can see...

2954
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,180
Look.

2955
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:31,950
(He zooms in on 24 again.)

2956
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:33,480
Here.

2957
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,850
(Thinking hard)

2958
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:38,090
(You know now, right?)

2959
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:39,220
Here.

2960
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:40,750
- December 24. - December 24.

2961
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:42,290
(They answer at the same time.)

2962
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:43,460
- December 24. - December 24.

2963
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:46,760
(They got the Christmas Eve part right!)

2964
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:46,360
Now...

2965
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,130
Hurry up and ask the question.

2966
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:51,000
(If they say Hong Kong, the mission will be completed.)

2967
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:50,360
The question is when and where.

2968
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:51,670
It seems like...

2969
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:54,000
- you found out when it was taken... - That's right.

2970
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,840
- even though we kept quiet. - That's right.

2971
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,240
- Okay. - Now,

2972
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,510
- what's important is where. - Where...

2973
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:01,380
(The location is what matters now.)

2974
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:01,540
- I'll ask the question. - Okay.

2975
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:05,780
(The theme of the picture: Hong Kong on Christmas Eve)

2976
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,280
We're on an overseas trip.

2977
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,750
When and where was this photo taken?

2978
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:07,480
(Will they get the location right?)

2979
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,620
- What's important is where. - The details are there.

2980
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:12,450
- I'll ask the question. - Okay.

2981
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:13,390
(They noticed it's Christmas Eve!)

2982
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:14,220
We're on an overseas trip.

2983
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:16,960
(They need to say it's Hong Kong now!)

2984
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,460
When and where was this photo taken?

2985
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:20,490
- What's important is where. - The details are there.

2986
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:23,830
(Will they get the exact answer?)

2987
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:23,660
When and where was this photo taken?

2988
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:31,210
It looks like a photo that was taken in Hong Kong on December 24.

2989
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:35,680
(She figured it was Hong Kong!)

2990
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,540
It's correct.

2991
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,040
- Yes. - You succeeded in...

2992
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,510
- the second trip to Hong Kong. - Thank you.

2993
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:38,950
Thank you.

2994
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:41,450
(Their second trip has ended thanks to the witty ladies.)

2995
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:41,220
- Thank you. - Thank you. Take care.

2996
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:42,980
She figured it out right away.

2997
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:46,620
(Shameless)

2998
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,650
- How did she know from the photo? - I know.

2999
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,490
- She's so witty. - How... You're incredible.

3000
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,290
It's definitely Hong Kong, right?

3001
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:50,390
- Yes. - Yes.

3002
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:51,530
- Thank you. - Do you know this place?

3003
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:53,130
- I've been there. - I see.

3004
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,360
She figured it out right away.

3005
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,830
- What? Hey! - Thank you.

3006
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:58,730
- Hold on. He sounds cheerful. - Are they done?

3007
01:15:58,730 --> 01:16:00,830
- Are you guys done? What happened? - He sounds cheerful.

3008
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:03,200
(Confident)

3009
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,200
- No way. - How did you pull it off?

3010
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,410
Success!

3011
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:05,870
- How did you pull it off? - Really?

3012
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:10,040
(They barely made it with a little trick.)

3013
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:06,870
- Seriously. - How did you do it?

3014
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:08,040
- How did you do it? - Did someone say the answer?

3015
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,180
- Seriously. - Hong Kong on December 24.

3016
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:11,250
- What acted as clues? - We showed the photo like this.

3017
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:12,350
- That's incredible. - We did that.

3018
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:13,580
How did this person know that it was Hong Kong?

3019
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:15,080
- You showed the details. - She got the Hong Kong part right.

3020
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,280
She has been there.

3021
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:16,850
(Lucky)

3022
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,420
- You showed the details. - It must be a part of her routine.

3023
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:20,250
(They're on a lucky streak with 2 consecutive successes so far.)

3024
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,120
- It must be a part of her routine. - That's incredible.

3025
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:22,620
- Well done. - Now, you need to succeed in...

3026
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:24,660
(Only the last destination is left!)

3027
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,460
the last travel destination.

3028
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:26,330
- Okay. - One hour and a half remains.

3029
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:28,700
(They do not have much time.)

3030
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:28,300
- We need to hurry up. - Succeed in it during that time.

3031
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:29,700
- Pick one. - If it's someplace close,

3032
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:30,730
we can eat a dessert.

3033
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:32,000
- I hope it's someplace close. - A dessert.

3034
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,700
- If it's someplace close... - Seok Jin, pick one.

3035
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,370
(They pick the last concept.)

3036
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:34,800
- Go ahead. - I haven't picked one before.

3037
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,840
- He has good energy. - Let it be Hongdae.

3038
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:38,270
(What will the last destination be?)

3039
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,540
- Open that one. - Okay.

3040
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,040
I hope it's someplace close.

3041
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:40,240
(He picked it.)

3042
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,210
- It's a bit far. - Wouldn't Itaewon be the best?

3043
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:41,780
- LA that Kim Jong Kook... - LA that Kim Jong Kook loves.

3044
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,550
(LA that Kim Jong Kook loves)

3045
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:43,180
A burger place.

3046
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:44,380
We have many options for LA.

3047
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,280
The concept for the next trip is...

3048
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:47,750
(LA that Kim Jong Kook loves)

3049
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,050
LA that Kim Jong Kook loves.

3050
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:49,880
(The last destination is LA, USA.)

3051
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:52,320
(It's famous as the center of the film industry, Hollywood...)

3052
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,390
(and the world's vacation spot.)

3053
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:56,820
(The third travel destination, the celestial city, LA)

3054
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,930
As you probably guessed, I chose LA.

3055
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:01,000
It's the sky of LA.
(He visits LA like it's his home.)

3056
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,730
There's the LA crew. All my close friends are in LA.
(Jong Kook's love for LA is well-known.)

3057
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:07,000
(Did Jong Kook's daughter go to UCLA?)

3058
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:04,900
All right.

3059
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,100
This is accurate.

3060
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,400
Jong Kook's child!

3061
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:09,700
Christina!

3062
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:14,380
(There's even a rumor of him having a daughter in LA.)

3063
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:13,040
- He went along with it. - She's in high school.

3064
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,140
Christina!

3065
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:16,880
- LA that Kim Jong Kook... - LA that Kim Jong Kook loves.

3066
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:22,580
(LA that Kim Jong Kook loves)

3067
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:19,750
- A burger place. - We have many options for LA.

3068
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:21,650
It'll be hard to show that it's a city...

3069
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:23,120
- Jong Kook loves. - Jong Kook.

3070
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,590
- No, Seok Jin. We can cry... - You have a point.

3071
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:27,250
(The modifier is even more difficult.)

3072
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:25,950
while Jong Kook smiles.

3073
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:27,320
- We can cry. - Listen.

3074
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,660
We can hang our heads while wearing a hat that says LA.

3075
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:32,430
Jong Kook will have his head up...

3076
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:34,600
- and make a happy face. - That's a very strange idea.

3077
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:37,230
- Mister, why are you acting up? - Seriously.

3078
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:39,670
(Se Chan steps in again to keep him from acting up.)

3079
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:40,030
- Bo Sung. - Bo Sung!

3080
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:42,140
(Sighing)

3081
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,570
What's wrong with him?

3082
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,540
- Wasn't it a perfect idea? - Haha, are you the leader?

3083
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,510
- Is he the leader? - What's wrong with him?

3084
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:48,210
(Teasing)

3085
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:47,910
- Wasn't it a perfect idea? - Haha, are you the leader?

3086
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,380
- Mister, who are you? - Your style is so old.

3087
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:50,880
- Which time period is it from? - How will you take a photo then?

3088
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,050
- They'll stop if you say sorry. - A burger place would be the best.

3089
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:54,420
(Familiar)

3090
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:53,180
- Just wrap it up that way. - A burger place.

3091
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:54,350
- A burger place. - A burger place.

3092
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:55,450
- I keep giving ideas. - I mean,

3093
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:57,580
(Ha Bo Sung has to fight against 6 all day.)

3094
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:56,920
other things that are associated with LA...

3095
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,790
Shall we talk someplace else?

3096
01:17:58,390 --> 01:18:01,420
(They get out of the alley and go to the main street.)

3097
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:00,720
Let's go up this way.

3098
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:01,890
- Okay. - Are you okay?

3099
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:03,420
- What? - You must be upset...

3100
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:04,430
since you gave an idea.

3101
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:05,990
- It's okay. - I'm sorry, Haha.

3102
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:08,000
I couldn't side with you due to my position.

3103
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:11,100
(Bitter)

3104
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:10,100
In LA...

3105
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:12,970
- Hey, when Haha gives an idea... - Yes?

3106
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:14,170
- later on, - Okay.

3107
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:16,570
let's go, "That's a great idea."

3108
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:18,040
- Okay. - Haha, you can depend on...

3109
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:20,210
(Loyalty!)

3110
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,770
- the younger members. - In that case...

3111
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:21,210
Let's support Haha as the younger members.

3112
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:24,240
(The youngest members form an alliance with Ha Bo Sung.)

3113
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:23,080
- Yes. We're the new generation. - Where will we get LA hats?

3114
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,880
There must be many places with the LA vibe.

3115
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:25,910
LA?

3116
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,380
Hey, look. Isn't it pretty, Jong Kook?

3117
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:29,580
- It's pretty. - It's so pretty.

3118
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:30,850
- Ginkgo. - What a nice building.

3119
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:34,820
(It is the perfect place for their concept meeting.)

3120
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:31,950
- Ginkgo. - How pretty.

3121
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:34,120
- Let's have a talk here. - That's a good idea.

3122
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,620
How nice.

3123
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:38,030
Share your idea. I'll recommend it then.

3124
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:39,590
Let's talk over there.

3125
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:41,860
- Let's cross our arms. - Let's do that.

3126
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,830
- One, two, three. Cross! - Cross!

3127
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:46,300
(The alliance promotes their loyalty once more.)

3128
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,330
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

3129
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:47,130
- This place is nice. - My goodness.

3130
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:48,840
This place doesn't have the LA vibe.

3131
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:51,570
- There's a janggi board. - This is hanok.

3132
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:54,740
- We came here to talk. - This isn't LA.

3133
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:54,710
(They have a short meeting at the hanok pavilion...)

3134
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:58,110
(before heading to LA.)

3135
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,380
- Okay. - Isn't this place pretty?

3136
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:57,610
- Yes. - It's so pretty.

3137
01:18:57,610 --> 01:18:58,750
- My goodness. - Still...

3138
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,280
Let's talk in the pavilion.

3139
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:03,080
(They decide to choose their concept before moving.)

3140
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,980
This concept is difficult. Isn't it difficult?

3141
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:02,980
- It's difficult. - LA.

3142
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:05,090
- All right. Let's hear from Haha. - All right.

3143
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:07,990
Let's buy an LA hat.

3144
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:08,520
(He finally gets to speak.)

3145
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:11,790
Let's go to a cafe with the vibe of LA, the US.

3146
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:11,020
(Haha's idea: 1. Buy an LA hat.)

3147
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:14,500
(2. Go into an American-style cafe.)

3148
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:13,030
While we hang our heads,

3149
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:15,200
Jong Kook can stand at the front and take a selfie.

3150
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:19,230
(3. Only Jong Kook will pose happily.)

3151
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,860
- Haha. - Then he can make a heart.

3152
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:18,700
- "I love LA." Okay? - Hey.

3153
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,230
- Listen. - Like this.

3154
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:23,700
(He states his opinion, with the alliance on his side.)

3155
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:22,000
- Haha. - LA. This is how you do it.

3156
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,470
- LA. - Haha.

3157
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:25,370
- LA. See? - It's a bad idea.

3158
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:26,640
- Haha, it's a bad idea. - It won't be easy to guess.

3159
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:29,380
- When we had Paris... - What?

3160
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:30,580
What's up with you guys?

3161
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:31,950
(Their loyalty is thrown away.)

3162
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:32,550
You guys were supposed to support me.

3163
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:34,410
It's a terrible idea.

3164
01:19:34,410 --> 01:19:35,880
I voiced my opinion because of you guys.

3165
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:38,290
I'm sorry, but are the three of you KOYOTE?

3166
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:40,390
Are the three of you KOYOTE?

3167
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:45,530
Jae Seok, she's By 100.

3168
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:47,130
- She's By 100. He's Shinji. - By 100.

3169
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:49,000
- Is she By 100? - I'm Kim Jong Min.

3170
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,500
- I see. - By 100.

3171
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,670
- She's By 100. - She's By 100.

3172
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,830
(Everyone agrees.)

3173
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:53,800
- I knew it. - Yes.

3174
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,200
- She'll be By 100 with a beanie. - Hey.

3175
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,570
- She's By 100. - Yes.

3176
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:59,840
(Fake By 100, the team's tallest member)

3177
01:19:58,570 --> 01:19:59,870
- She really looks like By 100. - By 100.

3178
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:01,780
While Haha's opinion is good...

3179
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:04,010
(And another opinion is disregarded...)

3180
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:04,210
- LA hats... - Ji Hyo, what are you doing?

3181
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:05,410
While Haha's opinion is good...

3182
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:07,750
- LA hats... - Ji Hyo, what are you doing?

3183
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,090
What is she doing?

3184
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:13,220
(Ginkgo nut attack)

3185
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:13,820
- It's a ginkgo fruit. - Hey.

3186
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:15,520
(Gagging)

3187
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:15,820
She stepped on a ginkgo fruit.

3188
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:17,190
Why did you shove a ginkgo fruit...

3189
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:19,930
- What was that? - She put it up his nostril.

3190
01:20:19,930 --> 01:20:22,130
- Ji Hyo. - Why did you shove it...

3191
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:23,130
(The smell of autumn attacked him out of the blue.)

3192
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,530
I stepped on a ginkgo fruit on my way here.

3193
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:26,870
- Why did you... - It smelled so bad.

3194
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:29,170
Why did you shove it at my nose?

3195
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:29,700
(I get it, but...)

3196
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:30,500
- What's wrong with you? - Seriously.

3197
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,840
(She didn't want to smell it on her own.)

3198
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:33,170
I stepped on a ginkgo fruit, and it smelled so bad.

3199
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:35,610
- Ji Hyo smells so bad. - Seriously.

3200
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:36,180
(The ginkgo nut smell)

3201
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:37,740
Please add a smoke using computer graphics.

3202
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,780
- I'm not lying. It exploded. - My goodness.

3203
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:42,580
- Ji Hyo's feet stink. - It'll last for a while.

3204
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:43,620
Really?

3205
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:45,250
(Shouting)

3206
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:46,650
(Screaming)

3207
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:47,250
Really?

3208
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:49,290
(He has a super chemical weapon on.)

3209
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,930
(He lost his sense of smell.)

3210
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,490
- Ji Hyo... - Just now,

3211
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:54,330
(Attacking again)

3212
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:55,600
she stepped on a potent ginkgo fruit.

3213
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:57,660
(The ginkgo nut terrorist goes wild.)

3214
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,230
- It'll... - It's no joke.

3215
01:20:57,230 --> 01:20:59,970
- Ji Hyo. - It'll make men fall out of love.

3216
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:01,540
- The smell hit me. - The smell is no joke, right?

3217
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:02,570
Ji Hyo, don't move.

3218
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:03,700
I don't think I can be in the same car as her.

3219
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:05,870
(Stinking)

3220
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,570
- The fruits are very potent now. - I...

3221
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:07,370
- It's no joke. I got a cramp. - Seriously.

3222
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:10,040
- The fruit exploded under my shoe. - The fruit.

3223
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:11,380
(The ginkgo nut attack ends.)

3224
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,380
Some people should dress...

3225
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:14,080
(They go back to the meeting.)

3226
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:13,380
- like they're in LA. - Okay.

3227
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,850
- They should wear the LA hats. - Yes.

3228
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,150
(Jae Seok's idea: Wear the LA hats.)

3229
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:16,720
- They should wear the LA hats. - Okay. Purchase the LA hats.

3230
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,950
Okay. Purchase the LA hats.

3231
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:19,890
(It was Haha's idea.)

3232
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:23,120
But it won't be easy to show the part, "Kim Jong Kook loves."

3233
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,360
- Jong Kook, you should show... - "I love you."

3234
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:27,190
(Se Chan's idea: Only Jong Kook should look like he's enjoying it.)

3235
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,830
- that you're happy. - Why don't you do this alone?

3236
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:28,660
Why don't you do this alone?

3237
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:30,660
(It was Haha's idea again.)

3238
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:30,160
I gave the same idea.

3239
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,970
Here's the important question. Which place has the LA vibe?

3240
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,840
(Next is a place that feels like LA.)

3241
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:35,540
You know, LA has...

3242
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:37,340
- famous beaches. - That's right.

3243
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:39,240
- Santa Monica Beach. - Yes.

3244
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,780
- Why don't you go topless? - Venice Beach.

3245
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:43,840
(Like a beach)

3246
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:43,440
- That's a good idea. - Come on.

3247
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,880
- My body is too pale. - Jong Kook, take a marker...

3248
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,410
- and draw a heart on your body. - Just be quiet.

3249
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:48,880
- Write LA with a heart. - That's a good idea.

3250
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:50,580
- Just be quiet. - Write LA...

3251
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:52,220
- That's a good idea. - Just be quiet.

3252
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:54,390
- Draw a heart. - Mom, be quiet.

3253
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:56,090
- Son, listen to me. - Mom, be quiet.

3254
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:57,890
- Listen to me. - Mom.

3255
01:21:56,820 --> 01:22:01,630
(Ji Hyo adds to everything.)

3256
01:21:57,890 --> 01:21:59,330
- Gosh, Mom. - Son.

3257
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:01,300
- They have nice ad-libs. - You can draw a heart...

3258
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,700
- around LA. - Stop it, Mom.

3259
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:04,600
- It's impossible. - You looked up that cafe earlier.

3260
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,630
- The two of you did. - What?

3261
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:06,630
- Everyone. - Near this place...

3262
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:07,670
- Is there a cafe? - There is...

3263
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:08,700
There's a cafe nearby.

3264
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,900
- It's a ten-minute walk from here. - What is it?

3265
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,510
- A cafe. - It's totally...

3266
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,140
Haha, this place is nice.

3267
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:15,710
(On the way to the pavilion,)

3268
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:16,380
Haha, it's like the US.

3269
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:19,250
(they searched for American-style cafes.)

3270
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:18,050
Yes.

3271
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:19,380
This place is incredible.

3272
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:21,110
- I found a place earlier. - Really?

3273
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:22,920
- Haha doesn't know. - Okay.

3274
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,250
- I do. - Do you know?

3275
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:25,590
- Hey. - What?

3276
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:27,620
(He cuts off Haha.)

3277
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:27,290
We saw it together on our way here.

3278
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:29,020
You... What's up with you guys?

3279
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:32,430
(Dumbfounded)

3280
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:31,790
- I... - You said that you'd side with me.

3281
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:33,530
- You act up too much. - Hey.

3282
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:34,530
(Laughing)

3283
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:36,130
You wanted to take over as the younger generation.

3284
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:39,030
You guys will regret this.

3285
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,330
(They actually wanted to change Ha Bo Sung.)

3286
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:40,900
- The two of you. Okay. I... - What?

3287
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,700
Are you certain about the cafe?

3288
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:43,700
Yes, I am.

3289
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:45,070
- Is the vibe okay? - We can take a photo like this.

3290
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,870
(They choose the cafe that Se Chan picked.)

3291
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:46,640
- It's like the US. - Did you look it up online?

3292
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:47,770
- Yes. - Let's do this.

3293
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:50,080
One person should buy the LA hat while others wait at the cafe.

3294
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,610
- Do you want to go? - No.

3295
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,480
Why not? You said that one person should go.

3296
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:56,080
- I might have one in my car. - Yes.

3297
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:57,750
I think it's in my car.

3298
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:58,920
I might have one too.

3299
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,020
- Shall I ask? - Make a call.

3300
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:01,490
- It'll be faster that way. - Ju Eun.

3301
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:03,990
(He checks with the stylist.)

3302
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,930
Is there an LA hat in the car?

3303
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:10,500
(They can settle with the prop if he has the LA hat.)

3304
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,690
Please check.

3305
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:09,100
Look for the ones the members can wear. The LA hats.

3306
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,470
So it looks like we need to buy a hat.

3307
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:13,670
- Okay. - If you guys have it, we can go.

3308
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:15,340
(Team Cafe and Team Props)

3309
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:15,200
- If you guys don't, we can buy it. - That's right.

3310
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,640
- I... - Let's split up.

3311
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:17,840
(They will divide teams and move.)

3312
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:17,700
- I was going to say that. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

3313
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:18,870
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper...

3314
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:20,840
The 3 on that side and the 3 on this side...

3315
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,080
- There are four on this side. - Four.

3316
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,110
The winners...

3317
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:25,750
- That's only fair. - I excluded myself.

3318
01:23:25,850 --> 01:23:27,680
- We should split the group. - Rock-paper-scissors.

3319
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,080
(They divide in half and play rock-paper-scissors.)

3320
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,120
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

3321
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,420
- The losers... - Rock-paper-scissors.

3322
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,090
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Scissors.

3323
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,120
- For goodness' sake. - Okay.

3324
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,920
(Seok Jin lost.)

3325
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,460
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

3326
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,990
(KOYOTE plays rock-paper-scissors.)

3327
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:37,690
- Okay. - Rock-paper-scissors.

3328
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:39,460
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

3329
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:41,860
(Ye Eun lost.)

3330
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:42,330
- Ye Eun. - Ye Eun got picked here.

3331
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:43,660
Seok Jin got picked here.

3332
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,900
Chungju's Jee and Ji, cross!

3333
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:47,470
(Both Jee and Ji get chosen.)

3334
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,600
- Jee and Ji. - Jee and Ji.

3335
01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:50,740
(They have no luck at all.)

3336
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,900
- Why did you lose? - Jee and Ji.

3337
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,210
- Seok Jin, you should go. - They're the weakest ones.

3338
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:53,870
(Hat Expedition: Seok Jin and Ye Eun)

3339
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:53,870
- Rock-paper-scissors. - They're the weakest ones.

3340
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,440
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

3341
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:58,050
(They divide teams and head off.)

3342
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,050
If there's a blue T-shirt, you should get it.

3343
01:23:58,110 --> 01:24:00,280
We just need two LA hats.

3344
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:01,180
(Ye Eun and Seok Jin move to find a hat store.)

3345
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:01,420
Let's hurry.

3346
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,850
(Will they be able to buy an LA hat in time?)

3347
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:03,150
We need to go to Itaewon.

3348
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:04,620
Gosh, let's hurry.

3349
01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:07,450
(Right then, he gets a call.)

3350
01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:05,890
Jae Seok.

3351
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:07,250
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

3352
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,990
We found two LA hats.

3353
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:12,790
(In the car)

3354
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:10,460
Just come to the LA cafe.

3355
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:12,260
Okay. That's good to hear.

3356
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:14,660
- Okay. - Okay. We'll be there.

3357
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:16,100
(Jae Seok found LA hats in his car.)

3358
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:15,660
Okay.

3359
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:17,660
He was very happy.

3360
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,370
(Laughing)

3361
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,330
- Of course. - He was cheerful.

3362
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,740
Seok Jin was very happy about not going.

3363
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:22,370
(They have 50 minutes left,)

3364
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:23,540
Okay. We're set. Let's go.

3365
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:26,640
(and they move to the cafe!)

3366
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:26,540
It looks like you're abroad if the signs are in English.

3367
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:27,710
Hi.

3368
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:28,380
(The hot sun...)

3369
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:29,180
- Hello. - How old are you?

3370
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:30,780
(and the hip attractions greet them.)

3371
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:30,880
I'm fine. Thank you. And you?

3372
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:34,180
(To the City of Angels, LA!)

3373
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:32,680
How old are you?

3374
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,120
Se Chan, is this the location of the cafe you found?

3375
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:40,420
Yes, Jae Seok. It has the American vibe. The sign...
(It is so Korean.)

3376
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:42,390
Let's see if it's LA.

3377
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:44,760
(The familiar LA is located in the middle of the alley.)

3378
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:44,420
- Long time, no see. - It's nice.

3379
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:45,990
- Is this the American vibe? - This is the place.

3380
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:48,530
- This isn't the American vibe. - The US...

3381
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:48,830
(Flustered)

3382
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:50,730
There's a bit of English.

3383
01:24:50,730 --> 01:24:53,530
I see. That's the vibe.

3384
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:55,540
(You can see English, but...)

3385
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,570
- This is the place. - Sebastian.

3386
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:59,410
- Sebastian! - What? Is this the US?

3387
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:01,940
- This isn't the American vibe. - This part...

3388
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:05,710
(Well...)

3389
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:03,710
- is a bit... - Okay. It's nice.

3390
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:05,610
- It's this direction. - This direction.

3391
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:07,450
- Here. - It's this direction.

3392
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:09,780
(It is more familiar than they thought.)

3393
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:09,920
- We should take it like this. - Is the bottom part more American?

3394
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,650
- Well... - There's more English.

3395
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:13,450
(But they don't have time to move to a different place...)

3396
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:13,150
Sit here. Let's check out the angle.

3397
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,590
- Here. - This place isn't bad.

3398
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:16,320
Ji Hyo, take a photo from there.

3399
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,590
Let's monitor it.

3400
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:18,630
- I'll take a photo. - Ji Hyo, take a photo from there.

3401
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,130
(They try to bring up the LA vibe.)

3402
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:19,990
Shall I put it at the front?

3403
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:21,160
- The hat says LA. - Here.

3404
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,360
- This isn't the LA vibe. - Put it here.

3405
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:25,670
(They try to set up an angle with Jong Kook's lead.)

3406
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,370
- Have you been to LA? - No.

3407
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:29,370
(Se Chan, who recommended the place, is taken aback.)

3408
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:27,970
Jae Seok, this was what I saw.

3409
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:29,340
I've never been to LA.

3410
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:31,840
- LA. - I can see "Makgeolli" on the back.

3411
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,870
- Take the photo well. - Let me see.

3412
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,880
(Makgeolli in LA?)

3413
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:36,940
Due to the signs...

3414
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,910
(Trying to ignore it)

3415
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,680
- It looks like we're abroad. - It feels like a foreign country.

3416
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,910
- Really? - English should be visible.

3417
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:41,450
Okay. Take a photo.

3418
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:43,480
(Checking the picture)

3419
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:42,580
- Look. - It doesn't work, right?

3420
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:43,720
Let's see. Is it LA?

3421
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:45,450
- I don't think so. - What do you mean?

3422
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:46,950
(Just a nearby cafe)

3423
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:46,890
- I don't think it's LA. - Have you been to LA?

3424
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,820
At a glance, it looks like we're in a foreign country.

3425
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:52,460
(Not sure)

3426
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:51,930
- It has that vibe. - It does look like a Korean cafe.

3427
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:53,590
Jae Seok, let's go downstairs for something more dramatic.

3428
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:55,200
- Shall we go downstairs? - Let's take a dramatic photo.

3429
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,660
- I think the downstairs is better. - It's better.

3430
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:58,800
(They move indoors, which they haven't seen yet.)

3431
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:58,470
- Let's go down. - Let's go downstairs.

3432
01:25:58,470 --> 01:25:59,470
Seriously.

3433
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:02,840
Gosh, is LA like this?

3434
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,170
(The concept is clear on the inside.)

3435
01:26:02,970 --> 01:26:04,500
- It's like LA. - Jae Seok.

3436
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:05,540
- It's the American vibe. - Hello.

3437
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:06,770
- This is it. - This place is...

3438
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,880
(Jong Kook approves of it.)

3439
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:07,870
- more like LA. - It's the real deal.

3440
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:09,840
I see American items.

3441
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,410
It's like LA here.

3442
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:13,580
(Little LA is inside the basement of the alley.)

3443
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:14,920
- Seriously. - My goodness.

3444
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:15,850
(There are cute props, which make it seem like...)

3445
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,380
- Hello. - Seriously.

3446
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:20,120
(they are in a supermarket in America.)

3447
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:18,080
It's LA.

3448
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,250
- Gosh. - There are magazines too.

3449
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,420
You're right.

3450
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:23,620
- This place is better. - Right?

3451
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,660
(Satisfied)

3452
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:26,090
- It's here. - This really looks like LA.

3453
01:26:26,190 --> 01:26:27,830
- Let's stand here. - We can sit here.

3454
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:30,130
(Photographer Yu checks the angle right away.)

3455
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:29,000
- Let's stand here. - Let's see how it looks.

3456
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,130
- Here, Jong Kook. - We can sit with the milkshakes.

3457
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:34,330
- We can sit here like this. - Wear the cap, Jong Kook.

3458
01:26:34,330 --> 01:26:35,470
Wear the LA hat and make a heart.

3459
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:36,470
Is this better or this?

3460
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:39,040
(The hat Jae Seok brought)

3461
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:38,370
- This is better. It's hard to see. - You can't see this.

3462
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:40,440
- Should I wear this? - Yes.

3463
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:42,210
(Jong Kook puts on the LA hat.)

3464
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:42,680
You can't see the letter.

3465
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:44,510
(Taking a photo in the meantime)

3466
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,180
I think it's a bit small.

3467
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:45,210
Look.

3468
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,420
It looks like you're shopping in the US.

3469
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,280
- Doesn't it look like that? - It does.

3470
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:52,720
(It looks like they're in LA.)

3471
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,380
It does.

3472
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:52,990
- It really looks like LA. - It does.

3473
01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:55,660
It's Jong Kook who loves LA.

3474
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:56,260
(They decide to take the photo here.)

3475
01:26:55,690 --> 01:26:56,990
But this cap...

3476
01:26:56,990 --> 01:27:00,160
doesn't give off the LA mood that much.

3477
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,700
- No. - Or...

3478
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,800
- get a T-shirt. - LA.

3479
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:07,600
Or write LA at the back. "I love LA."

3480
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,740
You said that was very unnatural.

3481
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:12,140
You said it was very stereotypical and unnatural.

3482
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:13,270
- Why are you suddenly saying that? - "I love LA."

3483
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,940
Not "I love."

3484
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:17,880
(Let's just put on the LA hat.)

3485
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:17,440
- Let's write LA here in blue. - Right.

3486
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,550
- Writing that is the same thing. - On my back...

3487
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:23,250
- Right here. - It's messy.

3488
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:24,920
(He was so against it, saying it's cheating.)

3489
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,650
Right.

3490
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:27,150
- When I suggested it earlier... - It's a good idea, Jae Seok.

3491
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:28,260
- It's good, right? - Yes.

3492
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,460
It's a good idea. Very good.

3493
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:33,830
(They reuse the "I Love LA" theme as they lack ideas.)

3494
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:32,990
That could be better. Go with "I love LA."

3495
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:35,100
Then you're using my earlier idea.

3496
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:38,900
(They write on a T-shirt again.)

3497
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,830
Do it. "I" and heart.

3498
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:38,230
I heart LA.

3499
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:39,700
It has to be emphasized.

3500
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:42,470
Love. Draw the red heart.

3501
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:44,370
Jong Kook really loves LA.

3502
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:46,010
- Of course. - It's true.

3503
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:47,870
- Write LA in thick letters. - Write it first.

3504
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:49,880
Making it pretty isn't important. We have to do it quickly.

3505
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,850
No. We should make it pretty still.

3506
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:53,350
That's right. It's done.

3507
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:55,380
(They're done reusing the idea.)

3508
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:54,880
What should we do?

3509
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:56,920
- Let's sleep. - That's nice.

3510
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:57,980
Put on an indifferent pose.

3511
01:27:57,450 --> 01:28:00,450
(Haha and Ji Hyo: They're bored of LA.)

3512
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:59,590
Ji Hyo and Haha are doing well.

3513
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:00,790
I'll be drinking this.

3514
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:03,320
(Seok Jin, Se Chan, Ye Eun: LA is their life.)

3515
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:02,190
Who ordered Americano?

3516
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:03,390
Let's go with an everyday life concept.

3517
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:06,290
(Ye Eun: Eating is her life.)

3518
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:04,460
We should drink Americano...

3519
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:06,290
- since we're in America. - That's right.

3520
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:07,430
- Everyone. - We have to do this well.

3521
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:10,160
(Photographer Yu will take the photo again.)

3522
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:10,360
Pose over there like you're overseas.

3523
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,000
We don't have time, right?

3524
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,730
You have 25 minutes left now.

3525
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:16,970
(They have less than 30 minutes.)

3526
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:16,040
We have to hurry.

3527
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,000
- Let's go. - Let's go.

3528
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:20,210
(They need to hurry to ask a question to a passerby.)

3529
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,710
- Let's quickly take the picture. - Let's go.

3530
01:28:19,710 --> 01:28:21,570
- Let's go. - Hey.

3531
01:28:20,370 --> 01:28:21,370
(The theme of the photo: LA that Kim Jong Kook loves)

3532
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:23,740
(The LA-lover Jong Kook is at the center.)

3533
01:28:21,570 --> 01:28:22,580
That's nice, Jong Kook.

3534
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,680
I don't like that.

3535
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:27,950
(Other than Jong Kook, the rest are LA-haters.)

3536
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:28,250
- Go to the side, Ye Eun. - Hollywood.

3537
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:29,280
- Yes. - That's right.

3538
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:30,650
Is your house in Hollywood?

3539
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:32,150
- Yes. My house... - Do it like this.

3540
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:33,950
- Jamwon? - Not Jamwon.

3541
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:35,960
- Not Jamwon? - I live in LA.

3542
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:37,660
(How will it look?)

3543
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,120
- It's done. - It's done.

3544
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,460
- Okay. - Let's check.

3545
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:40,530
Hey! It really looks like LA here.

3546
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:42,100
- That's true. - Yes.

3547
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:43,300
- It's not bad, right? - It looks like LA.

3548
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:44,930
- It looks like LA. - It really looks like LA.

3549
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:46,000
Yes. Let's see.

3550
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:50,400
(A photo with an LA vibe that looks like it's in the US)

3551
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
- It looks like LA. - Totally.

3552
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
- It looks like it was taken in LA. - It's LA.

3553
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,700
- Okay. - What question do we ask with this?

3554
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,510
- The question... - "We are traveling abroad."

3555
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:55,340
(The question they need to ask)

3556
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:54,140
"Where was this photo taken from?"

3557
01:28:54,140 --> 01:28:56,510
If you don't succeed in one go,

3558
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:58,180
- a modifier will be added, - We have to hurry.

3559
01:28:58,180 --> 01:28:59,850
and you have to shoot again.

3560
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:01,720
If you fail to do the mission within the given time,

3561
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:05,390
you will all get a very tough penalty.

3562
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:05,220
(Everyone will have to take the penalty.)

3563
01:29:05,390 --> 01:29:08,660
Today's penalty is touring the night view of Seoul...

3564
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:10,260
(Today's penalty: Night city tour of Seoul)

3565
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:10,190
since you traveled abroad all day.

3566
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:11,290
- No way. - We're almost there.

3567
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:13,160
(The worst penalty where they will have to spend 4 more hours)

3568
01:29:11,290 --> 01:29:12,490
- The picture came out so nicely. - We're almost there.

3569
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:14,930
- It looks so much like LA. - It's not "where" and "when."

3570
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:17,730
(The theme of the photo: LA that Kim Jong Kook loves)

3571
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:17,800
When people answer,

3572
01:29:17,730 --> 01:29:20,800
(As soon as they see it)

3573
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:21,100
they have to say, "LA that Kim Jong Kook loves."

3574
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:24,770
(The modifier, "loves" isn't easy to come up with.)

3575
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:23,700
They have to say that on their own. It's difficult.

3576
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:26,070
Jong Kook can go this time.

3577
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,370
- Me? - Jong Kook...

3578
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:28,740
- Jong Kook should go... - Go in this shirt.

3579
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:30,540
(With human LA, Jong Kook,)

3580
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,380
- You can pick one person. - Then...

3581
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:32,980
- Go with Ji Hyo. - Seok Sam is good at this.

3582
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:34,410
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, and Ji Hyo will go and ask the question.)

3583
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:34,580
- Don't you need help? - Come.

3584
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:39,520
(They have 15 minutes left. Will they succeed in time?)

3585
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:36,080
It's difficult this time.

3586
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,580
- It's difficult. - It's difficult.

3587
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,720
- It's difficult. - They can get LA.

3588
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:41,590
We should ask someone young, right?

3589
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:43,090
Someone who watches Running Man a lot.

3590
01:29:43,090 --> 01:29:44,920
- "LA that Jong Kook loves." - People who like Running Man...

3591
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:46,290
(Target: A young citizen who loves Running Man)

3592
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:45,960
- "Jong Kook loves." - know that you like LA.

3593
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,090
Let's see.

3594
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:49,330
(They set off to find their target.)

3595
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:49,000
Someone a bit young.

3596
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,160
It's not easy.

3597
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,500
- It's actually... - It's difficult.

3598
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:55,370
(They have around 15 minutes left.)

3599
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,830
- "That Kim Jong Kook loves..." - Wait...

3600
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:55,170
- It's so difficult. - Let's think carefully.

3601
01:29:55,170 --> 01:29:57,670
Someone young should see it.

3602
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:59,410
(If they don't succeed right away, they'll have to do the night tour.)

3603
01:29:57,670 --> 01:29:59,570
We have to pick well.

3604
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:01,370
Hello.

3605
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:04,080
- Ji Hyo. - Could we interview you?

3606
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,450
- Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

3607
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,950
(Ji Hyo tries to find a citizen to interview.)

3608
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:06,980
- No. - No.

3609
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:08,380
Ji Hyo. These days, you're...

3610
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:09,420
- She's almost... - You're...

3611
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:10,920
- That's not it. - Over there.

3612
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,950
(Rushing)

3613
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,620
Hello, lady. Could we interview you two?

3614
01:30:14,620 --> 01:30:16,460
Interviewing isn't the problem here.

3615
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:17,590
- Ji Hyo... - We need to find...

3616
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:18,690
- someone who can answer this. - Could we talk to you for a bit?

3617
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:19,860
- Ji Hyo. - These days, Ji Hyo...

3618
01:30:20,130 --> 01:30:21,460
- She... - Ji Hyo.

3619
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:22,730
- Just for a bit. - As soon as we mentioned it...

3620
01:30:22,730 --> 01:30:24,300
No, Ji Hyo. Would this be all right?

3621
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:25,970
- But they're coming. - Come.

3622
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:28,030
- This person? - Could we...

3623
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:30,540
(Thanks to Ji Hyo, they manage to find someone to interview.)

3624
01:30:28,030 --> 01:30:30,270
- ask you something? - He came.

3625
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:32,370
Do you watch Running Man often?

3626
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:34,010
I watch it a lot on YouTube.

3627
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:35,210
- It's done. - That's all right.

3628
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:36,880
- It's okay. - What's your name?

3629
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,010
I'm Ha Kwang Ho.

3630
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:40,050
(Ha Kwang Ho, young)

3631
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:39,980
- He's a Ha. - His surname is Ha.

3632
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:41,580
Who do you like best in Running Man?

3633
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:43,380
I like Jong Kook the most.

3634
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,950
- It's done. - It's done.

3635
01:30:44,950 --> 01:30:45,950
I like Jong Kook the most.

3636
01:30:45,150 --> 01:30:48,090
(His favorite member is Jong Kook!)

3637
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:47,150
- It's done. - It's done.

3638
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:49,390
- It's done. - You work out, don't you?

3639
01:30:49,390 --> 01:30:51,760
His body. He works out.

3640
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:52,990
(He met a fellow gym-goer at the perfect time.)

3641
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,930
- No wonder. - He looks like it.

3642
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:57,030
(If he's Jong Kook's fan, he might know the answer.)

3643
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:55,930
- His shoulders are broad. - His...

3644
01:30:55,930 --> 01:30:57,100
His shoulders are broad.

3645
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:59,100
- Do you watch GYM Jong Kook? - I watch it often.

3646
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,230
Goodness.

3647
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,200
- Good. - I noticed that.

3648
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:04,500
(Jong Kook often talks about LA on his YouTube channel.)

3649
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,200
Now, then...

3650
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:07,070
- he might be able to get it. - You have to answer this.

3651
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:07,370
(They see hope.)

3652
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:09,380
- We'll show you a photo. - Look at it.

3653
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:09,440
(Revealing the mission photo)

3654
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:10,380
- We have a picture. - First look at it.

3655
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,580
(The theme of the photo: LA that Kim Jong Kook loves)

3656
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:11,380
- Look at it. - Don't say it.

3657
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:12,410
- So, - We...

3658
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:13,580
you said you watched Running Man often.

3659
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:14,610
- That's right. - Don't say it.

3660
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:16,550
You know why Jong Kook is like this, right?

3661
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:19,390
- This one. - Let me explain.

3662
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:24,160
(Jong Kook's fan seems to have noticed that it's LA.)

3663
01:31:19,490 --> 01:31:21,450
It's a picture of us traveling abroad.

3664
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:24,460
- We're traveling abroad. - We're traveling abroad.

3665
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:26,990
We are traveling abroad.

3666
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:33,200
(The question they need to ask)

3667
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:29,100
Where was this photo...

3668
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:32,200
taken from?

3669
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,300
- Don't think about the place only. - Right.

3670
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:35,300
- It's a place but what... - There's a modifier.

3671
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:38,400
(Where is the location?)

3672
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,270
- It's a place. - But what...

3673
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:38,510
- A certain place. - This place.

3674
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:40,210
- You'd know if you look at this. - Yes.

3675
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:43,610
(If he's a fan of Running Man, he must know Jong Kook's love for LA.)

3676
01:31:40,210 --> 01:31:41,210
You know it, right? You watch...

3677
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:42,740
- Running Man on YouTube. - Here.

3678
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:45,280
- Yes. - He's the only one smiling.

3679
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:47,080
- He's looking at the front. - Look at this.

3680
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,550
There's something written on the front.

3681
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:50,220
They're sleeping too.

3682
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:51,920
- Do you know where this is? - Yes.

3683
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,220
You know where it is, right?

3684
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:54,450
- We're traveling abroad. - You're in a city.

3685
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:55,720
- That's right. - Yes.

3686
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,320
- You can say what place it is. - And...

3687
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,990
- we went on a trip to that city. - Yes.

3688
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:01,260
(Now, he needs to figure out the modifier.)

3689
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:02,130
There are modifiers to that city.

3690
01:32:02,130 --> 01:32:05,100
It wouldn't be funny to just say the answer, right?

3691
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,170
- Yes. - There would be a modifier.

3692
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:09,700
(His favorite member is watching.)

3693
01:32:07,170 --> 01:32:09,370
- Look at this. - But...

3694
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:11,370
- Why is he... - He really likes it.

3695
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:12,870
He loves it very much.

3696
01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:14,710
- Who? - He loves it so much.

3697
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:16,240
(He likes it?)

3698
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:16,280
- The rest aren't interested. - No.

3699
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,280
- He's the only one who loves it. - He loves it very much.

3700
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:20,180
("Love" is the answer, not "like.")

3701
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:21,180
- Think about it slowly. - Just look at this.

3702
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:22,450
How does it feel?

3703
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:23,120
(The photo)

3704
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:24,380
- Just say what you think. - It's easy. It's not hard.

3705
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:27,390
(Did he figure out how Jong Kook is feeling in the photo?)

3706
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:27,290
- You already know the location. - Yes.

3707
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:28,960
- I need to say the modifier. - Right.

3708
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,390
- Just say what it feels like. - It's not complex.

3709
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:32,330
- Say what it feels like. - This feeling.

3710
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:32,760
(Thinking)

3711
01:32:32,330 --> 01:32:34,160
- Can I say it now? - Yes.

3712
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:36,130
- Well... - One, two, three.

3713
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:39,300
Kim Jong Kook.

3714
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,530
Kim Jong Kook...

3715
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:47,640
(The theme of the photo: LA that Kim Jong Kook loves)

3716
01:32:43,070 --> 01:32:46,240
Kim Jong Kook.

3717
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:47,470
Kim Jong Kook...

3718
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:51,810
- He really likes it. - He loves it very much.

3719
01:32:48,110 --> 01:32:52,610
(He has to say "that Kim Jong Kook loves.")

3720
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:56,120
LA that Kim Jong Kook loves.

3721
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:59,650
LA that Kim Jong Kook loves.

3722
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:03,720
(They succeeded in the mission in one go!)

3723
01:33:01,890 --> 01:33:03,290
- He got it perfectly. - Was it correct?

3724
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,560
- You're the best. - That was accurate.

3725
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:08,730
(A true fan who figured out how Jong Kook was feeling)

3726
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:07,890
- It's really amazing. - It was accurate.

3727
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:10,230
- That's GYM Jong Kook. - That was perfectly correct.

3728
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:12,900
(They succeeded at once 3 times in a row.)

3729
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:12,130
- Awesome. - That's GYM Jong Kook.

3730
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:13,270
- Give me your phone. - Thank you.

3731
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:14,730
- We should take a selfie. - That's right.

3732
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:16,570
- Amazing. - We met like this.

3733
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:17,740
- One, two, three. - Thank you.

3734
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:19,940
(They even have the same selfie pose.)

3735
01:33:18,870 --> 01:33:20,440
- Thank you. - Okay.

3736
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:23,780
(Surprisingly, they succeeded in all the missions at once.)

3737
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,280
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3738
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,580
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3739
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:24,910
- It's done. - Thank you.

3740
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:26,650
(Even they find it fascinating.)

3741
01:33:24,910 --> 01:33:26,880
How did he answer it so accurately?

3742
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:27,650
(LA, Paris, Hong Kong)

3743
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,180
- That's amazing. - We achieved the difficult task.

3744
01:33:27,650 --> 01:33:31,180
(They finished traveling to 3 cities.)

3745
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,150
You succeeded in the final trip as well.

3746
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:34,150
(They cleared all the missions as well.)

3747
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:34,150
- How? - He said the exact words.

3748
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:36,190
- Who did you show it to? - Who was it?

3749
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:36,590
(Fascinated)

3750
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:37,520
I met a subscriber.

3751
01:33:36,590 --> 01:33:38,860
(Lucky)

3752
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,060
- A subscriber? - GYM Jong Kook's subscriber.

3753
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:41,590
- And... - He said the exact words?

3754
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:43,060
("Loves")

3755
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:43,900
- The exact words. - Such an Intimate Overseas Trip...

3756
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:45,900
has ended.

3757
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:48,640
You succeeded in traveling around three countries.

3758
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:50,870
(The time they took to travel the 3 cities)

3759
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:53,110
The time it took was 5 hours and 52 minutes.

3760
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:55,480
- Three countries. - That was close.

3761
01:33:54,110 --> 01:33:57,940
(They cleared the mission with 8 minutes remaining.)

3762
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,940
You succeeded in today's race.

3763
01:33:57,940 --> 01:34:00,280
So you can all leave work now.

3764
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:02,580
(They'll all go home right away without getting the penalty.)

3765
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,880
- Okay. - Okay.

3766
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,720
- No way. - It's been a while.

3767
01:34:03,450 --> 01:34:08,490
(Even the ending was perfect for their trip abroad.)

3768
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,690
The places we went to today were amazing.

3769
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:07,350
- Seriously. - Hong Kong as well.

3770
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:09,690
- I could feel the local atmosphere. - Seriously...

3771
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:13,960
(We'd like to thank everyone who participated in their trip.)

3772
01:34:09,690 --> 01:34:10,890
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3773
01:34:10,890 --> 01:34:12,230
- Well done. - Thank you.

3774
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,530
- Bye. - We're going home.

3775
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:16,400
(Odd or even, what is your choice?)

3776
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:16,030
Hurry up.

3777
01:34:16,530 --> 01:34:18,360
Hurry up!

3778
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:19,770
I think I should continue with odd.

3779
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:21,930
I'm not scared! Even drives me crazy.

3780
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:24,140
It's even again if I go.

3781
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:28,470
You will play an odd or even game that decides your fate.

3782
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:26,170
(Odd, even)

3783
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:28,140
(An odd-or-even race determining their fate begins!)

3784
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:30,280
You always betrayed us.

3785
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:33,110
- But you do that too. - No way.

3786
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,780
(Kyu Hyun)

3787
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,480
- Where are you going? - What?

3788
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:37,520
(Dahyun of TWICE)

3789
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:37,680
- I'll bring something to eat. - They said they'd be here.

3790
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:41,390
(Move the members according to the prediction.)

3791
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:39,320
Come to the PC room.

3792
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:41,290
- No I won't go. - Why won't you go?

3793
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:42,860
You're trying to read the air.

3794
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:44,090
I guess you chose even.

3795
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:46,530
I don't betray. I'm a loyal person!

3796
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:49,630
- Come. - Is someone hiding again?
(But the result keeps getting changed.)

3797
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:51,260
(There's someone behind it?)

3798
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:50,830
What?

3799
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:53,270
It's x.

3800
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:54,800
- What is this? - Who is it?
(Now it's a battle of brains, not luck!)

3801
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,240
- Why are you coming here? - I'm even. Wait.

3802
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:59,840
(A new game begins, and you never know how it will be until it ends.)

3803
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:00,170
- Come. - It's even, Se Chan!

3804
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:02,410
- Even! - Come.

3805
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:04,980
(The Wise Odd and Even Choices)

3806
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:05,280
Don't betray us.

3807
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:10,380
(Running Man)
