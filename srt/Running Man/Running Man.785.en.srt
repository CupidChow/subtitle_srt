00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,980
(Running Man)

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,080
- Hello. Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,180
(The bright new year of 2026, the Year of the Horse, has arrived.)

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,120
Is this the New Year's special?

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,890
(A horse racing park in Gwacheon)

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,150
- What is this? - It's the Year of the Horse.

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,830
(The Year of the Horse begins with the Gilt Bronze Horse Statue.)

9
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,920
- I see. - Is it the Year of the Horse?

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,460
- It's the New Year's first episode. - Hello.

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,790
- Hello. - Hello.

12
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,500
- It's the New Year's first episode. - It's the Year of the Horse?

13
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,530
Hello.

14
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,530
Weren't you born in the Year of the Horse?

15
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,700
- Right. - I've never seen this before.

16
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,100
- This is golden. - Is it the Year of the Horse?

17
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,440
(They make a lively entrance, blessed by the golden horse.)

18
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,500
- It wasn't golden before. - My goodness.

19
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,140
- It's beautiful. - You look so warm.

20
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,840
- Gwacheon Racecourse Park. - Right.

21
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,870
Dear viewers.

22
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,610
- Happy New Year! - Happy New Year!

23
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,280
- Yes. - It's 2026, the Year of the Horse.

24
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,910
- The Year of the Horse? - The New Year has arrived.

25
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,080
How do you know stuff like that?

26
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,450
- Of course, I do. It's basic. - Do you study?

27
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,180
- Do you study at home? - People say that a lot.

28
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,050
- You often hear it during a shoot. - Right.

29
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,320
(They start the new year bickering as always.)

30
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,150
- Is it the Year of the Horse? - Yes.

31
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,260
The episode we're filming today...

32
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,660
is the first to air in 2026, the Year of the Red Horse.

33
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,230
- The Red Horse? - The Red Horse.

34
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,200
- It's the Year of the Red Horse. - That sounds good.

35
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,330
So we're doing the opening in front of this statue,

36
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,940
which symbolizes wealth, health,

37
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,700
(They shoot the opening in front of the Gilt Bronze Horse Statue.)

38
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,970
- and good fortune. - It looks nice.

39
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,700
It was here before, but I'm not sure if it was golden.

40
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,710
I didn't know.

41
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,610
(It is perfect for welcoming the Year of the Red Horse.)

42
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,410
It's dazzling.

43
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,240
As we welcome the hopeful New Year, there's good news.

44
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,280
(With the arrival of the hopeful new year...)

45
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,780
(is Running Man's first good news.)

46
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,350
- What? - About whom?

47
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,680
It's Yu Jae Seok.

48
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,880
He won first place as the entertainer of the year...

49
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,850
("The Nation's Beloved MC, for Sure")

50
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,080
("Ranked Entertainer of the Year for the 14th Consecutive Year")

51
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,820
- for the 14th consecutive year. - Thank you.

52
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,490
(Amazing)

53
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,490
- How does he do that? - I'm really...

54
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,060
- For 14 years? - How do you do that for 14 years?

55
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,590
It's truly impressive.

56
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,760
It's not like I can do it just because I want to.

57
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,030
(It is thanks to the viewers, who supported him for 14 years.)

58
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,600
- That's true. - I'm just grateful.

59
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
That's wonderful.

60
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
- It's amazing. - It will be sad to be in second.

61
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,770
- For the past 14 years... - Why would you say something bad?

62
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,970
- In the morning... - You know what?

63
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,910
- It's good news. - He said the same thing last year.

64
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,340
- He's the same. - I did?

65
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,040
- You're full of envy. - Right.

66
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,510
So, how are you feeling?

67
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,050
- When everything goes well. - "How are you feeling?"

68
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,950
(Upset)

69
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,180
What?

70
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,320
- What was that? - Why are you being like this?

71
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,450
- Seriously... - You should stay here.

72
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,090
(Seok Sam congratulates him aggressively.)

73
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,820
- What's wrong with you? - Why are you being like this?

74
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,360
Everything is going well for him. I wonder how it feels.

75
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,590
- Why are you doing this? - My gosh.

76
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,830
By the way, what is the cameraman doing here?

77
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,400
- Who? - Cameraman?

78
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,930
What is the cameraman doing here?

79
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,930
(The cameraman is here without a camera.)

80
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,070
- Who? - Cameraman?

81
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,670
(Looking around)

82
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,270
- Aren't you the cameraman? - Hey.

83
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,170
- He looks... - Are you...

84
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,440
dressed like a cameraman?

85
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,910
- You two can't say that to me. - Why not?

86
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,510
- We are different. Why? - Mr. Cameraman.

87
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,480
(Drawing the line)

88
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,510
- I mean... - You know,

89
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,780
- this is called gorpcore. - You are...

90
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,810
- the outdoor shoot cameraman. - Jae Seok!

91
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,020
You keep siding with Jong Kook, so he doesn't know what's wrong.

92
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,150
- What's wrong? - I didn't side with him.

93
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,420
- He's well dressed. - What about me?

94
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,220
He was dressed like this two years ago.

95
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,120
And four years ago.

96
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,820
Right. He was dressed like this even ten years ago.

97
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,320
(His fashion has been the same for the past 10 years.)

98
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,420
- True. - Even ten years ago.

99
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,260
I'm shooting a video for my YouTube channel this week.

100
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,630
You should bring a camera.

101
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,870
(He is scouted to be Gym Jong Kook's dedicated cameraman.)

102
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Okay? I need two cameramen.

103
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,960
- This is a fashion choice. - Fashion?

104
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,700
- Aren't you a cameraman? - Right.

105
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,500
Look at him. He's staying quiet next to him.

106
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,070
What about me? I look fine. I dressed young.

107
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,270
- What about him? - He looks fine.

108
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,410
Haha, this is Stussy.

109
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,440
- Really? - Stussy.

110
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,910
- That's Young Forty. - Young Forty.

111
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,310
This is Young Forty.

112
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,810
- How old are you? - I'm 40.

113
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,510
(Born in 1986)

114
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,710
- You're Young Forty. - I'm Young Forty!

115
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,980
(Ssaeb Ssaeb is now officially a Young Forty.)

116
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,050
- Young Forty! - Young Forty!

117
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,620
- Seok Sam is 60! - He's 60!

118
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,150
- He's 60! - I said no.

119
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,350
(Born in 1966, the Year of the Horse, 60 years old this year)

120
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,420
- You're obviously 60 now. - No.

121
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,320
- We will throw a party... - Right. Please.

122
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,230
- for his 60th birthday. - Yes. On his birthday.

123
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,030
I'm 59 years and 13 months old.

124
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,700
- What are you talking about? - What do we do?

125
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,900
- Your birthday is in February. - Seriously...

126
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,200
(Not understanding)

127
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,130
He's 59 years and 13 months old?

128
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,800
- That's it. - I'm so sick of this.

129
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,700
(He can't give up his 50s.)

130
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,900
- He's 59 years and 13 months old? - I'm 59 years and 13 months old.

131
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,700
So what? That's my age.

132
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,910
- What do we do? - What?

133
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,940
What, you brat?

134
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,710
He just swore.

135
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,350
(He is extremely sensitive whenever age comes up.)

136
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,410
- I'm sorry for causing trouble. - What do we do about him?

137
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,150
(Seok Sam's 60th birthday party is coming soon!)

138
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,180
This reminds me of my dad's 60th birthday.

139
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,790
Today, to celebrate 2026, the Year of the Red Horse,

140
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,750
(The first race for 2026, the Year of the Red Horse)

141
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,060
we will have the Follow the Horse, Complete the Bingo Race.

142
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,990
(Follow the Horse, Complete the Bingo Race)

143
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,290
What's that?

144
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,460
- Bingo. - We have a bingo board...

145
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,290
with nine squares with horse-related missions.

146
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,260
- Really? - And within the time limit...

147
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,160
- of 3pm, - Until 3pm?

148
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,800
you must choose and complete the missions you want on the board.

149
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
(Execute the mission until the limit time, 3pm.)

150
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,440
(Succeed in one bingo square, get 1 prize sticker)

151
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,600
Succeeding in one square...

152
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,740
- earns you a prize sticker. - I see.

153
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,040
Completing one bingo line...

154
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,540
(Succeed in one bingo line, get 6 prize stickers)

155
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,480
- earns you six prize stickers. - That's a lot.

156
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,510
That's a lot.

157
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,710
At the end of the race, you will place...

158
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,450
(With the prize stickers earned before 3pm,)

159
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,880
(place them on the penalty dice.)

160
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,220
the prize stickers you earned...

161
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,050
on any side of these dice.

162
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,750
- We put the stickers on them. - We put them.

163
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,860
After placing all the stickers,

164
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,790
you will roll both dice.

165
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,490
(After placung the prize stickers, roll the 2 dice.)

166
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,560
If you get the prize on both dice, all of you will receive a prize.

167
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,600
(Prize, prize, If 2 are prizes, all get prizes.)

168
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,030
If one die shows the prize and the other shows the penalty,

169
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,670
(Prize, penalty)

170
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,470
the four of you, which is half, will get the penalty.

171
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,700
(If 1 is a prize and 1 is a penalty, 4 members will get the penalty.)

172
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,770
- I see. - Okay.

173
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,070
- That's a lot. - That's too many.

174
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,970
And if both dice show the penalty,

175
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,240
- all of you get the penalty. - All of us?

176
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,840
- I see. This is... - It's not easy.

177
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,940
So, we need to get...

178
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,340
- as many prize stickers as we can. - That's right.

179
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,440
- Are we one team today? - Yes.

180
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,980
- You're one team today. - We are?

181
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,320
(They will race as a team of 7.)

182
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,180
- It's been a while. Let's do this. - Good.

183
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,680
We don't lose when we're one team.

184
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,220
(Full of motivation)

185
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,020
- Right. - That's true.

186
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,990
Since we're one team today,

187
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,390
you can't do anything silly.

188
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,120
- Se Chan. - We just need to try our best.

189
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,190
(We're a team.)

190
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,030
- Who are you talking about? - Se Chan.

191
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,560
Aren't you the one who's planning something silly?

192
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,590
You always do silly things.

193
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,500
(Their teamwork falls apart right away.)

194
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,360
- Se Chan. - What is she talking about?

195
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,430
You don't understand the rules, do you?

196
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,830
I understand.

197
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,300
By the way, you look...

198
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,240
like an old lady who's playing a big game.

199
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,400
- I'm a lady who's here for a game. - Right.

200
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,610
It looks like you're here to feed horses.

201
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,240
- Today... - Feed horses?

202
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,640
- There's a big game today. - You're here to feed horses.

203
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,680
(Teasing)

204
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,240
How many layers are you wearing underneath the jacket?

205
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,350
Shut it.

206
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,950
Shut it.

207
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,150
(The lady gives him a blow elegantly.)

208
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,450
- Hey! - My goodness.

209
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,420
- Ji Hyo is tough. - What's going on?

210
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,620
- The gold key. - She sounds scary.

211
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,790
- You worry about yourself. - I got you the gold key.

212
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,820
- He got you the gold key. - Hey!

213
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,590
(Jong Kook gifted Ji Hyo with a don of gold last time.)

214
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,260
- The gold key. - Oh, right.

215
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,130
Jong Kook is the only one who cares about you.

216
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,390
That's how I feel...

217
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,860
(That's true.)

218
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,560
- I was so touched. - I know.

219
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,130
- The gold key. - That's my heart.

220
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,330
I'll show you the bingo board.

221
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,130
(The bingo board with the missions is revealed.)

222
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,530
- What's that? - What are the missions?

223
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,570
All right. Thank you.

224
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,840
(Complete a mission with a celebrity born in the Year of the Horse)

225
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,970
They are related to horses.

226
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,640
I think we can find horses here.

227
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,910
(Take a picture with a horse)

228
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,340
"Take a picture with a horse."

229
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,010
Does it count if we take a picture with Lee Moon Sae?

230
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,580
Should we take a picture with a horse?

231
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,840
- How would we do that? - Horse...

232
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,810
(Dress up as a horse without being noticed)

233
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,550
Jae Seok, how would we dress up as a horse without being noticed?

234
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,380
(Another tough challenge)

235
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,350
Hey, this is really hard.

236
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,020
Dress up as a horse without being noticed?

237
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,290
Maybe we should go to a kindergarten to do that.

238
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,350
- We should go to a kindergarten. - How could we not be noticed?

239
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,320
- We won't get caught there. - Dressed as a horse...

240
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,960
(Amid baffling missions that seem impossible to try...)

241
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,190
- We will get caught. - They will notice us.

242
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,190
They will know for sure.

243
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,230
"Complete a mission with a celebrity born in the Year of the Horse."

244
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,690
- This is okay. - That's easy.

245
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,160
And doing it with a citizen is easy.

246
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Things like this are okay.

247
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,170
(There are some doable things.)

248
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,870
- Complete a mission with a citizen. - That's a good one.

249
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,170
But we should start in the middle.

250
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,770
(Draw a horse and sell it online using the Karrot app)

251
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,770
How would we sell something online using an app?

252
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,970
A horse drawing?

253
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,440
Can we really draw a horse...

254
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,770
(Starting from the center is more beneficial for finishing the bingo.)

255
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,570
and sell it online using the Karrot app?

256
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,670
- My goodness. - We can do it.

257
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,740
- Who would buy it? - If we say...

258
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,880
that it's Jae Seok's drawing and sell it.

259
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,180
But I'm terrible at drawing.

260
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,780
- That's why it's fun. - If we don't say...

261
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,480
- It's for good luck. - He can take a picture...

262
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,120
(Jae Seok)

263
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,020
- holding his drawing. - Right.

264
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,890
Let's say it's Yu Jae Seok's drawing.

265
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,350
But instead of selling my drawing,

266
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,590
Seok Jin, who was born in the Year of the Horse...

267
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,660
Gosh, no.

268
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,790
- Jae Seok. - Still, you are more influential.

269
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,730
- Who would want to buy it? - Hey.

270
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,230
Right?

271
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,430
(The hard truth is finally said out loud.)

272
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,060
- Still... - Hey.

273
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,430
- Don't be upset, Seok Jin. - I was talking.

274
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,770
I was saying that myself, but that darn brat...

275
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,600
- Why would you say that? - The Karrot app...

276
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,610
(It's true.)

277
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,510
- I mean, people are busy. - You can't say that.

278
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,340
Shouldn't I tighten discipline at the beginning of the year?

279
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,780
- But he's right about that. - Hey, I was talking.

280
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,980
- Jae Seok is better. - It should have collectible value.

281
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:50,580
(They were happy about being a team, but they are already falling apart.)

282
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,210
Who would... Exactly.

283
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,650
- Yu Jae Seok... - It's all about who drew it.

284
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,850
- Who drew it is more important. - I think...

285
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,820
Once you select a mission,

286
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,920
(The details will be revealed once the mission is chosen.)

287
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,690
I'll give you the details then.

288
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,250
- Okay. - Okay.

289
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,520
(Complete a mission with a celebrity born in the Year of the Horse)

290
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,820
- Let's get changed first. - Yes.

291
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,820
(Take a picture with a horse)

292
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,120
We should show them what we've got.

293
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,390
(Each buy an item related to horses)

294
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,390
- We have to make it today. - Okay.

295
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,730
- It's the basic rule... - But...

296
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,660
(They come inside and begin to choose the mission square.)

297
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,730
that we complete the middle one first.

298
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,830
- We should try this first. - Yes, the middle one.

299
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,530
(The middle)

300
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,800
- Exactly. - We wait until we hear something.

301
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,030
- He's smart. - We can sell it then.

302
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,600
- Would anyone want to buy it? - All right, then.

303
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,900
- Jae Seok should draw it. - Then,

304
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,070
(Draw a horse and sell it online using the Karrot app)

305
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,340
- let's all try drawing a horse. - My gosh. How would we...

306
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,640
(They decide on the middle square!)

307
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,840
- We will pick the best one. - If you chose the drawing mission,

308
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,210
(The exact rule is revealed.)

309
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,440
- I'll tell you about the rules. - Let's go.

310
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,380
If you draw a horse,

311
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,950
(Complete the mission by drawing...)

312
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,050
upload it to a secondhand trading app, and sell it to a citizen,

313
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,480
(a picture of a horse and selling it through the secondhand market app.)

314
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,420
- you succeed in the mission. - Okay.

315
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,450
But you can't give it away for free.

316
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,490
- Of course not. - We can't do that.

317
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,060
You can mention your name in the transaction,

318
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,890
but you can't upload a picture of your face...

319
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,260
or mention that it's a Running Man mission...

320
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,400
- and you're shooting Running Man. - This is difficult.

321
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,830
- Then the drawing should be good. - We need someone good.

322
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,030
But we should say that Jae Seok drew it.

323
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,940
- You can say that. - That's how it works.

324
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,970
- Right. - But...

325
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,670
(Worried)

326
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,670
- no one would believe it. - We need his autograph.

327
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,210
We can't prove it with a picture, right?

328
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,340
(As mentioned, they cannot use their picture as proof.)

329
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,670
- You can't. - He can sign his autograph.

330
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,180
Anyway, it should be drawn...

331
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,040
- by someone good. - Okay.

332
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,310
- Right. - I'm not sure.

333
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,750
- No matter how good the drawing is, - Then...

334
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,720
- I'd want a famous man's drawing. - Give us the sketchbooks.

335
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,650
It's better to have a famous person's drawing.

336
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,790
- All right, then. - So, we will just compare...

337
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,820
(A famous person)

338
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,420
Jae Seok's drawing and Jong Kook's drawing.

339
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,560
- No, we all should try drawing. - Let's all do that.

340
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,590
- We should draw one each. - Haha is good at drawing.

341
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,930
You all should try drawing a horse.

342
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,600
I've never tried drawing a horse.

343
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,600
(Zero confidence)

344
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,700
Just draw it, you brat.

345
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,500
Why are you being so negative?

346
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,930
(Attacking together)

347
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,230
Why are you so negative?

348
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
- Okay. - Why live so negatively?

349
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,970
(The oldest one born in 1966 is full of positive energy.)

350
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,240
No one tried it.

351
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,740
How does a horse look?

352
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,010
If my drawing is good, will it be selected?

353
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,440
- Sure. - Okay.

354
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,310
(They will all draw, then pick out the one who did best.)

355
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,980
We need to draw a horse well.

356
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,380
- It's for secondhand trading. - Right.

357
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,220
Even though it's a celebrity's drawing,

358
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,450
- It's... - it should still be good.

359
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,590
So, for this,

360
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,620
we should pick someone who's good at drawing.

361
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,960
Ji Hyo, that's what I already said.

362
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,460
That's what we've been talking about.

363
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,300
- Is this an echo or what? - Now...

364
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,900
Excessive drinking...

365
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,270
(Criticisms pour in.)

366
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,670
- It's not good. - You know what?

367
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,040
Next year...

368
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,970
- I'll quit drinking this year. - Right.

369
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,070
I bet everything I have on you not being able to quit.

370
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,310
- I bet my entire fortune. - How much do you want to bet?

371
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,580
- For a year... - How much?

372
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,240
Hang on.

373
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,750
Wait. This is...

374
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,950
(The horse drawing competition begins.)

375
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,050
A horse is really...

376
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,620
- I'll try my best to draw a horse. - Okay.

377
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,290
I'm doing my best as well.

378
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,290
How should I draw a horse?

379
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,420
What should I do to make it look like a horse?

380
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,220
It should look fun, though.

381
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,990
(He draws the teeth first.)

382
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,790
To draw a horse...

383
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,390
(Draw a horse and sell it online using the Karrot app)

384
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,930
I'll try my best anyway.

385
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,700
(Ddochi copies the horse on the bingo board.)

386
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,930
I'll just copy that.

387
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,300
(Haha is looking at it too.)

388
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,970
A horse...

389
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,140
- Why is that a horse? - What?

390
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,540
- Why is that a horse? - What?

391
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,180
Are you drawing the legs?

392
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,250
Yes.

393
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,750
This is becoming like an anteater. I'm in trouble.

394
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,550
(While Se Chan is creating a monster...)

395
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,060
(The bad drawers are worried as well.)

396
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,250
If I do this wrong, it will look like a cow.

397
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,260
Does a horse have four legs?

398
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,920
- Of course. - It has four legs.

399
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,130
Why are you drawing a buffalo? Is it a human or what?

400
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,700
It's so creepy.

401
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,400
(Odd)

402
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,970
It's a horse.

403
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,500
- I've never drawn a horse before. - A horse...

404
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,270
(Jae Seok is just as bad.)

405
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,270
Should I draw the far legs?

406
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,210
(Still, everyone is putting in genuine effort.)

407
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,580
- It's a little... - This is bad.

408
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,380
- I need something to refer to. - I just can't...

409
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,710
sell this on a secondhand trading app.

410
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,680
I'm done.

411
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,250
- Haha's drawing is nice. - This is...

412
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,720
He's so good.

413
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,890
This one looks good.

414
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,860
(A square-jawed horse appears.)

415
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,790
Haha, you're really good at drawing.

416
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,360
- This is... - When you were little,

417
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,590
your family was well off, right?

418
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,860
(I'm sure you went to an academy.)

419
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,960
- I bet you were rich. - What's this?

420
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,060
Let's look at Se Chan's drawing.

421
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,100
(Time is up, and it is time to show off their work.)

422
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,300
- Me? - Isn't this creepy?

423
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,200
- Ssaebssaeb, show us yours. - This is mine.

424
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,170
(Se Chan's is revealed first.)

425
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,800
- Hey. - How is that a horse?

426
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,970
- This is mine. - Hey.

427
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,570
- How is that a horse? - Hey.

428
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,170
- Is that an imaginary animal? - If you look at the teeth...

429
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,040
Even Na Eun draws better than you.

430
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,240
- I'm... - Isn't that a monster?

431
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,840
I just can't do it. This is the best I can do.

432
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:43,010
(The creative style looks like it was drawn by a 5-year-old.)

433
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,380
- How is that a horse? - I don't know.

434
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,550
That's...

435
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,150
Hey,

436
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,490
it should be at least this good.

437
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,720
Jae Seok, what's that?

438
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,890
(Jae Seok introduces his drawing.)

439
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,190
It should be at least this good.

440
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,330
Jae Seok, what's that?

441
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,300
- Jae Seok, you're no different. - Isn't that a wolf?

442
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:03,670
(It's not much different from Se Chan's work.)

443
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,330
I think I saw a dinosaur that looks like this.

444
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,970
- A horse is... - The body is too long.

445
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,370
- What's that? - I have an image on my mind,

446
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,800
but I can't express it.

447
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,410
- Let's see Ji Hyo's drawing. - Show us.

448
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,110
(Lady Song shows her drawing.)

449
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,570
- This is the front view. - It's...

450
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,980
Your drawing is scary.

451
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,180
- This is the front view. - It's...

452
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,180
Your drawing is scary.

453
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,720
She always expresses things in a different way.

454
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,480
(Whispering)

455
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,820
- That's true. - She really does.

456
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,580
- She's unique. - Right.

457
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,820
Why is mine so hideous?

458
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,020
(Seok Jin shows his drawing.)

459
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,460
- Your drawing is too hideous. - Seok Jin.

460
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,890
- Half-human, half-beast. - Something is mixed up.

461
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,960
(Half-human, half-beast)

462
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,190
- A lion and... - What is this?

463
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,630
- It's strange. - It's half-human, half-beast.

464
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,330
The horse is a little...

465
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:37,640
(An awkward clash between a balding human and a bison body)

466
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,260
Seok Jin, just because you have thin hair...

467
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,470
What kind of horse is this?

468
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,370
But I won an art contest in high school.

469
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,140
- Who did? - How... I won when I was little.

470
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,240
- I think this is good. - Ye Eun, show us.

471
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,070
(Ye Eun shows her drawing.)

472
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,810
- Mine is cute. - Ye Eun's horse is cute.

473
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,970
- It looks like a horse. - Yes.

474
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,110
(It's quite cute.)

475
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,480
Jong Kook, you're good at drawing.

476
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,540
- But why is your horse like that? - What's that?

477
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,840
- Isn't that Jae Seok? - It's Jae Seok.

478
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,350
(Next, Artist Kim shows his drawing.)

479
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,250
- It's horrible. - It's like this, Jong Kook.

480
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,650
- It's cute, though. - It's cute.

481
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,450
(It's an Insa-dong caricature-style drawing...)

482
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,150
- It's not bad. - It's like a caricature.

483
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,620
- I think it's cute. - It's a caricature.

484
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,680
(that he seems to have made based on Se Chan.)

485
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,650
Show us, Haha.

486
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,020
- This is what I drew. - That's nice.

487
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,090
(And finally, Haha)

488
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,420
- He's good at drawing. - This is a good one.

489
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,300
(The only work that got praised, looking like a martial arts comic.)

490
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,690
- Just as expected. - This one looks like a work of art.

491
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,960
- It's so cool. - As expected from Haha.

492
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,160
- So... - It's Haha and Jong Kook.

493
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,660
Haha and Jong Kook are the best.

494
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,800
(The top two best were Haha and Jong Kook.)

495
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,400
- Right. - They can't hide their talent.

496
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,430
And...

497
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,730
- Ye Eun's drawing is not bad. - This is...

498
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,200
- This is just cute. - To be honest,

499
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,440
when I look at them objectively...

500
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,570
as a work of art, I think...

501
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,710
- Se Chan's drawing is the cutest. - Come on.

502
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,340
- Don't be ridiculous. - I'm serious.

503
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,610
- Would you buy it? - No one would buy it.

504
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,150
(Haha likes the alien creature.)

505
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,780
- Why this? - It won't sell.

506
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,050
- It's like a childhood piece. - No one would buy it.

507
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,850
- That's ridiculous. - I'd want to buy this one.

508
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,450
(Haha's)

509
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,180
Hey, I think Haha is the one...

510
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,820
- who should be drawing here. - Right.

511
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,590
(Haha will make the drawing that will actually be sold.)

512
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,790
- All right. - You should use a red marker here.

513
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,960
If I were to buy a drawing,

514
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,160
I'd choose something like this.

515
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,790
- Seriously... - It's like a Picasso painting.

516
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,430
I'm not joking.

517
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,830
(Unique taste)

518
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,030
- Don't be absurd. - I'm serious.

519
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,060
We will sell this to you.

520
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,530
- I'm serious. - You can buy this.

521
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,830
Do you want to buy this?

522
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,900
This is more artistic.

523
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,400
Then you can buy our drawings.

524
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
- Okay. - It's 20 dollars.

525
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,670
It's ten dollars each.

526
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,510
- That darn Antenna. - Antenna?

527
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,610
- It's the Antenna duo again. - Give us ten dollars each.

528
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,040
- We will sign it. - Yes, we will sign it.

529
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,180
I think this is a lot cuter.

530
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,780
- So you can buy it. - You can buy it.

531
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,210
- Isn't this cute? - You buy it.

532
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,250
- Mine is just cute. - Don't you find it cute?

533
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,380
- It's cute, but... - I think...

534
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,550
(Haha keeps pushing it off when he was asked to draw.)

535
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,720
Ye Eun's drawing is good too.

536
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,790
- Haha's is perfect. - Right.

537
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,820
This looks like a work of art.

538
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,390
- Yes. - Haha should be...

539
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,820
the main artist.

540
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,390
And we can draw something next to his drawing.

541
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,690
- Or we can color it. - So,

542
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,430
- you should draw a red horse. - This isn't so good.

543
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,460
(Mine)

544
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,660
- But... - I think it's good enough.

545
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,060
I just wonder...

546
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,930
if anyone would want to buy Haha's drawing.

547
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,500
- Hey, you're... - My gosh.

548
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,640
(A blunt realist)

549
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,870
- I mean, we should be realistic. - You're really...

550
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,570
- What about him? - I'd buy Jae Seok's drawing.

551
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,410
(Getting choked up)

552
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,240
- I agree with you. - It means something.

553
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,870
- That's why I'm saying this. - You get Jae Seok's drawing...

554
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,480
(Keeping it up)

555
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,640
- at the beginning of the year? - So...

556
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,940
- Hey. - I think it will be meaningful.

557
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,110
- I think so. - The one and only...

558
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,310
(Chiming in)

559
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,280
- Yu Jae Seok's drawing. - Exactly.

560
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,920
Still, you should draw it.

561
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,380
(Coddling)

562
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,750
- Haha should be the main artist. - He's the main artist.

563
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,490
- We can draw on a side. - Let's do that.

564
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,520
(Karrot sales plan: Haha's drawing is the main,)

565
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,090
We can write things like "Happy New Year..."

566
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,160
(but they will all write things to decorate.)

567
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,690
- and decorate it. - All right.

568
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,190
I mean, we can decorate...

569
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,790
Maybe we can write...

570
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,490
Rather than writing in Korean...

571
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,500
- What are you saying? - What was that?

572
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,730
- Write in Korean? - Should we not write in Korean?

573
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,030
- What was that? - I want it to feel like art,

574
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,430
- so instead of writing in Korean, - Yes?

575
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,040
we should sign it with our autographs.

576
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,240
- Our autographs? - Just our autographs.

577
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,970
- Anyway, start drawing. - Draw the horse,

578
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,140
(Karrot sales plan: Haha's drawing will be the base,)

579
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,810
put the R for Running Man on its back,

580
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,840
(and then draw an "R" mark on the back.)

581
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,180
- and we'll add on... - Why should it have our logo?

582
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,280
You can't draw the Running Man logo.

583
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,950
- It can't seem obvious. - Exactly.

584
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,180
- We can sign it instead. - That seems wrong.

585
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,480
Instead of saying it's for a mission,

586
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,250
we can just say we drew it while out at a team dinner.

587
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,450
- Right. - We gathered and...

588
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,920
(That level of trickery is acceptable.)

589
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,490
Sounds good. Anyway, just draw for now.

590
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,220
(The actual canvas that will be sold)

591
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,690
- Just draw. - Will people buy this?

592
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,490
- Are you going to draw in black? - Haha, do you feel pressured?

593
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,890
- Your drawings are good. - It's not that. I can draw,

594
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,860
- but it's too obvious. - I don't think it'll sell.

595
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,430
- What's your problem? - What's with you?

596
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,200
- Stop it. - There's a reason I quit art.

597
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,470
- What's your problem? - Just get drawing.

598
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,670
- This isn't art. - You just...

599
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,300
- don't get it. - This isn't even close to art.

600
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,170
- What's your problem? - Are you the hidden villain?

601
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,570
- Is your goal to sabotage us? - We won't sell it for a lot.

602
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,810
(Artist Ha keeps whining.)

603
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,840
- Just get drawing. - Just draw.

604
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,380
- It'll only be for a dollar. - He thinks he's an artist.

605
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,480
- What's with him? - It'll only be a dollar.

606
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,050
(It must be a mid-stage case of art fever.)

607
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,410
- Are you the hidden villain? - You think you're an artist.

608
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,080
- This has been my insecurity. - I think he has a secret mission.

609
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,120
- He's trying to sabotage us. - Just get drawing.

610
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,780
- I mean... - Just draw.

611
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,620
(He sulkily sits down.)

612
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,250
He thinks he's an artist.

613
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,120
- He thinks he's an artist. - We're running out of time.

614
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,830
(It's 11:08am, and they have until 3pm to complete the bingo.)

615
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,460
Just draw!

616
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,630
- Here you go. - Thanks.

617
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,130
(Working on the drawing that'll be sold)

618
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
I'll keep it on this level.

619
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,500
- That's great. - I love it.

620
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,370
Don't think about doing well. Just draw it.

621
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,330
You're better at drawing than any of us here.

622
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,540
(It's the Year of the Red Horse, so he uses a red pen.)

623
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,940
- Of course. His looks the best. - His is the best.

624
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,740
- Haha's just... - No one else can draw like him.

625
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,270
He's just dwelling on the past.

626
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,770
- This... - He's hung up on an old dream.

627
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,140
- He wants to do well. - He just wants to do well.

628
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,650
- Yes, of course. - Thinking that it'll be sold...

629
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,880
He just feels pressured knowing his drawing...

630
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,350
- will remain out there. - It looks like a dinosaur.

631
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,450
- He thinks he's an artist but... - Exactly.

632
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,390
Why start the new year thinking you're something you're not?

633
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,020
I can't believe those two at Antenna Entertainment.

634
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,790
(Despite the duo's sarcastic remarks,)

635
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,760
(Haha calmly works on his drawing.)

636
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,960
- The Antenna duo. - The Antenna duo.

637
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,260
- "The Antenna duo." - Good. I love it.

638
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,730
- Nicely done. - Now...

639
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,470
(He tosses it to Jong Kook.)

640
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,270
- Can you complete it? - Haha, come on!

641
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,600
- You can draw it yourself. - What's the problem?

642
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,830
- Is this necessary? - He can draw the mane.

643
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,770
(The 2nd place winner gets to work on the mane.)

644
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,240
- But... - Just the mane.

645
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,570
Haha, you drew it perfectly earlier.

646
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,010
- Jong Kook's just as good. - He's good at drawing too.

647
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,140
- The mane. - Jong Kook's just as good.

648
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,580
Haha must feel pressured. Just help him out a little.

649
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,940
- I love it. - That looks great.

650
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,010
- That looks cool. - Should the veins be popping?

651
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,710
- Why not add... - It looks fine as it is.

652
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,450
"Happy New Year" before it?

653
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,550
- Right. - Or...

654
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,020
- Year 2026. - Year 2026.

655
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,160
(He expresses the New Year energy with rough lines.)

656
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,150
- Nice. - I love it.

657
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,790
Hold on. That looks...

658
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,090
- I love it. - It feels artistic.

659
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,860
- Good. - Art majors sure know...

660
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,260
- what they're doing. - They're good at drawing.

661
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,790
Did Jong Kook major in art?

662
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,960
- I don't know. - Of course not.

663
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,930
- That looks good. - It looks like...

664
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,130
(He did not go to art school.)

665
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,960
- a real art piece now. - Exactly.

666
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,230
- This looks cool. - It's nice.

667
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,300
- Even I would buy this. - This is good.

668
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,300
How much should it be?

669
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,140
- I'd buy this for three dollars. - For sure.

670
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,010
You're surprisingly good at drawing for a gangster.

671
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,810
For a gangster?

672
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,080
(He's now writing "year.")

673
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,010
- E, A... - A and R.

674
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,210
Nicely done.

675
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,980
Add Running Man to the R.

676
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,620
- Exactly! No, circle it! - Don't.

677
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,120
- Don't do that. - Circle it!

678
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,850
(Starting to pull sneaky tricks)

679
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,720
- Don't do things like that. - Please.

680
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,750
You can't circle the R.

681
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,390
- That's not allowed. - This is a work of art.

682
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,490
- No, don't. - We're just producing art.

683
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,960
- How about this? - The R is there, isn't it?

684
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,560
(Writing over the "r", using art as an excuse)

685
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,660
- This counts as art. - This much is art.

686
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,830
- Like this. - Add some blue.

687
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,300
How about this, then?

688
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,500
- Right. - I'd buy that.

689
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,630
We want it to mean something.

690
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,200
(He uses blue and yellow on the "r" mark.)

691
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,030
Jong Kook, you should add some yellow.

692
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,670
- That's good enough. - Can't you circle it?

693
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,200
I think that's enough. If we do more...

694
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,110
(They are strangely united when they're pulling sneaky tricks.)

695
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,670
- We should leave it at that. - There you go.

696
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,840
- This is great. - Nice.

697
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,940
- I should color it. - Yes, color it.

698
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,740
- Can't we sign it? - Color it.

699
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,710
- I actually like this. - Me too.

700
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,510
Jong Kook and Haha collaborated on this.

701
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,180
(They carefully get to coloring.)

702
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,710
- That looks so cool. - Art majors...

703
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,150
- sure know what they're doing. - I like it.

704
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,280
Add a bit more.

705
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,490
- What about that? - We should sign it.

706
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,650
- Let's sign it. - Yes, let's sign it.

707
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,650
- We should all sign it. - We'll sign it.

708
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,020
This feels meaningful because...

709
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,760
- it's our 1st autograph of 2026. - Of 2026.

710
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,960
- Nice. - Goodness.

711
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,160
- Let's do this. - How about pricing it...

712
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,330
at 2.60 dollars?

713
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,530
- Why? - That'd be weird.

714
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,300
(Slapping)

715
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,530
- How is that weird? - Seok Jin, come on.

716
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,730
- How is that weird? - He was signing that.

717
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,770
The most important person...

718
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,770
- was signing that. - You annoying jerk.

719
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,270
- Will people know who drew this? - Should I write January?

720
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,300
(To boost the chances of getting sold,)

721
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,770
- Don't bother with that. - Go with 1 and 1.

722
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,740
(Jae Seok adds his handwritten autograph.)

723
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,670
- Go with 1.1 instead of Jan 1. - You should add your name.

724
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,440
- Jan 1. - Write Yu Jae Seok.

725
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,080
It's one of a kind.

726
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,910
Of course, it is. We don't even have this at home.

727
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,710
(The rest of the members also add in their autographs.)

728
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,710
- Look at that. - That looks like real art.

729
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,850
I love it.

730
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,820
(The work of art is finished.)

731
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,080
- I would... - Here's the phone you can use.

732
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,820
(They are given the phone for the sales.)

733
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,850
- Can you believe this? - You must sell the drawing...

734
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,190
- by 3pm to succeed. - Take a photo of this.

735
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,290
(Will they be able to sell it before 3pm?)

736
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,520
If someone shows up to buy this...

737
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,590
We can only photograph the drawing,

738
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,920
not Haha drawing it, right?

739
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,960
- That's right. - That's right.

740
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,690
- I want this. - I'd buy this.

741
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,160
(He opens the app on the given phone.)

742
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,760
- A dollar? - I want it for myself.

743
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,930
The seller's temperature is too low.

744
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,800
(Seller temperature: 36.5°C)

745
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,770
- What's wrong? - It's 36.5°C.

746
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,000
(It's a fresh new account that was just made.)

747
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,300
- Come on. - Seriously?

748
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,040
- That's what you start off with. - That's basic.

749
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,240
A higher temperature reflects trust.

750
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,670
(Worried)

751
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,040
- Of course. - Which neighborhood...

752
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,170
- will this get posted? - The neighborhood?

753
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,610
- That matters. - You can only sell items...

754
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,380
(The app only allows them to sell within the uploaded area.)

755
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,040
in a certain neighborhood.

756
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,310
You can post the item in a neighborhood where you think...

757
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,620
(They can go to the area where they want to sell in.)

758
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,510
- it will sell well. - Okay, we're good.

759
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,520
- Gangnam? - Gangnam's good enough.

760
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,480
This is a masterpiece.

761
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,120
- Ye Eun, can you take the photo? - Sure.

762
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,250
Let's take one with the mountain in the background.

763
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,320
(It is time to take the picture that will be uploaded.)

764
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,220
- Running Man... - No, just the drawing.

765
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,460
- Take one with only the drawing. - Just the drawing.

766
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,660
This is incredible.

767
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,890
- I want to make it look good. - You did great.

768
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,430
- This is amazing. - Haha, it's incredible.

769
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,830
- Actually, we should put it down. - Really?

770
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,100
- Take one of the drawing only. - It's really good.

771
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,030
- That'll be messy. - Do you mean that?

772
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,200
(Concerned)

773
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,070
- Of course! - It's really good.

774
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,100
- It'll be like from a gallery. - You did a great job.

775
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,810
(On the other hand, she starts to take pictures passionately.)

776
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,300
I mean it. You're great at drawing.

777
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,570
I love it.

778
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,070
This will make it look like it's from a gallery.

779
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,240
Let's trust Ye Eun with photos.

780
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,380
- Hold on. - Ye Eun,

781
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,080
(Cutting in immediately)

782
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,780
- isn't this background better? - Leave it to Ye Eun.

783
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,310
- She's good at this. - It's like a stone wall.

784
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,650
- This is better. - Sure, go ahead.

785
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,320
- Have it fit the entire screen. - Are we good?

786
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,750
(They finish taking the picture like it's from a gallery.)

787
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,890
- This is what I got. - I like it.

788
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,190
Let's head to Gangnam for now...

789
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,560
(They will upload it once they get to Gangnam later on.)

790
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,250
- Let's go. - with the drawing.

791
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,220
- I see. - Aren't we uploading it here?

792
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,820
- It needs a sweet description. - Okay.

793
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,560
- It's pretty. - We need to move out now.

794
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,890
- Let's go. - Do I keep this?

795
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,960
Are you sure about this?

796
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,260
Don't we have to complete other missions on that board?

797
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,930
Let's take a photo with a horse.

798
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,440
(The racecourse)

799
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,030
It's right outside.

800
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,170
Where's a horse?

801
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,140
It's closed for the day,

802
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,640
so you can't complete your mission here.

803
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,310
(They can't carry out the mission here since it's closed today.)

804
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,310
- I see. - A Horse zodiac celebrity.

805
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,340
(Complete a mission with a celebrity born in the Year of the Horse)

806
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,340
We'll call a celebrity born in the Year of the Horse.

807
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,610
(The members want to try the upper left square.)

808
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,380
- Or find a citizen. - A Horse zodiac celebrity.

809
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,080
Which celebrities were born in the Year of the Horse?

810
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,910
(They need to find a celebrity born in the Year of the Horse.)

811
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,780
- Who has the Horse zodiac sign? - Who has one?

812
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,180
- Or maybe... - Aren't there a lot of them?

813
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,380
- How about Jin Sung? - What?

814
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,380
Weren't you born in the same year?

815
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,090
(Jin Sung was born in 1960, the Year of the Mouse.)

816
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,550
- He's older than me. - What about those born in 1978?

817
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,350
- They have the Horse zodiac sign. - Right?

818
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,060
- They have the Horse zodiac sign? - They do.

819
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,660
- Many celebs were born in 1978. - What's next?

820
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,090
- No, that's 1979. - Eun Ji Won.

821
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,060
- Oh, Ji Won. - Ji Won?

822
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,030
(Eun Ji Won was born in 1978, the Year of the Horse.)

823
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,500
- Ji Won. - Yes, Ji Won was born in 1978.

824
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,900
There's also Kim Yong Myung.

825
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,330
- Really? - Yong Myung?

826
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,470
He was born in 1978.

827
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,970
- Year 1978. - The year 1978.

828
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,840
Soo Young of Girls' Generation.

829
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,170
Was she born in 1978?

830
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,070
- Those born in 1990 too? - Right, 1990.

831
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,710
(Soo Young was born in 1990, the Year of the Horse.)

832
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,810
Those born in 1990. They count as well.

833
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,640
- That opens up many options. - There's Kyoung Pyo.

834
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,480
(Ko Kyoung Pyo was born in 1990, the Year of the Horse.)

835
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,780
Ko Kyoung Pyo.

836
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,250
- Was he born in 1990? - In 1990?

837
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,750
- Kyoung Pyo... - Yang Yo Seop,

838
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,450
- Soo Young? - Samuel, and Jun Ho.

839
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,020
(Among them all, who will they call?)

840
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,620
Jun Ho's a great option.

841
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,050
- Mr. Wang Jong Geun. - I don't know his number.

842
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,090
Why don't I reach out to Soo Young?

843
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,520
- Soo Young works out... - What about Kim Soo Yong?

844
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,860
- at our gym. - Kim Soo Yong?

845
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,190
(Soo Dragon was born in the Year of the Horse.)

846
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,490
- Soo Yong was recently reborn. - I didn't mean him.

847
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,590
Not him?

848
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,360
(But Jae Seok was talking about Soo Young of Girls' Generation.)

849
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,400
- Girls' Generation... - Soo Young of Girls' Generation.

850
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,960
- Exactly. - Soo Young works out...

851
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,700
at our gym.

852
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,970
She appeared on Running Man a lot.

853
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,070
- Right. - Of course.

854
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,040
(Reaching out to her right away)

855
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,840
- Are you calling her? - Yes.

856
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,010
She could be working out in Cheongdam-dong.

857
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,780
- Hello? - Soo Young.

858
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Hello?

859
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,710
- Hello? - She doesn't recognize the number.

860
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,520
- Gosh, hello. - Hey, it's Seok.

861
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,250
- She must be flustered. - Soo Young,

862
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,650
you must be surprised to get a call from me.

863
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,890
Right.

864
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,890
- It's just that... - Exactly.

865
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,730
- I haven't called her in a while. - When did you last call her?

866
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,860
She must be surprised, given that I haven't called her in a while.

867
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,930
Soo Young.

868
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,070
- Yes, Jae Seok. - Weren't you born...

869
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,170
in the Year of the Horse?

870
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,770
- The Year of the Horse? - Yes.

871
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,840
Yes, I was born in the Year of the Horse.

872
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,510
- Really? - Exactly!

873
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,770
(They confirm that she was born in the Year of the Horse.)

874
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,170
- I knew it. - Congratulations!

875
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,180
You were born in the Year of the Horse.

876
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,340
- That's right. - Soo Young.

877
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,610
- Yes? - You used to be...

878
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:45,620
(Tossing the bait)

879
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,350
on Running Man a lot.

880
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,550
- Of course. - Is this how it's going to be?

881
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,550
How could you not show up for so long?

882
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,190
I need to be asked to be on the show first.

883
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,750
- Right. - We'll invite her right now.

884
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,260
Was it our fault?

885
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,320
- That's right. - I see.

886
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,790
- Then we apologize. - Sorry about that.

887
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,460
(Apologizing suddenly)

888
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,860
Invite her over right now.

889
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,930
(Jae Seok failed his initial plan.)

890
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,300
- Sorry about that. - Sorry about that.

891
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,970
Soo Young, can we have you on the show today?

892
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,800
(Going straight to it)

893
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,500
- Now? - Sudden, isn't it?

894
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,740
- Soo Young. - Where are you right now?

895
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,140
- Where is she? - It's nothing serious.

896
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,470
We have to complete a mission...

897
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,440
- for Running Man. - Celebrities with the Horse zodiac.

898
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,840
I don't know what we'll be doing,

899
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,780
(Muttering)

900
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,250
but we have to complete a mission...

901
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,780
with a celebrity born in the Year of the Horse.

902
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,020
I see.

903
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,450
Soo Young, if it's all right with you...

904
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,590
Her voice dropped.

905
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,590
- Yes? - She sounds flustered.

906
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,520
Your voice dropped a lot just now.

907
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,360
- Ask if she's on the fence. - She needs to go to the salon.

908
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,590
- I bet it's giving her a headache. - Please let me know...

909
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,530
- if you need to think about it. - Does she need to think about it?

910
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,890
(Chuckling)

911
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,660
I'm in the middle of a skin care treatment.

912
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,700
- I see. - Is that so?

913
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,330
I'm in the middle of a skin care treatment.

914
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,670
(She's currently getting a skin care treatment.)

915
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,800
- Then she can't come to us. - We get it.

916
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,140
- Soo Young... - Do what you need to do.

917
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,740
But I could... Hold on.

918
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,170
Is it necessary for you to complete this mission?

919
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,740
- Of course. - That's right.

920
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,980
She's loyal, isn't she?

921
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,210
The members are scruffy too,

922
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,750
so we don't look any better.

923
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,350
(Will Soo Young accept the sudden invitation?)

924
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,110
- Is that so? - Yes.

925
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,020
Soo Young, could you make some time for us?

926
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,520
I guess I should help you guys out.

927
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,560
- Yes! - Nice!

928
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,690
I guess I should help you guys out.

929
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,720
- Yes! - Nice!

930
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,760
- Of course. - We knew you'd come through.

931
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,960
(They succeed in inviting Soo Young, born in the Year of the Horse!)

932
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,030
- How loyal of her. - Girls' Generation rocks.

933
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,090
- That's so cool of her. - What a relief.

934
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,360
Girls' Generation never disappoints.

935
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,800
- Of course! - Where are you right now?

936
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,130
We'll head over to you.

937
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,730
I'm in Gangnam.

938
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,740
- Nice. Gangnam's great for us. - Okay, got it.

939
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,670
(They hear that she is in Gangnam, where they will do the transaction.)

940
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,270
We have to go to Gangnam anyway,

941
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,170
so I'll call you when we get there.

942
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,770
(It is 25 minutes away.)

943
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,710
- I see. - Ask how long she needs.

944
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,010
- How long... - Just give me some time.

945
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,310
- Got it. How long? - How much time?

946
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,350
- An hour? - About an hour.

947
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,620
- Sounds good. Perfect. - That's great.

948
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,280
Are you on the Karrot app by any chance?

949
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,450
- Seriously? - Why would you ask her that?

950
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,990
Did you think you could sell her the drawing?

951
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,060
(So petty)

952
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,660
Soo Young, don't listen to him.

953
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,490
Soo Young, I'll call you in about an hour.

954
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,260
(They agree to meet 1 hour later,)

955
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,960
- Got it, Jae Seok. - Thank you.

956
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,730
(and end the call with Soo Young.)

957
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,030
- Thanks! - Okay!

958
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,660
- Thank you. - She's amazing.

959
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,070
- Soo Young's the best. - That was really cool of her.

960
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,530
- We got it on the first try. - Soo Young...

961
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,900
- That was our first try. - She's always been cool.

962
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,570
(I knew it.)

963
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,400
As for this...

964
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,470
(At Gangnam, and this is also at Gangnam.)

965
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,110
- We can upload the drawing... - Yes?

966
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,110
while we're on our way to meet Soo Young.

967
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,140
- That's right. - Sure.

968
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,580
(They have a bit of time before they have to meet Soo Young.)

969
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,780
Why don't we complete a mission before we head out?

970
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,640
Let's say we got this.

971
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,050
- Then... - Then rather than this,

972
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,250
we could make a bingo in this straight line.

973
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,550
This is also an option.

974
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,650
- Really? - There's a zoo nearby.

975
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,650
(Gwacheon)

976
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,650
That's right.

977
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,120
- Right. - Seoul Grand Park.

978
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,720
(In progress)

979
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,420
(Guessing that the horse-related location is the nearby park)

980
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,390
You're right!

981
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,290
- Seoul Grand Park is nearby. - Exactly.

982
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,390
- Seoul Grand Park. - This place is closed today, so...

983
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,130
I went there a lot as a kid.

984
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,500
- Is this a racetrack? - Let's go there.

985
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,360
If we're lucky, we might get to take a photo.

986
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,570
(In progress)

987
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,630
- Let's go there. - If we're lucky,

988
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,500
(They plan to go to a location related to horses...)

989
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,670
we might get to take a photo.

990
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,670
Let's go there.

991
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,440
(and also take a picture with a horse.)

992
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,800
Let's go for the 2-for-1 special.

993
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,970
- Here. - A location related to horses.

994
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,140
Find a location related to horses within 30 minutes.

995
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,570
(Then...)

996
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,470
Sure. Let's attempt that.

997
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,570
We'll give that a try.

998
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,040
(They attempt to find the horse-related location!)

999
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,910
- Here... - Have you made your decision?

1000
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,010
- Yes. - You see,

1001
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,510
to complete the mission, you must drive there yourself.

1002
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,520
- Right. - You'll be given the rules...

1003
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,380
(The rule will be given to them in front of the car outside!)

1004
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,220
- once you're in the van. - I love it. Let's go.

1005
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,550
I'm a fan of Girls' Generation.

1006
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,320
(In progress)

1007
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,920
- You're what? - I'm a fan of Girls' Generation.

1008
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,590
(Find a location related to horses within 30 minutes)

1009
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,790
- You're right. - Of course.

1010
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,660
- What now? - I'll explain the mission...

1011
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,290
(She explains the rules in earnest.)

1012
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,960
about finding a location related to horses.

1013
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,300
You must drive yourselves there, and you have designated seats.

1014
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,700
- What? - Designated seats.

1015
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,800
(Designated seats?)

1016
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,130
- Se Chan will drive. - What?

1017
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,240
- I drive? - Haha takes the passenger seat.

1018
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,240
- Okay. - In the far back,

1019
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,340
- Jae Seok, Seok Jin, and Jong Kook. - Okay.

1020
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,810
The women sit in the second row.

1021
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,180
- Why? - Why is that?

1022
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,810
There's a reason for the designated seating.

1023
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,280
The GPS is programmed in English.

1024
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,120
What?

1025
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,850
What?

1026
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,820
- What? - Seriously?

1027
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,490
- Why am I... - These guys...

1028
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,890
- I'm in the back? - These guys...

1029
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,060
- These guys... - Turn right! Turn left!

1030
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,930
- That's it. - He grew up in Dongducheon.

1031
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,000
(Se Chan grew up in Dongducheon!)

1032
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,300
Turn right, turn left.

1033
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,160
(He used to work part-time in Itaewon.)

1034
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,360
- I used to work in Itaewon. - Hey, nice.

1035
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,470
(Haha and Se Chan will take an English listening test.)

1036
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,900
- It's not like they're... - Hey.

1037
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,840
- They know left and right. - Hyung Seon, it's the new year.

1038
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,200
(Upset)

1039
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,210
What about the GPS screen?

1040
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,210
(What about the navigation screen?)

1041
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,470
The screen is blank. They must rely on the audio...

1042
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,110
- Come on. - and find the location...

1043
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,280
(They have to reach the destination with only English audio guidance.)

1044
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,410
- we put in. - We can do that.

1045
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,680
You can do that.

1046
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,180
The hint is that the location has something to do with horses.

1047
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,450
- Okay. - You must get there...

1048
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,690
- within 30 minutes. - We can do that.

1049
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,750
Okay, that's fine.

1050
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,390
- We can do that. - We can do it.

1051
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,960
- I have a question. - You guys...

1052
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,090
They must've clapped and cheered thinking this was a great idea.

1053
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,130
(It's annoying.)

1054
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,600
- You guys planned this so well. - You look down on them too much.

1055
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,860
They belittle us.

1056
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,030
- Haha can understand it. - You didn't put Ji Hyo with him.

1057
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,800
(Thankfully, they weren't assigned as the driver and the assistant.)

1058
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,870
- Right? - Those two should be together.

1059
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,570
We have a shot at least.

1060
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,300
(The production team had enough conscience...)

1061
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,240
- Ji Hyo should be up front. - I can understand pretty well.

1062
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,610
(to let them avoid the worst combination.)

1063
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,540
- I too... - What do you think of them?

1064
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,380
I can spell the word "kitchen."

1065
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,940
Can you spell "kitchen?"

1066
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,280
- I can. - Spell it.

1067
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,050
K-I-C-H...

1068
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,250
- Wrong! - K-I...

1069
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,720
(Wrong)

1070
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,850
- C-H... - Wrong!

1071
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,250
(Ji Hyo forgot the T.)

1072
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,550
- Wrong! - You're wrong.

1073
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,550
- C-H? - This is bad.

1074
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,760
Se Chan, you spell "kitchen."

1075
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,790
I can just fine. K-I-T-C-H-E-N.

1076
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,060
That's it!

1077
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,690
(Se Chan is correct.)

1078
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,630
K-I-T?

1079
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,500
(Triumphant and proud)

1080
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,560
- There's a T. - What about "chicken?"

1081
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,130
What about "chicken?"

1082
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,100
- "Chicken." - Oh, come on...

1083
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,870
Please, Haha.

1084
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,370
(Mr. Give Me Chocolate tries to brush it off by acting cute.)

1085
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,070
- There's a secret? - It's a secret.

1086
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,340
You have to drive to the location,

1087
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,280
and you only get one chance.

1088
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,080
The moment you get in the car, you're banned from using your phone.

1089
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,550
- Okay. - That's nothing.

1090
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,750
- Get in the car. - What do you take us for?

1091
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,080
(Of course.)

1092
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,850
- Let's do this. - You belittle us.

1093
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,290
- Let's go. - Let's get in.

1094
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,060
(They get into the car with confidence.)

1095
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,220
- Get in the car. - Haha's English is pretty decent.

1096
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,060
- Yes. Haha traveled a lot. - This mission...

1097
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,230
That's hilarious.

1098
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,660
Hey, "kitchen..."

1099
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,800
Hi, nice to meet you.

1100
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,930
- Hi. - Hi.

1101
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,200
(Warming up with a simple conversation)

1102
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,230
K-I-T-H?

1103
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,100
K-I-T-H?

1104
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,170
(All of a sudden)

1105
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,740
- K-I-T. - K-I-T.

1106
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,640
- K-I-T? - There's a T.

1107
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,070
(Relaxed)

1108
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,750
Hang on. Where's the GPS?

1109
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,780
(The screen is hidden behind a sheet of black paper.)

1110
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,380
Hang on. Where's the GPS?

1111
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,580
Haha, don't you understand a bit of English?

1112
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,660
(Haha, who was born in Germany, is the only one they can trust.)

1113
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,920
- Haha traveled a lot. - Seok Jin.

1114
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,920
- He's been abroad a lot. - Haha speaks some English.

1115
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,690
Haha. "Turn right."

1116
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,960
"Turn left."

1117
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,190
- "Right" is right. - Yes.

1118
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,390
- "Left" is left. - Yes.

1119
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,660
- "Go street." - Go straight ahead.

1120
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,470
It's not that. If the instructions are in English,

1121
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,140
- You guys. - it won't just be left and right.

1122
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,040
- It says all sorts of things. - It's not that.

1123
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,910
They understand "turn left" and "turn right."

1124
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,070
(The brainiacs in the back feel nervous...)

1125
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,840
- It won't be just that. - I don't think...

1126
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,040
(because they can't hear the GPS directions.)

1127
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,180
- it'll be like that. - "Reduce speed."

1128
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,780
(The Empty Heads in the middle aren't reliable.)

1129
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,910
It'll say something like "50m."

1130
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,680
"Thirty meters." I don't know.

1131
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,920
(The ones in the front are the worst.)

1132
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,280
If not meters, it'll mention times.

1133
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,360
(Will they be able to get there using only English directions?)

1134
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,690
Let's give it a go.

1135
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,590
I'm worried about the two at the front.

1136
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,460
- Don't be. - I'm worried.

1137
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,590
(They depart in Gwacheon.)

1138
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,330
Guys. We'll set off, then.

1139
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,590
Let's go.

1140
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,860
It'll be tough to get there in 30 minutes. It won't be easy.

1141
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,200
(Which horse-related place is within 30-minute radius?)

1142
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,830
Yes, I'm ready.

1143
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,770
You set off at 11:40am,

1144
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,770
so you must arrive...

1145
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,370
- by 12:10pm. - My gosh.

1146
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:21,380
(They have 30 minutes left until 12:10pm.)

1147
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,610
Let's have a go.

1148
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,110
- Gosh. - Can we get there?

1149
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,140
There's time.

1150
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,820
(Will they be able to find the place related to horses in time?)

1151
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,450
Se Chan, you can do it.

1152
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,020
- Yes. I can do it. - Just do it.

1153
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,820
(Extremely tense)

1154
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,050
- Impossible is nothing. - Yes.

1155
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,190
Do you know... Let's exit first.

1156
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,520
(They head out of the parking lot first.)

1157
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,790
- We must exit first. - Did they say where?

1158
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,760
We could see a zebra at the Grand Park.

1159
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,660
(The GPS lady gets to work.)

1160
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,830
What? Did it say 300m?

1161
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,800
(He can't hear it.)

1162
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,970
It's saying something.

1163
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,130
- In 300m... - Oh, really?

1164
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,100
- I don't hear anything. - We must keep quiet.

1165
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,000
(As expected, people in the back can't hear it.)

1166
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,740
- What if... - Keep quiet.

1167
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,440
In 300 meters, make a right turn.

1168
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,540
- What? Did it say 300m? - It's saying something.

1169
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,180
- In 30m... - In 100m...

1170
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,450
It said "right."

1171
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,180
Speed bumps ahead in a minute.

1172
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,820
- What? - What are you saying?

1173
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,980
(Frustrated)

1174
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,580
It's frustrating without the screen.

1175
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,990
(People in the back are even more frustrated as they can't hear it.)

1176
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,890
- I can't hear well from here. - No.

1177
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,920
Haha, lean back. I can't see that mirror.

1178
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,020
In a minute, make a right turn.

1179
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,360
- "Right turn." - "Right turn."

1180
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,560
Make a right turn.

1181
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,960
- "Right turn." - "Right turn."

1182
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,730
- Yes. He can understand. - They're managing.

1183
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,030
(They know left from right.)

1184
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,570
Turn right at the end.

1185
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,570
We need to guess a lot.

1186
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,570
It's just 30 minutes away.

1187
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,110
- It won't take that long. - Yes.

1188
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,210
Right turn.

1189
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:28,310
(They pass the first hurdle.)

1190
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,180
It's a wide, straight road.

1191
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,650
- It's not easy. - It's not easy.

1192
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,480
- A wide, straight road. - Do we go straight?

1193
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,720
- Yes. - Keep listening.

1194
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,350
In a minute, take the overpass on the right.

1195
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,060
- "Right." - "Overpass, right..."

1196
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,060
- Up there... - The overpass.

1197
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,330
- Yes. - "Over," get up there.

1198
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,330
Well done.

1199
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:47,200
(They guess that they must take the overpass on the right.)

1200
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,830
- The overpass. - "Over," get up there.

1201
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,330
Did it tell you to take the overpass?

1202
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,870
- Did you hear that? - No, just "right."

1203
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,700
It said "over," so isn't this it?

1204
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,700
- Because it said "over?" - Haha's catching some things.

1205
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,640
(Feeling proud)

1206
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,610
He's really good at catching stuff.

1207
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,810
You need to concentrate.

1208
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,210
(The get on the overpass with some good guesswork.)

1209
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,080
He's really good at catching stuff.

1210
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,380
You need to concentrate.

1211
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,810
Continue straight until you hear the next instruction.

1212
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,450
- "Straction?" - What?

1213
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,780
- What's "straction?" - "Straction?"

1214
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,880
Don't you just go straight?

1215
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,990
Just go. Let's just go "straction."

1216
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,590
We're doing good.

1217
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,660
(Proud Empty Heads)

1218
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,590
It's working.

1219
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,530
(Haha's like a documentary director.)

1220
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,260
You sound like a documentary producer.

1221
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,900
You're like a documentary director.

1222
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,630
Director.

1223
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,100
With the outfit and everything.

1224
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,600
(English Travels)

1225
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,770
- Director. - Seriously.

1226
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,300
The two at the front aren't dressed like celebrities.

1227
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,340
Wait, quiet!

1228
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,040
- They're not dressed like celebs. - Wait, quiet!

1229
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,080
In 700m, take a right road at Suseo IC.

1230
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,410
- Wait, quiet! - In 700m,

1231
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,380
take a right road at Suseo IC.

1232
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,410
- "IC." It can see us. - "I see."

1233
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,380
- "IC." It can see us. - "I see."

1234
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,090
The IC, the exit, you fools!

1235
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:47,560
- "IC." - Oh, "IC." Sorry.

1236
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,390
(Oh, IC as in InterChange.)

1237
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,130
- "Interchange." - "I see."

1238
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,260
(He shouted "I see" as he heard it.)

1239
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,290
- "IC." "I see." - They thought...

1240
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,200
it meant they could see us.

1241
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,970
"They can see us. 'I see.'"

1242
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,330
Oh, it was "IC."

1243
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,600
(Feeling embarrassed)

1244
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,740
"They can see us. 'I see.'"

1245
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,840
- My word. - "They can see us."

1246
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,310
- "IC" stands for "interchange." - The interchange.

1247
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,710
(But they entered the IC safely.)

1248
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,080
It means you should take the exit.

1249
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,050
- I need to study English. - Though it's not clear from here.

1250
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,780
- Okay, now... - It's not clear from here.

1251
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,420
In 600m, use the green lane...

1252
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,650
to enter the city expressway on the left.

1253
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,590
In 600m, use the green lane...

1254
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,120
to enter the city expressway on the left.

1255
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,030
- I didn't hear that. - Left, left.

1256
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,300
"Six hundred." Go 600m then turn left.

1257
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:31,130
- Gosh. - You're good.

1258
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,130
(He barely got the 600m and left instruction.)

1259
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,300
- Left, left. - Take the left lane.

1260
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,370
- Stay on the left. - Oh, Suseo IC.

1261
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,980
(As Haha said, they exit via Suseo IC on the left.)

1262
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,510
Are you sure?

1263
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,980
(Those who struggles with English are managing to go correctly.)

1264
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,510
- Stay in the lane. - Is this right?

1265
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,010
- I think it's right. - It's right.

1266
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,450
(Isn't this the direction to Yangjae?)

1267
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,080
Aren't we headed to Yangjae?

1268
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,680
Is this right?

1269
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,480
- No? Is this Yangjae? - Are you sure?

1270
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,090
- It looks like Yangjae. - I think that's it.

1271
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,890
- Yes. - Isn't it Daechi-dong?

1272
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,690
(Isn't the destination Daechi-dong?)

1273
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:52,890
- Why? - Why?

1274
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,330
(Daechi-dong has nothing to do with horses.)

1275
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,320
- Why? - It's horse-related.

1276
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,460
- How so? - What about Daechi and horses?

1277
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,230
- No? - No.

1278
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,160
(She pretended to be sharp.)

1279
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,800
Daechi-dong has nothing to do with horses.

1280
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Is it Maljukgeori?

1281
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,400
- Maljukgeori. - Maljukgeori.

1282
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,700
Maljukgeori in Yangjae-dong.

1283
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,170
I think you're right.

1284
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,440
(Is Maljukgeori in Yangjae-dong their destination?)

1285
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,340
It's Maljukgeori.

1286
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,540
I think Maljukgeori is in Yangjae.

1287
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:15,810
(The navigation system is really leading them toward Yangjae.)

1288
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,780
- Maljukgeori? - I think that's it.

1289
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,640
Maljukgeori is the old name for that area.

1290
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,080
- Yes. - Surprisingly.

1291
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,980
I think we followed well so far.

1292
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:20,220
(Is their destination really Maljukgeori, as they guessed?)

1293
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,150
- Do you? - Yes.

1294
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,480
Don't you need to stick to the left?

1295
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,320
In 500m, use the third lane from the left...

1296
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
to keep right to the underpass.

1297
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,230
- "Underpass?" - It said "left."

1298
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,290
- What did it say? - "Underpass."

1299
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,900
- "Underpass?" - "Left, underpass."

1300
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,460
- "Left?" - "Left."

1301
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,200
"Left, underpass?"

1302
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,900
(Thinking hard)

1303
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,330
- "Left?" - "Left."

1304
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,970
"Left, underpass?"

1305
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,300
Oh, it's that. On the left,

1306
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:47,080
- To go underground. - Oh, the underground underpass.

1307
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:50,250
(Correct)

1308
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,010
- I see. - "Under."

1309
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,550
"Under."

1310
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,680
- We're doing pretty good. - We are.

1311
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,120
It's not the Undertaker...

1312
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,020
Use the third lane from the left to keep right to the underpass.

1313
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,290
(You're right!)

1314
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,550
- "Underpass." - We're right.

1315
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,060
- Go straight on. - Okay.

1316
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,060
I'll stick to the left because it said so.

1317
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,890
(Feeling proud)

1318
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,160
(Just in time, the entrance to the underpass comes into view.)

1319
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,960
It's Seongsu Bridge.

1320
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,060
Your English will improve a lot now.

1321
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,460
- We're doing good. - We're managing.

1322
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,700
You're from Dongducheon.

1323
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,070
- And I worked in Itaewon. - Yes.

1324
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,640
- Itaewon! - Cross!

1325
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,800
(Empty Head Cross)

1326
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,040
(If they keep going like this,)

1327
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,770
- Gosh. - You're doing great.

1328
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,610
- Is this the right way? - My word...

1329
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,170
(will they be able to mark 1 more space on the bingo card?)

1330
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,940
Everyone.

1331
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,780
- Yes? What? - Auntie's car and...

1332
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,480
You went the wrong way, so your trip will take seven more minutes.

1333
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,890
- What? - You went the wrong way,

1334
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:32,360
(They went the wrong way?)

1335
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:29,950
so your trip will take seven more minutes.

1336
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,990
What?

1337
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,460
- It'll take seven more minutes? - Earlier, we...

1338
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,260
(A little while ago, right before entering the underpass)

1339
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,630
In 500m, use the 3rd lane from the left...

1340
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,430
to keep right to the underpass.

1341
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,170
In 500m, use the 3rd lane from the left...

1342
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,170
to keep right to the underpass.

1343
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,640
- "Pass left?" - "Underpass?"

1344
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,700
It said to go left.

1345
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,610
(The GPS directed them to the road next to the underpass.)

1346
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,870
- "Left turn." - What did it say?

1347
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,970
"Underpass."

1348
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,310
- "Left underpass." - "Underpass?"

1349
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,380
- One more time. - Oh, it's that. On the left,

1350
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,010
- the underground tunnel. - Underground.

1351
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,410
- The underpass. - It means to go into the underpass.

1352
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,150
I should stay on the left...

1353
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,020
(They entered the underpass instead of the road on the right side.)

1354
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,750
since it said "left."

1355
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,120
I get it. Itaewon is my homeground, you know?

1356
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,220
(In the end, they excitedly went off course after hearing "Underpass.")

1357
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,420
- Right. Cross! - Itaewon!

1358
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,690
- We got delayed by seven minutes? - Earlier, we went under,

1359
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,090
but it must've been a left turn on the right side.

1360
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,960
- I guess so. - Right?

1361
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,030
- Gosh, we might fail the mission. - Will we arrive after ten minutes?

1362
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,260
- I think we will. - Or we could wait for the left...

1363
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,800
- Will we arrive after ten minutes? - I think we will.

1364
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,400
(By going off course, they gained 2km in distance and 7 minutes.)

1365
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,270
I can't hear the instructions, so I have no clue.

1366
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,800
We're not doing a U-turn here.

1367
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,740
(If they get there after 12:10pm, they'll fail the mission.)

1368
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,810
We must be going back down after a left turn.

1369
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,570
- Oh, no. The traffic is bad. - The traffic is bad.

1370
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,510
(They need to hurry, but the road is jammed.)

1371
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,780
- What did it say? - We're in trouble.

1372
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,380
- "Sorry?" - In a minute,

1373
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,450
- make a left turn. - "Left turn."

1374
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,520
It might be tough if we wait in the left-turn lane.

1375
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,080
(Anxious)

1376
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,780
- No, but this... - But we have to make a left turn.

1377
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,820
- It will... - Or go straight and do a U-turn?

1378
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,050
- It will only be two red lights. - These days, the roads...

1379
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,690
- Only 2 red lights? - Yes, it'll only be 2 red lights.

1380
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,860
- It's rush hour. - I can just tell.

1381
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,190
- Don't be so anxious. - By the way,

1382
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,790
going straight and doing a U-turn is seriously...

1383
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,590
- It was a seriously bad idea. - I mean,

1384
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,760
- if the signal is short here... - Seok Jin,

1385
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,160
I take this road every time!

1386
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,400
Whenever I travel to and from Anyang.

1387
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,830
- Why are you shouting, punk? - Well, you were...

1388
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,970
- I tried... - Do you want a beating?

1389
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,570
I tried to speak nicely, but you wouldn't listen.

1390
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,840
(They're arguing in the back seat while in a rush.)

1391
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,140
- Seok Jin. - Do you want a beating?

1392
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,570
- What a happy family. - But you wouldn't listen.

1393
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,080
Seok Jin, he'd get punched once,

1394
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
and you would...

1395
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,450
- Seok Jin. - I know that too.
- I must knock him out in one go. - You know,

1396
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,180
I take this road every week.

1397
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,490
- Yes, every week when I visit home. - Every week?

1398
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:13,520
(They go left as Jong Kook said, just before getting punched by him.)

1399
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,490
- Oh, this is the road to Anyang? - This one? Of course.

1400
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,290
I take this road every time I visit home.

1401
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Okay, we have the light.

1402
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,360
- Be quiet now! - Just a moment.

1403
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,530
One moment.

1404
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,230
Red light and speed camera ahead...

1405
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,930
Red light and speed camera ahead in 300m.

1406
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,940
Speed limit is 50km per hour.

1407
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,170
- It's just about... - It says there's a camera.

1408
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,070
watching out for the speed camera.

1409
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,780
What are those guys listening to?

1410
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,280
(Nervous)

1411
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,140
Excuse me, Director.

1412
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,950
This is bad. I'm getting worried now.

1413
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,950
- I thought we could do it earlier. - What are you guys listening to?

1414
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,150
Tell us a few things.

1415
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,820
- Tell us. What... - I think...

1416
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,950
I think it said something like "Flower."

1417
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,760
- Is it a flower shop in Yangjae? - Yes, flower...

1418
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,260
Excuse me, Director.

1419
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,730
- It just said "Speed camera." - What?

1420
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,230
- And it said "Flower." - "Flower?"

1421
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,430
Does the navigation system say things like "Flower?"

1422
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,930
(Suspicious)

1423
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:58,330
- It said 300... - Speed limit is 50km per hour.

1424
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,340
- "Flower." - Just say what you heard.

1425
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,740
- "Flower?" A flower shop? - "Flower."

1426
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,770
I think it's a flower shop.

1427
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:03,770
- It's kind of long. - Is it?

1428
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,680
- Speed limit is 50km per hour. - Just say what you heard.

1429
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,980
(Flower?)

1430
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,050
- "Flower?" A flower shop? - "Flower."

1431
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,180
- It's kind of long. - Is it?

1432
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,080
It's not "Flower." It's "Per hour."

1433
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,620
What's "Per hour?"

1434
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,620
It's not "Flower." It's "Per hour."

1435
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,150
What's "Per hour?"

1436
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,150
(Never heard of it)

1437
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,960
- "Per hour." - "Per hour."

1438
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,060
So...

1439
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,690
- I think it's kilometers per hour. - Well...

1440
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,130
- It's about the speed limit. - Yes, right.

1441
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,960
(Blinking slowly)

1442
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,300
- "Flower." - "Flower."

1443
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,030
(Still thinking about it)

1444
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,500
- "Flower." - I knew it was weird that...

1445
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,930
(Laughing)

1446
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,730
- the navigation system said... - "IC!"

1447
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,100
What are you even listening to?

1448
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:35,370
(They misheard "Per hour" as "Flower in English.)

1449
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,470
(Laughing)

1450
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,440
- Ye Eun has burst out laughing. - "IC!"

1451
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,670
- Mister! - Ye Eun...

1452
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,710
- can't stop laughing. - "I see." It's looking at me.

1453
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:45,480
(They almost headed to Yangjae Flower Market Center.)

1454
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,510
"I see." It's looking at me.

1455
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,580
- "Flower." - It's looking at us.

1456
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,310
"Per hour" became "Flower."

1457
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,450
This isn't easy, though. Right, Haha?

1458
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,620
Gosh, "Flower."

1459
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,890
- It's not the English that we use. - Then...

1460
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,220
(Empty Heads are thirsty from embarrassment.)

1461
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,890
"Flower." That's so funny.

1462
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,360
I wish I could laugh too.

1463
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,260
(Glaring)

1464
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,260
Hey, Haha. Why does your face look so yellow today?

1465
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,200
Hey, Haha. Why does your face look so yellow today?

1466
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,830
It's because...

1467
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,840
- Ye Eun did his makeup. - Oh, really?

1468
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,100
- Ye Eun was... - You're right.

1469
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,140
(Before driving, during the break)

1470
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,970
Hey, this is not bad at all.

1471
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,810
(Ye Eun and Haha)

1472
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:16,510
(Contouring Haha's face)

1473
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
- Don't do too much, Ye Eun. - Okay.

1474
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,140
Ye Eun, you can stop now.

1475
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,750
But there's the T-line, you know?

1476
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,380
(She keeps going.)

1477
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,380
Right here.

1478
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,720
About this much. This much is good.

1479
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,220
- She's a makeup artist. - You're right.

1480
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,650
(She used him as her canvas...)

1481
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,920
- But why is his face so yellow? - Kind of like jaundice.

1482
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:27,690
(and ended up creating a jaundiced look.)

1483
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,120
- But his face is so yellow. - You know,

1484
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,560
- Don't you think? - you need new makeup.

1485
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,430
- The color is... - Hey, I told you it was yellow.

1486
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,490
- You contoured it way too much... - I mean...

1487
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,560
Why is your face the shade of poop?

1488
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,300
You look like you're jaundiced right now.

1489
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,330
- Your face is the shade of poop. - It kind of...

1490
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,640
(He looks like a sickly, yellow Smurf.)

1491
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,340
- You're right. - What? The shade of poop?

1492
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,340
No, it's just yellow.

1493
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,770
- You're trying so hard to be artsy. - Your face is...

1494
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,240
(Teasing)

1495
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,010
Your foundation is too yellow.

1496
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,180
I'm not trying to be artsy!

1497
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,740
- You little punk. - You're totally trying to be artsy.

1498
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,180
- Spend some money on your face. - Trying to be artsy.

1499
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,550
Why is your face the shade of poop?

1500
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,680
Buy one that's bright.

1501
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,920
(An avant-garde artist who walks around with dirt on his face)

1502
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,820
- Yes, buy a bright shade, Haha. - His face is the shade of poop.

1503
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,890
- Not one that has a yellow base. - All right.

1504
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,850
- Hey, listen carefully up there. - Okay.

1505
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,290
(Focus.)

1506
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,690
- The time for the mission... - Well, you know...

1507
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,160
(It seems like quite some time has passed.)

1508
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,530
- Just tell us what you hear. - Right.

1509
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:05,230
In 600m, make a left turn in Maebong Tunnel.

1510
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,660
- "Left turn, 600m." - Yes, you're right.

1511
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,470
Hey, it's been saying to make a left in 600m since a while ago.

1512
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,130
(Nervous)

1513
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,600
- Gosh, where are we going? - How many left turns are we making?

1514
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,870
(The destination is still unclear.)

1515
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,170
- Gosh, where are we going? - Where could we be going?

1516
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,940
Then, Maljukgeori must be right, Jae Seok.

1517
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,980
No, it's past that.

1518
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,410
(Maljukgeori, Yangjae Station, Maebong Station, Yangjaecheon)

1519
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,280
It's Maljukgeori.

1520
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,110
(If they turn left, Maljukgeori should be nearby.)

1521
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,880
- Is this it? - If it's in 600m...

1522
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,110
- "Make a left turn." - Okay, "Make a left turn." Now,

1523
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,680
(Is Maljukgeori their destination?)

1524
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,020
the navigation system will talk. Please be quiet.

1525
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,250
(They turn left as the GPS instructed.)

1526
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,080
Okay, quiet.

1527
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,320
- Hey, it's Nambusunhwan... - Accident-prone area ahead...

1528
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,390
in a minute.

1529
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,260
"In a minute, area?"

1530
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,560
- It said some kind of area, right? - "In a minute."

1531
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,490
- The nearby area, "In a minute?" - Yes, we must be getting close.

1532
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,030
- In a minute. - Yes, the nearby area...

1533
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,300
- One minute? - We're close by.

1534
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:42,130
(They misheard it, but they're actually close to the destination.)

1535
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,630
Hey, we're almost there.

1536
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,730
- The instructions are... - "In a minute."

1537
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,300
It really must be the Yangjae, Maljukgeori area.

1538
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,230
- Be quiet, everyone. - Yes.

1539
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,600
(For now, Maljukgeori seems the most probable.)

1540
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,840
- Maljukgeori is near Yangjae-dong. - Right.

1541
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,310
"Be quiet, everyone."

1542
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,540
- Hey, over there. - Keep going.

1543
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,240
(In fact, Maljukgeori is the only nearby horse-related place.)

1544
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,640
- Look around. - Where is it?

1545
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,810
See if there are any security guards.

1546
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,610
- It must be nearby. - Hey, if we succeed,

1547
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,110
(Mostly certain)

1548
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,150
- Hey, drive slowly. - it will be so amazing.

1549
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,450
- Drive slowly! - Okay.

1550
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,880
Go slowly.

1551
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,320
(Right then)

1552
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,050
In a minute,

1553
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,750
- keep right of the underpass. - "Keep right."

1554
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,750
In a minute,

1555
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,520
- keep right of the underpass. - "Keep right."

1556
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,190
- "Keep right." Go to the right. - Then, in 138m...

1557
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,330
(Underpass again?)

1558
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,060
Use the third lane from the left to keep right to the underpass.

1559
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,630
- "Left?" - "Underpass?"

1560
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,830
- The underground tunnel. - Underground.

1561
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,270
- The underpass. - It means to go into the underpass.

1562
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,670
- Keep right of the underpass. - "Keep right."

1563
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:23,070
(Again, it's the "Underpass" they heard before!)

1564
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,170
- "Keep right." Go to the right. - Then, in 138m,

1565
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:28,080
(Will they be able to go without mistakes this time?)

1566
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,310
- make a right turn. - Thirty-eight.

1567
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,110
- Yes. - You got it.

1568
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,610
- Oh, there's an underpass. - We might actually make it in time.

1569
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,710
- Yes. - You got it.

1570
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,080
(An underpass up ahead)

1571
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,250
- Oh, there's an underpass. - We might actually make it in time.

1572
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,450
- Yes. - You got it.

1573
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,850
We might actually make it in time.

1574
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,220
And in 10m,

1575
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,950
- you'll meet your destination. - What did it say now?

1576
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,490
"Destination?"

1577
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,920
Oh, we're nearly there.

1578
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,960
"Destination." We're at the place.

1579
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,160
Okay, let's be on the lookout now.

1580
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,230
(Their destination is right in front of them.)

1581
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,860
- You can make a right after this. - Right here. Right.

1582
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,100
- Yes, go all the way to the right. - Yes.

1583
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,560
- Over there. - It's there. We're almost there.

1584
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,570
(They head straight...)

1585
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,800
- Go down, then make a right turn. - Good, go all the way to the right.

1586
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:54,500
(for the underpass in front of them without a second thought.)

1587
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,370
I think we're almost out of time.

1588
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,340
- Up there. - "Destination?"

1589
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,910
"Destination." The place you're going to.

1590
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,540
- Good. We made it, Haha. - Haha, your hand...

1591
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,710
We must be near KEPCO.

1592
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,680
I used to go to a boxing gym near here in Yangjae.

1593
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,780
(Because I used to go to a boxing gym near here in Yangjae.)

1594
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,210
- Rocky Boxing. - Gosh, seriously.

1595
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,950
(He's confident that they've arrived at the correct place.)

1596
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,950
- I know this area so well. - Hey,

1597
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,550
Jong Kook doesn't usually get around much, but today...

1598
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,220
- Okay, let's go in smoothly. - Rocky Gym.

1599
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,320
(They exit the underpass just like that.)

1600
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,390
That's Rocky Gym, right there.

1601
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,860
But this isn't telling me to turn right.

1602
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,890
- We have to turn right here. - It said to turn right earlier.

1603
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,830
(The GPS is quiet, which is suspicious.)

1604
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,730
- Did it? - Yes, a right turn here.

1605
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,960
- Then, it should've said so. - Hang on. Then... You're right.

1606
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,530
(It does seem strange.)

1607
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,100
- But a right turn... - I think...

1608
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,860
- You went the wrong way. - Thirty... What?

1609
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,600
- You went the wrong way. - Okay.

1610
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,840
You've gone past the destination,

1611
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,210
so the navigation system was turned off.

1612
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,270
You've gone past the destination,

1613
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,410
(They're going the wrong way, past the destination?)

1614
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,880
so the navigation system was turned off.

1615
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,750
Then, back there, it wasn't... So,

1616
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,950
- not the underpass. On the side. - We were so close.

1617
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,750
- Hey, earlier... - It was Maljukgeori.

1618
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,880
- It was Maljukgeori. - Earlier,

1619
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,980
I kind of heard something like,

1620
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,120
"Keep right" and "Underpass."

1621
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,590
I think it said not to go into the underpass.

1622
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,860
Right. It was saying not to go in.

1623
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,860
And "Underpass."

1624
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,360
(Repeating the same mistake at the same underpass?)

1625
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,190
I think it said not to go into the underpass.

1626
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,590
Right. It was saying not to go in.

1627
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,460
Use the third lane from the left...

1628
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,130
to keep right to the underpass.

1629
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,770
- "Left?" - "Underpass?"

1630
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,430
(They failed the first time because they entered the underpass.)

1631
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,370
- The underground tunnel. - Underground.

1632
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,630
- The underpass. - It means to go into the underpass.

1633
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,700
In a minute,

1634
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,700
- keep right of the underpass. - "Keep right."

1635
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:03,270
(The same instruction as the first time)

1636
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,310
- "Keep right." Go to the right. - You're so smart.

1637
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:07,410
(They entered the underpass again the second time.)

1638
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,670
- Yes. - You got it.

1639
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,040
- Oh, there's an underpass. - We might actually make it in time.

1640
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,640
- Go down, then make a right turn. - Good, go all the way to the right.

1641
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,310
- Were we not supposed to go down? - We were on our way...

1642
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,250
(The underpass got them twice in the same way.)

1643
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,580
You still have time left.

1644
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:15,280
- You still have time left. - But...

1645
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,790
- Come to the horse-related place... - Hey.

1646
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,160
- that you can think of. - It's Maljukgeori.

1647
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,390
- Let's go to Maljukgeori. - Let's go.

1648
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,690
- I'll turn right first. - Hey, Maljukgeori.

1649
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,790
(They head to Maljukgeori, which is their last hope.)

1650
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,890
- Just go for now. - It's Maljukgeori.

1651
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:23,960
Turn right.

1652
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,360
Turn right, and go around.

1653
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,800
(The road they just passed)

1654
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,300
- Are we turning right here? - Turn right. Go up, yes.

1655
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,870
Oh, if we went past it...

1656
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:35,340
(If we passed by the destination)

1657
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,140
- We went past the destination. - It must be in Yangjae-dong.

1658
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,100
- It must be an intersection, right? - Right.

1659
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,310
- It's near here. - I'm sure.

1660
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,970
But I don't think we have much time.

1661
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,710
- Just go. It must be Maljukgeori. - Right.

1662
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,840
We don't have much time.

1663
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,180
Let's just go through the alleys.

1664
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,980
(Time is running out. They quickly head to Maljukgeori!)

1665
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,880
Go out to the intersection.

1666
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,220
- Here... No, go this way, - Isn't it farther down, then left?

1667
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,120
(With help from those familiar with Gangnam,)

1668
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,390
- and if you follow the big street, - Yes.

1669
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,390
(they're navigating the alleys.)

1670
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,890
we'll get to the Yangjae area.

1671
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,160
- We have to turn right there. - Do we go this way?

1672
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,120
(The underpass they entered by mistake)

1673
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,520
(Heading to the road on the right side)

1674
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,560
- Hey, I'm glad we had time. - Turn right here.

1675
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,430
- We could've made it here before. - It was right here.

1676
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,700
- This was... - So close.

1677
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,700
Actually, we didn't understand the word for underpass.

1678
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,170
(If only they said it quietly in the back)

1679
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,970
- If only they said it quietly. - We should've gone this way.

1680
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,440
I mean, we would've gone this way...

1681
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,070
(They'll never forget the word "underpass.")

1682
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,670
since we didn't understand the word, "Underpass."

1683
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,240
We would've understood.

1684
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,310
Gosh, so close.

1685
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,210
- I think we're almost out of time. - Make a right here.

1686
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,710
(They turn right.)

1687
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,140
- Yes, a right turn here. - Where is the destination? Hang on.

1688
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,180
(They found Maljukgeori.)

1689
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,810
- Oh, it's here. - This is it!

1690
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,480
- This is it. - Ye Eun.

1691
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,950
- Oh, it's here. - This is it!

1692
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:21,520
(They arrived safely at Maljukgeori, the destination they were sure of.)

1693
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,620
- This is it. - Ye Eun.

1694
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,050
I've heard so much about Maljukgeori,

1695
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,590
(They headed to Maljukgeori,)

1696
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,090
but I didn't know this was here.

1697
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,050
- I didn't know about this either. - The sign is here.

1698
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,450
(following their hunch without using the GPS.)

1699
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,590
Yangjae-dong is where Maljukgeori is.

1700
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,790
(Is Maljukgeori the right place?)

1701
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,460
- It's Exit Four. - I didn't know this was it.

1702
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,430
I also only knew it was around here.

1703
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,390
- I didn't know. - I didn't know either.

1704
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,960
- This is the Maljukgeori. - I came here often and didn't know.

1705
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,530
(They arrived at the nearby parking lot.)

1706
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,330
This is where Maljukgeori is.

1707
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,600
Oh, they were right here.

1708
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,800
- Get out. - Let's get out.

1709
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,200
All right. Get out and go in.

1710
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,400
Take a photo first.

1711
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,570
(Even if Maljukgeori is their destination,)

1712
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,610
- The time... - Are we okay...

1713
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,910
(they have to get there in time to succeed.)

1714
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,910
- on time? - We might be out of time.

1715
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,310
Or we might still have time.

1716
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,540
- Don't you think? - Let's go.

1717
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,640
Hurry up. Run!

1718
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,780
- It'd be awesome if we make it. - Do we have time?

1719
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,180
- Where is it? - Do we have time?

1720
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,720
(There's still a chance.)

1721
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,620
- We might make it. - Go.

1722
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,990
- Run. - Oh, boy.

1723
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,620
(They start running toward the Maljukgeori monument.)

1724
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,290
- To the side. - We might have enough time.

1725
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,760
- Let's go. - Just go and see.

1726
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,590
- Let's go. - Hey, Haha.

1727
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:05,030
(Will they be able to get there by 12:10pm?)

1728
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,290
It would've been over if we just turned right.

1729
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,090
Do we have time?

1730
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,560
Over there!

1731
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,900
Let's go and see.

1732
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:10,570
(The Maljukgeori monument is right in front of them.)

1733
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,730
- Is that it? - Just go. It's here.

1734
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,900
Is this it?

1735
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,670
Over there! Come this way!

1736
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,970
- Ji Ye Eun, run! - Why, this...

1737
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,800
The time is what matters.

1738
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,940
Go.

1739
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,240
- All right! - Is this it?

1740
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:21,340
(They arrive in front of Maljukgeori.)

1741
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,310
Oh, this is it. Maljukgeori.

1742
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:25,950
(Is Maljukgeori really the answer?)

1743
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,010
Gosh, this is...

1744
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,810
- Hey, we were so close. - It really was Maljukgeori.

1745
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,180
Yes, the destination you had to arrive at within 30 minutes...

1746
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,080
(A horse-related destination)

1747
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,190
(Maljukgeori)

1748
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,620
was Maljukgeori.

1749
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,650
That was tough.

1750
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,490
(Just as they expected, their destination was Maljukgeori.)

1751
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,420
The destination is Maljukgeori.

1752
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,930
Travelers' horses were fed porridge here,

1753
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,630
(Maljukgeori was a place in the Joseon Dynasty...)

1754
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,260
(where travelers' horses were fed porridge.)

1755
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,790
- which is how it got its name. - Exactly. That's right.

1756
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,260
(Maljukgeori)

1757
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,630
- That's how it got its name. - We were right.

1758
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,800
- We guessed it was Maljukgeori. - We were right.

1759
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:44,270
(They arrived at the right place!)

1760
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,970
- We said it earlier. - Right.

1761
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,070
However...

1762
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,940
(What time did they arrive?)

1763
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,340
- What time is it? - Didn't we arrive in time?

1764
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,370
You were supposed to arrive by 12:10pm.

1765
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,470
- Sure. - What time is it?

1766
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,280
You guessed Maljukgeori correctly,

1767
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,080
but you weren't here by 12:10pm.

1768
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,980
- You weren't here by 12:10pm. - We were late.

1769
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,450
(They arrived at 12:12pm.)

1770
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,580
You didn't arrive here on time...

1771
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,320
- You didn't arrive here on time, - We were late.

1772
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,590
but you located Maljukgeori at 12:10pm.

1773
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,890
- What? - Did we?

1774
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,590
(They located the destination at 12:10pm?)

1775
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,760
You located it.

1776
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,960
- What? - Did we?

1777
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,960
- According to the GPS? - We did locate it.
We arrived at the location according to the GPS.

1778
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,930
- Exactly. We located it. - We did locate it.

1779
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,000
(2 minutes before they got out of the car)

1780
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,130
- Make a right here. - Yes, make a right.

1781
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,270
(The van they were in passed the location.)

1782
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,430
- It was this place all along. - This is the place.

1783
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:22,670
(The satnav puts them at the location too.)

1784
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,370
- It was this place all along. - This is the place.

1785
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:22,740
That was so close.

1786
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,280
For that reason, we'll count this as a success.

1787
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,510
- Yes! - But?

1788
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,110
But the mission was to be here on time,

1789
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,410
- not drive past it. - Exactly.

1790
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,120
To balance this out, an additional person...

1791
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,120
will receive a penalty today.

1792
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,720
(1 more person will receive a penalty at the end.)

1793
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,520
If you have to receive a penalty, that is.

1794
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,620
- If we have to receive a penalty? - Got it.

1795
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,650
This still counts as a success.

1796
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:39,520
(They arrived on time according to the navigation,)

1797
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:38,650
Yes, you completed this mission.

1798
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,960
- Then we're good. - I don't mind that.

1799
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,190
(so the bingo is marked as a success.)

1800
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,460
- That's not bad. - That's a win.

1801
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,520
That's more than enough.

1802
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,030
- Where's the sticker? - The GPS put us here.

1803
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,830
(The bingo card is here.)

1804
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,260
- Of course. - That's right.

1805
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:46,860
You'll put the success sticker on.

1806
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,800
(Find a location related to horses within 30 minutes)

1807
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,130
- Just one, right? - Yes.

1808
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,330
- Okay! - Okay!

1809
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:52,070
(Their first bingo mission was barely successful!)

1810
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,230
- No way. - There.

1811
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:53,040
We'll get going, then.

1812
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,240
(They also get 1 prize sticker.)

1813
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,670
- Okay. - We did it.

1814
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,840
- I didn't expect this at all. - Let's go.

1815
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,210
- How about a hotteok? - Why don't we get a hotteok?

1816
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,510
- Jae Seok. - How about a hotteok?

1817
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:00,540
Can't we have a hotteok?

1818
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,350
(The adventurers feel hungry after using their brains.)

1819
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,440
- We'd like to get some hotteok. - Let's get some.

1820
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,080
- Can we have some hotteok? - And bungeoppang...

1821
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,650
(They got distracted after completing just one mission.)

1822
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,120
- Is it ready? - What's ready to go?

1823
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,880
- The peanut... - Peanut cake.

1824
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,950
(As if hypnotized, they head for the winter snack.)

1825
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,620
- The peanut cake. - Let's get the peanut cake.

1826
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,850
How about some ingeoppang?

1827
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:11,990
Can you hold this for me?

1828
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,120
We're allowed to eat this much.

1829
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,490
- Three hotteok sounds good. - Good.

1830
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:15,520
Then...

1831
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,590
- Hello. - Bungeoppang.

1832
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:17,690
I've seen you a lot on TV.

1833
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,560
- Thank you. - Can we have the bungeoppang?

1834
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,830
- How about 70 peanut cakes? - The peanut cake.

1835
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,030
- Should we get 70 of them? - Yes, 70.

1836
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,930
- Jae Seok, 70 peanut cakes. - We need to share.

1837
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,170
- What? - Seventy.

1838
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,170
We need to share.

1839
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,470
- And hotteok. - Seventy.

1840
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,600
- How many? - Seventy.

1841
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:31,510
(Food Fighter ordered a lot of peanut cakes.)

1842
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,440
- Seventy? - We need to share.

1843
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,010
Are you kidding me? 70 peanut cakes?

1844
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,080
We'll only get ten each.

1845
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,710
- Exactly. We'll only get ten each. - Sure.

1846
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,380
- We need 70 of them. - You're right.

1847
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,410
We'll take 30.

1848
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:39,010
(It's way too much.)

1849
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:38,450
We'll only get ten each.

1850
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:39,580
- Then... - You're right.

1851
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,580
- You're absolutely right. - Besides, they're tiny.

1852
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,120
- You... - As for me...

1853
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,520
(Laughing)

1854
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,720
- Why are you so angry? - My gosh.

1855
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,390
- You seem pissed off. - And bungeoppang.

1856
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:48,720
(She has strong opinions when it comes to food.)

1857
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,460
But they're tiny!

1858
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,090
- Look at the size of those. - You're right.

1859
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,890
- I'll give you 20 dollars. - Hotteoks are delicious.

1860
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,460
- I want peanut cake. - Thank you.

1861
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:55,200
(Jae Seok spent 20 dollars of his own money to get snacks.)

1862
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,600
Thank you so much!

1863
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,300
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1864
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,370
- Did you get 70 of them? - Jae Seok,

1865
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:57,870
- I'll enjoy drinking this. - No, just 30.

1866
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:59,500
- Did you get some hotteok too? - Yes, three of them.

1867
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,600
(A set of peanut cake, bungeoppang, and hotteok)

1868
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,070
- Thank you. - They only had three made.

1869
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,040
- Here. - I'll enjoy this.

1870
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,970
(They start eating in a hurry.)

1871
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,210
- We should have some hotteok. - Peanut cake.

1872
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,440
I'm going for some hotteok.

1873
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,610
Don't you want this?

1874
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,340
(Exclaiming)

1875
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:07,910
- Is it good? - It's delicious.

1876
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:08,980
Hey, it's bungeoppang.

1877
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:09,980
Who wants hotteok?

1878
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,150
- Goodness. - Hotteok.

1879
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,150
I want peanut cake.

1880
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,050
Peanut cake... Shouldn't you be facing the camera?

1881
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,820
(You're facing away from the camera.)

1882
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,890
(Savoring)

1883
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,850
- Hope today goes well for you! - Thank you.

1884
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,120
- Have this. - The hotteok is delicious.

1885
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,090
- I love hotteok. - Bungeoppang is my favorite.

1886
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:22,590
(They head to the car while eating bungeoppang.)

1887
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,420
- No, hotteok. Let's go. - This is tasty.

1888
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,960
- This is a healthy snack. - Exactly.

1889
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:25,430
(They get in the car excitedly.)

1890
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,830
Each cake has three peanuts in it.

1891
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:25,830
Some have four.

1892
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,760
The hotteok has a lot of honey in it.

1893
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,330
(Would you like to try the hotteok?)

1894
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,570
Would you like to try some of this? It's really good.

1895
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,770
I don't eat after other people.

1896
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,270
(Laughing)

1897
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,840
I see.

1898
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,910
(Chuckling)

1899
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,640
I'm kind of like a princess.

1900
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,610
(A princess who eats 70 peanut cakes)

1901
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,610
I see.

1902
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,180
Let's go meet Soo Young now.

1903
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,510
We should head over to meet Soo Young.

1904
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:45,810
(They're supposed to meet with Soo Young an hour later.)

1905
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,680
- Soo Young... - Jae Seok, hold on.

1906
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,280
We're off to meet...

1907
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,720
- Soo Young right now. - Sure.

1908
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:52,050
(Complete a mission with a celebrity born in the Year of the Horse)

1909
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:52,150
If we meet her at a restaurant with "horse" in the name,

1910
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,420
(Eat five foods with "mal" in their name)

1911
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,060
- We could complete two missions. - we could kill two birds...

1912
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,060
- with one stone. - Exactly!

1913
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,960
Haha's totally right.

1914
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:59,800
(They want to complete 2 missions at a restaurant.)

1915
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,530
- He is. - We could complete...

1916
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,560
- two missions at once. - Right.

1917
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,360
Besides, one bingo line shouldn't be our priority.

1918
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,800
- We should aim to get them all. - Exactly.

1919
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,200
That way, no one will receive the penalty,

1920
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,330
and we'll all win a prize.

1921
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,240
Yes, we should get all of them.

1922
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,710
(Captain Ha full of energy after getting his first bingo.)

1923
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,940
Chicken Head, don't be weak-minded.

1924
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,610
- I see you dream big. - Okay?

1925
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,070
Let's pick a restaurant...

1926
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:13,140
- and ask Soo Young there. - Sure.

1927
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,710
How about a street food place?

1928
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,210
(They're going to decide on a restaurant first.)

1929
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,040
- Seok Jin, wait. - Deep-fried seaweed rolls...

1930
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,610
Think about a pork belly place.

1931
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,280
- There's rolled omelet. - Cold kimchi noodles.

1932
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,920
And cold kimchi noodles.

1933
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,690
(Haha recommends a pork belly restaurant.)

1934
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,850
- Anything rolled or... - We already have two.

1935
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,490
- They'd have to serve those. - That's a good idea.

1936
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,590
- Director. - Yes?

1937
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:28,120
Is pork belly a good choice for lunch?

1938
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,290
- I mean... - We need to promote it.

1939
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,490
- But... - I'm on board.

1940
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,530
(Let's go with it.)

1941
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,230
Is it to help your own restaurant?

1942
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,230
(Food Fighter strongly supports him.)

1943
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,530
- But... - Promote pork belly barbecue.

1944
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,400
Then let's pick a pork belly place...

1945
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,400
- and ask Soo Young there. - Sure.

1946
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,640
Let's search for one. Se Chan, you're good at that.

1947
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,840
(They're going to search for a pork belly restaurant in Gangnam.)

1948
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,370
- With cold kimchi noodles... - One that has noodles.

1949
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:44,410
One that serves pork belly, rolled omelet,

1950
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:45,440
- and various side dishes? - Yes.

1951
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,640
Maybe deep-fried seaweed rolls.

1952
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,980
- Is there anywhere open? - It won't seem sincere.

1953
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,180
If it's not that, then...

1954
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,650
How about Nari Restaurant?

1955
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,920
- I love it! - Nari Restaurant?

1956
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,180
We'll go there and...

1957
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,620
You can grill their rolled omelet.

1958
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,690
Hold on a second.

1959
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,250
- That place... - We should call in advance.

1960
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:02,420
(The Free Meals Couple is excited about food.)

1961
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,220
- Haha, wait. - Let's not be selfish.

1962
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,060
We're not playing this game to fulfill your selfish greed.

1963
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,930
But that restaurant is...

1964
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,660
(They agree on that restaurant for now.)

1965
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,630
I mean, that place...

1966
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:08,130
We'll get a matcha latte...

1967
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:10,330
- Apgujeong... - at a convenience store.

1968
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,730
- Dried radish strips. - While we're there,

1969
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:13,970
we can also get Mallang Cow.

1970
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,700
- Mallang Cow! - Nice.

1971
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,010
(They're going to get 5 foods with "mal" in their name...)

1972
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,010
- That's a great idea! - Mallang Cow.

1973
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,510
We can get the rest at a convenience store.

1974
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:21,080
(at a convenience store.)

1975
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,310
- Mallang Cow? - We could clear both missions.

1976
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,340
- Yes, get everything done. - While we have lunch.

1977
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,210
As Soo Young...

1978
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,980
to bring something to eat that starts with "mal."

1979
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,220
Why would you stress her out like that?

1980
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,450
Why you...

1981
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,590
That'd make her uncomfortable.

1982
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:34,660
(Old Haha is looking for an easy way to get it.)

1983
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,790
- Absolutely. - What did he say?

1984
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,390
He said we should ask her to get us something.

1985
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,490
- Come on. - That's not nice.

1986
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:36,960
We should be grateful that she agreed to meet us.

1987
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,590
- You think you're some big hotshot. - Take that!

1988
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,130
(He's so childish.)

1989
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,460
(Scolding)

1990
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,330
He spat at us.

1991
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,830
- That's just wrong. - Check out her face.

1992
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:45,770
(What's wrong with him?)

1993
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,700
Your eyes seem droopy.

1994
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,340
That's just wrong.

1995
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,270
She ate so many of those peanut cakes.

1996
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:49,340
She ordered 70 of them.

1997
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,670
She's one to order 70 peanut cakes.

1998
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,510
(Food Fighter is full of energy after eating peanut cakes.)

1999
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,240
Eating those must've energized you.

2000
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,780
- Peanut cakes... - We ate all 30 of them.

2001
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,080
- Seventy peanut cakes. - Let me have one.

2002
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,750
- There aren't any left. - How could you eat them all?

2003
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,780
That's why she ordered 70 of them.

2004
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,280
- How many did we buy? - I said we should get 70!

2005
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,780
(While Ye Eun finished all the peanut cakes,)

2006
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,550
- Exactly. - We should've bought 70 of them.

2007
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:02,650
You were right.

2008
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:06,120
(they arrived at the destination.)

2009
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:03,990
We're here.

2010
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,250
We've been here before.

2011
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,790
Let's get off the bus. Get off.

2012
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,790
(They get off the bus in front of the restaurant.)

2013
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,960
Hurry up, guys.

2014
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,360
Guys, hurry up.

2015
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:15,130
(A pork belly place recommended by the Free Meals Couple)

2016
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:13,500
Hello.

2017
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,500
I can't believe we're actually here.

2018
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,600
- Okay. - It smells incredible.

2019
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:19,800
(How many foods contain "mal" in their name here?)

2020
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,830
- We were here before. - It's...

2021
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:19,130
- our second time here. - We've been here before.

2022
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,270
This place serves incredible food.

2023
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,900
- They have cold kimchi noodles. - It's our second time here.

2024
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,810
- Let's see what they have. - Cold kimchi noodles.

2025
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:25,110
(Cold kimchi noodles, called kimchi-mal-e-guksu in Korean)

2026
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,410
- Is there cold kimchi noodles? - Do they have it?

2027
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:28,480
(They're off to a good start.)

2028
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:26,710
Yes, they serve cold kimchi noodles.

2029
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,310
- There it is. - They have it.

2030
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,310
- Do you still serve rolled omelet? - It's right here.

2031
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:32,480
- Oh no. - And rolled omelet.

2032
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,120
(Including rolled omelete, called gyeran-mal-e in Korean,)

2033
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,480
They serve rolled omelet for sure.

2034
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,550
I remember because you can grill them if you want.

2035
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,880
(the restaurant serves 2 dishes with "mal" in their name.)

2036
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,150
I'll get us a matcha latte and a Mallang Cow.

2037
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,120
- I'll get them. - Yes, anything with matcha.

2038
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:41,690
(They'll get 3 dishes outside.)

2039
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,590
We'll be right back.

2040
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,430
Let's upload the drawing on the app first.

2041
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,690
Yes, let's upload it on the app.

2042
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,430
- Ye Eun, upload the drawing. - Go ahead.

2043
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,160
(They were going to put up a post on the Karrot app...)

2044
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:47,860
- I already got started on it. - What?

2045
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,160
(in a crowded place.)

2046
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,030
- Did you? - Cheat as much as you can.

2047
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:52,070
(Ssaebssaeb's draft)

2048
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,970
"Hello, this drawing was done by all the Running Man members."

2049
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:55,900
"We're selling it to celebrate the Year of the Red Horse."

2050
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,970
- Can I upload it as is? - "It might sound hard to believe,"

2051
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:57,970
"but it's real."

2052
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,710
"If you're unsure, check the autographs online."

2053
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,810
- I think it needs a bit more. - "Then..."

2054
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,980
(Add this.)

2055
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,280
Write that the members will hand over the drawing in person.

2056
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,580
- Right. - Yes, in person.

2057
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,580
(Typing slowly)

2058
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,680
"The members..."

2059
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,450
- Should I type that? - Yes, go ahead.

2060
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,250
(The youngest member handles the upload.)

2061
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,290
The members...

2062
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:13,960
Who's going to the convenience store?

2063
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,690
- Not everyone has to go. - Just us three.

2064
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,990
(Haha, Ji Hyo, and Se Chan will go a nearby convenience store.)

2065
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:16,930
- Us three? - Sure.

2066
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:17,930
Let's go.

2067
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,560
What's the post going to say?

2068
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,730
(The other members will review the post for one last time.)

2069
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,800
- Like this. - Read it.

2070
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,830
- Let me see. - "Hello,"

2071
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:23,400
"this drawing was done by..."

2072
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:25,470
(They added a selling point to the original draft.)

2073
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:26,640
(This artwork is worth collecting.)

2074
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,770
"The Year of the Red Horse..."

2075
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,970
(The members will personally hand over the item.)

2076
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,410
- Good. That's more than enough. - Isn't that more than enough?

2077
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,940
(They set the price now.)

2078
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,270
- That's clean and simple. - Should it be two dollars?

2079
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,680
- Shouldn't it be... - Isn't that too cheap?

2080
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,910
- It's too cheap. - How about three dollars?

2081
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,850
I haven't bought or sold anything on the app.

2082
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,580
- I don't know what's appropriate. - Five dollars is too expensive.

2083
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,820
- That's too expensive. - Five dollars is expensive?

2084
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,120
(Thinking hard)

2085
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:42,880
If it's too cheap,

2086
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,890
- it'll seem like a joke. - Three dollars.

2087
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,150
- Five dollars. - What?

2088
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,290
That's too expensive.

2089
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,690
(The suggested price jumped significantly.)

2090
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:49,190
Five dollars is a bit too much.

2091
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:51,660
- From three dollars to... - I'm pricing it this way...

2092
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,730
because it's our own artwork.

2093
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,500
Yes, it's our artwork, so let's take some pride in it.

2094
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,760
- Three dollars? - That's what suddenly got to you?

2095
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,900
- I got it. - Price it at seven dollars.

2096
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,030
Five dollars but negotiable.

2097
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,400
Yes, it should start at five dollars.

2098
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:01,970
(The youngest one clears everything up.)

2099
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,840
- We shouldn't sell it... - Upload it at that price for now.

2100
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,070
It shouldn't be a giveaway.

2101
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,040
(She listed the item for 5 dollars!)

2102
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,410
- Five dollars is good enough. - There's psychology behind it too.

2103
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,040
- Five dollars. - We could sell it for more.

2104
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,940
- Right. - We said it was negotiable.

2105
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,280
(She added that it's negotiable.)

2106
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,510
- Sure. - People will see it, and...

2107
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:11,050
(Will anyone want to buy it?)

2108
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,210
Keep your phone close in case you get any messages.

2109
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:12,480
Hey, they have a matcha-flavored one.

2110
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:14,080
(In the meantime, the three of them are at a convenience store.)

2111
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,480
- Matcha. Then... - Is there one?

2112
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,880
We could get a matcha drink instead.

2113
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,090
- Check this out. - Show me.

2114
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,250
It's matcha-flavored.

2115
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:19,690
- Does it have "mal" on it? Good. - Yes.

2116
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,790
(They get matcha ice cream because matcha is "malcha" in Korean.)

2117
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,090
- I see it. - Matcha-flavored Ice Brulee.

2118
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,360
Sir, don't you have Mallang Cow candy?

2119
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,160
- Here it is. - Get two of those.

2120
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,790
Here we go. I found it.

2121
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,360
(They got the Mallang Cow...)

2122
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,030
- Okay, we're good. - Ice...

2123
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,700
(they'd been wanting since they were on the bus.)

2124
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:28,460
Mal...

2125
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:31,800
(They need to find 1 more item to get all 5.)

2126
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:30,530
What else has "mal" in it?

2127
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,430
There aren't a lot of match-flavored things.

2128
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,270
- Mal... - Haha, look.

2129
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,040
(Ssaebssaeb found something.)

2130
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:35,740
- What is it? - How's this?

2131
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,110
There's "mal" in squishy and moist.

2132
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,540
That works.

2133
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:43,040
(Including squishy squid, they got 3 items.)

2134
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,980
- It works. - Of course, it works.

2135
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,510
- That definitely works. - Let's take these three for now.

2136
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,950
- As long as it works, right? - Sure. Let's go.

2137
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,110
- It has "mal" in it. - Yes, it makes sense.

2138
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:47,850
(The convenience store squad completed their mission.)

2139
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,820
- It makes sense. - Sure does.

2140
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,050
We got them all.

2141
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,050
(They got 3 foods and returned to the pork belly restaurant.)

2142
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,250
- You won't believe it. - What did you get?

2143
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,350
We got three things.

2144
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:53,390
- Then we're good! - All right.

2145
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,020
(Including cold kimchi noodles and rolled omelet,)

2146
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:54,660
- Have a seat. - We have so much.

2147
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,220
- Thanks. - You got Mallang Cow.

2148
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,690
(they got 5 dishes.)

2149
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,760
- I absolutely love this. - This squishy squid snack...

2150
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,760
looks delicious.

2151
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,260
- I absolutely love this. - This is a favorite of mine.

2152
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,430
It tastes like milk.

2153
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:04,030
All right, all we need now is cold kimchi noodles...

2154
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,100
- A rolled omelet. - and a rolled omelet.

2155
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,040
Who'd like some of this?

2156
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,340
- What is it? - Once the celebrity born in...

2157
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,540
(The matcha ice cream they got at the convenience store)

2158
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,510
- the Year of the Horse gets here, - It's cream brulee.

2159
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:11,670
- we need to complete the mission. - What's a brulee?

2160
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,180
- This is more like ice cream. - I see.

2161
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:15,710
(Food Fighter tries the dessert before she eats.)

2162
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,310
- Really? - It's topped with sugar.

2163
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:15,880
I absolutely love cream brulee.

2164
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,310
- What? - I eat five of them at buffets.

2165
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:19,410
This is a cream brulee.

2166
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:21,280
(Gazing)

2167
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,620
It's really good.

2168
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,720
- Ye Eun. - Yes?

2169
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,620
- Didn't you just have peanut cakes? - Are you going to eat that?

2170
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,820
I want it.

2171
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,420
They bought it for us to eat.

2172
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,720
- Go ahead. - What on earth is that?

2173
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,190
- Would you like some? - No, you go ahead.

2174
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,290
(While Food Fighter can't take her eyes off the dessert)

2175
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,230
- It's a brulee. - Do you want some?

2176
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:32,260
What on earth is a brulee?

2177
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,400
Soo Young's here!

2178
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,130
- Soo Young, no way. - Soo Young!

2179
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,130
Soo Young's here!

2180
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,570
- Soo Young, no way. - Soo Young!

2181
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:38,630
We should...

2182
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:39,730
- Soo Young's here. - Soo Young!

2183
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:41,000
(She still takes a bite of it.)

2184
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,270
- Soo Young, no way. - Come this way.

2185
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,840
(Thankfully, the celebrity born in the Year of the Horse came.)

2186
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,310
- Soo Young, my gosh. - You should sit over there.

2187
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,370
Come this way.

2188
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,110
(Member of Girls’ Generation and actress, Soo Young)

2189
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,310
- Soo Young, my gosh. - You should sit over there.

2190
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,680
Sorry, but who's in the center during the hook?

2191
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,450
(A true talent in variety shows who always steals the spotlight)

2192
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,780
She's trying to outshine them.

2193
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,950
- Did you kill him? - It wasn't me!

2194
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,420
(In the new drama series "IDOL I,")

2195
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,190
Get a grip on yourself.

2196
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:01,490
(she plays Maeng Se Na, a lawyer.)

2197
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,960
He's only a client. I'll be by your side.

2198
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:05,260
(Soo Young always delivers with stellar acting.)

2199
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:04,760
Until you get all the answers you need.

2200
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,700
(The loyal fairy came on the show on short notice.)

2201
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:08,130
- Soo Young, my gosh. - You should sit over there.

2202
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:09,400
Soo Young, you should sit over there.

2203
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,230
- It's been so long. - Have you been well?

2204
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:12,900
- This is so kind of you. - Hello.

2205
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,600
- Soo Young, no way. - It was on such short notice.

2206
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,400
- Seok Jin, give her your seat. - Move over.

2207
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,510
- Soo Young, it's been so long. - Give her your seat.

2208
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,340
(Happy to see her)

2209
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,380
- Soo Young, no way. - Soo Young, look at you.

2210
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:22,580
(She looks even more radiant after visiting the dermatologist.)

2211
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:22,040
- You... - You're a total actress now.

2212
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,180
- Of course. She's an actress now. - She's beautiful.

2213
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:26,850
You look like a European actress.

2214
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,720
- A European actress? Really? - I almost didn't recognize you.

2215
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:33,090
(She's flustered in front of her favorite K-pop idol.)

2216
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,690
- A European actress? Really? - I almost didn't recognize you.

2217
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,260
- What? - Hey, she went to Hollywood.

2218
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,960
- She's a Hollywood star. - Soo Young is now...

2219
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,060
- Gosh, she's an actress. - Compared to Soo Young...

2220
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,260
from Girly Generation,

2221
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,460
who was on Running Man in our early years,

2222
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,460
- Gosh, no. - she has a different vibe.

2223
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,530
It's Girls' Generation. What's Girly Generation?

2224
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:45,830
- Girly Generation! - What is that?

2225
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,270
(Speaking quietly)

2226
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,470
- Girls' Generation. - Girly Generation!

2227
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:48,570
What is that?

2228
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:50,070
- Back then... - Hey, Soo Young.

2229
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,570
Was Yu Ri and everyone else born in the Year of the Horse too?

2230
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:54,510
No, Yoon A and I were born in the Year of the Horse.

2231
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,040
I see.

2232
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,410
She's exactly right. You know her, don't you?

2233
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:59,010
- Oh, hello. - She's a huge fan...

2234
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:00,080
- of Girls' Generation. - Yes.

2235
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,450
- Really? - Yes, really.

2236
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:03,890
- She's been saying it for a while. - Oh, my hands are dirty.

2237
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:06,320
(Ddochi can't sit still in front of her favorite idol.)

2238
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,720
- Gosh, really? - She knows all of your dances.

2239
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:07,260
She knows all of the dances to Girls' Generation songs.

2240
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,130
I got an autographed CD from Hyoyeon.

2241
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:11,190
(Bragging)

2242
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:11,360
- Really? - Really?

2243
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,260
I have Yoon A's phone number too.

2244
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:16,100
(She's cute.)

2245
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,770
So, today... Hey, you should sit next to her.

2246
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,930
Hey, dance for her. Show her something.

2247
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,670
(Ye Eun)

2248
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:20,940
- Hurry up and dance. - Okay, get up.

2249
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,400
(Asking her to dance to their song...)

2250
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,940
- Hey, this is... - Gosh, come on!

2251
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,070
(in front of a Girls' Generation member)

2252
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,810
- Dance in front of your idol. - What can you do?

2253
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,040
(A dream performance that will prove that she's a fan)

2254
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,070
- Hey, dance in front of Soo Young. - Just do it.

2255
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,880
Hurry up. When else would you get to meet her?

2256
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,680
(Show us!)

2257
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,440
- Your face might burst. Get up. - But...

2258
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,480
(Her face is red.)

2259
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,510
- Hurry up and show her. - Gosh, seriously?

2260
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:33,150
(She reluctantly goes up on stage.)

2261
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,780
- Act like you can't help it and go. - Show us.

2262
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:34,380
- She really knows all the dances. - This is like the holidays.

2263
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,850
- I know. - Making the youngest sister...

2264
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,760
(Uncles want to show off her talent.)

2265
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,790
The uncles are making the youngest kid dance.

2266
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,520
- Hey, go on. - Yes, our niece.

2267
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,090
- Hey! - Yes.

2268
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,890
- Our niece. Go on. Which song? - Go on, Ye Eun.

2269
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,830
(Excited)

2270
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:47,060
- I did "The Boys" last time. - "The Boys."

2271
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:50,300
Girls' Generation makes you feel the heat

2272
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,830
(Suddenly starting without any warming up)

2273
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,300
Girls' Generation make you feel the heat

2274
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:57,740
- Good job! You're doing so well! - Right?

2275
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,610
(The paper doll is flapping about to no music.)

2276
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,770
- Good job! - Right?

2277
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:02,640
You're doing so well! Good job!

2278
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:07,180
(Excited)

2279
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,310
You're majestic and strong

2280
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:07,320
- Good job! - You were always cool

2281
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,790
She knows every song! Hey, do one more.

2282
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,120
(Adoring)

2283
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,020
(Hearing her favorite cheer for her, she decides to sing one more song.)

2284
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,420
- I did "Genie" before too. - "Genie."

2285
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,420
Yes, "Genie."

2286
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,690
(Here she goes again.)

2287
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,720
- I love - Love you

2288
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,360
I always believe in you

2289
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,890
(Flapping)

2290
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:21,430
(She shows how much she loves her by flapping her arms and legs.)

2291
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,930
She's so adorable.

2292
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:22,300
- Dreams and passion - And passion

2293
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,260
(Floudering)

2294
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,470
I want to give you everything

2295
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,500
Hey, but why does your dance look so loose?

2296
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,740
I learned this at a dance academy.

2297
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,940
A dance academy?

2298
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,010
- Oh, goodness. - You know,

2299
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,810
she auditioned for the three major agencies and failed.

2300
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,280
- Oh, really? - She auditioned to become an idol.

2301
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,810
Seok Jin, why would you tell her that?

2302
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,810
- Well, it's true. - Seriously.

2303
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:40,850
- She's so adorable, though. - She is.

2304
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:44,890
By the way, Soo Young says that Ye Eun is so cute.

2305
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:47,290
(Anyway, she successfully proved she was a fan.)

2306
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,390
- She said you did so well. - Oh, really?

2307
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:47,420
- She was clapping away. - Good job.

2308
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,460
- What year were you born? - In 1994.

2309
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,790
- In 1994? - Yes.

2310
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,160
(Sighing)

2311
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,330
- My gosh. - Why?

2312
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,530
- Is that a good age? - No, now...

2313
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,800
Back in the day, most places I went to,

2314
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,930
- Yes, you were the youngest. - I'd be younger than everyone...

2315
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:01,200
(She used to be the youngest wherever she went.)

2316
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,470
- my senior. - Right.

2317
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:02,600
But now, I should just sit quietly, wherever I go.

2318
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,110
(She's a veteran with 19 years of experience.)

2319
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,940
- But here... - You're a big senior in this field.

2320
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,240
- But you're not that much older. - No.

2321
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,680
You've become a senior.

2322
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,480
By the way, I was born in the Year of the White Horse.

2323
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,050
Yes.

2324
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:17,490
Yes, but apparently, everyone says their year was the White Horse.

2325
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:20,190
Is the White Horse better?

2326
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,920
It just seems kind of special.

2327
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:24,230
(The White Horse seems special for no reason.)

2328
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,920
Oh, the White Horse.

2329
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,430
But 1990 really was the Year of the White Horse.

2330
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,930
Seok Jin was born in the Year of the Horse too.

2331
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:26,930
- Really? - Of course.

2332
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,830
(Born in 1990, born in 1966, the Year of the Horse)

2333
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:29,100
- The Year of the Horse in 1966. - Oh, really?

2334
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,430
Isn't that two cycles around?

2335
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:31,830
We're several cycles apart.

2336
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,270
They're 24 years apart, but they share the same Chinese zodiac sign.

2337
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,440
- Two cycles. - Two cycles. Or is it three?

2338
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,500
But I was also born in the Year of the White Horse.

2339
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,700
- What? - It's two cycles.

2340
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,370
- I'm a White Horse, too. - It's two cycles.

2341
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:39,340
It doesn't make sense if you're also a White Horse.

2342
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,610
I'm pretty sure the White Horse comes around once every 60 years.

2343
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:42,810
I'm a White Horse.

2344
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:43,980
- Is that so? - Really.

2345
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,310
- What... - I think you're wrong.

2346
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,520
(So childish)

2347
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:47,780
- I think you're wrong. - Me?

2348
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,620
Hey, Seok Jin, she's here as a guest.

2349
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,890
- That's right, Seok Jin. - Hey, what...

2350
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:54,020
(He suddenly argues with the guest.)

2351
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:52,620
- It was hard for her to come. - I'm sure she is...

2352
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,960
- Hey, what... - It was hard for her to come.

2353
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,420
- We have to clear things up. - Just say that I'm right!

2354
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:58,060
The guest says she's a White Horse. Why do you keep saying she's not?

2355
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,530
Fine, then. You can be the White Horse.

2356
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:00,100
(You can be the White Horse then!)

2357
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:02,700
Seok Jin, 1966 was the Year of the Red Horse.

2358
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,530
(The writer confirms.)

2359
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,300
- Really? - See, Seok Jin? I was right.

2360
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:07,840
(So simple)

2361
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,070
Then, this is my year!

2362
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,240
Oh, you're right.

2363
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,170
Then, everyone turning 60 this year are a Red Horse.

2364
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,240
Oh, really?

2365
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,510
Everyone turning 60 this year are a Red Horse.

2366
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:15,840
- Nice! - That little punk.

2367
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,810
(It was accidentally revealed that he's turning 60 this year.)

2368
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,710
Soo Young, Seok Jin is turning 60 this year.

2369
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:21,320
- Gosh, what are you saying? - Congratulations.

2370
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:21,150
(Worked up)

2371
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:25,720
(Changing the topic)

2372
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,790
Soo Young, you should eat first. You haven't eaten, have you?

2373
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,220
Oh, I ate before I came.

2374
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,460
- You're so diligent. - Right. My goodness.

2375
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,960
(The White Horse argument is over.)

2376
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,430
- Hey, this is... - All right. Rolled omelets.

2377
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:32,060
(The dishes are finally served.)

2378
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:32,230
This is frozen pork belly, the thing we kept getting wrong.

2379
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,730
(Frozen pork belly Mr. Free Meals was craving)

2380
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,160
Frozen pork belly. Hey, it's frozen pork belly.

2381
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:36,730
Indeed, frozen pork belly is...

2382
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:39,530
Gosh, cold kimchi noodles.

2383
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,740
(Cold kimchi noodles that will fill the square)

2384
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,170
Hey, it's cold kimchi noodles.

2385
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,840
Here is the rolled omelet.

2386
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,840
(And rolled omelet)

2387
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,040
We have the rolled omelet.

2388
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:47,410
For this... You have to grill this and eat it.

2389
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:49,340
- Oh, really? - Yes, it tastes better that way.

2390
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,710
Haha, how do you know this?

2391
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,250
(As Mr. Free Meals recommended,)

2392
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,310
The owner of a pork belly restaurant sure is different.

2393
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,050
Grill this?

2394
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:57,190
(he puts rolled omelet on the grill.)

2395
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,850
Do we put these on the grill now?

2396
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,920
How does this look, Haha? Right here. Should I put it here?

2397
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,020
(Golden brown)

2398
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,690
Gosh, Se Chan.

2399
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:02,820
Okay, you can eat it now.

2400
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:05,560
(Eating the rolled omelet with "mal" in the name, which means "horse")

2401
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,360
Thank you, Se Chan.

2402
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,630
Let's eat quickly.

2403
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,830
(Another dish with "horse" in the name)

2404
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,230
- Just eat first. - Please eat.

2405
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,270
(Trying the cold kimchi noodles before eating the meat)

2406
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:11,530
- We can work after we eat. - Soo Young, go ahead and eat.

2407
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:14,870
- We don't have time. Thanks. - Here you go.

2408
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,970
(Humming)

2409
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:25,650
(Noodle lover Jae Seok clears a bowl of cold kimchi noodles.)

2410
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:25,010
Gosh, this is good.

2411
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,010
Soo Young.

2412
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:28,620
Want some cold kimchi noodles?

2413
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,520
(Soo Young)

2414
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,820
- I'm okay with just watching. - Still, Soo Young...

2415
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:33,490
- We just want you to eat some. - Still, have a bite.

2416
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,290
- Do you want some of this? - I'll have some meat.

2417
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:37,630
- The meat. - I'll get it.

2418
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:39,690
(Soo Young)

2419
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,060
- Here's some meat. - Hey...

2420
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,430
- Already? No, it has to cook more. - Have some meat.

2421
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:43,430
Is that so?

2422
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:46,030
I mean, it's not even fully cooked.

2423
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:50,100
(Delivering undercooked meat as she wants to feed her favorite idol)

2424
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:49,040
It's still red. She wanted you to eat...

2425
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,240
I mean, it's not even fully cooked.

2426
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,640
It's still red. She wanted you to eat...

2427
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,610
(He's choking from laughter.)

2428
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,280
Hey, Jae Seok is laughing.

2429
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,110
Hey, give it to her once it's fully cooked.

2430
00:57:58,110 --> 00:57:59,380
A member of Girls' Generation is here.

2431
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,420
Yes.

2432
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:01,680
As a fan, you wanted to...

2433
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,980
- give her food. - Right.

2434
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,050
(Being a fan, she acted hastily.)

2435
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,320
- She wanted to impress you. - But it's not fully cooked.

2436
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:08,090
The grease was dripping from it.

2437
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,720
She wanted you to eat something.

2438
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,830
- She wanted to give it to you. - She wanted to give her food.

2439
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,700
- How cute. Thank you. - She is a nice kid.

2440
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,300
- She's a nice kid, but... - "She's a nice kid, though."

2441
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,100
- Yes, she's a nice kid. - Gosh, she's so cute.

2442
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,830
I've been watching your work and thought you were cute.

2443
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,440
Soo Young, it's so funny to hear you say that.

2444
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:24,140
(She gives her a well-cooked piece of meat this time.)

2445
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,440
I think this is cooked.

2446
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,570
You've been watching her and found her cute.

2447
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,640
- Shouldn't you cook it more? - No, it's good like this.

2448
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,670
- Is that so? - Yes.

2449
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:28,440
(Golden brown)

2450
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,040
- No, really. - It's good like this. Soo Young.

2451
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,280
- Really? - Yes.

2452
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,110
(Dropping)

2453
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,410
- Hey, the grease... - Oh, gosh.

2454
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:32,510
The grease is dripping.

2455
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,250
The grease always drips from pork belly.

2456
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:35,320
(Thanks to her clumsy but nice fan,)

2457
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,450
- Is that true? - Yes.

2458
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:42,390
(she's eating pork belly on a full tummy.)

2459
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,990
- Oh, really? - This is...

2460
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:38,350
- You can eat this. - My goodness.

2461
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,820
Indeed, frozen pork belly is...

2462
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,460
- Ye Eun, you should eat too. - Ye Eun, aren't you going to eat?

2463
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,020
- Hey. - Okay.

2464
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,960
- Eat the ones that are cooked. - Eat first.

2465
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:49,200
Just eat first, okay?

2466
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,270
(Tying her hair up)

2467
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,470
She's so adorable.

2468
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:56,400
(After grilling meat for her idol, Food Fighter sets off.)

2469
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,640
It's delicious.

2470
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,310
(After the noodles, she goes for the meat.)

2471
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,120
It's tasty.

2472
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,880
- Ye Eun is so happy right now. - Here.

2473
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,180
(Meat in the right hand, meat in the left hand)

2474
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:11,620
Sure. There's delicious food,

2475
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:15,360
and her childhood idol, Soo Young of Girls' Generation is here, right?

2476
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,230
(Eating with a member of Girls' Generation, as great as pork belly)

2477
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:23,460
Hey, by the way, you must've been surprised by Jae Seok's call.

2478
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,730
"Oh, what's the occasion?" You know?

2479
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,600
- And you picked up in the morning. - Well...

2480
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,340
You know, we're asking for favors as we call people.

2481
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:34,010
(Contemplating)

2482
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,110
It's not easy. It's hard.

2483
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,710
Right, it's really hard.

2484
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,210
- Of course. - Yes.

2485
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:39,680
Soo Young, aren't you shooting something now?

2486
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:40,250
(By the way)

2487
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,020
Yes, my drama premieres today.

2488
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,620
- It premieres today? - Yes.

2489
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:48,320
(As of the day of filming, the first episode of "IDOL I" aired.)

2490
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,090
- Which drama is it? - I hope it's a big hit.

2491
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:46,990
The drama is called "IDOL I."

2492
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:49,520
- So, I wanted to come... - What is it?

2493
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,790
on Running Man to promote the drama.

2494
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:52,760
- You really ended up coming. - Yes.

2495
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,760
(It's amazing.)

2496
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,030
- But... - It just worked out like this.

2497
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:57,170
- This is great. - I know. It premieres today?

2498
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:59,970
- Yes, the first episode airs today. - But this won't be on TV today.

2499
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,470
(He feels sorry.)

2500
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,540
- When will this be on TV? - It will probably be next year.

2501
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:05,840
(By the time of the broadcast, the show had been airing successfully.)

2502
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,470
- In January? Oh, that's great. - Yes.

2503
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,440
- It's good, right? That's perfect. - Yes, January 4?

2504
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,510
- That's perfect! - It is.

2505
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:09,540
Our drama will be on Episodes 5 and 6 on January 4.

2506
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,610
- But Episodes 5 and 6... - Still, in the middle,

2507
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:13,550
- if you get some more PR... - That's right.

2508
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:15,250
- Around Episodes 5 and 6, - A boost.

2509
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,150
- dramas usually need a boost. - That's right.

2510
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:20,690
So, these days, actors do promotions in the middle.

2511
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:23,490
(Please watch "IDOL I.")

2512
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:22,620
- Yes, please give us your support. - Right.

2513
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,890
- Yes. - Hey, hurry up and eat.

2514
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:25,930
Hurry up and eat this.

2515
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:28,200
Jae Seok, nobody is reading our Karrot post. What will we do?

2516
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,100
Nobody is reading our Karrot post. What will we do?

2517
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,970
(The horse drawing is surprisingly unpopular.)

2518
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:32,300
- Nobody is reading it? - Hey, that can't happen.

2519
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,270
- They're not reading it. - That's why we have to...

2520
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,940
clickbait people with bags or watches.

2521
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,570
Or can't we lower the price from five dollars?

2522
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,170
- Lower it. - Lower it.

2523
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,410
- Who'd be crazy enough... - Two dollars. A huge discount.

2524
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:41,910
(Lower the price.)

2525
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:41,880
to buy it for five dollars?

2526
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,710
(It's heavily discounted to 1 dollar to encourage a sale.)

2527
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:45,780
But we said we were open to price negotiations.

2528
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,720
(Eat 5 foods with "mal" in their name)

2529
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:49,520
By the way, if we succeed in this mission as well,

2530
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,950
(We successfully ate 5 foods.)

2531
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:50,820
and if Soo Young...

2532
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,420
We don't know what the mission is, but if she joins and we succeed...

2533
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:55,190
(The key is whether they can succeed in the mission with Soo Young.)

2534
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,890
We must do a mission with her.

2535
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:55,160
Do I have to succeed?

2536
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,160
- All of us, together. Yes. - We have to do it together, right?

2537
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:00,060
- We don't know what it is yet. - But Soo Young is so good at games.

2538
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,430
I'm really bad at games, Haha.

2539
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:02,560
- You're bad at games? - I am.

2540
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,270
You have to do well. You're the smartest one here.

2541
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:06,930
(Will Soo Young be able to complete the mission?)

2542
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:06,130
- No, I'm really bad at games. - She's a game genius.

2543
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,170
Gosh, the meal...

2544
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:08,840
Hey, let's hurry up and eat.

2545
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:11,440
(Let's hurry up and eat then.)

2546
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,440
- Just eat first. - Then, we have to do the mission.

2547
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,470
- We can work after we eat. - Soo Young, go ahead and eat.

2548
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,510
- We don't have much time. - Right.

2549
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,710
(They have less than 2 hours left until the Bingo game is over.)

2550
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,480
- Hurry up and eat. - Hurry up.

2551
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,080
Quickly, eat this.

2552
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:20,110
- The potato is tasty. - Stop eating meat.

2553
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,450
(Soo Young's appetite kicks in belatedly...)

2554
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,280
- We don't have time to eat it. - I haven't had any doenjang stew.

2555
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:24,720
(when there's no time.)

2556
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,920
- Eat up. Is the potato good? - Yes.

2557
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,620
- It's really good. Yes. - Is it?

2558
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,920
(Glancing)

2559
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:27,820
It's really good.

2560
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:31,630
Soo Young is suddenly eating so much.

2561
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:32,960
She's suddenly eating so much.

2562
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,260
- Hey, she's going for it. - Hey, she's a good eater.

2563
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,130
You said you ate before you came!

2564
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:40,230
What are you doing, all of a sudden?

2565
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:42,700
Hey, she started eating and didn't talk for ten minutes.

2566
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,670
- What are you suddenly doing? - She's eating so well.

2567
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:46,510
This place has good food. It's a good restaurant.

2568
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,240
- Eat up. - Soo Young is eating. How funny.

2569
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:52,080
(Now they've eaten, they'll hurry off to the mission.)

2570
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,610
I really don't think I can do it. What do I do?

2571
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:55,150
It's been a while since Soo Young joined us. We have to succeed.

2572
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,790
I think I'm just going to be a nuisance.

2573
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:01,790
No! Soo Young, a nuisance? What are you talking about?

2574
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,890
(They're full of worry at the thought of the mission.)

2575
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,230
Gosh, I'm really bad at games!

2576
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:06,630
I don't know what the mission is going to be.

2577
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:08,330
Goodness, seriously.

2578
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:09,160
(Sniffing the smell of meat)

2579
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:09,330
Here.

2580
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:10,600
Let's do this!

2581
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:13,100
(They take a seat for the mission.)

2582
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:12,100
- Seok Jin, sit here. - Okay.

2583
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:13,800
Gosh, I really am bad at games.

2584
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,100
- Still no news from Karrot? - Not yet.

2585
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,910
- The category... - I changed it, but...

2586
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,010
(Checking the message on the app)

2587
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:19,040
What did you change it to? It should be...

2588
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,880
- Oh, we got a message! - We did?

2589
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,080
- We got a message! - Did we get a message?

2590
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,110
(Did they get a message?)

2591
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,580
"Hello, I'm sending a message because I'm interested."

2592
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,950
(From Butcher Shop Dessert)

2593
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:25,950
"When and where do I need to go?"

2594
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,380
Let's call this person here.

2595
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:28,220
(Someone really wants to buy a horse drawing!)

2596
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,620
- User Butcher Shop Dessert. - Let's call this person here.

2597
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:31,890
(Excited)

2598
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,990
- Really? - It isn't a staff member, right?

2599
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:32,750
- We got a message! - Should we ask this person to come?

2600
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,490
- "When are you available?" - Ask that.

2601
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:36,090
- No way. - This is insane.

2602
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:37,090
- Is this... - Did we really get a message?

2603
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:39,460
- Is this real? - Did we really get a message?

2604
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:39,790
(They didn't think they'd actually get a message.)

2605
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:40,500
For what price did you upload it?

2606
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,630
- One dollar. - One dollar.

2607
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:42,900
(It's a low price.)

2608
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,600
- I got goosebumps. - Hey.

2609
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,600
Jae Seok, we got another message from Lalala.

2610
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,170
(From Lalala)

2611
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,070
We're getting responses. "Hello."

2612
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,770
- So... - Shall I raise the price?

2613
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:51,110
- No. - No.

2614
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:55,010
- You can't raise it now. - Then you'll be a crook.

2615
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:54,540
(He's determined to earn money.)

2616
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,450
- Then you'll be a crook. - You can't do that.

2617
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:59,210
What should I do with Lalala? Shall I respond to this user?

2618
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,380
- Yes. - But...

2619
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,880
- After talking to one user... - Butcher Shop comes first.

2620
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:05,220
(The user who messaged them first)

2621
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,990
- That's right. - That user comes first.

2622
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,150
- That's right. - Butcher Shop comes first.

2623
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:07,960
Do a transaction with Butcher Shop first.

2624
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:09,490
(Soo Young teaches them proper etiquette.)

2625
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,060
That's right. We need to be reasonable.

2626
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:12,460
- What does the user say? - Hold on. Where did it go?

2627
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:14,600
(Confused)

2628
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:14,130
- Here. Active chatrooms. - Active chatrooms.

2629
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,730
One dollar is too much.

2630
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,630
(Slow)

2631
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,630
- Ask to meet in Gangnam. - In ten minutes.

2632
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:21,470
(You can tell he has no experience with second-hand trading.)

2633
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:19,830
Nari Restaurant.

2634
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,040
Hold on. This user is at home.

2635
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,570
How frustrating. Can't you call this user?

2636
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:23,800
- Is there a call function? - Is there a call function?

2637
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,970
How frustrating. Can't you call this user?

2638
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:27,640
(Her inner thought bursts out.)

2639
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:26,340
- Is there a call function? - Is there a call function?

2640
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,080
Is there a call function?

2641
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,180
- Really? - Let's try it.

2642
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,810
- Have you done this, Soo Young? - Try it.

2643
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:32,910
- I use the Karrot app. - Really?

2644
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,350
Is there a call function?

2645
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,450
(Soo Young is a frequent user of the Karrot app.)

2646
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,980
- No? - My temperature is very high.

2647
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,350
- Really? - What is it?

2648
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:39,490
- It's over 40°C. - Really?

2649
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:41,820
- You're an expert. - I want to buy it.

2650
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:43,420
This user isn't replying.

2651
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,060
(Butcher Shop Dessert isn't replying.)

2652
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,930
In that case,

2653
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:49,300
- You should chat with Lalala. - Soo Young, please do it.

2654
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:51,370
(Instead of Butcher Shop Dessert, she tries contacting Lalala.)

2655
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,370
- Please do it. - Soo Young is good.

2656
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,800
- Her temperature is 40°C. - Her temperature is 40°C.

2657
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,500
(The highly rated, well-mannered user steps up.)

2658
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,100
Soo Young is good at this thanks to her high temperature.

2659
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,140
She's fast.

2660
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:57,370
Press the keyboard.

2661
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,410
(Typing)

2662
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,240
She types well...

2663
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,680
- with her long nails. - She types well.

2664
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,580
- How do you type so well? - Can you press with those nails?

2665
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:03,910
(She's way faster than the others.)

2666
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,980
To raise your temperature on the app,

2667
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,350
- you need to respond right away. - That's right.

2668
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:08,550
- It depends on the speed. - That's right.

2669
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:09,980
(Karrot Fairy's tip: Respond immediately.)

2670
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,580
Do you know why?

2671
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:11,250
- Even as they chat, - Okay.

2672
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:12,750
- they rethink their decisions. - They change their minds.

2673
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,120
- You need to respond right away. - They change their minds.

2674
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,860
- She has know-how. - Yes.

2675
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:18,990
(That's why she's highly rated on the app.)

2676
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,830
- Her temperature is warm. - We need to do this right away.

2677
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:22,800
Butcher Shop replied, "I can do 4pm today..."

2678
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,130
"or sometime in the morning tomorrow."

2679
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:26,070
No. Please say sorry.

2680
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:27,000
(Since they have to finish the mission by 3pm,)

2681
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,840
- "I'm sorry." - We can't do those times.

2682
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,240
(they'll hold off on the deal.)

2683
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,100
- Let's move on to Lalala. - Lalala.

2684
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:30,870
(Trying to contact Lalala)

2685
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,770
We need to do this before 2:30pm.

2686
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:34,210
- If this user is at work... - Remove the rice on your chin.

2687
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:39,450
(I'm sorry. I don't think I can meet up right away.)

2688
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:36,880
- Let's move on to Lalala. - Lalala...

2689
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,410
- can't meet up right away. - These users must be at work.

2690
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,650
- Then... - Why don't we send it to a user?

2691
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:40,720
(Draw a horse and sell it online using the Karrot app)

2692
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,920
(The second-hand trade mission is at the center of the bingo card.)

2693
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:43,150
- Call the user. - The mission requires meeting up.

2694
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,720
- It requires meeting up. - Where is the workplace?

2695
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,950
We can go to the user's workplace.

2696
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:47,790
- We can go near the place. - The neighborhood is Cheongdam.

2697
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:51,730
(They're willing to visit their office to complete the bingo.)

2698
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:49,260
- Yes. It must be nearby. - Yes.

2699
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:51,690
- "We'll go to the workplace." - "We'll go."

2700
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,690
- "We can go." - I asked, "Will it be hard..."

2701
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:54,960
"even if we go to your current place?"

2702
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,060
- This user... - Listen.

2703
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,800
Seok Jin, why don't you give away your personal number for a call?

2704
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,500
Give away your personal number.

2705
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,100
- A call will be faster. - Listen.

2706
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,600
After the transaction, this user won't call your number again.

2707
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,170
Why do you think that?

2708
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:06,340
I'm a celebrity too.

2709
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,210
- Seriously. - "I'm a celebrity too."

2710
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:09,680
I forgot.

2711
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,850
- Say that we'll go. - Soo Young is doing all the work.

2712
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:13,780
(She's sending a message to Butcher Shop Dessert just in case.)

2713
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:14,320
- Thank goodness Soo Young came. - Soo Young, you came...

2714
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:16,350
(Soo Young is doing so much for them.)

2715
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,150
- to do a Karrot transaction. - This is incredible.

2716
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,490
- Aren't they replying? - Neither one is replying.

2717
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:20,390
- Were we too forward? - Were we?

2718
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:22,520
- Let's wait. - While you wait,

2719
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,960
- you can do a mission. - Let's do a mission.

2720
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,530
- Let's do a mission. - Seok Jin, hold on to the phone.

2721
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:26,830
- The password... - Here's the important thing.

2722
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:28,300
- Soo Young needs to do... - We got a reply!

2723
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,730
- Call. - Lalala.

2724
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:30,770
What?

2725
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:32,630
Butcher Shop said, "If you come, I'll be thankful."

2726
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:33,930
- Where? - Seoul Forest.

2727
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,240
- Seoul Forest is near. - Seongsu-dong.

2728
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,110
- Seongsu-dong. - We can do there.

2729
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,210
(It's a 12-minute drive from the restaurant to Seoul Forest Park.)

2730
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:39,570
I think we can go there.

2731
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,540
- At what time shall we go? - Hold on.

2732
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,610
(Enthusiastic)

2733
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:42,640
Seoul Forest is very close.

2734
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:45,980
(The bingo finishes at 3pm. It's close enough.)

2735
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,610
- Yes. It's right across the river. - It's Seongsu-dong.

2736
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:45,610
We can get there in ten minutes.

2737
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:46,750
Let's go there quickly...

2738
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,280
- after finishing the mission. - Let's do that.

2739
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,320
- Ask the user to wait. - Say that you'll reply shortly.

2740
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:50,850
(They need to complete the mission as quickly as possible...)

2741
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,820
- Say that you'll reply shortly. - Okay.

2742
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:52,620
(and meet with the user.)

2743
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:52,990
We can get there in ten minutes.

2744
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:55,590
- And ask for the address. - Yes. Ask for the address.

2745
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:58,490
(Checking the detailed address)

2746
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,190
- The address. - I asked for the address.

2747
01:05:58,190 --> 01:05:59,290
- Okay. - Okay.

2748
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:00,330
Soo Young is good.

2749
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:01,600
(Draw a horse and sell it online using the Karrot app)

2750
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,430
If you succeed in the mission with Soo Young,

2751
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,760
(Complete a mission with a celebrity born in the Year of the Horse)

2752
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,230
(If they complete both the mission and the transaction,)

2753
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:04,970
- you'll complete one bingo. - Okay.

2754
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:05,970
- Exactly. - Okay.

2755
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:07,670
(they'll get 1 bingo.)

2756
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:07,200
- Let's do this. - Let's go.

2757
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,300
- Now, - Let's go.

2758
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,900
we'll proceed with the mission.

2759
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:11,810
(They quickly carry out the mission while waiting for a reply.)

2760
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,810
With Soo Young, a celebrity born in the Year of the Horse,

2761
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:14,110
you'll play a game that's popular on social media these days,

2762
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,170
(The mission they'll try with Soo Young,)

2763
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,410
(who was born in the Year of the Horse)

2764
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:15,880
Rhythmic Words.

2765
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:17,040
What's that?

2766
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,650
- I don't know. It sounds hard. - Rhythmic Words?

2767
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:20,720
- It sounds hard. - To the rhythm,

2768
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,420
you'll say the words that represent the photos...

2769
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:25,350
(Needle, scale, needle, needle, needle, scale, needle, scale)

2770
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,690
on the screen in order.

2771
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,420
- Really? - Needle, scale, needle,

2772
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,360
needle, needle, scale, needle, scale.

2773
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,260
That's a basic skill. I can groove to the rhythm.

2774
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:34,300
Each person needs to say five sets of words.

2775
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,400
If he or she misses the beat...

2776
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,630
or messes up the words, it's a failure.

2777
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,340
- It sounds hard. - Including Soo Young,

2778
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:44,910
(Including Soo Young, 5 people will try.)

2779
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,970
- five people need to participate. - I can't remember the words.

2780
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:46,640
If three people pass,

2781
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,810
the mission will be a success.

2782
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:48,910
Three people need to pass?

2783
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:50,010
And five people need to participate?

2784
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:51,780
This is totally doable.

2785
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:52,910
- Of course. - It's easy.

2786
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:54,980
- You get three tries. - Come on.

2787
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:57,020
- Okay. - Soo Young, you know what to do.

2788
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,250
Let's go. We need to do it in three tries, right?

2789
01:06:57,690 --> 01:06:59,520
(Worried)

2790
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,360
Soo Young has to participate.

2791
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:03,860
(They'll choose 5 people to play the game.)

2792
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,060
- Soo Young has to participate. - Soo Young...

2793
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,360
- You have to participate. - Young members.

2794
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,490
- I'll do it. - You have to participate.

2795
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:07,800
Young Forty and Young Fifty should sit out.

2796
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,760
- Hey, he's old too. - Participate.

2797
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:10,500
(The older members are kicked out.)

2798
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,430
- Go in the order of age. - Haha should be included then.

2799
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:14,100
(Since it's a rhythm game, they chose younger members.)

2800
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:14,170
But Ye Eun... I mean, Ji Hyo is pretty good.

2801
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:15,970
- Okay. Ji Hyo, participate. - No.

2802
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:18,240
(Ji Hyo, who is unexpectedly good at games, joins them.)

2803
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,810
- I... - And...

2804
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:19,540
Haha, give it a go.

2805
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:20,740
- Go. - I'm not very quick.

2806
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,540
- Five youngsters should do it. - Do it.

2807
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,840
Let's do a cheer together.

2808
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,950
(That's how the team was formed with younger members.)

2809
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,080
- One, two, three! - One, two, three!

2810
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,210
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2811
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:28,650
- I'm really bad at games. - Soo Young...

2812
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,750
is very nervous since her drama begins airing today.

2813
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,220
(Stomping her feet)

2814
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:31,820
- Oh, no. - Seriously.

2815
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,690
- It's okay. Try it. - Try it. It's okay.

2816
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:34,860
What should I do?

2817
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:36,960
(The fate of the bingo rests with Soo Young.)

2818
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,720
- I'm really bad at games. - You can do it.

2819
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,090
- Imagine yourself at home. - Come on.

2820
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:40,530
(Make yourself at home.)

2821
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,260
I can't do this at home either.

2822
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:40,860
If you're ready,

2823
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:42,460
we'll get started.

2824
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:43,830
Set, go.

2825
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,500
(The first player, Soo Young, gives it a go.)

2826
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,740
- What? - Okay.

2827
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:48,700
(First question, star and bee)

2828
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,240
(If you miss the beat or mispronounce the words, you fail.)

2829
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,240
- What? - Okay.

2830
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,970
Star, star, star, star, bee, bee, bee, bee.

2831
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:55,040
- Okay. - Good.

2832
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:56,140
(She passed the first challenge.)

2833
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,280
- My goodness. - All right.

2834
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:59,080
Star, star, bee, bee, bee, bee, star, star.

2835
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,080
Good.

2836
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:01,550
(The second one went smoothly as well.)

2837
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,120
- What? - Snake.

2838
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,780
Good!

2839
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,520
(Suddenly, a snake enters!)

2840
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:03,820
- What? - Snake.

2841
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:07,250
Star, bee, star, bee, snake, bee, star, bee!

2842
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:08,220
(Incorrect!)

2843
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,660
Snake, bee, star, bee!

2844
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:12,090
- It's hard. - It's over.

2845
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:13,660
- Star, bee. - It's hard.

2846
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:14,800
It's over.

2847
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:16,060
(She was confused because they had similar pronunciations.)

2848
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,130
- Star, bee... - Star...

2849
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:17,800
(Soo Young fails.)

2850
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,900
- It's hard. - It's hard.

2851
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:19,270
It's hard.

2852
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:20,730
Hey, how will we do this?

2853
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:22,400
(Infuriated)

2854
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,170
- Seriously. - Are you kidding me?

2855
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,940
It's too hard.

2856
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,170
- Jae Seok, I can do it. - We can't do it. It's hard.

2857
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:27,270
You can't do it.

2858
01:08:26,610 --> 01:08:29,240
(Many people want to give up after just one try.)

2859
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:28,880
- We can't do it. It's hard. - Hey.

2860
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,380
- Let's scold them. - This is...

2861
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:30,380
(Let's scold the production crew.)

2862
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:32,650
- Hey, we suddenly got... - It's too hard.

2863
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,550
- star, bee, and snake. - Snake.

2864
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:36,150
- Snake, bee, star, rice, - Snake, bee...

2865
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:38,650
(The next set even had rice.)

2866
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:37,490
- rice, star, snake, bee. - Snake, bee...

2867
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:38,690
- Snake, bee, star, rice, - Snake, bee, star, rice...

2868
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:40,150
- rice, star, snake, bee. - This is fun.

2869
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:43,390
(Each of them gives it a go.)

2870
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:41,220
- It's hard. - Snake, bee...

2871
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,490
- Star, rice, rice, star... - Snake, bee...

2872
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,490
- For goodness' sake. - Snake, bee,

2873
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:46,690
- star, rice... - It's impossible.

2874
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,160
- Snake, bee, star, rice, - Snake, bee...

2875
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,960
- rice, stel, sneak, beer. - Snake, bee, star, rice...

2876
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:51,970
(He's really bad at it.)

2877
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,800
- Snake, bee! - Snake, bee...

2878
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,800
- It's too hard. - Even if it's a set per person,

2879
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,830
we'll fail.

2880
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:55,540
- The production crew... - We'll still fail.

2881
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,740
- This is... - I thought it was a set per person.

2882
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,170
- It's faster than I thought. - Same here.

2883
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,640
- Must one do... - Must one do...

2884
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,480
(Ssaebssaeb sees his chance and attempts to change the rules.)

2885
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,410
- Must one do 5 sets? - Must one do 5 sets?

2886
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:02,640
- Then... - Is it five sets per person?

2887
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,610
- Yes. - Let's make it one set per person.

2888
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:07,110
That's right. It'll still be hard.

2889
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,450
(That's right.)

2890
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:09,180
- Let's make it a group game. - Let's make it a group game.

2891
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:11,550
(They're united in moments like this.)

2892
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:10,890
- The rhythm is too fast. - One set per person.

2893
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,690
- The rhythm is too fast. - We're at that level.

2894
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,920
In that case,

2895
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,060
(Considering their abilities,)

2896
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,630
- each person must do one set. - Good.

2897
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:18,430
(they'll have each person take on 1 challenge.)

2898
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:21,030
- But all 5 people must do 2 rounds. - Okay.

2899
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:23,100
- Okay. Good. - You get three tries.

2900
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,130
Yes!

2901
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,870
- Good. - I think these parts are hard.

2902
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,740
- Numbers 3 and 4. - Skilled ones should go last.

2903
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,670
(It'll get more and more difficult.)

2904
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:29,470
- Skilled ones should go last. - Seok Jin.

2905
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:32,940
(It's easiest for the 1st player.)

2906
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,940
- Soo Young, go to the back. - You're good.

2907
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,640
- Take a harder one. - I'm bad at this.

2908
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,140
The bad ones should go first.

2909
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:36,510
- I'll sit here. - I'll take an easy one.

2910
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:37,910
(Without hesitation)

2911
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,310
- I'll take an easy one. - I'll take an easy one.

2912
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:40,110
(Jong Kook takes number 1, which is the easiest.)

2913
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,580
- I'll sit here. - Take number two.

2914
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:41,520
- I'll take it. - Take number two.

2915
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:42,420
(Young Forty Ha takes number 2.)

2916
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:44,320
Soo Young, number three is the right one for you.

2917
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:46,290
I doubt this will work.

2918
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,090
(Soo Young takes number 3 with the snake.)

2919
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,520
Number one is easy, Jong Kook.

2920
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:49,520
- Okay. Let's go. - Let's go.

2921
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:51,190
(They need to clear two rounds in a row to complete tyhe mission.)

2922
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,290
Soo Young's drama begins today.

2923
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:52,490
Let's go.

2924
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:53,790
(Will they succeed in it this time?)

2925
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,500
Let's begin. Set, go.

2926
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,070
- Whale, whale, octopus, whale. - Okay.

2927
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:03,340
Whale, whale, octopus, whale, whale, whale, octopus, whale.

2928
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:04,640
That one was easy.

2929
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:04,910
(Jong Kook cleared the challenge.)

2930
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:08,640
Octopus, octopus, whale, whale, whale, whale, octopus, whale.

2931
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,980
- Good. - Oh, no. What?

2932
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:09,910
(Haha cleared the challenge.)

2933
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:12,280
(A new word is added to number 3 once again.)

2934
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:11,250
- Shark. - It's easy.

2935
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:12,710
Whale, whale, octopus, shark,

2936
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,750
- whale, shark, whale, whale. - Oh, no.

2937
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:17,990
Whale, whale, octopus, shark, whale, shark, whale, whale.

2938
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:18,720
(Despite the addition of a shark, she sails through!)

2939
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:19,190
- Oh, no. - Good.

2940
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,590
What?

2941
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:23,690
(This time, it's a shrimp!)

2942
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,520
- Oh, no. - Good!

2943
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,560
What?

2944
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,460
Shark, octopus, octopus, whale, shrimp, whale, whale, octopus.

2945
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,100
- Well done. - Okay.

2946
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:30,430
(Ddochi did it!)

2947
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,300
How did you do the shrimp?

2948
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,800
- Well done. - Okay.

2949
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,700
(If Se Chan makes it now, they'll clear one round!)

2950
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:35,740
Shark, shark, shrimp, octopus, whale, shrimp, gosh, hasal!

2951
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,500
Whale, shrimp, gosh, hasal!

2952
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:41,310
(Se Chan fails.)

2953
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:40,740
- Gosh! - Come here. Gosh!

2954
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:42,610
- Gosh, you should've done it. - I couldn't do it.

2955
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:44,380
- What was that? - I couldn't do the end.

2956
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:46,510
- Why did it become so hard? - What was that?

2957
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:47,680
- Ye Eun had a harder one. - I did well, right?

2958
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:48,980
- You had a hard one. - I had a hard one.

2959
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,720
- I didn't even notice the shrimp. - Right? Didn't I do well?

2960
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,950
(Ye Eun did a great job despite the unexpected words.)

2961
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:51,720
You're good.

2962
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:52,890
- I didn't even notice the shrimp. - Well done. It was so hard.

2963
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:54,960
This spot is hard. Number four is hard.

2964
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:57,290
- Jae Seok, shrimp was too much. - "Gosh!"

2965
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:59,030
(They were almost there, but Ssaebssaeb ruined it.)

2966
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,960
- Yours was easier than hers. - That's right.

2967
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,730
- Shrimp suddenly appeared. - It was hard.

2968
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:01,800
- Go further back. - The last one was hard.

2969
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,160
I've done enough.

2970
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,030
- One of you should take number one. - I'll do it.

2971
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:06,500
I want to stop.

2972
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:08,870
- One of you should take number one. - I'll do it.

2973
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,940
(Jong Kook is scared.)

2974
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:10,040
- I'll try it. - I want to stop.

2975
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,270
Will Ji Hyo take it?

2976
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,970
- Seok Jin, try it. - Ji Hyo will do it.

2977
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:14,340
- Do it with Ji Hyo. - Why?

2978
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:16,310
- Gosh. - I can do number one.

2979
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,110
(The eldest player finally gets to play the game.)

2980
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:17,880
The last one is hard.

2981
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,180
- You do it. You're better. - You do it.

2982
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:20,510
- Haha is good. - You're better.

2983
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:21,380
(They choose a member to take number 5, which is the hardest.)

2984
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:21,520
Let him do it.

2985
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,520
- Numbers 4 and 5. - Switch places.

2986
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,950
- No, number four is hard. - Switch places.

2987
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:25,720
- Just do it. - Number four is harder.

2988
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:28,590
(Feeling pressured, the middle-aged men are trying to avoid it.)

2989
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,790
- Just do it. - Number four is hard, right?

2990
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:29,220
Number four becomes tricky in the middle.

2991
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:30,660
- It becomes tricky in the middle. - Just do it.

2992
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:33,630
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Just do it.

2993
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:35,930
- I won't do it. - Soo Young's drama begins today!

2994
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:36,960
- Let's switch. You do it. - Isn't it intimidating?

2995
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,200
- Take number five. - You do it.

2996
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:40,470
(The dirty mustache pushes it to others.)

2997
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,770
- You sat down already. - I'll definitely fail.

2998
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:41,570
- Soo Young, it's too hard. - Go.

2999
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:42,770
- Go. - Go.

3000
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:43,800
Because of our age...

3001
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,510
Soo Young took the hardest one.

3002
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,470
- Yes, it's the hardest one. - It's the hardest one.

3003
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:49,080
(Number 5, Soo Young, is the most pressured.)

3004
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:48,610
- It's the hardest one. - But...

3005
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:50,310
it isn't necessarily hard.

3006
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,550
You learn from the previous ones.

3007
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:55,050
- No, things change in the last one. - For goodness' sake.

3008
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:57,250
(What's wrong with him?)

3009
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:56,980
- It's hard. - Then you take the last one.

3010
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,590
Soo Young, shall we switch places?

3011
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:59,490
(Groundless confidence)

3012
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:00,220
- No, don't do that. - Okay.

3013
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:02,590
- After all... - Only Soo Young can do it.

3014
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:04,730
- Trust Soo Young. - You can't do it.

3015
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,360
(Suddenly getting serious)

3016
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:06,460
- Don't switch places. - Accept it.

3017
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:08,260
Accept it.

3018
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,830
(He shuts down Seok Jin's bravado with a tiger's roar.)

3019
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:10,930
Don't switch places.

3020
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:12,430
- Please. - Please.

3021
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:14,070
- Seriously, Soo Young. - Let's do this.

3022
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:15,970
- Let's go. - Soo Young's drama begins today.

3023
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,370
(They have only 2 chances left.)

3024
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,570
- Soo Young's drama begins today. - Good luck with the first episode.

3025
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:19,670
- "IDOL I," let's go. - "IDOL I."

3026
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,480
(Going for the bingo, hoping for the success of "IDOL I")

3027
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,280
- "IDOL I." - "IDOL I."

3028
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,510
I'll do this for you.

3029
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,810
(Successful fan of Girls' Generation)

3030
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,780
"IDOL I."

3031
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,450
- We can do it. - Let's go. Ji Hyo, good luck.

3032
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:27,580
(The second try begins.)

3033
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,150
- I'm nervous. - Set, go.

3034
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:33,220
- It's easy. - What? Is it in the air?

3035
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:36,190
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, candy, sugar, sugar, candy.

3036
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:37,730
- Good. - That was easy.

3037
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,090
(Ji Hyo completes it.)

3038
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:41,160
Candy, candy, sugar, sugar, love, caandy, candy, candy.

3039
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,560
- Come on! - Seok Jin!

3040
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,900
Love, caandy, candy, candy.

3041
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:45,470
- Come on! - Seok Jin!

3042
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:46,200
(He pronunciation is a bit off, but he gets a pass.)

3043
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,500
Let's keep going.

3044
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,370
Love, candy, love, love, sugar, candy, candy, market.

3045
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,610
- It's hard. - It's hard.

3046
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,940
(The difficulty level goes up because they sound similar.)

3047
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:57,110
Love, market, market, sugar, sugar, love, love, candy.

3048
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:58,150
(Ye Eun completes her set!)

3049
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:58,150
- Good. - Good.

3050
01:12:58,150 --> 01:12:59,510
- It's a hard one. - Here it comes.

3051
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,580
- Good. - Good.

3052
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:01,750
It's a hard one.

3053
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,680
(Number 5 is the hardest!)

3054
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:04,890
(Will Soo Young succeed in it?)

3055
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,790
- It's a hard one. - Here it comes.

3056
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,690
Market, love, candy, love, sugar, candy, market, love.

3057
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:10,360
(She succeeds in it cleanly.)

3058
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:11,730
Market, love, candy, love, sugar, candy, market, love.

3059
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,930
- Well done. - Well done.

3060
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:17,130
(Soo Young the problem solver succeeds in the hardest set.)

3061
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:16,100
- Soo Young. - You did it.

3062
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:19,100
- We did it. - That was incredible.

3063
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,100
- You grooved to the rhythm. - "IDOL I."

3064
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,440
- "IDOL I," let's go. - "IDOL I."

3065
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,840
- "IDOL I." It was good. - "IDOL I."

3066
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,910
"IDOL I," let's go.

3067
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,610
(The dignity of the member of a girl group of 19 years)

3068
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:26,340
- You're good. - Seriously.

3069
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:27,910
- "IDOL I," let's go. - Seok Jin almost failed.

3070
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:28,940
(Level-headed)

3071
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:29,180
- "IDOL I." It was good. - "IDOL I."

3072
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:30,510
- Seok Jin. - It was hard.

3073
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:31,980
- I succeeded in it. - Seok Jin, you get a warning.

3074
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,750
- I succeeded in it. - You get a warning.

3075
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,380
- My pronunciation was a bit off. - My heart is pounding.

3076
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:37,080
- You know, - I'm nervous.

3077
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:40,120
I'm even more nervous because I represent my age.

3078
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,520
My peers are watching.

3079
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:45,260
I doubt your peers think of you as the representative.

3080
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:47,390
Be quiet.

3081
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:48,830
- Seriously. - Of course, they don't.

3082
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:50,930
Of course, they don't.

3083
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,970
Candy, love, love, love, candy, love, love, candy.

3084
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:56,200
(He shows that he still has it.)

3085
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:57,040
He'll collapse afterward.

3086
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:58,970
- Candy, love, - Candy, love,

3087
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:00,410
- love, candy. - love, candy.

3088
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:02,840
(Chuckling)

3089
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:05,080
- It'll be embarrassing to fail. - Does anyone want this spot?

3090
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:06,350
(Pressuring)

3091
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,210
- No. - You do it.

3092
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:07,410
Do you want this spot?

3093
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,050
- Do you want this spot? - Do you want Haha's spot?

3094
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:10,620
- Do you want to switch? - Okay. Only one round remains.

3095
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,690
(Seok Sam's confidence spikes after playing once.)

3096
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:11,720
- Really? Do you want to switch? - Okay.

3097
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,020
- Only one round remains. - Really?

3098
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:14,250
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

3099
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:15,390
- Let's go! - Let's go!

3100
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,860
(Going for number 3, which is difficult)

3101
01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:16,620
- Will you guys switch places? - Are you confident?

3102
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:17,960
- Of course. - He'll get it wrong.

3103
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,190
- Seok Jin will get it wrong. - Yes.

3104
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:20,290
- He took number three. - It's bound to happen.

3105
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,400
If you complete this round, the mission will be a success.

3106
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,800
(They'll succeed in the mission if they pass one more round.)

3107
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,960
- Here it comes. - Let's go.

3108
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,070
Love.

3109
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:26,200
The words will be different.

3110
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:28,470
What?

3111
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,700
- What? - Walnut, plow, walnut, plow,

3112
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,010
walnut, walnut, walnut, walnut.

3113
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:33,270
- That's it. - Is that a plow?

3114
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:34,440
It's so easy.

3115
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:35,940
Plow, plow, plow, plow,

3116
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:37,640
- walnut, walnut, walnut, walnut. - It's so easy.

3117
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,680
(Another trick question)

3118
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:39,980
- What's that? Seahorse? - Hippo.

3119
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:42,620
Walnut, walnut, plow, hippo,

3120
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,750
- hippo, hippo, walnut, dragon. - What?

3121
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:46,090
- Walnut, dragon. - What?

3122
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:48,120
(Dragon?)

3123
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:48,020
- Dragon? - It's a seahorse.

3124
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,190
Is it a dragon?

3125
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:50,490
- Seahorse. - Seahorse.

3126
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:52,290
- Why... - Hold on.

3127
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:54,260
Seahorse.

3128
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,130
(Frustrated)

3129
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:56,300
Hold on.

3130
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,100
- It looks like a dragon. - That's right.

3131
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,130
- I thought it was a dragon. - Hey.

3132
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,770
- It looks like a dragon. - I thought it was a dragon.

3133
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:03,400
(Suddenly changing his stance)

3134
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:03,070
- I thought it was a dragon. - It's a dragon.

3135
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:04,270
- Suddenly... - I mean...

3136
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,570
Dragon.

3137
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:07,370
- I thought it was a dragon. - It isn't a seahorse.

3138
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:09,480
(They begin insisting in a group.)

3139
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:08,610
- Is it... - It looks like a dragon.

3140
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:10,410
- Is it a dragon? - It's a dragon.

3141
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:12,350
- I thought it was a dragon. - Really?

3142
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,280
(Dumbfounded)

3143
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:13,850
- I thought it was a dragon. - Who'll think it's a seahorse?

3144
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:15,180
- It looks like a dragon. - Dragon.

3145
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,520
- Dragon. - The second try failed.

3146
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,950
- I thought it was a dragon. - That came out of nowhere.

3147
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:19,290
- You know... - Dragon.

3148
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:21,290
(Shutting down the arguing)

3149
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:20,720
- I thought it was a dragon. - It really looks like one.

3150
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:21,790
- I know. - It looks like...

3151
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:24,290
- his hippocampus is damaged. - It looks like a dragon.

3152
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:26,560
- His hippocampus is damaged. - Hey.

3153
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,360
- How is that a dragon? - It's a dragon.

3154
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,660
(What he truly intends)

3155
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:29,730
- Seok Jin. - Good luck.

3156
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:30,900
- Didn't you think it was a dragon? - How is that a dragon?

3157
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,130
- Seahorse. - It's a dragon.

3158
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:34,100
- Why did he call it a dragon? - Dragon.

3159
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:36,270
Hey, it looks like a dragon.

3160
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:38,070
(He was so confident.)

3161
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,500
- You try it. - Dragon.

3162
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,610
- He suddenly said, "Dragon." - I knew it was a seahorse.

3163
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:42,510
(He blows the second chance due to the damaged hippocampus.)

3164
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:41,380
- Seriously. - He had it the easiest.

3165
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:44,910
There was a hippo, so it would've been a seahorse.

3166
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:46,680
One try remains.

3167
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:50,580
(The last chance to go for it)

3168
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,350
- Let's go. - Seriously, Soo Young.

3169
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:49,580
- Let's do this. - Let's go.

3170
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:50,720
Soo Young's drama begins today.

3171
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,320
- Soo Young's drama begins today. - Good luck.

3172
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,550
The first one is easy.

3173
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:55,690
(Se Chan moves to number 1.)

3174
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:55,960
- This one is easy. - Take number four.

3175
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,130
- Ye Eun, take number five. - Ye Eun, are you confident or not?

3176
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:00,060
- What? I'm confident. - Soo Young.

3177
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,630
- Why don't you take number four? - That's right.

3178
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:02,660
Shall I take number four?

3179
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,030
- Maybe we won't get this far. - It isn't like that.

3180
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:05,630
- We won't get that far. - New words get added...

3181
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:09,640
(Placing Soo Young in seat 4 where new words are given)

3182
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:06,770
- in numbers 3 and 4. - Let's go.

3183
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,540
Nothing new gets added in number five.

3184
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:09,740
Number three is hard.

3185
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:11,040
Are there words?

3186
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:13,170
- Are there words? - No.

3187
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:15,040
- The words are simple. - Se Chan, take this spot.

3188
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,810
- Number 3. - Seok Jin, take number 1.

3189
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:18,610
(They finish placing the members after much deliberation.)

3190
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:18,080
Sit here. I'll take number two

3191
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,080
- Okay. - All right.

3192
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:22,020
(Will they be able to complete the bingo?)

3193
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,380
It's a matter of pride.

3194
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:22,480
Let's begin. Set, go.

3195
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,220
What? It's easy.

3196
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,960
Water, water, fire, fire, water, water, fire, fire.

3197
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,260
- Okay. - It's easy.

3198
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,260
Water, fire, water, fire, fire, water, water, water.

3199
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,400
- Okay. - That's a nice rhythm.

3200
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,860
(Seok Jin completes his set.)

3201
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,830
Grass.

3202
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:40,530
Water, grass, grass, fire, fire, grass, grass, water.

3203
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:41,570
- Nice. - What?

3204
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:42,640
- Honey. - Honey.

3205
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:43,940
- Water. - Nice.

3206
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,410
- What? - Honey.

3207
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,470
(As expected, a new word appears.)

3208
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,410
Water, honey, grass, water, grass, grass, honey, water.

3209
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,080
Water, honey, grass, water, grass, grass, honey, water.

3210
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:51,980
(Soo Young succeeds in it!)

3211
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,450
- Okay. The last one. - Good.

3212
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:56,380
(If Ye Eun completes her set, the 1st round will be a success.)

3213
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,920
Good.

3214
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,020
Honey, water, grass, water, fire, honey, water, grass.

3215
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:02,660
Okay.

3216
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:03,560
(They complete the 1st round.)

3217
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,930
- You did it! - All right!

3218
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:07,660
(Ace Soo Young neatly managed the risk.)

3219
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:06,160
- "IDOL I," let's go! - "IDOL I," let's go!

3220
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,760
- "IDOL I." You did well. - You did a great job.

3221
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,800
If you succeed in this round, you'll complete a bingo.

3222
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:13,200
(They'll succeed in the mission if they pass one more round.)

3223
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:10,900
- It's hard. - This is...

3224
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,330
- the last round. - Honey, water, grass, water,

3225
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:14,100
fire, honey, water, grass.

3226
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,540
- It's hard. - It's hard.

3227
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,870
(They suddenly feel pressured.)

3228
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,900
We got grass after water.

3229
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,240
Grass after water.

3230
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:20,170
- Well done. - Hey.

3231
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:22,080
- What? - Poop Face,

3232
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,080
- do you want to go first? - Try it.

3233
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,950
- Poop Face? - Poop Face, take number one.

3234
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:27,310
(Haha is picked.)

3235
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:27,210
- Take number one. - It's easy.

3236
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:28,280
Jong Kook can do it.

3237
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,750
- I can do it. - This is...

3238
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:32,550
(That's how the last members are chosen.)

3239
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:31,690
Jong Kook doesn't want to do it.

3240
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:33,520
- Can you take number three? - Of course.

3241
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,960
You get a new word in number three.

3242
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,260
- You get a new word in number 3. - Number 3.

3243
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:37,390
You're really good.

3244
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,130
(Soo Young)

3245
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:38,760
- You're good. - You're good.

3246
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,960
Soo Young and Ye Eun are great.

3247
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:43,260
(The two youngest ones are leading the game.)

3248
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,230
- They're good. - They're different.

3249
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:43,560
It's different when you're there.

3250
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,970
- You feel nervous. - That's right.

3251
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:46,500
- That's right. - The nerves are killing me.

3252
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,600
- We got this. - My palms are sweaty.

3253
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,200
- Jong Kook, try it. - I can't.

3254
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:50,800
Let's go!

3255
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,140
(The second round begins.)

3256
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:51,910
- We got this. - Let's begin.

3257
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:53,010
- We got this. - Let's go.

3258
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:58,480
Ramyeon, jjolmyeon, jjolmyeon, jjolmyeon,

3259
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,880
jjolmyeon, ramyeon, ramyeon, jjolmyeon.

3260
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:00,910
- Good. - Okay.

3261
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:01,920
It's easy.

3262
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:03,720
Ramyeon, eye mask, jjolmyeon, eye mask,

3263
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,220
jjolmyeon, jjolmyeon, ramyeon, jjolmyeon.

3264
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,650
(Seok Jin gets ulmyeon at his turn.)

3265
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:09,020
Jjolmyeon, ulmyeon, eye mask, ramyeon,

3266
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,460
ramyeon, jjolmyeon, ulmyeon, eye mask.

3267
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:11,530
- Well done. - Good.

3268
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,760
Ulmyeon, eye mask.

3269
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,860
(They get past Seok Jin's part.)

3270
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:13,830
- Well done. - Good.

3271
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,860
(Two ace members remain!)

3272
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,960
Ulmyeon, jjolmyeon, ramyeon, ulmyeon,

3273
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,730
eye mask, ulmyeon, ralramyeon, jjol...

3274
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,430
Ralramyeon, jjol...

3275
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,170
Gosh, Soo Young!

3276
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,340
Gosh, Soo Young!

3277
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:27,270
(Soo Young gets it wrong!)

3278
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:29,280
- "IDOL I" needs to be a hit. - Soo Young, even I can do that.

3279
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,810
(Mission failed)

3280
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,740
I feel so betrayed.

3281
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:35,280
(Soo Young, whom everyone trusted, blows the final challenge.)

3282
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:34,780
- Why did you get intimidated? - You're a smart girl.

3283
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,650
- Soo Young. - Why did you get intimidated?

3284
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:38,420
- That was... - Eye mask, ramyeon, jjolmyeon,

3285
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,450
(Seok Sam did it too.)

3286
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,790
ulmyeon, jjolmyeon, ulmyeon, eye mask.

3287
01:18:39,790 --> 01:18:41,860
- Even I can do it. - You better not cry

3288
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:47,390
(The challenge with Soo Young ended without completing the bingo.)

3289
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,020
Eye mask, eye mask...

3290
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,190
- You better not cry - Eye mask, ramyeon, jjolmyeon,

3291
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:45,360
ulmyeon, jjolmyeon, ulmyeon, eye mask.

3292
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,360
It was easy.

3293
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,300
- Soo Young, you got intimidated. - Since things have come to this,

3294
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,860
you need to stay with us until the penalty.

3295
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:51,830
- This won't do. - You'll need to stay.

3296
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:53,630
I did well until now and messed up number five.

3297
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,800
(She became the main culprit at the end.)

3298
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:55,470
It's a hard mission.

3299
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:56,870
- The last one... - But...

3300
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:59,740
Hold on. Don't we need to do this mission to complete a bingo?

3301
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:01,780
- What's the situation? - What's the situation?

3302
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:03,810
(If you don't complete this block,)

3303
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,380
- Then... - There's no way around it.

3304
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,980
(it's meaningless to complete this one.)

3305
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:06,280
Then we can forget about selling our drawing online.

3306
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:08,120
- Selling our drawing... - Go to the karaoke.

3307
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:11,720
(They rush to take on a different challege, but...)

3308
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,850
- We can't complete that bingo. - We must go to the karaoke.

3309
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:13,790
Sing and get a score that matches the Years of the Horse.

3310
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,290
We could do that instead.

3311
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:16,390
- It'll take a long time. - Jae Seok.

3312
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:18,360
Butcher Shop keeps asking when we're coming.

3313
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,800
(There's a customer waiting for the trade.)

3314
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:20,360
- Let's go. - This user is waiting.

3315
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,630
- Let's go and sell it. - Let's sell it.

3316
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:22,960
- Let's sell it. - Let's sell it.

3317
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,900
(They can't break a promise with the customer.)

3318
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,360
- After selling it, - We need to keep our promise.

3319
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,630
let's sing and get a score that matches the Years of the Horse.

3320
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:31,200
(Then they won't be able to complete a bingo.)

3321
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,100
Then...

3322
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,670
The remaining ones...

3323
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:30,940
Each buy an item related to horses.

3324
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:35,580
- Give us 1 more chance. - Give us 1 more chance.

3325
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:34,140
(The chance for the mission)

3326
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:35,980
(Things start to go south.)

3327
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:36,840
We have two celebrities who were born in the Year of the Horse.

3328
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:39,010
- The Year of the Red Horse. - The Year of the Red Horse.

3329
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:41,980
(Begging with all their might as the entire bingo is at stake)

3330
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:40,380
- Red Horse, White Horse. - The Year of the White Horse.

3331
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:41,980
We really want to succeed in it.

3332
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,750
(Then...)

3333
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:43,780
Then we'll give you one last chance.

3334
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:44,850
Good.

3335
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:49,060
(An extra chance is given for Soo Young)

3336
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:46,820
- This is for Soo Young. - Okay.

3337
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,590
- Good. - Thank you.

3338
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,460
We need to complete this bingo.

3339
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:53,230
I'm so nervous.

3340
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:57,700
(The last round that will actually decide today's race)

3341
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:54,930
I'm so nervous.

3342
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:57,830
I'll do it no matter what. Come on, Soo Young.

3343
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:00,300
- All right. Let's begin. - Similar words...

3344
01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:01,700
(Will they be able to succeed like a miracle?)

3345
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,240
- are confusing. - Set, go.

3346
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,910
(The very last chance begins.)

3347
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:07,010
- We're set. - It's hard.

3348
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:09,540
- We're set. - It's hard.

3349
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,750
Jisoo, Suzy, Jisoo, Suzy, Suzy, Jisoo, Suzy, Jisoo.

3350
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,380
- It's hard. - It's hard.

3351
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:15,450
It's hard.

3352
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:17,820
WOOZI, Muzie, Muzie, WOOZI, Muzie, WOOZI, WOOZI, Muzie.

3353
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:19,920
- It's hard. - It's hard.

3354
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:23,760
WOOZI, Jisoo, Muzie, Suzy, WOOZI, Suzy, Jisoo, Muzie.

3355
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,090
- Gosh, Seok Jin. - It's okay.

3356
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,490
(The result is on hold.)

3357
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:26,230
Muzie.

3358
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:27,830
- Gosh, Seok Jin. - It's okay.

3359
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:31,160
WOOZI, Jisoo, Muzie, Suzy, Muzie, WOOZI, Suzy, Jisoo.

3360
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,300
That was great.

3361
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,370
Let's go.

3362
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:36,500
Jisoo, Suzy, WOOZI, Muzie, Muzie, Suzy, WOOZI, Jisoo.

3363
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,770
(Everyone was perfect except for Seok Jin!)

3364
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,240
I was a bit...

3365
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,680
- You stuttered a bit. - It wasn't clean, right?

3366
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:44,240
(Coming clean by himself)

3367
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:43,810
He stuttered a bit.

3368
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:44,880
- But it was good enough. - Let it pass.

3369
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,750
- He grooved to the rhythm. - It's the issue of his age.

3370
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,420
- That's right. - He grooved to the rhythm.

3371
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,720
- It's the issue of his age. - That's right.

3372
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:51,320
(The production crew accepts that it's an issue of age.)

3373
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,720
- It's the issue of his age. - Do your next set perfectly...

3374
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:55,990
(Next round must be perfect for the mission to be a success.)

3375
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,450
- to succeed in the mission. - The next one.

3376
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:55,760
- There's one more round. - The next one.

3377
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,260
- One more round. - There's one more round.

3378
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:58,630
Stay alert.

3379
01:20:58,630 --> 01:20:59,930
Jae Seok, do you want to take this spot?

3380
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:01,860
(Intimidated)

3381
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:01,430
- I think... - Jae Seok practiced.

3382
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:02,500
I'll do perfectly.

3383
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:03,930
- Jae Seok practiced. - Come and take the spot.

3384
01:21:03,930 --> 01:21:05,500
- Jae Seok. - Shall I do it?

3385
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:06,870
(He only played hard for this moment.)

3386
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,530
- You'll do it perfectly. - Let's go.

3387
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:07,700
- We need to win. - Okay.

3388
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:09,270
(A shocking player placement)

3389
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:08,870
- We need to win. - Let's go.

3390
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:09,970
- Jae Seok. - Let's go.

3391
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,970
(Adding nervous Jae Seok instead of intimidated Seok Jin)

3392
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,710
- Let's do the last round well. - Aren't you nervous there?

3393
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:15,040
Jae Seok, don't be nervous.

3394
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,440
(Anxious)

3395
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:17,140
- I'll be fine... - Don't be nervous.

3396
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:19,550
- as long as I don't get nervous. - That's right. Be nervous.

3397
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:22,550
- Let's go. - Let's do this.

3398
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,150
(Will they be able to laugh in the end?)

3399
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,320
- Let's go. - Okay.

3400
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,190
- Good. - Set, go.

3401
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:30,660
Two, three, four.

3402
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:32,960
Two, three, four.

3403
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,760
Gloves, general, gloves, gloves, gloves, general, gloves, gloves.

3404
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,760
Right.

3405
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,300
It's harder than I thought.

3406
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:41,270
General, general, gloves, gloves, general, gloves, wallet, wallet.

3407
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,440
(Jae Seok...)

3408
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:49,140
Wallet, wallet, gloves, gloves, general, gloves, gloves, abacus.

3409
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:50,280
Let's go!

3410
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:53,880
(Jae Seok managed to do it even with the new word "abacus.")

3411
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,210
Wallet, wallet, gloves, gloves, general, gloves, gloves, abacus.

3412
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,280
- Okay. - Let's go!

3413
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,920
Abacus, abacus, wallet, gloves, gloves, general, gloves, wallet.

3414
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,720
- Okay! It might get to the end. - Nice.

3415
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:03,120
(Soo Young succeeds. Their fate lies on Ddochi.)

3416
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,190
- Okay. It might get to the end. - Nice.

3417
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:06,160
Wallet, abacus, gloves, gloves, abacus, general, wallet...

3418
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:09,160
Wallet...

3419
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:11,630
(There's only one word left!)

3420
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,300
Ye Eun.

3421
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,470
Wallet, abacus, gloves, gloves, abacus, general, wallet, gloves.

3422
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,040
It's correct.

3423
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,610
Wallet, gloves.

3424
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,840
(They finally made it!)

3425
01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:20,470
We barely made it.

3426
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:24,710
(They barely managed to succeed in it after pouring all their focus.)

3427
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:21,740
- Gloves. - Okay!

3428
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:24,780
- Okay! - Okay! It's over!

3429
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:26,450
- It's amazing. - This is impossible.

3430
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:28,380
- Well done. - We'll count that as a success.

3431
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:30,250
(Mission, success)

3432
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:29,980
- Success! - Yes!

3433
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:35,120
(They finally finished a line after 40 minutes.)

3434
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,590
It was so hard.

3435
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,420
Where is it? Complete a mission with a celebrity.

3436
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:35,520
It's amazing.

3437
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:37,660
- That's right. - We succeeded!

3438
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:39,260
- We need this one... - You all...

3439
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:40,660
- did a great job. - Let's go with the horse.

3440
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:43,830
The person born in the Year of the White Horse.

3441
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,500
(The key figure of the success)

3442
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:46,070
- We succeeded thanks to Soo Young. - Soo Young.

3443
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:48,700
(White Horse Soo Young)

3444
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:48,370
- Well done. - Good job!

3445
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,840
It was so hard.

3446
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,840
It was quite sudden for Soo Young,

3447
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,580
- but she came after a long time. - Right.

3448
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:57,080
- It was so... - It was really nice to see her.

3449
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,180
Above all,

3450
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:01,150
- it's probably airing on ENA. - Right.

3451
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:04,280
(Thanking Soo Young for her surprise appearance)

3452
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:03,050
- Thank you. - "IDOL I."

3453
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:04,380
- I hope many people watch it. - Right.

3454
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:07,620
(Please send lots of support to "IDOL I!")

3455
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,450
Please give her a big hand.

3456
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:07,250
- Well done, Soo Young. - Thank you.

3457
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,560
- Happy New Year. - We'll officially invite you again.

3458
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,560
- Next time. - I'll come.

3459
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,060
- Please call me. - Thank you.

3460
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:18,100
(Complete a mission with a celebrity born in the Year of the Horse)

3461
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:15,130
- We succeeded thanks to Soo Young. - That's right.

3462
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:16,660
- It was hard. - Thank you, Soo Young.

3463
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:17,760
Happy New Year!

3464
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,130
We have to go quickly.

3465
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:22,570
(Only 30 minutes before the bingo ends)

3466
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:20,470
- We have to go quickly. - Let's go.

3467
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:22,270
- We have to go. - We have to move.

3468
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:25,870
- It's almost time. - One warm light latte, please.

3469
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:27,610
(Setting off for the trade)

3470
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:27,240
- Is it time? - Is it time?

3471
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,410
- We don't have time. - It's almost time.

3472
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:30,440
(Setting off to Seoul Forest Station, Exit 3)

3473
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:30,040
Do we have to go? Let's go.

3474
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,850
Please go to Seoul Forest Station, Exit Three.

3475
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:34,810
(Seoul Forest Station, Exit 3, the showdown spot)

3476
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:33,550
- Exit 3. - Seoul Forest Station, Exit 3.

3477
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:35,350
- Let's go! - I'm in front

3478
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:38,850
Of Seoul Forest Station Exit Three

3479
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:40,590
- What is that? - Her energy came up after eating.

3480
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:41,890
- But... - After eating...

3481
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:46,460
(It's clear when the food fighter runs out of her energy.)

3482
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:42,920
It came up after eating.

3483
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,260
- Ye Eun... - Yes.

3484
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:46,090
- She's back after eating. - was taken care of.

3485
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,230
- It came up. - Right.

3486
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:48,960
(Right then, they get an answer.)

3487
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:49,960
It says "okey."

3488
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,570
(Look at this.)

3489
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,600
- "Okey?" - Is it someone old?

3490
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,970
- Is it someone old? - I've never seen someone...

3491
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:54,270
- write it like that. - The person might be old.

3492
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:56,700
- It'd be someone above 40. - Definitely.

3493
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:58,300
(They can tell the customer is old from the way they speak.)

3494
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,410
- "Okey." - But it's Butcher Shop Dessert.

3495
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:01,610
The full name is Butcher Shop Dessert Trainer.

3496
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:02,210
(Butcher Shop Dessert Trainer)

3497
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:03,380
- The person is a trainer. - The person is a trainer?

3498
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:04,010
(But their job is a trainer?)

3499
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:04,980
- If the person sees Jong Kook... - A trainer.

3500
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:05,950
(Looking bright)

3501
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:06,450
- He or she'd be really happy. - But...

3502
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:08,920
it might not be a fitness trainer.

3503
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:11,850
The ID might seem powerful, but it could be a woman.

3504
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:15,960
(What kind of person will they be?)

3505
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,690
Like my ID.

3506
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:18,590
This person would be very blessed as the year goes on.

3507
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:21,290
- This is meaningful. - Right.

3508
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:24,630
(The members are obsessed with their drawings.)

3509
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:22,300
- Seriously. - It's a very meaningful piece.

3510
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:25,330
- One dollar for this? - It's a great deal.

3511
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:28,370
It doesn't make sense to give it for one dollar.

3512
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:30,570
- We're going there ourselves, too. - I know, right?

3513
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,770
- The person wouldn't expect us. - I wouldn't believe it.

3514
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,470
(Right when Jee Star is absorbed in his drawing)

3515
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:34,570
We'll arrive at Seoul Forest after we pass this point.

3516
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,280
- It's nearby. - We're here.

3517
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:38,550
(They enter Seongsu Bridge.)

3518
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,280
- What time is it? - Are we here?

3519
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,280
The time...

3520
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:39,650
(Current time: 2:40pm)

3521
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,750
It's 2:40pm, then 2:50pm.

3522
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:45,050
(They're in time. They'll complete the bingo if they finish the deal.)

3523
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:42,920
I don't think we'll be able to succeed. We're in trouble.

3524
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:47,050
I got a message from the person.

3525
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:48,020
(Butcher Shop Dessert)

3526
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:49,820
- What did the person say? - "When will you be arriving?"

3527
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:49,920
(Current time: 2:54pm)

3528
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:51,320
We're almost there.

3529
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,160
(They find Seoul Forest Station right in time.)

3530
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:53,390
- We got here on time. - We're almost there.

3531
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:55,500
Was it a white jacket?

3532
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,330
(They're meeting at Exit 3 of Seoul Forest Station.)

3533
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,300
The person is wearing a white jacket.

3534
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:59,930
(The person is wearing a white jacket.)

3535
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,830
It's a cold day.

3536
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:02,100
We said we'd get here at this time.

3537
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,500
Should we wear our caps and masks?

3538
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,670
White jacket?

3539
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:06,410
It's in front of Exit Three on the right.

3540
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:07,440
(Right then, they arrive at the meeting place.)

3541
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:08,610
- Is it here? - This is Exit Three.

3542
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:10,840
(We need to find the person wearing a white jacket quickly.)

3543
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:11,210
- White jacket. - White jacket. Here!

3544
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,150
White jacket. Here!

3545
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,820
- Here! - Where?

3546
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:21,190
(There are 2 people wearing white jackets in front of Exit 3.)

3547
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,190
- Who is it? - The person...

3548
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:20,390
- Where? - They're here.

3549
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:22,060
- Should we all go? - If so many of us go...

3550
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:23,290
- Is that so? - Let's all go.

3551
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:27,230
(They need to make the trade within the time.)

3552
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:24,290
Let's go.

3553
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:25,730
- He'll give it to his child. - It's somewhat...

3554
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:27,860
- How did he happen to get this? - This is really...

3555
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:29,600
Let's hurry. We don't have time!

3556
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:31,430
(They fail if they are not the people they're dealing with,)

3557
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,030
We should hurry. Run!

3558
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:32,930
-Did his child ask him for this? - Hurry.

3559
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:35,300
(or if they reject the trade.)

3560
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:34,330
- Let's go quickly. - I think he'll be flustered.

3561
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:36,500
I don't know if we should all go like this.

3562
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,940
- He'd get very shocked. - I think he'd get very shocked.

3563
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:39,970
He might run away.

3564
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:42,810
(Meanwhile, a man in a white jacket is left alone.)

3565
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:42,080
- He doesn't know now. - He wouldn't know.

3566
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:45,780
- Are you perhaps... - Karrot...

3567
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:49,350
(Would he be the person who came for the Karrot exchange?)

3568
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:46,910
here for the Karrot deal?

3569
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:51,520
Butcher Shop Dessert.

3570
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:53,520
Hello.

3571
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:55,090
Butcher Shop Dessert.

3572
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:58,120
(The gentleman accepts the handshake first.)

3573
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,360
Butcher Shop Dessert.

3574
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,330
- Butcher Shop Dessert Trainer. - Hello.

3575
01:25:59,330 --> 01:26:01,760
- Are you the trainer? - Are you the trainer?

3576
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:01,930
(Nodding)

3577
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:03,960
(They found him!)

3578
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,800
What kind of trainer are you?

3579
01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:07,870
I used to do photography.

3580
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:09,470
- Photography. - Photography.

3581
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:11,370
(Butcher Shop Dessert, a former photographer)

3582
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:10,840
- You did photography, - By the way,

3583
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,270
how did you request this deal?

3584
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,480
I work part time...

3585
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:17,110
- at a convenience store. - Yes.

3586
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:18,550
I saw it during work.

3587
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:20,350
Really?

3588
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:21,180
(Staring intently)

3589
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:23,650
Haha drew this...

3590
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:25,080
(Turning)

3591
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,490
this morning.

3592
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:29,760
(The trainer is dumbfounded.)

3593
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:26,850
- We did it. - We signed on it.

3594
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:28,250
- We signed it. - We signed it.

3595
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,290
Thank you.

3596
01:26:29,290 --> 01:26:31,290
- Did you know it was ours? - No.

3597
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:32,830
(Dazed)

3598
01:26:31,290 --> 01:26:32,290
- You didn't know? - I didn't.

3599
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:34,560
- Just in case? - That's right.

3600
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:35,160
(Dazed)

3601
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,760
Are you going to give this to someone?

3602
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,460
I wanted to keep it as a keepsake.

3603
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:38,770
Really?

3604
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:40,900
- Do you like Running Man? - Yes.

3605
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,910
(A long-term Running Man fan who is rare to find)

3606
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:44,040
- I'm happy he likes Running Man. - Right.

3607
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:47,870
Did you think the piece was nice?

3608
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:51,480
It's nice, but I like Running Man in the first place,

3609
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,510
so I liked it.

3610
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:56,780
(He overestimated the quality of the drawing as he's a fan.)

3611
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:53,850
- It's warm. - I'm so grateful.

3612
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:54,910
Thank you so much.

3613
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:56,950
- Thank you. He watches Running Man. - What's your name?

3614
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,720
- It's the Year of the Red Horse. - Right.

3615
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,420
(Explaining the drawing first)

3616
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:00,820
That's why we drew a red horse.

3617
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:02,460
- The red horse. - We made it red.

3618
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:04,560
- Haha drew it. - We signed on it this morning.

3619
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,290
- Happy New Year. - Yes.

3620
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:09,260
- Thank you. - Do you do Karrot deals often?

3621
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:10,260
I do.

3622
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:11,360
His temperature...

3623
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,470
- was 40-something degrees. - You said it.

3624
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:16,340
(He has a super high level of courtesy on the app.)

3625
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:14,200
- Your temperature... - Forty-something degrees?

3626
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,100
- Forty-something? Really? - Your temperature is high.

3627
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:17,240
Right.

3628
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,370
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3629
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:20,470
- It's a cold day but you waited. - Not at all.

3630
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:21,770
(The ardent lover made a trade on a cold day.)

3631
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:22,610
- Should we just give it to him? - We should just give him.

3632
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:23,680
For free.

3633
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,350
- Let's do that. - As a gift.

3634
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:26,750
- We're so grateful. - Of course.

3635
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:29,920
(Feeling grateful, they give the drawing at one dollar.)

3636
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:27,950
- As a gift. - We should give it to him.

3637
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:29,920
- As a gift. - We'll just give it to you.

3638
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,650
- We're so grateful. - Right.

3639
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,550
- Then... - As a gift.

3640
01:27:32,190 --> 01:27:34,220
(Rummaging)

3641
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:34,990
- But... - What...

3642
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:37,090
- But... - What...

3643
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:38,460
Goodness.

3644
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:40,630
(He also prepared a gift!)

3645
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,660
- This... - It's so heartwarming.

3646
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:41,460
- It's the first... - This is the charm of Karrot deals.

3647
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,830
- Forty degrees. - It's warm.

3648
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:43,060
(Courtesy level)

3649
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:46,970
(An energy-booster who warms up our hearts as well)

3650
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:45,570
- Goodness. - It's warm.

3651
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:46,870
- It's nice. - It's so nice.

3652
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:48,740
- Forty degrees. - Forty degrees, of course.

3653
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:50,140
(There's a reason why he's at a high level.)

3654
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:50,140
- It's not easy. - We'll raise the temperature...

3655
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,140
because we're thankful.

3656
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:53,370
- We definitely should. - This...

3657
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:55,740
Were you going to give us one dollar in addition to this?

3658
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:57,640
(Originally)

3659
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:56,940
Yes.

3660
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:58,850
It's so warm.

3661
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:01,380
This is what Karrot is all about.

3662
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:01,710
(Moved)

3663
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:03,320
You feel the warmth from it.

3664
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,380
- Right. - It's so nice.

3665
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:10,290
(Even he's getting moved as well.)

3666
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:07,350
- I was so grateful... - Yes.

3667
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:09,390
that you were going to sell this precious item.

3668
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:11,490
- Thank you. - You shouldn't sell it...

3669
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,690
on Karrot again.

3670
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:16,800
(There's no selling back.)

3671
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,360
We're going to buy it.

3672
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:18,970
We're actually shooting this in 2025,

3673
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:22,300
- but it will air next year. - Yes.

3674
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:25,740
We met unexpectedly through a deal,

3675
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:27,270
but we wish you a happy New Year.

3676
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:28,880
- Happy New Year. - Stay healthy too.

3677
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,380
- Stay healthy. - Thank you.

3678
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:32,610
- Thank you. - Shall we take a picture?

3679
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:33,910
Two, three.

3680
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:36,880
(They captured New Year's memories in photos.)

3681
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:37,050
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3682
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:38,720
- Be healthy. - Thank you.

3683
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:42,720
(They succeed in the trade mission.)

3684
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,750
- Happy New Year. - Thank you. Happy New Year.

3685
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:41,990
- Happy New Year. - Thank you.

3686
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:43,020
Thank you.

3687
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,260
- Take care. - Take care.

3688
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:46,760
- He just came. - Right.

3689
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,230
- No wonder. - It's so fascinating.

3690
01:28:48,230 --> 01:28:50,760
- Jong Kook said "okey" sounded old. - Right.

3691
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,400
- Someone old. - You got that right.

3692
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,970
- This is really... - What time is it now?

3693
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,500
(But what time is it now?)

3694
01:28:56,670 --> 01:29:00,040
(They succeed only if it's before 3pm.)

3695
01:28:57,870 --> 01:29:01,310
It's 2:58pm.

3696
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:05,380
(They succeeded.)

3697
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:04,580
It's 2:58pm.

3698
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,380
- We succeeded in one. - The Karrot art piece...

3699
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:10,480
(They completed a line as they succeeded within time.)

3700
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:08,050
- We did one. - We made it.

3701
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:10,380
- We completed one. - You completed the Karrot deal...

3702
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:11,850
and completed one bingo.

3703
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,450
- Okay! - Okay!

3704
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:15,660
(Draw a horse and sell it online using the Karrot app)

3705
01:29:13,450 --> 01:29:15,960
- We only made one. - Let me please be exempted.

3706
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:17,890
(Prize sticker 1, prize sticker 6)

3707
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:19,560
We'll give you seven prize stickers.

3708
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:20,830
(They got 7 stickers in total.)

3709
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,060
- Okay. - Right.

3710
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:24,260
You can stick them...

3711
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:25,600
(They can switch the penalty with prize.)

3712
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:25,670
to any side of the dice.

3713
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:28,570
If the prize sticker faces up on both, everyone will get a prize.

3714
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:31,140
If it faces up on only one, five people will get the penalty.

3715
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:32,410
If the penalty sticker faces up on both,

3716
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:33,410
- everyone will get the penalty. - Okay!

3717
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:36,140
(Sticking "prize" on it)

3718
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:34,870
- There are seven, right? - There are seven.

3719
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:37,680
- Let's stick 3 and 4. - Okay.

3720
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:39,850
(They stick 3 and 4 stickers, aiming to get everyone a prize.)

3721
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:39,810
- Here. - Haha.

3722
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:42,080
- Stick them here, here, and here. - Right.

3723
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,580
- Stick them like that. - Nice.

3724
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:44,950
- We should stick them like that. - It should go like this.

3725
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,690
(Die 1)

3726
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:46,720
- Right. - Right.

3727
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:48,790
(Their plan is sticking them in a row.)

3728
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:48,890
- One here. - Stick one more.

3729
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:51,760
- We have to stick it here as well. - On the other side?

3730
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:51,720
(Die 2)

3731
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,960
(They stick them in a row for the other die.)

3732
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:52,930
Let's stick it after tossing it.

3733
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:53,960
- Should we stick it? - On the other side.

3734
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:55,600
Toss it like this on one side.

3735
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,760
- On the other side? - We should stick it there.

3736
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,530
- Right. That's how you do it. - You're good.

3737
01:29:56,830 --> 01:30:00,000
(They plan to turn it with a trick after sticking them in a row.)

3738
01:29:58,730 --> 01:29:59,730
You should toss it then.

3739
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:01,670
- Jae Seok and Se Chan. - We can do it.

3740
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:04,400
(The protruded mouth brothers will throw the dice.)

3741
01:30:01,670 --> 01:30:03,070
We'll toss them.

3742
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:04,140
Let the Antenna members throw.

3743
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:05,870
- Here I go. - Say, "Here I go."

3744
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:07,170
- Here I go. - Do it properly.

3745
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,440
(Se Chan goes for it.)

3746
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:08,340
- Here I go. - High up like this?

3747
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:09,340
You can do it, Se Chan.

3748
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:12,250
(The first die is in the hands of Se Chan.)

3749
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:11,380
- Let it rotate a lot. - I'll make it rotate a lot.

3750
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:12,810
- Here I go. - Throw it.

3751
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:13,680
(Die 1)

3752
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:15,250
- I'll throw it like this. - Okay.

3753
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:16,550
(The first prize or penalty of 2026 will be decided.)

3754
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:16,550
- Here I go. - Here I go.

3755
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,820
- One, two, three. - Right.

3756
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:20,250
Nice.

3757
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:22,390
- One, two, three. - Right.

3758
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:23,760
Nice.

3759
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:25,590
(The die is standing on its edge!)

3760
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:27,630
(The back of the die is for the penalty.)

3761
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:26,860
Let's go!

3762
01:30:28,230 --> 01:30:30,000
(It's the first prize and penalty of the New Year.)

3763
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:29,900
Oh, dear. No.

3764
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,770
(Will they get the prize?)

3765
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:32,100
Why is this making me nervous?

3766
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,440
(Prize)

3767
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:40,010
(They get the prize.)

3768
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:41,470
- It's the prize! - I was so nervous.

3769
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:43,610
(They managed to avoid the penalty for everyone.)

3770
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:42,910
- It's not the penalty! - My goodness.

3771
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:47,180
- That was... - This was so dramatic.

3772
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:48,850
Seriously, it was so dramatic.

3773
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:50,050
- It's all down to luck. - We can do this.

3774
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:52,050
(All that's left is Jae Seok's throw.)

3775
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:51,320
- All right. - All right, Jae Seok.

3776
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,520
- Good. - You can do this.

3777
01:30:52,190 --> 01:30:55,490
(If Jae Seok gets "prize," everyone will get the prizes.)

3778
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:53,890
- Throw it over there. - Let's do this for the New Year.

3779
01:30:53,890 --> 01:30:55,150
- You can do this, Jae Seok. - Let's do this.

3780
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:56,320
- I'll give you good energy. - We have good energy.

3781
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:58,890
(Getting the red horse's energy)

3782
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,460
- Let's go. - For the New Year.

3783
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:58,590
- You can do this. - All right.

3784
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:00,160
- You can do this. - We got this.

3785
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,630
(Shouting)

3786
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,230
For the New Year.

3787
01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:02,430
- I'll throw it. - Okay.

3788
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:06,570
(The 1st race of 2026 depends on Jae Seok.)

3789
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:04,160
- All right. - Throw it high.

3790
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,430
- Show us. - It's done!

3791
01:31:05,570 --> 01:31:06,630
It keeps going like this.

3792
01:31:06,730 --> 01:31:07,930
- Show us. - It's done!

3793
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:08,730
(He threw the die!)

3794
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:10,040
It keeps going like this!

3795
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:15,240
(Will they be able to successfully start the year 2026?)

3796
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:15,440
- Let's do this for the New Year. - It's the Year of the Red Horse!

3797
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:18,780
(Prize)

3798
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:17,010
Right. Let's keep the energy going!

3799
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:23,150
(It's the prize again!)

3800
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,650
You got the prize on both dice,

3801
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:30,820
(Everyone gets the prize.)

3802
01:31:26,650 --> 01:31:28,020
so all of you will receive the prize.

3803
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:29,720
- Yes! - We did it!

3804
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,960
I can't believe this.

3805
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,960
- This is unbelievable. - This isn't rigged!

3806
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:35,900
(The 7 members worked together for the first time in a while.)

3807
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:36,560
- This is amazing. - We're lucky this year.

3808
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,130
- We're off to a good start. - It's a good start.

3809
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:40,200
I can't believe we did it.

3810
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:44,570
(The first race of the new year was very thrilling.)

3811
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:41,970
- It was so thrilling. - That was so close.

3812
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:44,300
This is no big deal, but I was so nervous.

3813
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:45,640
How did this happen?

3814
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,010
Here's the prize for today.

3815
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:48,770
- That was so dramatic, right? - Hoping you will keep...

3816
01:31:48,770 --> 01:31:50,210
running healthy in the New Year,

3817
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:51,980
we prepared health supplements.

3818
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:53,280
- Okay. - How nice.

3819
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:55,310
- This is nice. - Thank you.

3820
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:58,380
(They're going to run healthy in the new year as well.)

3821
01:31:55,850 --> 01:31:56,980
- Thank you. - Let's eat this...

3822
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:58,850
- and work harder this year. - At the beginning of the year,

3823
01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:00,650
- we're getting good energy. - It's great.

3824
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:02,490
- Yes. - Let's boost our immunity.

3825
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:04,720
For the New Year,

3826
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:07,030
- Director Hyeong Seon... - That's right.

3827
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:08,590
newly joined us.

3828
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:10,460
- We will keep working hard. - Yes.

3829
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:12,230
It's the Year of the Red Horse.

3830
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:15,330
- Happy New Year! - Happy New Year!

3831
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:16,540
(Happy New Year to Soo Young, Butcher Shop Dessert, and viewers.)

3832
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,370
With gold prices skyrocketing,

3833
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,840
(Gold prices continue to soar in 2026.)

3834
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:21,170
the era of 1,000 dollars per 3.75g of gold is coming.

3835
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:21,170
(The era of 1,000 dollars per 3.75g of gold?)

3836
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:24,880
Only one of those bags contains gold.

3837
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,740
(Find the bag with real gold.)

3838
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:27,350
(The tiger moths are carried away already.)

3839
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:26,380
- How many grams? - Excuse me.

3840
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:27,550
Will all of us get gold?

3841
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:29,850
- Hello. - It's been a long time.

3842
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:30,250
(To challenge the members,)

3843
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:31,580
It's been forever.

3844
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:32,850
(the idols with 15 years of experience show up.)

3845
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:33,390
It's been a while since we've seen the whole group.

3846
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:35,320
(All members of Apink are here.)

3847
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:35,490
- Apink. - Apink!

3848
01:32:35,490 --> 01:32:36,720
Five! Hard!

3849
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:38,420
(Requests accepted)

3850
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:39,930
(The 15-year-old idol group...)

3851
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:39,890
- Darn it! - Oh, no.

3852
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:42,130
- That's nice, Bo Mi. - No. That's an old move.

3853
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:41,990
(leads Running Man by the nose.)

3854
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:43,530
Nam Joo is the youngest member here,

3855
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:44,730
but her moves are so old-fashioned.

3856
01:32:44,730 --> 01:32:45,830
(Busted)

3857
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:49,170
- This is it. Hang on. - It feels so heavy.

3858
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:48,330
(But even after all these years, they still have a good hunch.)

3859
01:32:49,470 --> 01:32:50,500
It's behind me.

3860
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,170
(For the gold bags that they've expertly hidden,)

3861
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,310
- Where's your bag? - We hid it.

3862
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:54,310
- I should've stolen it. - We should be quick.

3863
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:54,310
(the hyenas quickly reach out.)

3864
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:55,540
- Jae Seok! - What? Why?

3865
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:57,580
- Where is it? - Run away!

3866
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,510
(The tiger moths smell the gold and fly at it.)

3867
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:59,210
(A showdown with the tiger moths)

3868
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,280
- No. - Haha, catch her!

3869
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,980
- Hurry. Se Chan. - This is a really awful show.

3870
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:01,980
Hurry and go!

3871
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:02,010
(15 years of friendship versus 16 years of experience)

3872

(Who will take home the gold bag?)

3873
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,080
Get over there!
