00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,080
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,980
(Running Man)

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,080
- Hello. - Hello!

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,080
Hello.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,390
(Everyone is busily going to work.)

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,150
This place is...

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,250
It's been a really long time since I've been to Yeouido.

8
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,220
(The members are gathered at a building in Yeouido.)

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,590
- Look at the big window. - This is really nice.

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,390
(The view)

11
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,060
- Why is it so good? What is this? - It's amazing.

12
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,630
- This is great. - I didn't know about this place.

13
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,260
My goodness. What is this?

14
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,400
- This video? - Oh, right.

15
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,930
(Ye Eun went viral for a choir song on Ji Hyo's YouTube channel.)

16
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,900
I was surprised when I watched this.

17
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,170
- Seriously, - It's hilarious.

18
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,400
- you have to watch this. - It's so funny.

19
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,800
We were on Ji Hyo's YouTube channel.

20
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,140
(Testimony from the witness, Se Chan)

21
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,910
Ye Eun showed us what she did...

22
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,680
- when she auditioned for "SNL." - Right.

23
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,010
Jong Kook couldn't believe why she hadn't done it before.

24
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,480
(You should have done it earlier.)

25
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,380
- Why didn't you? - Why did you not show us sooner?

26
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,810
I didn't have a chance to show it on Running Man.

27
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,380
Actually, Ye Eun goes to church for real.

28
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,890
- Right. - Yes. I play the piano,

29
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,020
She plays the piano at church.

30
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,390
- and I'm a choir member. - She's a choir member.

31
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,260
- You should show us. - And her singing skills...

32
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,060
- I'm good, right? - She's not good at singing pop,

33
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,590
- She sings hymns well. - but she's good...

34
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,660
- at singing hymns. - Is she good?

35
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,960
The collaboration between hymns and pop is really fun.

36
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,260
- Show us the choir singing. - Show us.

37
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,770
Which song? Something like...

38
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,670
(A sneak peek of a real choir song)

39
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,970
- Sing "Silent Night, Holy Night." - "Silent Night, Holy Night?"

40
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,170
- Sing it. - Yes.

41
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,870
Silent night

42
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,210
- Soprano. - Yes.

43
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,040
Keep going. After doing this...

44
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,780
(It's hard to say that she's good.)

45
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,950
- I can see that. - Ye Eun, keep going.

46
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,310
- She's good. - You have to do this first.

47
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,220
(She turns red in embarrassment.)

48
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,580
- You should do it. - It's good.

49
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,490
- She's really... - She sounds like an aunt.

50
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,290
My mother-in-law sings like this.

51
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,860
- Then... - Sing a pop song.

52
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,860
(Next is a mix with a pop song.)

53
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,190
- A pop song? - Yes.

54
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,260
My tingling feelings for you

55
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,660
My tingling feelings for you

56
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,530
(She's good.)

57
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
Can you hear them?

58
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,200
- I need you - She's good.

59
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,470
I love you

60
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,470
- She's good. - You're good.

61
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,640
I told you she was good.

62
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,310
She sings well with that style.

63
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,810
Try singing "Tell Me."

64
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,610
(A song request)

65
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,580
Tell me, tell me

66
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,980
(The church girl is a singing genius.)

67
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,680
- Nice. - She's good.

68
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,210
- That's good. - It's your specialty.

69
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,250
- Isn't she good? - She's good.

70
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,250
She sings well.

71
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,580
(It still lingers in his mind.)

72
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,780
My tingling feelings for you

73
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,820
Can you hear them?

74
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,490
(Encore)

75
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,650
- I need you, I love you - I need you, I love you

76
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,060
Why are you doing this with your hands?

77
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,290
- Can you hear them? I need you - She needs the gesture.

78
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,560
(She can't sing without them.)

79
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,330
- I love you - To make it exciting.

80
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,360
It's like "Mrs. Doubtfire."

81
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,960
(The youngest one's opening show ends.)

82
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,190
It was really hilarious.

83
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,360
- It was fun. - I didn't know you could do that.

84
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,370
All right. We have guests joining us today.

85
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,770
(Special guests for the new year)

86
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,700
- We do? - Yes.

87
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,940
- Who are they? - Please bring in the guests.

88
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,210
It's been a really long time.

89
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,070
(Excited)

90
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,440
- Hello. - Apink!

91
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,010
(Apink came to Running Man as a full group.)

92
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Hello.

93
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,580
- It's been forever. - Hello.

94
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,480
- I can't believe this. - Ha Young, Eun Ji!

95
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,210
- Hello. - It's been a really long time.

96
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,920
- Welcome. - Hello.

97
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,550
(Bo Mi, Cho Rong, Ha Young, Eun Ji, Nam Joo)

98
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
- Hey. - You guys look amazing.

99
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,380
You've lost a lot of weight.

100
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,390
Hey.

101
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,190
I almost didn't recognize you.

102
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,220
- It's been a while, Eun Ji. - Hello.

103
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,560
It's been a really long time.

104
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,160
(Apink is back after 3 years, celebrating their 15th anniversary.)

105
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,330
(Apink makes a comeback on the 5th with "Love Me More.")

106
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,960
Bo Mi is back after a long time.

107
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,570
(They perform "Love Me More" on Running Man.)

108
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,300
- They're so good. - It's been a long time.

109
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,670
This is great.

110
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,440
- Look at them! - My goodness, the youngest one.

111
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,970
They're amazing!

112
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,840
- My goodness, the youngest one. - They're amazing.

113
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,710
(The youngest one, Ha Young)

114
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,810
Look at his reaction. A middle-aged man's reaction.

115
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,780
- "Oh, dear." - Nice.

116
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,150
(Laughing)

117
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,880
Oh, dear.

118
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,580
- My goodness. - Gosh.

119
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,080
It's been a really long time.

120
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,290
- Apink! - They're back after a long time.

121
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,490
Apink! There you go!

122
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,320
(A terrible imitation)

123
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,490
Apink!

124
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,090
- Just as expected. - Apink!

125
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,260
- Nice. - I knew it.

126
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,290
Look at Cho Rong.

127
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,560
Cho Rong!

128
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,370
(Apink is back with their more lovely looks.)

129
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,800
- Cho Rong! - They're so good.

130
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,430
Eun Ji! Ha Young!

131
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,570
- They're so talented. - Love me more

132
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,870
- They're really pretty. - Nam Joo, I like your expression.

133
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,740
They're the best.

134
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,140
Apink is back after a long time.

135
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,540
- Yes! - Yes!

136
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,380
(Please send lots of love to "Love Me More.")

137
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,550
Their new song is "Love Me More."

138
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,420
They're back as a full group.

139
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,320
It's been a long time since we've seen you all together.

140
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,650
- Right. - That's true.

141
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,390
- It's been about three years. - Right.

142
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,690
- Yes. - It's been a really long time.

143
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,420
(Out of nowhere)

144
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,960
Cho Rong is funny.

145
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,560
Do you feel reassured to be here with the members?

146
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,430
I feel reassured. And since we're back with a new album,

147
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,460
(It is extra reassuring because it's a full-unit comeback.)

148
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,260
it feels even better.

149
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,100
Eun Ji, I don't know how long it's been.

150
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,970
- It's been forever. - It's been a really long time.

151
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,930
(Since they last came to Running Man.)

152
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,870
You were here on our ninth anniversary, right?

153
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,870
Yes. It was around that time.

154
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,540
We got a party It was when we did this.

155
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,540
- With Seok Jin. - Party

156
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,810
Right. Kwang Soo and I made an album with them.

157
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,840
- Right. - It was for the special episode.

158
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,610
(It was 7 years ago.)

159
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,050
- Yes. - That's right.

160
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,010
That's right.

161
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,980
(They performed "Party" together for "Running Man's fan-meet.")

162
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,050
- That's when we met last. - Right. It was the last time.

163
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,050
Yes.

164
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,390
It was a long time ago.

165
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,190
- Yes, it was a long time ago. - It's been a long time.

166
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,590
(It's nice to see them after such a long time.)

167
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,120
- It was about 5 or 6 years ago. - It was 6 years ago.

168
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,390
It's been about 5 to 6 years.

169
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,360
(There's another good news.)

170
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,360
Bo Mi, you're getting married.

171
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,760
- Yes. - Really?

172
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,630
- In May? - In May.

173
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,130
(Rado and Bo Mi are getting married in May.)

174
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,730
- Congratulations. - Really?

175
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,330
She's getting married in May.

176
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,130
(Her uncle is proud.)

177
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,170
That's nice.

178
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,370
- In May. - I'm happy for you.

179
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,400
With Rado.

180
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,170
It still doesn't feel real.

181
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,810
- It still doesn't feel real? - No.

182
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,910
That's because it's not May yet.

183
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,380
- It will hit you when May comes. - Okay.

184
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,010
(A stunning bride in the month of May)

185
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,080
And we have Ha Young, the Soccer Hustler.

186
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,120
Soccer Hustler?

187
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,680
- Right. - She's a hustler.

188
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,190
No. I've...

189
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,690
We were scammed by her.

190
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,320
- We were scammed. - I've improved more.

191
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,520
- You're lying. - I got better.

192
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,060
Are you good at playing soccer?

193
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,590
- I'm really good. - I knew it.

194
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,230
(In Episode 697)

195
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,730
We can tell right away once we see you kick the ball.

196
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,860
(She boasted about how good she was at soccer.)

197
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,930
- Sure. - Show us.

198
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,970
Shoot.

199
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,130
(Screaming)

200
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,370
Oh, no.

201
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,370
(The Soccer Hustler ended up showing her poor skills.)

202
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,440
- Darn it. - Ha Young just swore.

203
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,440
I've improved. Why did you not call me?

204
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,470
Ha Young, we can't believe you.

205
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,040
- I met Ha Young at the gym. - Yes.

206
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,210
She said, "I've been playing soccer a lot."

207
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,110
"I'm even better than you now."

208
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,880
Whenever people see me, they say, "Hey, Girl Kim Jong Kook."

209
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,290
(Like Soccer Kim, her skills fall short compared to her enthusiasm.)

210
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,290
- Girl Kim Jong Kook? - And I deny it.

211
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,120
- My goodness. - Girl Jong Kook?

212
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,760
I feel really wronged. Please let me play soccer.

213
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,990
(Girl Jong Kook)

214
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,160
It's not easy to shake off that nickname.

215
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,530
We will see.

216
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,860
And Nam Joo is back after a long time.

217
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,360
- Right. - It's been really long.

218
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,760
- Nam Joo. - It's been a while.

219
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,070
How have you been?

220
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,170
I'm a college student now.

221
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,570
- Really? - Do you go to school?

222
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,840
Yes. I've returned to school after seven years.

223
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,010
- Really? - It's been ten years,

224
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,270
but I haven't graduated yet.

225
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,940
Did the school accept her when she returned?

226
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,040
But it's been seven years.

227
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,210
If it's been seven years, shouldn't I take the exam again?

228
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,920
So I went through the readmission process.

229
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,880
(She was readmitted after the readmission process.)

230
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,320
- You did? - I've been readmitted.

231
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,050
- Really? - So do you go to school now?

232
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,890
- Yes. - When will you graduate?

233
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,150
I don't know.

234
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,020
Make sure to go to school.

235
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,320
I just can't go to school now.

236
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,730
I returned to school with Shin Ye Eun.

237
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,560
- With Ye Eun? - So...

238
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,530
Yes. We haven't graduated yet.

239
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,730
- I see. - Now, Nam Joo sounds...

240
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,730
like an experienced artist.

241
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,570
That's not true!

242
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,970
- It is true. - No.

243
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,910
(Overly exaggerated tone and gesture)

244
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,140
"I've returned to school."

245
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,380
(The friendly and yet harsh chat about their recent events is over.)

246
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,680
- No. - She makes gestures like this.

247
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,850
Today, with Apink, who show off their golden friendship,

248
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,880
(Today's race is revealed.)

249
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,420
we will have the Gold Bag Chaser: Gold Me More Race.

250
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,820
- My goodness. - What's that?

251
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,790
For today's race, you'll be divided...

252
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,290
- into three teams. - Okay.

253
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,060
Each team will choose a bag.

254
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,260
And only one of those bags has gold in it.

255
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,460
- The gold price... - It's risen significantly recently.

256
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,200
- Is it real gold? - Yes, it's real gold.

257
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,030
- Real gold? - How big is it?

258
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,170
(Excited)

259
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,540
When the final Judgment Stand opens,

260
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:44,810
(The race is over when they place the bag on the Judgment Stand.)

261
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,840
you can only place one bag on it.

262
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,310
The team that finds the gold bag and places it on the stand wins...

263
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,510
(Win)

264
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,380
and receives the gold as a prize.

265
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,450
All the members of the other teams will get a penalty.

266
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,250
(Penalty for all)

267
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,050
- All of them? - All of them?

268
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,180
Those who fail to find the gold will get the penalty.

269
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,280
- Exactly. - All of them?

270
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,290
You are allowed to steal the other team's bag...

271
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,390
or switch yours with theirs.

272
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,090
- We can steal it? - But each team...

273
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,530
can have only one bag.

274
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,930
We can't keep two bags.

275
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,300
And you will receive hints about the gold bag after missions.

276
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,570
We've divided you into three teams.

277
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,470
(Team Jae Seok: Jae Seok, Se Chan, Cho Rong, Bo Mi)

278
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,640
Jae Seok, Se Chan, Cho Rong, and Bo Mi are one team.

279
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,940
(Team Jong Kook: Seok Jin, Jong Kook, Ye Eun, Nam Joo)

280
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,640
- Bo Mi and Cho Rong. - Seok Jin, Jong Kook,

281
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,280
Ye Eun, and Nam Joo are one team.

282
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,950
(Team Haha: Haha, Ji Hyo, Eun Ji, Ha Young)

283
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,550
Haha, Ji Hyo, Eun Ji, and Ha Young are one team.

284
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,780
- Okay. - Okay!

285
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,650
- It's good. - Okay. Haha has a backache today.

286
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,980
Haha is the weakest one today. He has a backache.

287
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,050
What do we do?

288
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,820
(Which team will claim the gold bag at the end?)

289
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,690
- Okay. Let's go. - Okay.

290
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,690
Let's go.

291
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,590
What? There's a mat.

292
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,030
(While the members get dressed...)

293
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,460
Seeing that the mat is laid out,

294
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,200
(A blue mat is laid out for the mission.)

295
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,330
we must be doing a mission first.

296
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,460
I hope this isn't a game where I have to use my brain.

297
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,370
I'm good at games where I use my body.

298
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,170
I have a bad backache now.

299
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,840
- We will do it. - Yes, you take care of it.

300
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,510
(Haha is getting his back treated, so he will be left out.)

301
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,040
- Don't worry. - I'm sorry.

302
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,610
It's really serious.

303
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,940
Oh, no.

304
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,680
All right. This mission is called I Don't Know the Answer.

305
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,980
I Don't Know the Answer.

306
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
I Don't Know the Answer?

307
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,750
- E-cigarette? - "I Don't Know the E-cigarette?"

308
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,190
I Don't Know the Answer

309
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,290
(Is it this one?)

310
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,720
(That's correct.)

311
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,660
The first-place team will receive a powerful chance card...

312
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,760
Chance! Okay.

313
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,160
- and bag selection priority. - Nice.

314
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,630
That's good.

315
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,970
Two players from each team will participate.

316
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,640
We will play music for you.

317
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,470
- You will dance to the music, - Okay.

318
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,170
- and we will give you a quiz. - Okay.

319
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,040
There will be cushions with the answers...

320
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,410
to those questions written on them.

321
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,580
You should sit on the cushion you think is the correct answer.

322
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,750
- We have to sit on it? - There will be a physical fight.

323
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,690
There will be two cushions with the correct answer.

324
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,790
- Two? - Yes.

325
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,390
If you get the correct answer, you earn two points.

326
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,960
And the best dancer gets one point.

327
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,260
- I see. - Okay.

328
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,030
We need a good dancer.

329
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,370
So the team with the highest score...

330
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,870
(The team that wins will get a chance card...)

331
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,930
- will get a special benefit. - Okay.

332
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,970
(and first priority for bag selection.)

333
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,070
- Eun Ji and... - Eun Ji is really strong.

334
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,800
- Okay. - She's the strongest one.

335
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,870
(Power Eun Ji)

336
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,810
We will place the cushions first.

337
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,810
We'll get ready.

338
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,280
The options? I see.

339
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,110
(There are 6 cushions with numbers on them.)

340
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,750
It's 1, 2, and 3.

341
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,020
(If they sit on the cushion with the correct answer, they succeed.)

342
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,910
So, one of them is the correct answer.

343
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,220
You should sit on the cushion that you think is correct.

344
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,480
All right then.

345
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,020
(Each team will have 2 players.)

346
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,850
First, Nam Joo will play.

347
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,050
- Nam Joo should play. - I'll dance.

348
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,690
- Nam Joo should play. - I'll play later.

349
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,920
(Nam Joo, who wants scores for dancing,)

350
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,820
Seok Jin and Nam Joo.

351
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,960
- I'll play. - Seok Jin?

352
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,590
(and Brainiac Seok Sam play.)

353
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,360
Okay, Seok Jin. You should go.

354
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,960
All right then. Ssaebssaeb...

355
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,200
- and Cho Rong will play first. - Right.

356
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,200
(For Team Jae Seok, Se Chan and Cho Rong play.)

357
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,030
- Me? - Yes, Ssaebssaeb and Cho Rong.

358
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,970
Dancing Machine Jung Eun Ji.

359
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,500
This is the first time I've heard that.

360
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,310
Isn't she a workout machine?

361
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,080
(For Team Haha, Strong Ji Hyo and Strong Eun Ji play.)

362
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,380
Eun Ji is a workout machine.

363
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,580
- We're ready. - Okay. We will play the music.

364
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,710
(The first question)

365
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,720
(What is this familiar melody?)

366
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,450
It's "I'm So Sick."

367
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,690
("I'm So Sick" by Apink)

368
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,060
- Nam Joo. - There you go, Nam Joo.

369
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,530
There you go!

370
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,230
Jung Eun Ji!

371
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,530
There you go!

372
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,800
You're dancing well.

373
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,730
(She dominates the camera from the center.)

374
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,300
- Okay! - Good.

375
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,770
Okay, Nam Joo!

376
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,840
There you go! I knew it.

377
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,770
Take the center spot!

378
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,110
Jung Eun Ji!

379
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,470
- Go! - No, I can't do that.

380
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,940
Go.

381
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,080
(The center is too much for the main vocalist.)

382
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,240
I can't.

383
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,650
Cho Rong, you can't dance carelessly.

384
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,720
(Move over!)

385
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,850
(Screaming)

386
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,320
- She's different. - Switch places.

387
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,990
(It seems like she is getting pushed aside...)

388
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,020
She's really different.

389
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,990
(But she takes back the center spot right away.)

390
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,390
- Where are you going? - There you go.

391
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,090
- Take the spot. - Kim Nam Joo!

392
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,690
(Right up close)

393
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,090
Kim Nam Joo!

394
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,190
Nam Joo!

395
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,730
- There you go! - She's so good.

396
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,500
(They won't give up the center spot.)

397
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,430
- Take the center spot. - Cho Rong.

398
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,930
- Let's do this. - Okay!

399
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,160
(Whistling)

400
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,830
(The first question)

401
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,530
- What is it? - What?

402
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,300
- Seven. - Nine, seven, one.

403
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,600
Hang on.

404
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,110
What is it?

405
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,510
- Seven. - Nine, seven, one.

406
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,680
Three.

407
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,640
- What? - Three.

408
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,920
- Cho Rong. - Stay seated.

409
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,720
(Surprisingly, Se Chan snatched 3, the correct answer.)

410
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,350
- What? - Three.

411
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,320
(Eun Ji takes the other cushion with number 3.)

412
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,350
Cho Rong, it's three.

413
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,090
Stay seated.

414
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,320
- Three. - Stay seated.

415
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,460
(Jee-rasoni goes after the correct answer.)

416
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,790
- Three! - Stay seated.

417
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,290
(Eun Ji)

418
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,960
- Stay seated. - It's three!

419
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,330
(Eun Ji holds on with her strength.)

420
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,570
(Groaning)

421
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,940
(Seok Sam is pushed away by the strength.)

422
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,770
- She's strong. - How is she so strong?

423
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,670
Cho Rong. My goodness.

424
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,170
Nice!

425
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,310
(Everyone is busy stealing 3 from each other.)

426
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,980
Cho Rong, it's three.

427
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,480
Stay seated.

428
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,050
- Just stay seated. - That's one.

429
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,050
- Three! - Three! Nice!

430
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,920
(She landed on 2.)

431
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,050
Cho Rong, it's three.

432
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,490
- Stay seated. - Three.

433
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,090
(The returning student, Nam Joo, is holding on to 2 for some reason.)

434
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,990
Cho Rong!

435
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,820
(Cho Rong is wandering.)

436
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,020
- It's three! - Stay seated.

437
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,730
- Three! - Sit down!

438
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,390
(Frustrated)

439
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,200
- Three! - Three, two, one.

440
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,400
(She tussles with Nam Joo for 2.)

441
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,230
Stop!

442
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,630
How is she so strong?

443
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,930
Gosh, Cho Rong...

444
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,670
- Seok Jin. - She's too strong.

445
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,070
- Eun Ji is really strong. - Seok Jin.

446
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,170
(He was pushed away by Eun Ji and couldn't even sit.)

447
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,740
- I got pushed away. - Cho Rong.

448
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,480
The correct answer is three.

449
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,550
(Se Chan from Team Jae Seok gets 2 points for getting the answer.)

450
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,140
Here. I got one.

451
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,680
Se Chan and Eun Ji...

452
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,310
- got the correct answer. - Okay!

453
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,280
(Eun Ji from Team Haha also gets 2 points.)

454
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,280
- Yes! - Nice.

455
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,390
What do you have?

456
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,050
Why are you sitting on two?

457
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,220
(He can't understand it.)

458
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,190
- Nam Joo. - What? You had two?

459
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,390
Nam Joo.

460
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,590
- What was that? - Why...

461
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,490
- Isn't the answer two? - By the way,

462
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,760
Nam Joo, why did you hold on to two?

463
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,430
(It seems like she could be an Empty Head.)

464
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,360
Seok Jin.

465
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Ye Eun said,

466
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,500
"The answer is 8, but why isn't there an 8?"

467
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,370
(The answer)

468
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,470
(All of a sudden, 8?)

469
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,970
- Why is it 8? - "Why isn't there an 8?"

470
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,010
- Why? - What is it?

471
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,340
- That's it? - There's the question.

472
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,940
Nine minus seven...

473
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,640
- Nine minus seven. - Seven...

474
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,850
Eight.

475
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,120
(After using her 10 fingers, she got the answer 8.)

476
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,080
- Isn't it eight? - Three!

477
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,490
(She's realized something is strange.)

478
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,350
- I see. - What? No.

479
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,930
(The new Empty Head has a unique way of counting.)

480
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,020
Are you out of your mind?

481
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,890
My goodness.

482
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,960
- Why is it 8? - "Why isn't there an 8?"

483
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,830
The dancing point goes to Nam Joo.

484
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,370
- The dancing point. - The dancing point.

485
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,770
(She didn't get the answer, but she got 1 point for dancing.)

486
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,970
- I got the dancing point. - Okay.

487
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,200
The dancing point.

488
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,640
(Current score: Team Haha 2, Team Jae Seok 2, Team Jong Kook 1)

489
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,240
Ha Young, come on out.

490
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,270
- Ha Young, get the dancing point. - Okay.

491
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,110
I'll do the math in the back.

492
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,140
(Each team's dancer comes up, aiming for the dance points.)

493
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,280
All right, Bo Mi.

494
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,510
- You should get the dancing point. - Okay.

495
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,150
All right. Let's move on to the next question.

496
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,780
(The second question)

497
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,210
Next question.

498
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,850
- Play the music. - Music.

499
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,050
(Music cue)

500
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,850
Let's go.

501
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:04,490
("Famous" by ALLDAY PROJECT)

502
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,790
Go.

503
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,520
- ALLDAY PROJECT. - Ha Young.

504
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,090
(This song is...)

505
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,560
What is it?

506
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,130
(It's "Famous" by ALLDAY PROJECT, the rookie mixed group.)

507
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,960
(This song is famous for its signature hand sign.)

508
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,230
Ha Young.

509
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,970
(Ha Young seems to know the dance.)

510
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,670
Go!

511
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,100
Why? What is it? What about Ha Young?

512
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,930
(He has no idea.)

513
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,770
- Ha Young. - Why? What is it?

514
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,840
- Go. - What about Ha Young?

515
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,010
It's ALLDAY PROJECT.

516
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,310
(At that moment...)

517
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,140
(Bo Mi steps forward as if she's been electrocuted.)

518
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,010
Good.

519
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,110
- Nice. - Bo Mi, keep up the spirit.

520
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,210
(Apink's main dancer doesn't know the dance...)

521
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,850
(but pushes forward with spirit.)

522
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,820
Keep going.

523
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,350
Good. That's nice.

524
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,420
What's this?

525
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,390
- The hand warmer. - Where is this from?

526
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,790
What's this?

527
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,960
(Picking up)

528
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,190
The hand warmer.

529
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,130
Where is this from?

530
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,060
(Is it mine?)

531
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,760
- Go ahead and dance. - No.

532
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,530
(While everyone is busy fighting for the center spot...)

533
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,600
But I can't...

534
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,300
What are you doing?

535
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,770
Go ahead and dance.

536
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,870
(Ddochi is red and can't even join the battle.)

537
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,040
Just go.

538
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,500
Go ahead and dance.

539
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,670
Go ahead and dance.

540
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,740
(In the meantime, the dance battle has become even more intense.)

541
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,910
- Hurry. - I can't dance.

542
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,810
- What are you doing? - Just dance.

543
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,350
(She did see it.)

544
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,750
- Hurry. - Good, Bo Mi.

545
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,980
- Nice, Bo Mi. - Yes!

546
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,580
(The spirited dance is truly excited.)

547
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,520
Dance.

548
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,720
Ha Young!

549
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,350
(Don't fall behind!)

550
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,120
Ha Young, show us the move.

551
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,550
- Bo Mi. - Show us your move.

552
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,860
(Ha Young intercepts her.)

553
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,060
- Show us your move. - Bo Mi, this one.

554
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,590
Seriously...

555
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,160
(Colliding with Twerking Bbom)

556
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,260
- Bo Mi. - Show us your move.

557
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,360
(Whistling)

558
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,560
- What? - Look at the question.

559
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,630
Now isn't the time for that.

560
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,330
(The second question)

561
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,300
- What? - Look at the question.

562
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,970
- What? - Look at the question.

563
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,870
Two.

564
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,040
- What? - What is it?

565
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,410
The question.

566
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,380
- What? - What is it?

567
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,010
(Blurry)

568
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,240
I can't see the question.

569
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,680
Look at the question.

570
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,580
- What? - What is it?

571
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,080
- What is it? - I can't see the question.

572
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,720
(Bo Mi quickly takes 2.)

573
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,020
Push her.

574
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,350
Fight for it.

575
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,390
- Keep it. - What?

576
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,360
(Concealing it tightly)

577
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,930
- Two. - What is it?

578
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,000
(She just sits on 2 without checking the question.)

579
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,690
I can't see. The question.

580
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,360
- I didn't see the question. - Push her.

581
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,030
- Three, four. - Is it two?

582
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,130
Yes. Hold on to it. It's two.

583
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,700
(The correct answer is 2!)

584
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,800
I didn't see it.

585
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,240
I didn't see the question.

586
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,740
- Is the answer here? - It is.

587
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,140
"Is the answer here?"

588
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,540
Is the answer here?

589
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,180
(Jae Seok looks for 2, 1 step behind.)

590
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,850
Jae Seok, take Eun Ji's.

591
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,150
Eun Ji!

592
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,510
Jae Seok, take Eun Ji's.

593
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,480
Good, Eun Ji. There you go.

594
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,120
(He tries to steal the cushion.)

595
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,620
Say, "What are you doing?"

596
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,490
- "Why are you doing this?" - Hey.

597
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,490
(Laughing)

598
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,250
- Kick him. - Let go of it.

599
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,520
(Eun Ji is relaxed even under Jae Seok's attack.)

600
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,690
Eun Ji, let go of it.

601
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,030
Eun Ji, let go of it.

602
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,330
(Jae Seok is exhausting himself.)

603
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,860
Eun Ji, let go of it.

604
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,660
Three.

605
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,600
(Bo Mi hides to a safe place, avoiding Team Jong Kook.)

606
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,170
- Two, one. - Eun Ji, let go of it.

607
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,370
Stop.

608
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,930
Eun Ji.

609
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,540
Eun Ji.

610
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,770
(Time is up.)

611
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,470
(Holding tight)

612
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,310
It's us.

613
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,070
We got it.

614
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,410
It touches her knees.

615
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,680
The correct answer is two.

616
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,620
(Strong Eun Ji held on to 2 until the very end.)

617
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,150
Eun Ji got it.

618
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,620
(She successfully kept the cushion with the correct answer.)

619
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,590
Eun Ji is the best.

620
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,960
You can never take it from her.

621
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,330
Nice!

622
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,460
(Team Haha got 2 points.)

623
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,430
I didn't see Bo Mi at all.

624
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,000
(Bo Mi was able to hold on to the answer from the beginning.)

625
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,160
- We're doing well. - The dancing point goes to Bo Mi.

626
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,300
(She got 2 points for the answer and 1 point for the dance.)

627
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,370
- Okay. - Okay. We got three points.

628
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,970
- Jae Seok. - What?

629
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,440
Why did you lift me up?

630
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,370
(Giggling)

631
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,370
- My gosh. - Eun Ji is amazing.

632
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,910
(Current score: Team Haha 4, Team Jae Seok 5, Team Jong Kook 1)

633
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,410
Well done.

634
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,440
- Right. - Eun Ji is impressive.

635
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,840
(He truly got a taste of Power Eun Ji's strength.)

636
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,910
Eun Ji is strong.

637
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,710
Eun Ji, how can you be so strong?

638
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,050
Cho Rong, let's do this.

639
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,650
We will get you the new cushions.

640
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,920
They're alphabets.

641
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,120
- I'm in trouble. - It's English.

642
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,920
(Next is an English word question.)

643
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,750
- English? - Okay.

644
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,490
- I and e. - Cho Rong, are you good at English?

645
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,620
No.

646
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,760
(Honest)

647
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,890
Hey.

648
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,920
(Jae Seok only has Dongducheon Boy to trust.)

649
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,460
Jae Seok, English is okay.

650
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,830
I can answer English questions.

651
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,130
- Are you good at English, Nam Joo? - Yes.

652
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,700
- Okay. - Do you speak good English?

653
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,400
(He's not too sure.)

654
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,000
(For Team Jong Kook, Nam Joo and Seok Sam play.)

655
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,160
- Yes. I know this much. - Right.

656
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,670
Ha Young, you've been learning English. You do it.

657
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,770
- English? - All right.

658
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,670
- She's learning English. - Ha Young learns English?

659
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,170
(For Team Haha, Ha Young and Ji Hyo play.)

660
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,140
Yes. She's learning English.

661
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,940
- Don't pick the same cushion, okay? - Yes.

662
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,710
(It's a strategy.)

663
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,970
Pick two different ones.

664
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,770
- This is an English question. - Yes.

665
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,680
- Nam Joo is here again. - Play the music.

666
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,510
- Nam Joo is back? - How can I beat her?

667
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,910
Cho Rong, dance.

668
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,620
- How can I beat her? - Cho Rong, dance.

669
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,680
(What is the third song?)

670
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,250
- Dance. - Go, Ha Young.

671
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,650
("Overdrive" by TWS)

672
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,890
What?

673
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,790
(Nam Joo steps up.)

674
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,120
Seriously!

675
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,520
- Seriously! - Go.

676
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,460
There you go.

677
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,630
(The fight for the center spot is heating up again.)

678
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,560
What is this song?

679
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,400
Oh, right. This is the song.

680
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,700
("Overdrive" by TWS is famous for its cute challenge.)

681
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,110
(Ha Young comes up to the stage from behind.)

682
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,210
Ha Young is coming.

683
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,510
Let's go.

684
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,980
Good, Ha Young.

685
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,750
(The epitome of a cute tantrum)

686
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,120
Cho Rong.

687
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,720
(Cho Rong is also cute.)

688
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,220
You're so cute.

689
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,390
(And...)

690
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,090
- She's good. - Nam Joo, you're the best.

691
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,660
You're the best in Korea.

692
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,220
- Nice. - That's good.

693
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,530
No, Nam Joo!

694
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,830
(Please)

695
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,730
- That's too old-fashioned! - Nam Joo, you're the best.

696
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,360
- That's an old move, Nam Joo. - Nam Joo, you're the best.

697
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,630
Nam Joo is impressive.

698
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,860
(Mouth wide open)

699
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,300
Look at her.

700
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,500
(The twirl master is back in 2026.)

701
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,500
- Nam Joo. - Has she always been like this?

702
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,970
- Yes. - Is she always like this?

703
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,240
Nice.

704
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,570
(Playful Monkfish)

705
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,410
- You're pretty. - Okay.

706
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,410
Ha Young, you're good.

707
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,450
- Nam Joo doesn't know the dance. - There it is.

708
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,050
(The next question)

709
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,020
What is it?

710
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,980
(Ha Young is studying English these days.)

711
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,890
- It's "calendar." - What? I don't know.

712
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,250
(She gets both of them.)

713
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,250
- What is it? - It's "a."

714
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,320
Sit here, Ji Hyo.

715
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,890
- Calendar. - Calendar.

716
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,420
(She got one for her teammate, Ji Hyo.)

717
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,360
Ha Young, hold on to it.

718
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,460
(At this moment, Seok Sam goes after E.)

719
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,300
Ha Young, hold on to it.

720
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,930
Good job. She sat on the right one.

721
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,230
(Ji Hyo versus Seok Sam)

722
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,230
Good!

723
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,900
- That's it. Nam Joo, help her. - Nam Joo.

724
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,410
Look at them.

725
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,170
(The female members have a fierce battle over "E.")

726
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,940
- Hey! - Nam Joo.

727
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,410
(Meanwhile, Cho Rong...)

728
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,610
- Calendar. - I didn't see it.

729
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,110
(She sits on "A" awkwardly.)

730
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,250
- Calendar. - I didn't see it.

731
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,580
Is it "a," Cho Rong?

732
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,750
- Hey. - Nam Joo, help her.

733
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,120
(She must have sat down without looking...)

734
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,550
Cho Rong...

735
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,660
- Three, two... - One.

736
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,290
(Ssaebssaeb returns with a leftover "A.")

737
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,790
It's "a."

738
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,130
- Three, two, - One.

739
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,500
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo are still fighting over the "E.")

740
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,160
one.

741
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,060
My goodness.

742
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,600
(Seok Sam failed to steal the cushion again.)

743
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,570
My team is so reassuring.

744
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,940
My team is so reassuring.

745
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,600
Ha Young.

746
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,610
(Team Haha is sure that it is an "E.")

747
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,810
You did a good job.

748
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,470
I almost died...

749
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,640
Calendar.

750
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,280
Is it "der?" Gosh, it's "e."

751
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,380
- Is it "e?" - I picked "a."

752
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,950
(Calendar versus calender, Which one is correct?)

753
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,780
- Me too. - I think it's "e."

754
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,820
The answer is "a."

755
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,850
A?

756
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,090
- It's "a!" - Yes!

757
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,050
It's "a!" We got it!

758
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,390
It's "a!"

759
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,160
(The two of Team Jae Seok got it right by luck.)

760
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,960
- That's amazing. - My goodness.

761
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,960
- The answer is "a." - A?

762
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,060
(Ha Young was sure that it was "E.")

763
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,900
- What? - Is it "a?"

764
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,630
- Is it "calendar?" - Did you not know?

765
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,800
- It's "a." - Is it "a?"

766
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,970
(Eun Ji didn't know, either.)

767
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,530
- Yes, it's "a." - That's amazing.

768
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,200
Why did I think it was "e?"

769
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,540
- You... - Why?

770
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,740
(Today's English word: It is calendar.)

771
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,370
Jae Seok, it's "calendar."

772
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,510
Calendar.

773
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,510
Calendar. Haha.

774
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,340
- The British accent. - I thought you knew.

775
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,410
Since when did it change to "a?"

776
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,180
- My goodness. - It can be confusing.

777
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,980
- It's "dar." - I thought it was "e."

778
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,950
The dancing point goes to Ha Young.

779
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,690
(Still, Ha Young got the dancing point.)

780
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,950
Nam Joo did a good job.

781
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,750
The dancing point goes to Ha Young.

782
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,190
(It's not me?)

783
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,720
Nam Joo did a good job.

784
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,890
(It's more disappointing than losing the answer for the dancing queen.)

785
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,560
Nam Joo doesn't know the dance.

786
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,960
- So, how did Ha Young dance? - That makes no sense.

787
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,060
She did this.

788
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,830
- I did that move. - Even I know that.

789
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,930
Hey!

790
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,270
Despite being the youngest member, Nam Joo only does outdated moves.

791
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,740
- She's dancing like she's old. - But Nam Joo...

792
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,810
(Her dance moves are mature, like old kimchi.)

793
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,540
- Only the twirl master does this. - It's outdated.

794
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,180
(It's been over 20 years.)

795
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,350
- The twirl master. - Her moves are clean.

796
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,050
Next up is another English quiz.

797
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,120
(Team Jae Seok got 4 points with 2 correct answer cushions.)

798
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,350
- Let's see. - Here we go.

799
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,820
(Current score: Team Haha 5, Team Jae Seok 9, Team Jong Kook 1)

800
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,790
Play the music.

801
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,590
Bo Mi, focus on getting points for dancing first.

802
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,890
- Okay, let's go. - It's "Mr. Chu."

803
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,990
("Mr. Chu" by Apink)

804
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,020
It's "Mr. Chu."

805
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,330
Okay, let's go!

806
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,260
(Twirling)

807
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,330
(She's dancing like she really means it this time.)

808
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,500
What's up with her?

809
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,970
(Genuine intensity)

810
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,910
(Look at Nam Joo!)

811
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,440
- Look at Nam Joo. - Chu!

812
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,940
- Jae Seok, she's intimidating. - What's up with her?

813
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,980
Look at her.

814
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,980
- Why is she all the way over there? - What's up with her?

815
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,350
- Nam Joo! - Come on.

816
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,550
- What's gotten into her? - Seriously?

817
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,620
(The twirl master is dead set on getting points for dancing.)

818
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,450
- What... - Go, Nam Joo!

819
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,090
Why is she standing so close to the camera?

820
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,350
Is that even the right choreography?

821
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,360
(The others give 100 percent, while she gives 20,000 percent.)

822
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,820
- Look! - Why does it look corny?

823
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,760
- It's corny! - Nam Joo, come on.

824
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,130
Her dancing's too corny.

825
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,530
She's hilarious.

826
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,730
(Team Leader Kook is completely satisfied.)

827
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,130
- Go, Nam Joo! - Stop wiggling your butt!

828
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,630
- I mean... - She doesn't go that hard...

829
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,770
even when we're on stage.

830
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,930
How...

831
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,970
What on earth?

832
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,440
All right!

833
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,700
- What on earth? - I have no idea.

834
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,370
- Average? - Average.

835
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,540
- Average. - Average.

836
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,710
- It's "a." - It's not that one.

837
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,740
Okay, good.

838
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,080
- Average? - Average.

839
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,880
(Quietly sitting on the cushion, labeled A)

840
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,950
- It's "a." - "I?"

841
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,250
I have no idea.

842
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,350
- It's "a." - "I?"

843
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,990
(Jong Kook gets a cushion with A too.)

844
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,850
This is the one.

845
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,320
- Wait. It's average. - I'm right.

846
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,860
(Sitting in the corner, out of sight)

847
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,960
- "A." - Where's the "a?"

848
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
I know I'm right.

849
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,430
It's "a."

850
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,390
(Jae Seok keeps searching for A.)

851
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,430
- Is it I? - No, the answer is "a!"

852
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,800
- "A." - No, it's "i."

853
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,730
(Checking Eun Ji's cushion)

854
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,200
- Darn. - Darn.

855
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,730
- All right! - Hold on.

856
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,070
(Found it.)

857
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,070
- It's "a." - She has "a."

858
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,140
"A?"

859
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,440
Let go!

860
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,810
- It's "a." - Yes!

861
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,370
(Another battle between Jae Seok and Eun Ji.)

862
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,310
- Go on. - Let go!

863
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,680
(Eun Ji is no pushover.)

864
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,640
Don't do this.

865
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,950
The answer is "a."

866
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,920
- I think it's "a." - The answer is "a."

867
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,490
(Jong Kook and Eun Ji get the correct answer.)

868
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,720
Yes!

869
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,350
Thank goodness you held onto it.

870
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,420
It was "a."

871
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,890
(Jae Seok lost to Eun Ji again.)

872
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,130
Nam Joo wins the point for dancing.

873
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,560
(Team Jong Kook got 3 points, including the dance point.)

874
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,730
- Yes! - Nicely done!

875
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,660
(Current score: Team Haha 7, Team Jae Seok 9, Team Jong Kook 4)

876
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,830
- Good work, Nam Joo. - She's too much.

877
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,000
(Team Jae Seok is still taking the lead.)

878
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,130
There's nothing you can do...

879
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,230
if Jong Kook and Eun Ji get the cushions.

880
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,530
We're back to numbers.

881
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,640
The numbers are larger than before.

882
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,010
Can't you give us songs by Sobangcha or something?

883
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,110
(They are back to numbers.)

884
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,910
("Last Night Story" by Sobangcha)

885
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,940
- That's what I'm talking about. - Nice.

886
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,510
Hey!

887
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,610
(The playlist suddenly went old-school.)

888
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,450
- That's what I'm talking about. - Nice.

889
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,750
- Hey! - It's an oldie.

890
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,620
(Her body remembers the tune from back in the day.)

891
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,920
Ji Hyo, go for it!

892
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,220
(Nam Joo, move.)

893
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,590
(She swings her short arms and dominates the dance floor.)

894
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,690
Look at Ji Hyo.

895
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,290
- This is Ji Hyo at a team dinner. - Look at her.

896
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,090
(This is her after at least 4 rounds of drinks.)

897
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,800
- Check out Ye Eun. - Hey, Ye Eun.

898
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,630
(The aggressive Giant Ji)

899
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,570
- Check out Ye Eun. - Hey, Ye Eun.

900
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,270
- Ye Eun, nice! - Look at her.

901
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
(Gasping)

902
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,400
- Look at her. - Ye Eun.

903
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,200
(Gasping)

904
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,440
- Go, Ye Eun. - Ye Eun, nice.

905
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,870
(The inflatable balloon flaps around vigorously.)

906
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,810
Nice. I love it.

907
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,980
Nice.

908
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,180
(They're all in a trance.)

909
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,180
This is amazing!

910
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,780
- Look at Ji Hyo! - Go, Ji Hyo!

911
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,280
Is this an event or something?

912
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,120
- Is this an event or something? - Are you jumbo balloons?

913
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,450
(As they show off their dance moves of unknown origin)

914
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,450
They're all great.

915
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,890
- Nice job. - Here we go.

916
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,890
(Time for the quiz)

917
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,020
Go, Nam Joo.

918
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,020
- Go for it. - What's the answer?

919
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,160
- Go ahead. - Five, eight...

920
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,800
(Focusing right away)

921
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,360
- Go ahead. - Five, eight...

922
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,430
- Three. - What's the answer?

923
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,430
- It's three. - What's the answer?

924
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,830
(The answer is 3!)

925
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,500
(The cushion with the correct answer)

926
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,570
- What's the answer? - Go ahead.

927
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,670
(Surprisingly, Nam Joo sits on the right cushion.)

928
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,570
What's the answer?

929
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,640
- What's the answer? - Go ahead.

930
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,270
(5 and 3)

931
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,910
(The jumbo balloon takes both for now.)

932
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,880
What's the answer?

933
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,380
Give me one!

934
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,380
Give me one!

935
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,450
Wait, what's that?

936
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,380
(Cho Rong clings to Ye Eun after a desperate cry.)

937
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,490
- My gosh! - What do you have?

938
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,350
(Shrieking)

939
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,620
- Cho Rong, what do you have? - This.

940
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,160
(She got the answer 3!)

941
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,560
- I didn't see what was on it. - Ye Eun.

942
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,260
- What? - Cho Rong, I'm sorry.

943
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,090
(Polite)

944
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,760
No!

945
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,660
- Cho Rong, I'm sorry. - No!

946
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,630
(Ji Hyo takes it from her.)

947
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,200
- There you go. - Cho Rong, I'm sorry.

948
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,700
- Nice. How simple was that? - Seriously, Cho Rong?

949
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,100
(Relaxed)

950
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,570
She's so strong.

951
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,370
- You're the best. - She's a beast.

952
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,640
(Whispering)

953
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,770
- She's stronger than I am. - Cho Rong!

954
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,010
(Ji Hyo has one,)

955
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,910
- Secure your cushion. - Cho Rong!

956
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,510
(so who will take the other?)

957
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,910
It's under Nam Joo.

958
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,110
(The cushion with 3 is under Nam Joo's bottom.)

959
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:04,110
- Take Ji Hyo's. - Her butt...

960
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,010
(Just go for the other one.)

961
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,380
- Your butt... - Take Ji Hyo's.

962
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,880
- Hold on. - Go after Ji Hyo's.

963
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,390
- Cho Rong, take Ji Hyo's. - Ye Eun...

964
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,490
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

965
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,390
(Two of them try to tackle her.)

966
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,320
Wait, from behind. One, two... Lift her up.

967
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,960
Okay. One, two, three...

968
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,030
One, two, three.

969
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,930
Ji Hyo's on the floor but still holding onto her cushion.

970
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,700
(Not budging)

971
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,370
- Go for it! - Ji Hyo, I'm impressed.

972
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,370
Here's one.

973
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,740
(Ji Hyo won by a landslide.)

974
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,700
She wouldn't budge.

975
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,540
- I'm impressed. - She sat there peacefully.

976
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,540
That was impressive.

977
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,980
- She must be heavy. - The correct answer is three.

978
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,380
Show us.

979
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,150
Go, Nam Joo!

980
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,350
(General Ji Hyo secured the cushion with a 3.)

981
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,950
Nice. We're dominating.

982
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,350
- Go, Nam Joo! - What was this one?

983
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,590
- Nicely done. - We're dominating.

984
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,590
(Nam Joo gets one right for the first time.)

985
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,390
The point for best dancing goes to Ji Hyo.

986
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,130
(Team Haha secures 3 points in 1 round.)

987
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,930
Go, Ji Hyo.

988
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,630
(Current score: Team Haha 10, Team Jae Seok 9, Team Jong Kook 6)

989
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,560
It was all Ji Hyo.

990
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:56,330
(Team Haha takes the lead.)

991
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,900
- Nice! - Nice.

992
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,330
We're dominating.

993
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,070
(In the next round...)

994
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,200
Here's the next quiz.

995
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,970
Look. Look at Ji Hyo.

996
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,810
(Ji Hyo has her dance shoes on and wins best dancing again.)

997
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,410
The point for best dancing goes to Ji Hyo.

998
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,440
The correct answer is five.

999
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,580
(She even got the answer and won 3 points.)

1000
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,910
- Nice. - She kept it.

1001
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,380
(Team Jae Seok got 2 points.)

1002
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,350
Wait. Was there a cushion with a five?

1003
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,250
- I didn't see it. - This is the last quiz.

1004
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,880
(Current score: Team Haha 13, Team Jae Seok 11, Team Jong Kook 6)

1005
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,280
- I'm so tired. - Sure.

1006
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,790
(They have one question left.)

1007
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,850
- The last quiz. - Ha Young, go ahead.

1008
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,690
- Eun Ji, are you good to go? - I'll do it.

1009
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,690
(Team Haha tries to lock it down.)

1010
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,960
- Yes! - Are you sure?

1011
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,120
She's dominating.

1012
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,420
- It'll be us two. - Sure.

1013
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,760
(Team Jae Seok is falling behind by 2 points.)

1014
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,630
- We need to win best dancer. - Got it.

1015
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,930
Let's win best dancer this round.

1016
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:27,260
(They need the dance point in order to turn the tables.)

1017
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,700
Play a song from our time.

1018
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,770
All right. Here's the last quiz.

1019
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,370
(The last question)

1020
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,870
- Sure. - Here we go.

1021
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,330
Play the music.

1022
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,970
("Barefooted Youth" by Buck)

1023
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,970
- Nice. I love it. - This song!

1024
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,510
(A song from their time that they desperately wanted)

1025
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,910
- Nice. I love it. - This song!

1026
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,640
- This is for you. - Here we go!

1027
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,710
(Let's win some points!)

1028
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,780
(The Bucktooth Brothers perform mirror dancing.)

1029
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,850
Look at Ha Young.

1030
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,820
(What is she doing?)

1031
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,060
Crawl under my legs.

1032
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,030
Jae Seok, crawl under my legs!

1033
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,260
Come on.

1034
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,860
Let's go!

1035
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,670
(The Bucktooth Brothers' unique performance,)

1036
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,260
- You're good! - Let's go!

1037
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,670
- All right. - Let's go!

1038
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,340
- Go! - Let's do this!

1039
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,270
Two. One, two, three, four.

1040
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,170
(The dance floor only gets hotter.)

1041
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,810
Get closer to the camera.

1042
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,180
Give us the quiz.

1043
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,240
(Coming back to his senses)

1044
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,010
- Bring it. - Nice.

1045
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,950
(The final round)

1046
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,080
It's "c."

1047
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,020
It's "c."

1048
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,450
- "C?" Let me see. - It's "c."

1049
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,620
- Scissors. - Scissors.

1050
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,890
- Isn't it "c?" - Isn't it scissors?

1051
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,460
(Like a miracle, Se Chan got the answer.)

1052
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,520
- Scissors. - Scissors.

1053
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,560
(Seok Jin takes the cushion with the C.)

1054
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,860
Isn't it scissors?

1055
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,830
(Ha Young has her hands on it too.)

1056
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,860
This isn't it.

1057
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,260
Scissors.

1058
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,760
Scissors.

1059
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,630
(Wrong)

1060
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,130
Is this it?

1061
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,800
It's "c."

1062
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,800
(Seok Sam grabs S which is the wrong answer.)

1063
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,370
- It's "c." - Scissors.

1064
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,400
It's scissors.

1065
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,340
- Isn't it scissors? - It's scissors.

1066
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,310
(Kim English is on the fence.)

1067
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,740
No, this isn't it.

1068
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,140
- Wait. What do you have? - "C," which is wrong.

1069
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,080
(Acting)

1070
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,680
- What do you have? - "C," which is wrong.

1071
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,310
- "C." - Oh, right!

1072
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,320
(Jong Kook hunts for the correct answer.)

1073
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,780
- Catch! - No, don't.

1074
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,850
(Passing to Jae Seok)

1075
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,320
- Go for Se Chan's. - Jae Seok, over here!

1076
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,960
(The weak Jae Seok gets stopped immediately.)

1077
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,560
Over here. Go for Jae Seok's.

1078
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,530
(Growling)

1079
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,960
(Mopping the floor)

1080
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,470
(He got it.)

1081
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,240
Jong Kook stole it.

1082
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,770
Go, Kim Jong Kook!

1083
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,670
(Good job!)

1084
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,170
Kim Jong Kook.

1085
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,070
- Go, Jong Kook. - Wait. Hold on.

1086
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,710
(Where's the answer?)

1087
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,250
- Wait. Hold on. - What...

1088
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,380
What...

1089
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,320
(It's in Jae Seok's hand!)

1090
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,790
- I have it. - What's this?

1091
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,850
(Growling)

1092
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,720
(Dragging)

1093
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,060
(Sweeping the floor for the 2nd time)

1094
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,700
- Three, two, - They're still going at it.

1095
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,730
(The 3-second countdown!)

1096
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,460
one!

1097
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,100
(Time's up.)

1098
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,400
It's on my knee.

1099
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,170
(It's here.)

1100
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,100
- What on earth... - What about the cushion?

1101
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,100
- Break it up. - He needs the cushion.

1102
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,810
(He held on to the answer, while he was crumpled like a sticker.)

1103
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,270
- It's "c." - You never know, so just grab one.

1104
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,570
The correct answer is "c."

1105
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,610
See? It's "c."

1106
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,340
- Jae Seok... - Who has "c?"

1107
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,310
- Is that how you spell scissors? - Jae Seok.

1108
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:59,320
(Jae Seok's persistence is acknowledged, and he gets 2 points.)

1109
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,680
- It's "c." - But I have the cushion.

1110
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,080
You need a cushion for it to count.

1111
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,850
- It's "c." - Who won this round?

1112
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,350
(Proud)

1113
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
It's "c."

1114
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,760
- Who won this round? - Ha Young also got it right.

1115
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,020
(Ha Young of Team Haha also gets 2 points for the answer.)

1116
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,690
Meet Charlie's Angels.

1117
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,790
- Who gets best dancer? - The best dancer...

1118
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,330
- goes to Jae Seok. - Okay!

1119
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,700
(The 1 dance point goes to Team Jae Seok.)

1120
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,400
You won best dancer.

1121
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,630
Nice.

1122
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,200
I can't believe you guys.

1123
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,270
- I'm good. - I'm touched, guys.

1124
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,270
(The total result of the scores...)

1125
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,700
Ha Young and Eun Ji are no joke.

1126
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,110
- My team is the best. - Tell me about it.

1127
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:25,140
(Final score: Team Haha 15, Team Jae Seok 14, Team Jong Kook 6)

1128
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,870
Here's the result of the first mission.

1129
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,480
Team Haha wins with 15 points.

1130
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,380
(Team Haha, only in name, got 1st place.)

1131
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,580
No way.

1132
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,210
- You guys are insane. - No way.

1133
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,480
They're out of this world.

1134
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,980
Team Jae Seok is in 2nd place with 14 points.

1135
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,850
- That was so close. - That was close.

1136
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,150
(Team Jae Seok is a close 2nd.)

1137
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,450
- We lost by one point. - What a bummer.

1138
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,190
(Team Jong Kook is in last place.)

1139
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,260
- They're really good. - Team Haha won,

1140
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,590
so they get the chance card.

1141
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,660
(1st place benefit: The only chance card of the day)

1142
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,900
The chance card can be used just once...

1143
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,800
(Chance card)

1144
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,230
at the moment of your choice.

1145
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:51,700
You must use it up before we give you the final hint.

1146
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,800
- Before the last hint. - At the end, then.

1147
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,970
- At the end. - Yes.

1148
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,110
Here's the chance card.

1149
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,740
(General Song takes it.)

1150
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,080
- Keep it for later. - She's really strong.

1151
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,450
- She's... - She's an ox.

1152
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,750
- She's an ox. - No one could lift her...

1153
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,910
once she sat down.

1154
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,280
When she's sitting down...

1155
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,820
She's like Thor's hammer.

1156
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,290
- She's an ox. - Once she sits...

1157
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,390
They could try to steal the chance card too.

1158
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,620
(Let's be careful.)

1159
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,690
- I'll keep it. - Yes.

1160
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,360
Put it in your underwear.

1161
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,890
Ji Hyo.

1162
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,530
They're coming in.

1163
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,460
(1st place benefit: Priority to choose a briefcase)

1164
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,630
It feels bulky.

1165
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,830
- You can't touch them. - Okay.

1166
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,430
The girls have been doing this for a while,

1167
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,200
so they speak freely.

1168
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,270
I said someone could steal the card, and Ha Young said,

1169
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,210
"Put it in your underwear."

1170
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,740
- What? - In her underwear.

1171
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,880
(Sneaky feel)

1172
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,910
Don't touch that.

1173
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,450
Don't touch that.

1174
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,220
- We were told not to touch it. - Don't touch it.

1175
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,420
(Disobeying)

1176
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,850
- Can you tell? - Don't.

1177
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,190
- You can't touch it. - Oh, no?

1178
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,650
(Only one of them is a real briefcase.)

1179
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,050
- I won't touch them. - Why are you acting out?

1180
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,720
(They can only look at them when choosing.)

1181
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,160
I'm not acting out.

1182
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,790
- He's not acting out. - What did you say?

1183
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,590
(Keep your hands off.)

1184
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,590
- Who's acting out? - What did you say?

1185
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,760
(Team Haha that won the mission selects a briefcase first.)

1186
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,290
- They're scary. - You can only look.

1187
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,600
Team Haha came first, so you get first pick...

1188
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,330
(That one)

1189
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,100
- out of A, B, and C - Which one?

1190
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,700
I have a feeling it's C.

1191
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,900
You think so? We have no clues at all.

1192
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,870
(They look pretty much the same.)

1193
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,940
- We have nothing. - We don't.

1194
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,540
- We pick C. - C?

1195
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,910
(Team Haha followed their instinct and chose Briefcase C.)

1196
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,910
Okay. Team Jae Seok?

1197
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,910
Which should we pick?
- A? - A.

1198
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,010
- A. - A.

1199
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:12,780
(Team Jae Seok: A, Team Jong Kook: B, Team Haha: C)

1200
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,010
Fine, then.

1201
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,110
- Automatically, - It's A.

1202
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,220
- you get B. - It can't be helped.

1203
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,080
We'll give you your briefcases before you set off.

1204
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,920
(Which one has gold?)

1205
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,090
- Okay. - Sure.

1206
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,590
One hour from now, we'll give you a mission...

1207
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,890
where you compete for a hint to figure out the gold briefcase.

1208
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:23,190
(They will take on a mission for clues about the gold briefcase.)

1209
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,200
That means you have an hour to eat lunch and strategize.

1210
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
- Good. - Yes.

1211
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,960
Each team can pick...

1212
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,200
one of the three options we prepared.

1213
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,570
- The dishes... - We should've won.

1214
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,300
- are sujebi, - That sounds good.

1215
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,800
- pork cutlet, - Oh, nice.

1216
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,040
- and gukbap. - Gosh.

1217
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,170
- I want gukbap. - Gukbap.

1218
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,810
All three sound good.

1219
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,910
We'll have gukbap.

1220
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,010
(Team Haha who won the mission chooses gukbap.)

1221
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,840
- We'll have gukbap. - Gukbap.

1222
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,310
- Did you pick gukbap? - Yes.

1223
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,820
All your missions will be sloppy.

1224
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,950
- Nicely said. - What was that?

1225
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,390
(He squashes them with a diss.)

1226
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,950
- All your missions will be sloppy. - Nicely said.

1227
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,290
What was that?

1228
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,460
- How mean. - You'll be sloppy.

1229
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,460
Will you have pork cutlet?

1230
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,390
You'll do a sloppy job in the end.

1231
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,630
Will you have pork cutlet?

1232
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,560
- Wait while we... - You'll get chopped up.

1233
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,530
(Timid)

1234
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Eat what you want.

1235
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,570
- Pork cutlet. - Pork cutlet?

1236
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,700
- Pork cutlet. - One, two, three,

1237
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,470
(Team Jae Seok chooses pork cutlet.)

1238
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,730
- pork cutlet. - Pork cutlet.

1239
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,570
- Then you have sujebi. - Sujebi.

1240
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,540
(Team Jong Kook goes with sujebi.)

1241
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,740
- Okay. Head to the restaurants. - It doesn't matter.

1242
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,110
I bet Yeouido has some great sujebi.

1243
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,380
(Which team will win the mission?)

1244
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,940
- It's good, yes. - Of course.

1245
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,340
- With anchovy broth. - Sujebi.

1246
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,550
Is this ours?

1247
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,210
(Team Jong Kook chose Briefcase B.)

1248
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,380
We can't look inside. I'll keep it for now.

1249
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,550
Let's see...

1250
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,320
What's this? There's nothing inside.

1251
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,320
- What do you mean? - The sound...

1252
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,060
(You can't tell if there's gold inside by shaking it.)

1253
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,160
Wouldn't it have a piece of paper saying "gold?"

1254
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,630
It must be a piece of paper.

1255
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,900
Why is it so...

1256
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,560
(Clicking)

1257
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,860
- It's open. - What?

1258
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,630
- Is that allowed? - It's not completely open.

1259
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,600
- This isn't completely open? - No.

1260
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:41,670
(It opens for real when they enter the passcode.)

1261
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,970
- It's not allowed, right? - It's open.

1262
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,200
- There's a code. - Wear your seat belt.

1263
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,210
What? Oh, it's not open.

1264
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:49,050
(While Seok Sam is taking a good look at the briefcase)

1265
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,280
I thought I'd opened it.

1266
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:56,790
(Team Jae Seok chose Briefcase A.)

1267
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,180
We can't look inside the briefcase.

1268
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,550
Can't we lift it?

1269
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,990
I did, but it didn't help.

1270
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,990
There's nothing inside.

1271
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,960
Wouldn't there be a piece of paper?

1272
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,960
Can I try holding it?

1273
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,090
- It's empty. - There's nothing inside.

1274
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,400
(Shaking)

1275
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,930
I think it's just a piece of paper.

1276
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,300
- Right? - Yes.

1277
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,930
(They're making cluelesss guesses about the gold briefcase.)

1278
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,100
- If it clunked, anyone would... - Yes.

1279
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,330
Then it's obvious.

1280
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,570
Haha's team has the best advantage.

1281
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,810
(Team Haha is in the most favorable position with the chance card.)

1282
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,640
Toward the end, they'll get a hint that tells...

1283
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,580
who has the gold briefcase.

1284
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,880
Cho Rong, your hair's almost...

1285
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,480
Does it show?

1286
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,680
Why? Are you wearing extensions?

1287
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,320
We haven't yet revealed our hairstyles for the comeback.

1288
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,760
(They put on hair extensions to hide the concept of their new song.)

1289
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,460
- It's a secret. - You haven't revealed it yet,

1290
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,290
- so you're hiding it. - Yes.

1291
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,760
Does the length of your hair tie in with the concept?

1292
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,830
Yes. I cut my hair.

1293
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
To a bob.

1294
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,930
- It's a bob? - That's why.

1295
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,270
- That's a thing? - Yes.

1296
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:50,370
(Short hair is Se Chan's favorite.)

1297
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,940
That's why my hair's like this.

1298
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,310
It's just you?

1299
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,010
Cho Rong is Se Chan's ideal type.

1300
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,480
(Turning around)

1301
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,640
- For real? - For real?

1302
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,480
- What are you on about? - What?

1303
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,210
You said so yourself.

1304
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,080
- Se Chan. - On Running Man? Yes, that's right.

1305
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,780
- Sit next to Cho Rong. - Yes.

1306
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,290
(Next to Cho Rong)

1307
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,690
- Come here. Sit next to Cho Rong. - What's wrong with you?

1308
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,320
(He dashes over.)

1309
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,160
- Thank you. - He's embarrassed.

1310
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,190
- "Thank you." - You're happy, right?

1311
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,890
Immediately after the shoot, I called Jong Kook.

1312
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,360
"This is great. It's great."

1313
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,400
(He mentioned Cho Rong endlessly.)

1314
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,900
He talked so much about Cho Rong.

1315
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,370
- She's the giving type. - No.

1316
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,240
"You even do this for a guy?"

1317
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,640
Is that so?

1318
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:23,040
Cho Rong's a shining single lady.

1319
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,170
Is she?

1320
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,210
Did you break up recently?

1321
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,410
- No. - You just shine.

1322
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,150
We'll get to know you, Cho Rong.

1323
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,780
We can't tell Se Chan to make a move...

1324
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:36,920
(With help from people around him, he flashes a gummy smile.)

1325
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,020
based on just one statement from someone.

1326
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,590
- Goodness. - We'll do some research too.

1327
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,520
- Let's figure things out. - Yes, about Cho Rong.

1328
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,360
(Sighing)

1329
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,960
- Gosh... - Yes.

1330
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,890
Are we off to eat now?

1331
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,930
- Yes. - Oh, okay.

1332
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,630
Will they give us a hint as we eat?

1333
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,570
- They won't. - After we regroup in an hour?

1334
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,470
- I think we should eat fast, - This is great.

1335
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,200
then go to another restaurant...

1336
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,140
(They're planning to attack the other team after a meal.)

1337
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,310
- To shake them up. - and shake things up.

1338
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,810
(Gukbap)

1339
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,810
Let's come up with some ideas to defend our briefcase.

1340
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,750
(Team Haha is being briefed on the chance card.)

1341
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:03,750
So you can strategize, I'll explain how to use the chance card.

1342
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,750
(Chance Card)

1343
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,420
When you want to use it,

1344
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,920
raise the card into the air...

1345
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,590
and yell, "Everyone, freeze!"

1346
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,790
All the members present will freeze for 60 seconds.

1347
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,760
(A golden opportunity to immobilize the opposing team for a minute)

1348
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,760
- I see. - That's insane.

1349
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,100
However, you must use the card before the last hint is given out.

1350
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,600
This makes us invincible.

1351
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,830
They said we can steal another briefcase.

1352
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,540
- We can toss ours and take another. - Yes.

1353
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,370
(We can toss Briefcase C.)

1354
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,310
Haha, considering the other teams, I don't think we can steal...

1355
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,310
from anyone.

1356
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,480
- We... - We could also run away.

1357
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,950
- Let's say a team approached us. - Yes.

1358
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,120
(They can either use the chance card to steal their briefcase...)

1359
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,320
We can yell "freeze..."

1360
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,580
(or run away.)

1361
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,480
and run away while they're frozen.

1362
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,590
After the second or so hint, we must think of a way...

1363
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:47,620
(When will Team Haha use their one chance?)

1364
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,720
- to not lose our briefcase. - Yes.

1365
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,730
(Just then)

1366
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,300
Thank you.

1367
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,400
(They should eat before searching for the gold briefcase.)

1368
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,730
Thank you. Gosh, look at this.

1369
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,300
(A lunch that will fill their stomachs)

1370
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:59,370
Morning gukbap is the best.

1371
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,970
(A rich gukbap...)

1372
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,800
It looks so good.

1373
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,410
- A 36-year history. - I'll enjoy this so much.

1374
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:08,110
(and thickly sliced broiled pork)

1375
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,380
Look at this.

1376
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,620
(Exclaiming)

1377
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,590
- Is it nice? - Is it crazy?

1378
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,750
It's madness. Try it.

1379
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,290
My word. What is all this?

1380
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,230
(Thick)

1381
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,790
Enjoy your food.

1382
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,930
- What is all this? - Dig in.

1383
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,230
It's flipping good.

1384
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,040
A countryside feel.

1385
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:39,180
(They're recharging before searching for the gold briefcase.)

1386
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,270
- The spiciness... - What is this?

1387
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,140
They cooked it so well.

1388
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,580
All this protein is crazy.

1389
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,110
- Let's win. - Good luck to us.

1390
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,380
- I want to win today. - Yes.

1391
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,220
Do those with the gold briefcase know they have it?

1392
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,220
- We can't tell. - Who has the gold?

1393
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,890
(Meanwhile, Team Jae Seok arrived at a beef cutlet restaurant.)

1394
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,160
It looks good.

1395
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,360
What's this?

1396
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,190
They serve beef cutlets.

1397
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,830
It sounds great. We chose well.

1398
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,930
This is crazy.

1399
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,430
(They're excited about the food.)

1400
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,400
- I bet it's good. - Well,

1401
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,130
sujebi would be nice too, but...

1402
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,600
- We want something grilled. - Yes.

1403
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,710
- Give us each a beef cutlet. - Okay.

1404
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,640
(4 beef cutlets)

1405
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,540
- We'll share an udon. - Yes.

1406
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,440
(1 udon)

1407
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,180
What do you want on the side?

1408
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,510
Can I have one mouthful of your udon?

1409
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,110
- Well... - We need to see how things go.

1410
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,220
- That's a bit... - That depends.

1411
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,320
One chopstick.

1412
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,250
Okay, in that case...

1413
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,620
Give us two udon.

1414
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,520
No, Jae Seok. I won't eat yours.

1415
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,590
- No, eat. - It'll be too much.

1416
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:31,630
(They're arguing over one bite of udon.)

1417
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,690
It won't be too much. Don't worry.

1418
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,300
Why do you only want one mouthful?

1419
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,270
(They're getting ready for the upcoming album.)

1420
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,830
I need to be on a diet for the comeback,

1421
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,400
and I eat whatever's before me.

1422
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,540
I guess you can't give up just one mouthful.

1423
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,410
- You can't... - Two beef cutlets...

1424
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,010
(4 beef cutlets)

1425
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,640
- and udon... No, four and two. - One udon.

1426
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:49,310
(2 udons)

1427
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,910
- You can't give up one mouthful? - Oh, two udon.

1428
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,010
It's not that. Just eat.

1429
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,780
- Look. One, one, one, one. - Yes.

1430
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,480
(There are 4 people.)

1431
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,920
One mouthful times four people.

1432
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,950
- That's it. - That's it.

1433
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,150
Yes. There's more than enough.

1434
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,460
Yes. Rather than not ordering enough food...

1435
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,290
(Their logical explanation convinced them.)

1436
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,790
- Yes, of course. - Right?

1437
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,960
I bet it's tasty.

1438
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,290
- That's so funny. - The cutlet's here.

1439
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,000
(The food they ordered is served.)

1440
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,500
My word. It looks amazing.

1441
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,970
Gosh, it looks good.

1442
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:14,870
(A beef cutlet set, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside)

1443
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,100
No way.

1444
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,600
It's a beef cutlet.

1445
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,940
- It looks so good. - It looks great.

1446
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,310
(Beef cutlets taste best when grilled directly over a brazier.)

1447
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,370
Cook it on this.

1448
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,510
- Let's eat. - Let's eat.

1449
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,710
- Thanks for the food. - Enjoy yourselves.

1450
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,040
(Flustered)

1451
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,180
- I grill this? - Yes.

1452
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,780
- It's practically raw. - I almost ate it.

1453
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,710
- You were going to eat it as is? - Yes.

1454
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,020
You cook it briefly on both sides.

1455
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,420
I've never had this before.

1456
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,620
- For real? - Yes.

1457
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,450
I always had pork cutlet and never a beef cutlet.

1458
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,990
(Except Ssaebssaeb, they've never had a beef cutlet before.)

1459
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,890
Me too. Do we cook it on this?

1460
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:33,020
Let it sizzle.

1461
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,790
(Doing as Se Chan said)

1462
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,960
Let both sides sizzle a bit and then eat it.

1463
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,290
(Sizzling)

1464
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,130
Then it'll be really tender inside.

1465
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,560
Ssaebssaeb, you know...

1466
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,200
- Yes. - a great deal about this.

1467
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,430
Did you go on many dates?

1468
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,400
- In Japan... - Did you take someone...

1469
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,640
to a beef cutlet place?

1470
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,940
This is a must when you visit Japan.

1471
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,940
Cook it on both sides, then try it with the salt first.

1472
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,140
(To Cho Rong)

1473
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,380
Then move on to the dip.

1474
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,410
- Thank you. - You...

1475
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,910
You and Cho Rong today...

1476
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,980
- Yes, I'll see how things go. - Today...

1477
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,250
Set things up.

1478
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,220
(Obsessed with romance, Protruded Brother tries to set the mood.)

1479
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,620
- Create a love line? - That's not easy.

1480
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,660
Bo Mi suggested you get together.

1481
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,660
- Ssaebssaeb... - Her ideal type is Haha.

1482
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,430
(Ruining the mood)

1483
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,190
- Why? - She likes dirty mustaches?

1484
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,100
A family-centered guy.

1485
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,360
I see.

1486
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:20,000
(The sudden twist was a let-down.)

1487
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,400
He's not like that?

1488
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,540
- He is family-centered. - He's family-centered.

1489
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,170
Really? Was I mistaken?

1490
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,870
(Is he not?)

1491
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,410
- He is totally family-centered. - Right?

1492
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,710
(Cho Rong's ideal type...)

1493
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,210
- He is family-centered. - Yes.

1494
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,110
(is a family-centered guy with a dirty mustache.)

1495
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,650
(Glancing)

1496
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,320
(Adding one more)

1497
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,120
Kids do that because they can't wait.

1498
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,920
Also, you know, to be honest, I wish...

1499
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,520
- You just want to eat it, right? - I wish it came out cooked.

1500
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,560
(Prankster Yu is impatient.)

1501
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,330
Let's cook them all now.

1502
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,960
- Cook them at once. - Yes.

1503
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,430
All in one go?

1504
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,430
- Quickly. ISP... - Why? Can we not do this?

1505
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:57,570
(The impatient Korean-style cooking method)

1506
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,400
I've never seen anyone put this many on at once.

1507
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,010
- Here. - I can't stand it if it's too slow.

1508
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,510
- Gosh, why is the grill so small? - Right.

1509
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,810
Should we ask for a big frying pan?

1510
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,780
It's frustrating, you know.

1511
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,550
You're supposed to grill it like this as you eat.

1512
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,820
(As Jae Seok's patience is being tested,)

1513
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,650
It's fun. Kind of small and cute.

1514
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,790
(Bo Mi tries her first bite ever.)

1515
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,220
It's frustrating, you know.

1516
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,590
Thank you for the meal.

1517
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,730
Enjoy your food.

1518
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,600
(Exclaiming)

1519
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,760
Is it tasty?

1520
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,200
Is it good?

1521
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,630
(Gasping)

1522
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,630
- It melts in your mouth, right? - Yes.

1523
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,800
- It really does. - Let me try one too.

1524
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,070
Let's try it.

1525
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:31,310
(Humming)

1526
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,210
Gosh, it's so delicious!

1527
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,810
It's so tender.

1528
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,140
- Is that so? - Yes.

1529
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,880
(Eyes widening at the new world of flavors)

1530
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,940
This is...

1531
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,210
- It's so good. - Gosh, Jae Seok!

1532
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,480
(Humming delightfully)

1533
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,450
(Starting the beef cutlet hunt in earnest)

1534
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,420
This is delicious.

1535
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,150
(All in one bite)

1536
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,520
Jae Seok doesn't like waiting.

1537
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,290
(Humming)

1538
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,990
(Clapping automatically)

1539
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,060
(A big bite with the sauce)

1540
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,100
(Humming in approval)

1541
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
(Delicious)

1542
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,070
(Clapping)

1543
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,240
(Higher pitch)

1544
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,380
(The idol of 16 years forgets all about her diet and goes at it.)

1545
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,440
- It really is so tender. - Yes.

1546
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,250
Gosh, Jae Seok!

1547
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,720
- This is delicious. - I like my meat well-done.

1548
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,990
(The well-done lover is still grilling.)

1549
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,890
- It really is so tender. - Yes.

1550
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,990
(Sighing)

1551
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,300
Why?

1552
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,100
Jae Seok doesn't like waiting.

1553
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,400
Gosh, this is frustrating.

1554
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,500
But once this gets heated up,

1555
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,940
things will start moving like a factory.

1556
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,710
(A lifetime of waiting is over.)

1557
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,270
- Will it turn out like that? - Yes.

1558
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,680
- Gosh, shall I try it now? - Yes, you should try it.

1559
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,550
- Was it worth the wait? - Isn't it so good?

1560
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,750
It's good.

1561
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,290
This place has great food.

1562
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,390
- It's good, right? Isn't it tender? - It's delicious.

1563
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:02,060
(It tastes even better after the long wait.)

1564
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,460
We always seem to go to good restaurants...

1565
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,930
- when we come to Running Man. - Is that so?

1566
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,630
(As everyone is enjoying the beef cutlet,)

1567
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,200
It's delicious.

1568
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,200
(the next dish arrives.)

1569
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,970
Oh, it's the udon.

1570
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,710
(Eyes widening)

1571
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,270
It was good that we ordered udon.

1572
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,310
What's up with the udon?

1573
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:17,350
(Mouth-watering udon with a bunch of green onions and beef brisket)

1574
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,380
It's beef brisket udon.

1575
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,610
- Look at the green onions. - I'm in big trouble.

1576
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,880
This is one piece, right?

1577
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,380
We have to win the next round.

1578
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,590
We have to win the next one. If not, we have no chance.

1579
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,450
(Impressed)

1580
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,960
- We'll probably face Haha's team. - Is that right?

1581
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,390
This broth is insane!

1582
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,960
- Yes, it's good, isn't it? - My goodness.

1583
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,360
(A bunch of noodles)

1584
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,800
(Plus green onions)

1585
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,900
Gosh, this...

1586
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,370
- They burnt the green onions. - Yes.

1587
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,870
- That's why it's so good. - The smoky flavor.

1588
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,980
Se Chan, you're a good cook, aren't you?

1589
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,040
- Me? Yes. - Right?

1590
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,040
(Chewing)

1591
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,180
I'm not bad.

1592
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,010
- What? - I'm not bad.

1593
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,750
(Mumbling)

1594
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,450
You're bad at it?

1595
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,780
- I'm not bad. - Oh, you're not bad.

1596
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,080
Why? What about someone who cooks?

1597
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,550
(Anticipating)

1598
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,490
No, I just thought you'd be a good cook.

1599
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,090
Why? Is something starting between you two?

1600
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,160
Eat this.

1601
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,530
Thank you.

1602
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,860
(Grinning)

1603
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,330
Well,

1604
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,130
Apink also has...

1605
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,270
- several years of experience now. - Yes.

1606
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,040
She goes along with the romantic gimmick.

1607
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,710
I'm disappointed when people don't try that with me.

1608
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,210
Of course.

1609
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,680
By the way, is it a good dream if you lose your teeth?

1610
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,780
(Casually asking)

1611
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,850
- A dream about losing teeth? - What?

1612
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,410
- Did you lose your teeth? - Today, in my dream.

1613
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,720
- From the top or bottom? - The top.

1614
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,050
Doesn't that mean your elder will pass away?

1615
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:32,660
(He ruins the sweet mood.)

1616
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,920
No.

1617
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,760
Was it a bad dream?

1618
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:35,120
(Asking the details)

1619
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,890
Did it bleed or not?

1620
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,020
There was some blood.

1621
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,290
Oh, bleeding means it isn't good.

1622
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,560
- I'm doomed. - "I'm doomed."

1623
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,830
She believes in dreams too much.

1624
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:44,770
(His interpretation makes them feel uneasy for no reason.)

1625
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,400
Every morning, she looks up...

1626
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,630
what her dream means.

1627
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,400
- Oh, really? - Right, but I couldn't do it today.

1628
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,640
Do you dream often?

1629
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,200
Yes, I dream often.

1630
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,440
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1631
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:52,170
- Is your bed facing the wrong way? - Is that it?

1632
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,340
Usually, when people dream often,

1633
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,810
they try changing the direction of their bed and stuff.

1634
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,380
Why? Will you move it for her?

1635
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,620
- How... - Why do you suddenly care...

1636
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,090
about the direction of her bed?

1637
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,290
But usually,

1638
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,420
when people have a hard time sleeping,

1639
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,960
they change the direction of the bed.

1640
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,560
- Right. - They change the direction...

1641
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,360
(The others keep pushing the romantic vibe on them.)

1642
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,560
of the bed.

1643
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,260
Jong Kook would've liked it if he came here.

1644
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,430
Gosh, Jong Kook.

1645
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,640
(Thinking of a certain guy as they eat protein)

1646
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,330
He'd be like, "Oh, it's delicious!"

1647
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,570
- He'd eat three plates of this. - Yes.

1648
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,380
(Meanwhile, Team Jong Kook is enjoying their meal.)

1649
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,510
- Is it good? It's so nice. - Gosh, this is incredible.

1650
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,410
This is so delicious.

1651
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,780
Gosh, it's anchovy broth.

1652
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:34,250
(They're enjoying sujebi, just as the other team enjoyed beef cutlet.)

1653
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,150
- Anchovy broth? - This is so delicious.

1654
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,420
- Gosh, it's so good. - It's so delicious.

1655
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,950
I'm glad we got the basic meal. It's really good.

1656
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,550
This is legit.

1657
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,760
(Exclaiming)

1658
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,420
- It's anchovy broth. - Gosh, it's anchovy broth.

1659
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,760
- Anchovy broth? - This is so delicious.

1660
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:48,030
(Like curing a hangover when they haven't had drinks)

1661
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,230
- This is really nice. - I'm glad we got the basic meal.

1662
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:46,500
It's really good.

1663
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,100
I think sujebi was a good idea.

1664
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,800
- Ye Eun, it's so good, isn't it? - Yes, the sujebi.

1665
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:56,470
(All 3 teams enjoyed their food.)

1666
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,270
- Gosh, this is... - It tastes so neat.

1667
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,170
It's my first time eating beef cutlet, but it's good.

1668
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,140
So, we'll give you the mission...

1669
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:02,380
(The next mission comes with hints about the gold briefcase.)

1670
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,980
- for the gold briefcase hint. - Okay.

1671
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,550
All three teams will start the mission at once.

1672
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,750
(The three teams will start at once.)

1673
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,650
The first team to finish will get the best hint.

1674
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:12,090
(The 1st 2 teams will receive different levels of hint.)

1675
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,490
The next team will get the second best hint.

1676
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:11,590
- The hints will be different. - All right.

1677
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,460
- Really? - Let's go.

1678
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,930
(All teams are doing it simultaneously.)

1679
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,720
We have to do this. For real.

1680
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,960
- All right. - Okay.

1681
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,190
- We must be doing the same game. - I guess so.

1682
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,390
Please take it easy on us.

1683
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,760
This mission is...

1684
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:22,460
Don't Be Sad If You're Wrong Tomato.

1685
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:24,970
(Mission 2: Don't Be Sad If You're Wrong Tomato)

1686
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,600
What is that?

1687
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,230
- Gosh, that tomato... - Yes.

1688
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,740
- Games with fruits are hard. - It's about palindromes, isn't it?

1689
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,640
You will see picture cards on the screen.

1690
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:34,580
(Read the picture cards in order.)

1691
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,040
- You have to... - I'm not good at games.

1692
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,540
take turns...

1693
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,510
and say it exactly.

1694
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:36,910
- Yes. - For example,

1695
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,480
if you see the front part of the tomato,

1696
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,520
you say, "To."

1697
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,520
If you see the middle part, it's "Ma."

1698
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,390
But if you see these two parts, it's "Mato."

1699
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,390
- I'm so sure I can do this. - The whole thing is,

1700
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:47,860
- Really? - "Tomato,"

1701
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,160
- "Potato." - and there's "Potato" too.

1702
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,090
- There's a Reverse card too. - "Reverse."

1703
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,030
- "Reverse." - I'll show you an example.

1704
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:55,430
- Okay. - If Jae Seok were to start,

1705
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,770
- then you just say one card. - Mato.

1706
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,400
After you say Mato, for Se Chan,

1707
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,840
- it accumulates. Mato, tomato. - Mato, tomato.

1708
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,570
- Oh, gosh. - Then, Cho Rong has three cards.

1709
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,110
- Mato, tomato, to. - That's right.

1710
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:07,340
But if you suddenly get a reverse card,

1711
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,480
then...

1712
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,210
It normally goes in this order, right?

1713
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,610
But you do the opposite.

1714
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,080
- To, tomato, mato. - That's it.

1715
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,220
And then, the next person will get...

1716
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,190
- the card after the reverse card. - Yes.

1717
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,220
Then, you just go in the normal order...

1718
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,260
- and ignore the reverse card. - Okay.

1719
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:24,430
Mato, tomato, to, tomato.

1720
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,460
- Okay. - Oh, the order will be...

1721
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,800
one, two, three, four.

1722
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,330
- Five, six, seven. - Six, seven?

1723
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,970
- We're in trouble. - Eight, nine, ten.

1724
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,670
- Eleven, twelve, thirteen. - We have to go for that long?

1725
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,800
(It's so difficult.)

1726
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:35,840
- It's just... - Yes.

1727
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,340
We'll show you 20 cards.

1728
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:40,080
(They need to read 20 cards in total.)

1729
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,040
If you successfully finish 20 cards, you will get the hint.

1730
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,050
(The team that succeeds 1st will receive the best hint.)

1731
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,210
- We'll get second place, at least. - I can totally do well on this.

1732
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,550
That team has Seok Jin. They can't do this.

1733
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,480
- So, we'll come in 2nd at least. - Oh, we'll get 2nd place?

1734
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,650
Don't worry.

1735
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:49,690
- Tomato. - Let's do this.

1736
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,650
(We have a 60-year-old man here.)

1737
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:50,820
We have a 60-year-old man here.

1738
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,090
- Come on. - He's 60 years old.

1739
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,590
- The issue of being 60... - I'm good at games.

1740
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,560
(The key is the villain's performance.)

1741
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,820
- What are you talking about? - Okay, let's do this.

1742
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,290
- All right. Let's go. - But he's...

1743
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,090
- Let's go! - Focus! Okay!

1744
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:58,990
(It's 12:30pm.)

1745
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:02,200
(The three teams begin the mission at the same time.)

1746
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,960
- All right. Let's find the gold. - Let's go!

1747
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,270
- I really want to find that gold. - Ready, go.

1748
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,970
- Ma. - Ma, mato.

1749
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,270
Ma, mato, to.

1750
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,070
To, mato, ma.

1751
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,810
Ma, mato,

1752
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,040
to, potato.

1753
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,780
Ma, mato,

1754
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,520
to, potato,

1755
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,420
- To. - to.

1756
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,950
Ma, mato, to,

1757
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,120
potato, to, tomato.

1758
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,560
Ma, mato,

1759
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,960
to, potato,

1760
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,760
- ma... - Incorrect!

1761
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:36,000
(He got it wrong because he read "to" as "ma.")

1762
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,400
I mean... Hey!

1763
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,460
What are we going to do?

1764
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,630
- My heart aches. - But...

1765
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:41,200
(They pull themselves together and try again.)

1766
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,830
Get your head in the game.

1767
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:39,870
- It's easy. - Let's cheer.

1768
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,300
- Yes. In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1769
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,370
- Let's go! - Let's go! Okay.

1770
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,410
All right, then. Ready, go!

1771
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:45,410
To.

1772
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,040
To, potato.

1773
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,180
To, potato, ma.

1774
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,310
To, potato, ma, mato.

1775
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,450
(Cho Rong, go in reverse.)

1776
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,120
Mato, ma,

1777
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,420
potato, to.

1778
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,220
To, potato, ma,

1779
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,920
mato, tomato.

1780
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:02,960
To, potato, ma,

1781
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,090
mato, tomato, ma.

1782
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,960
- To, potato... - It's my turn.

1783
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,630
- To... - Incorrect!

1784
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,130
- Hey! Why did you do it? - Cho Rong!

1785
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,140
- Cho Rong, why'd you go? It was me! - Hey, Cho Rong!

1786
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,640
(Empty Head's crush made a mistake this time.)

1787
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,540
- Let's practice once. - I mean, seriously!

1788
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,240
- Gosh, I'm dizzy. Why did you go? - Cho Rong, why did you do that?

1789
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,540
I was just talking to myself.

1790
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,110
Why did you talk to yourself? It was my turn.

1791
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,980
(She has a habit of talking to herself aloud.)

1792
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,110
- But why are you so bad at this? - I know.

1793
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,210
That's Ma.

1794
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,380
(It doesn't seem that Team Jae Seok will be able to finish it quickly.)

1795
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,880
- Don't be discouraged. - We have to succeed this time.

1796
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,180
That's Ma.

1797
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,420
Ready, set, go.

1798
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,150
(Team Haha is taking on the mission.)

1799
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,220
Mato.

1800
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,390
Mato, potato.

1801
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:33,920
Mato, potato, mato.

1802
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,060
Incorrect!

1803
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,730
(It's "ma," not "mato.")

1804
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,060
- Ma. - It's the middle part.
It was just the middle.

1805
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,530
- Here's the next question. - Okay.

1806
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,900
- Ready, set, go. - To.

1807
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,260
(They try again.)

1808
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,230
Mato.

1809
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,270
Mato, tomato.

1810
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,730
Mato, tomato, potato.

1811
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,570
Potato, tomato, mato.

1812
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:50,510
- Potato... - Incorrect.

1813
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,010
- It was mato. - Right.

1814
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,710
- Okay, here's the next question. - Hey, wait!

1815
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,880
Ji Hyo!

1816
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,510
- We don't know where it will be. - I want you to find your courage.

1817
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,680
- Okay, let's do this! - All right.

1818
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:02,620
(Ji Hyo, who's been making mistake after mistake, is the key.)

1819
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,080
- Let's go! - You can do this.

1820
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,780
Mato, ma, to.

1821
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,780
- Okay, let's go. - Yes.

1822
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,020
Hey, let's switch spots.

1823
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,660
Why are you making a fuss with switching seats?

1824
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:09,360
(They switch positions and pull themselves together again.)

1825
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,090
What? No.

1826
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:09,190
- Do you know all of the cards? - Yes.

1827
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,460
- To, ma. - Yes.

1828
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,690
- To, ma. - It's okay.

1829
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,730
- Let's go. - To, ma.

1830
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,360
(Ji Hyo has awakened.)

1831
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,860
(Will they succeed?)

1832
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:16,100
- Ready, set, go. - This will go the longest.

1833
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,070
Mato.

1834
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,430
Mato...

1835
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:21,470
(The first obstacle before her)

1836
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,870
- Let's go! - You can do this.

1837
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:24,410
- Mato, ma. - Incorrect!

1838
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:25,570
It's To.

1839
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,740
Are you going to quit drinking or not?

1840
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,810
(Exploding)

1841
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,480
I think the front seat is harder.

1842
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,450
(Mapo Brother gives her a wake-up call for the New Year.)

1843
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,680
Hurry up and swear.

1844
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,020
- You have to promise me. - No, I just got To and Ma confused.

1845
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,480
- All right, I'll quit drinking. - Okay.

1846
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,850
(She follows it up with a New Year's resolution.)

1847
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,520
- You really have to quit. - I want to play the game too.

1848
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,090
- I want to play the game too. - Is that so?

1849
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,790
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

1850
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,320
We have to do 20 of these?

1851
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,260
- Yes, if you get up to 20... - Gosh, even 10 would be hard.

1852
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,590
(Team Ji Hyo is drunk in tomatoes.)

1853
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,960
We can do it. None of the teams have succeeded yet.

1854
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,400
- Here... - Wait, why are you here, 60 Man?

1855
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,960
- I know. - What, 60 Man?

1856
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:52,670
(Team Jong Kook has the biggest villain.)

1857
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,200
It seems as though I'm the smartest one here.

1858
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,300
- Do you think you can do it? - Of course.

1859
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,570
- Let's do it, then. - Go for it.

1860
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:55,600
- Let's go. - Bring it.

1861
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:59,810
(Will Seok Jin prove he's not a sinkhole?)

1862
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,810
Tomato, to, ma...

1863
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,910
- Mato. - Here's the next one.

1864
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,210
- Ready... - Ready, go.

1865
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:05,850
- Ma. - Ma, mato.

1866
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,220
Ma, mato, tomato.

1867
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,480
Tomato, mato, ma.

1868
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,750
Ma, mato, tomato, potato.

1869
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,520
(Old man Seok Sam succeeds.)

1870
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,360
Ma, mato...

1871
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,020
Ma, mato, tomato, potato, mato.

1872
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,230
Ma, mato, tomato, potato,

1873
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,590
mato, topo... Potato!

1874
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,600
- Incorrect. - Come on.

1875
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,300
- mato, topo... Potato! - Incorrect.

1876
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,900
(Poddayddo is incorrect.)

1877
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,370
- Hey! - Seriously?

1878
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,770
- Why you... - What's the matter with you?

1879
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:27,500
(She made an unexpected mistake.)

1880
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,100
- What... - Seriously.

1881
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,700
Mato, ddo, ppoddayddo!

1882
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,070
- I... - What's the matter with you?

1883
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,970
- I said I was the best at this. - Seok Jin's pretty well.

1884
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,180
I'm the best out of all of us.

1885
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,380
Does he play go-stop a lot?

1886
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,940
His mind is still pretty sharp.

1887
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,750
- Let's go again. - Right here.

1888
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,980
(Seok Sam showed a new side of himself.)

1889
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,180
- Do it standing. - Got it.

1890
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,320
(They keep trying.)

1891
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,920
- Mato. - Imagine yourself rapping.

1892
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,980
- Yes, just rap it. - All right.

1893
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,190
The reverse card is stressing me out.

1894
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,250
(Team Jong Kook decides to follow Nam Joo and let the beat take over.)

1895
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,350
- Move to the beat. - Mato, potato.

1896
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,190
(It's their last resort.)

1897
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,490
- Okay, got it. - Rock your body.

1898
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:47,960
- Sway to the beat. - She's right.

1899
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:51,030
(They're breaking down the beat like Oh Ji Myeong.)

1900
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,190
- Like this. - Rock to the beat.

1901
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,630
- Like this. - Like this.

1902
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,330
- Side to side. - Keep going.

1903
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,230
- Okay, here we go. - Ready...

1904
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:55,960
(Will the hip hop warriors succeed?)

1905
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,860
- Focus. - Ready, go.

1906
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,130
- Okay. - Potato.

1907
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:58,470
Potato, ma.

1908
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,240
Potato, ma, mato.

1909
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,600
Potato, ma, mato, to.

1910
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:05,610
Potato, ma, mato, to, tomato.

1911
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:08,910
Potato, ma, mato, to, tomato, tomato.

1912
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,550
Potato, ma, mato, to, tomato, tomato, potato.

1913
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:17,750
Potato, ma, mato, to, tomato, tomato, potato, mato.

1914
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,150
(Nam Joo aims for best dancer,)

1915
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,890
(even though it doesn't give points.)

1916
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,590
Potato, ma, mato, to, tomato,

1917
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,520
tomato, potato, mato, mato.

1918
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,390
(He pronounces the words with a Seoul accent.)

1919
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,460
Potato, ma,

1920
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:26,400
mato, to, tomato,

1921
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,030
tomato, potato, mato, mato, ma.

1922
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,800
Potato, ma,

1923
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:34,070
(Ye Eun's complexion darkens next to the hip hop warrior.)

1924
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,100
mato, to, tomato, tomato, potato, mato,

1925
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,800
mato, ma, to.

1926
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:38,740
Potato, ma, mato, to, tomato, tomato,

1927
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,940
(Her heart starts racing.)

1928
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,040
potato, mato, mato, ma,

1929
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,040
- to, tomato. - Potato,

1930
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,910
(Ms. Ddomaddo is up.)

1931
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,950
ma, mato, to, tomato, tomato,

1932
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,020
potato, mato, mato, ma,

1933
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,750
to, tomato, mato.

1934
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:51,750
Potato, ma, mato,

1935
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:51,220
(Sighing)

1936
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:55,020
(The hip hop train barely manages to keep going.)

1937
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,960
to, tomato, tomato, potato, mato, mato...

1938
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,590
ma, to, tomato...

1939
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,060
mato, potato.

1940
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,060
(About to cry)

1941
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:01,430
Potato, ma, mato, to, tomato,

1942
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,430
(They're already on their 3rd row.)

1943
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,870
tomato, potato, mato, mato, ma, to,

1944
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,800
(The farther away you are, the greater the pressure.)

1945
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,970
tomato, mato, potato, to.

1946
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,010
- I'm nervous. - Potato,

1947
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:13,140
(They're on the final row.)

1948
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,140
ma, mato, to, tomato, tomato, potato,

1949
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,140
mato, mato, ma, to,

1950
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,810
tomato, mato, potato, to, to.

1951
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:21,720
Potato, ma, mato, to, tomato,

1952
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,050
- tomato, potato, - Oh, no.

1953
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,520
- My heart's racing. - mato, mato, ma,

1954
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,590
to, tomato, mato, potato, to,

1955
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:28,860
to, mato.

1956
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:31,130
- My heart's racing. - Potato, ma, mato,

1957
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,260
to, tomato, tomato, potato,

1958
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:33,300
(As her turn approaches,)

1959
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,400
- mato, mato, ma, to, - My heart's racing.

1960
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,770
(Ddochi's close to tears.)

1961
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,870
tomato, mato, potato,

1962
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,770
- to, to, mato, ma. - We did it.

1963
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:40,940
Potato, ma...

1964
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,740
(Ye Eun enters the ring close to breaking down.)

1965
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:44,710
Potato, ma, mato, to, tomato, tomato, potato,

1966
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,440
mato, mato, ma,

1967
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,140
to, tomato, mato, potato, to,

1968
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:53,150
to, mato, ma...

1969
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:54,180
(She's almost done!)

1970
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,950
Potato.

1971
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,190
(Even Ye Eun succeeded.)

1972
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,620
(It's all up to Lil Nam Joo now.)

1973
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:01,390
Potato, ma, mato, to, tomato,

1974
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:03,560
tomato, potato, mato, mato,

1975
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,900
ma, to, tomato, mato, potato, to...

1976
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:06,930
(Is this the ease of a 15-year K-pop idol?)

1977
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,500
(She's already on the last row.)

1978
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:09,560
To, mato, ma...

1979
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:14,270
(Can the tomato poet do it?)

1980
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,270
To, mato, ma...

1981
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:17,510
To, mato, ma, potato, ma!

1982
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,710
(Air horn!)

1983
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,310
- Yes! - Yes!

1984
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:21,840
- We did it. - Yes!

1985
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:22,940
(Team Jong Kook succeeds.)

1986
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:28,580
(They pull it off with a beat that would make Snoop Dogg proud.)

1987
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,280
We did it!

1988
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,120
- Great job! - Nicely done!

1989
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,720
- Nice! - You were amazing.

1990
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:32,250
- Kim Nam Joo! - Kim Nam Joo!

1991
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,260
- That was incredible. - I mean...

1992
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:36,060
Wasn't I good at this?

1993
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,360
- This... - We carried the team.

1994
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,330
(Nam Joo)

1995
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,890
Hold on. How well did we do?

1996
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,360
- How did we do? - My heart's pounding.

1997
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,660
- How well did we do? - What place are we in?

1998
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,670
(Are they the first team to succeed?)

1999
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:42,900
You...

2000
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,470
I think we did pretty good.

2001
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,740
You're in second place.

2002
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,970
- I see. - Still?

2003
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,110
(Team Jong Kook's in 2nd place?)

2004
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:49,440
Still?

2005
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,040
- Another team was faster? - I doubt it was Jae Seok's.

2006
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:54,640
(There's a team that did it first?)

2007
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,840
You're in second place,

2008
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,980
- so here's the hint you won. - Sure.

2009
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,440
(Team Jong Kook gets a 2nd-place hint.)

2010
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,310
(Ringing)

2011
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,810
- Here's your card. - That's our hint.

2012
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,420
- What was that? - You can check that.

2013
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,290
(A card with a hint is handed to them.)

2014
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,190
- Sure. Take a look. - Thanks.

2015
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:06,590
(Just then)

2016
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,390
- Hey! - Check ours first.

2017
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:07,420
- Hey! - Go ahead.

2018
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,290
(Team Jae Seok suddenly charges in.)

2019
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,860
- Hey, there. - Goodness.

2020
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,560
- Did you just complete it? - I doubt you guys got it.

2021
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,060
- We succeeded. - You only just succeeded.

2022
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,860
- I doubt you got it. - Nam Joo was terrible at it.

2023
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:17,700
(Team Jong Kook is flustered.)

2024
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,860
I doubt you got it.

2025
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,960
Are they in first place?

2026
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,930
- To, mato, ma. - Mato, tomato.

2027
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,030
What's going on?

2028
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,940
- Nam Joo was terrible at it. - Are they in first place?

2029
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,340
(Why did Team Jae Seok suddenly show up here?)

2030
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,470
- Nam Joo was terrible. - To, mato.

2031
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:28,280
(About 10 minutes ago)

2032
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:33,210
Mato, ma, tomato, mato, potato.

2033
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:35,850
- There. - Team Jae Seok,

2034
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:38,290
you were the first to succeed.

2035
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,760
(Team Jae Seok finished in 1st place.)

2036
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,790
- Here's the hint you won. - Really?

2037
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,730
I was so nervous...

2038
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:47,760
(The hint they received for finishing 1st)

2039
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:45,830
that my tongue got tied.

2040
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,860
No way.

2041
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:54,700
(The gold briefcase is the lightest.)

2042
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,270
- No way. - It's the lightest?

2043
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,470
Ours seemed heavy.

2044
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,870
- We need to check all of them. - Can't we try carrying the others?

2045
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,370
(They'll know the truth once they lift the briefcases.)

2046
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:57,310
We won't know until we compare the briefcases.

2047
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,870
- Yes, and it'll be obvious. - We have no choice...

2048
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:00,510
but to meet the other teams...

2049
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,980
- We have to go at it. - and check their briefcases.

2050
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,210
We'll have to personally check.

2051
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:07,020
(They have to go head to head with the other teams.)

2052
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:05,650
- Let's head over there. - Sure.

2053
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,380
Only then... We'll have to compare theirs to ours.

2054
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,220
- You said Seok Sam was nearby. - Let's go.

2055
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:12,490
(The target is Team Jong Kook's gold briefcase, which is closer.)

2056
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,590
Are Jong Kook and Seok Jin here?

2057
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:12,720
I'm scared.

2058
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,690
(What if we barge in and get beaten up?)

2059
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,890
What if they beat us up?

2060
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,320
Cho Rong's worried we might get beaten up.

2061
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:19,390
As if we'd sit back and just take it.

2062
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,830
- Just once. - We'll automatically react.

2063
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,470
First, check where their briefcase is.

2064
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:28,540
(Team Grasshopper voluntarily enters the tiger's den.)

2065
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,340
- Jae Seok, enter on the right. - Got it.

2066
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,600
Hold on.

2067
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,870
Check where the briefcase is.

2068
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:32,510
(They check where the briefcase is, outside the door.)

2069
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,540
- Right. - Should we check where it is?

2070
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,580
- Mato, potato, to. - They're still playing the game.

2071
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,180
(They're doing a mission.)

2072
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,780
- Is it behind them? - Potato,

2073
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,610
- ma... - I think it's with their jackets.

2074
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:38,310
(Found it!)

2075
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:37,980
- It's on Seok Jin's right. - Right.

2076
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,810
- It's on Seok Jin's right. - On the floor?

2077
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:42,620
(Ssaebssaeb locates the briefcase.)

2078
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,680
It's between Seok Jin and Nam Joo.

2079
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,750
(All that's left is to take on the tiger himself!)

2080
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,890
Taking the briefcase from them...

2081
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,690
is practically impossible.

2082
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:50,960
We could enter...

2083
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,700
while they're enjoying the bliss of winning the game.

2084
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,730
Is that our best window?

2085
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,900
Are we going to fight them, or just sneak it away?

2086
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,470
- If we fight them, - We'll get beaten up.

2087
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,240
- Jong Kook will hit us. - Okay.

2088
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,670
(Just then, they hear cheers.)

2089
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,110
- They won the game. - Not so fast.

2090
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:06,270
Potato, ma!

2091
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:08,080
- Okay. - Hey, we did it.

2092
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,080
- Let's go. - Hold on.

2093
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:14,150
(This is their window!)

2094
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,620
Jae Seok, don't tell me you're scared of him.

2095
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,650
It kind of looks like...

2096
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:17,950
Don't tell me you're scared of him.

2097
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:20,320
(Busted)

2098
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,190
It kind of looks like...

2099
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,190
We need to be patient.

2100
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,020
- They will let their guard down. - You seem a bit chicken.

2101
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:24,790
(They're constantly waiting for the other team to slip up.)

2102
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,590
We should go to where Ye Eun is.

2103
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:25,160
Jae Seok's a little scared.

2104
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,160
Jae Seok, hurry.

2105
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,800
(Frozen)

2106
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,360
- Before they receive the hint. - Why aren't you going in?

2107
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,700
- Why aren't you going in? - Just charge in.

2108
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:31,870
(I'm scared of Jong Kook.)

2109
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,730
This is frustrating.

2110
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,370
- Go on. - Get in there.

2111
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,440
Go ahead. Say things like "goodness."

2112
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:40,180
(They might as well have knocked and announced their presence.)

2113
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,570
- Hey, there. - Goodness.

2114
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:37,870
- Let's look. - Got it.

2115
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,940
- Hey, there. - Goodness.

2116
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,240
- Did you just complete it? - I doubt you guys got it.

2117
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,810
(They start with an awkward greeting.)

2118
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,950
- We succeeded. - You only just succeeded.

2119
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:45,950
Are they in first place?

2120
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,120
(Distracting Jong Kook)

2121
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:48,250
- To, mato, ma. - Mato, tomato.

2122
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,220
(They seamlessly join Team Jong Kook.)

2123
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,350
- Nam Joo was terrible at it. - I crushed it.

2124
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:52,450
Nam Joo was terrible at the game.

2125
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:54,290
- Nam Joo was the best. - I crushed it.

2126
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:55,820
- Nam Joo was great. - She seemed terrible.

2127
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,260
- Nam Joo was the best. - I crushed it.

2128
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,460
(Grabbing Briefcase B)

2129
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,690
- Nam Joo was incredible. - Nam Joo was great.

2130
00:55:58,690 --> 00:55:59,730
I doubt you won the game.

2131
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,500
- Nam Joo was great. - I doubt you won the game.

2132
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,270
- What? Jae Seok! - I doubt Jae Seok...

2133
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:05,500
- Stop Jae Seok! - What are you doing?

2134
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,970
- What's going on? - Go.

2135
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:09,040
(Running away before he's caught)

2136
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:08,200
What... Hold on.

2137
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,370
- Stop Jae Seok! - What are you doing?

2138
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,540
(Se Chan blocks Jong Kook.)

2139
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:11,140
- What's going on? - Go.

2140
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,270
- Why did you let them take it? - Can they take ours?

2141
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:16,110
(Run for now!)

2142
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:15,710
Run!

2143
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,750
- Bo Mi! - Yes? I'm right here.

2144
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,120
(They need to figure out which one is lighter.)

2145
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,010
Which one's heavier?

2146
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:21,650
- Get over here, guys. - Jae Seok, no way.

2147
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,820
(1st-place hint: The gold briefcase is the lightest.)

2148
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,250
- I don't see them. - I can't tell.

2149
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,850
(I don't know which one is lighter.)

2150
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,050
- Here they come. - Run!

2151
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:27,560
(They run away for now.)

2152
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,150
- Go. - Hurry.

2153
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,520
Which one's heavier, Jae Seok?

2154
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,890
- I can't tell. - I don't know.

2155
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,890
They took ours after receiving their hint.

2156
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:32,690
(Team Jong Kook was caught off guard.)

2157
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:32,490
- It was ours all along. - It must be B.

2158
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:33,830
It must be Briefcase B!

2159
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,760
(Briefcase B must be the gold briefcase!)

2160
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:34,960
Where's our briefcase?

2161
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,660
(Making a fuss)

2162
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,730
- Get Briefcase B! - Where's our briefcase?

2163
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,300
- Get Briefcase B! - Where's our briefcase?

2164
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:41,000
(They check the hint first.)

2165
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,730
- It has a different weight. - Ours is light.

2166
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,840
Ours is light.

2167
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,140
The gold briefcase has a different weight.

2168
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:46,840
(It's more general than the 1st-place hint.)

2169
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:44,140
We never got to check all their weights.

2170
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,610
- They'll give it back. - Briefcase B is light.

2171
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,140
Do you remember how heavy ours was?

2172
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,510
(2nd-place hint: The gold briefcase weighs differently.)

2173
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,910
They currently have two briefcases.

2174
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,410
Jong Kook could take one off them by force.

2175
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,780
- But... - Are we done here?

2176
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:54,320
(They need to go and get one of the briefcases.)

2177
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,410
- Most certainly... - Here's what I think.

2178
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,820
- We need to take this. - They'll compare the briefcases.

2179
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:58,190
If one is lighter than the other,

2180
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:00,460
- That's right. - they'll leave one behind.

2181
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,560
(They'll leave one behind!)

2182
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,660
They'll leave it behind.

2183
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,390
Here's what I think.

2184
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,290
It could be the lighter one.

2185
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:06,390
The hint specifically said...

2186
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:14,140
(Jong Kook's deduction: The real gold briefcase might be lighter.)

2187
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:07,500
that the gold briefcase has a different weight.

2188
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,860
- Is ours heavy? - It didn't say it was heavy.

2189
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:10,270
- Just different. - You get me, right?

2190
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:12,200
That's how Running Man masks their intentions.

2191
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,740
- As a twist? - Yes.

2192
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,170
There's a high possibility.

2193
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,300
Did they come this way?

2194
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,510
(Seok Sam goes after Team Jae Seok first.)

2195
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:19,870
I bet they went this way.

2196
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:24,480
(Team Jae Seok hasn't decided yet.)

2197
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,280
Jae Seok, we have to give one back!

2198
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,710
- I can't tell. - You can't tell?

2199
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,280
- I can't tell. See for yourself. - Ours doesn't have gold in it then.

2200
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,080
(1st-place hint: The gold briefcase is the lightest.)

2201
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,980
- Wait. They're the same weight. - This one's lighter.

2202
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,820
(Team Jae Seok's Briefcase A is lighter.)

2203
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,250
- Hold on. - This one's lighter.

2204
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,190
- Ours is lighter. - Ours is lighter.

2205
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,220
No, this one's lighter.

2206
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,390
(Team Jong Kook's Briefcase B is lighter.)

2207
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,250
- No. - This one's lighter.

2208
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,920
- Hold one in each hand. - I'll do it.

2209
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,120
- Cho Rong, hold one in each hand. - Go ahead.

2210
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,990
(1st-place hint: The gold briefcase is the lightest.)

2211
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,690
No, we have to carry this together.

2212
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:42,330
(Is Team Jong Kook's Briefcase B lighter?)

2213
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,600
I think this is lighter.

2214
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,760
Isn't this one lighter?

2215
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:44,400
- Jae Seok, close your eyes. - Which one is it?

2216
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,630
(Jae Seok weighs them again with his eyes closed.)

2217
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:45,870
Jae Seok, close your eyes.

2218
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:47,970
Hang on.

2219
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,510
- Be clear-headed. - I think it's this one.

2220
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,440
I can't tell.

2221
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,180
- Let me try. Give me those. - Try it.

2222
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,350
- Close your eyes. - Close them.

2223
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,980
(This time, Bo Mi tries it.)

2224
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,610
I had no idea.

2225
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:04,190
(Team Jong Kook's Briefcase B, Team Jae Seok's Briefcase A)

2226
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,250
Oh, it's this one. No, wait.

2227
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,590
Oh, this is...

2228
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,890
- Oh, I think this one is lighter. - Right?

2229
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:09,060
Right? I think neither of these is the lightest.

2230
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,790
(Is Briefcase B slightly lighter?)

2231
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,390
- Come on, let's... - Where is it?

2232
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:11,930
- This way. - Where is it?

2233
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,630
(Right then, Seok Sam chases them down.)

2234
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,630
- Where is it? Hey. - Here you go.

2235
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:16,130
- You can't do this. - Sure we can.

2236
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,770
(He hands him a briefcase without making a fuss.)

2237
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:17,600
- You can't do this. - Yes, we can.

2238
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,740
(He gave him Briefcase A, the one Team Jae Seok originally had!)

2239
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:19,500
- It's right here. - You compared them, didn't you?

2240
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,240
- Compare what? - Why should we?

2241
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,340
- Hey, Jong Kook! - Run away.

2242
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:26,040
Run away. Let's go.

2243
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,680
(Bo Mi runs off with Briefcase B which they took.)

2244
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,280
Oh, my. Run!

2245
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,620
(Stopping Seok Sam as he was trying to chase them)

2246
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,510
Jong Kook!

2247
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,750
Jong Kook...

2248
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,880
Jong Kook!

2249
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,590
- Hey, Jong Kook! - Yes, Seok Jin.

2250
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:40,050
(Team Jong Kook is one step behind.)

2251
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,720
But seeing how they took B,

2252
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,090
- I think that's it. - Right.

2253
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:45,090
(Seok Sam tries to chase them down on his own.)

2254
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:43,260
- Run away! - Hey, hurry up and run away!

2255
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:45,890
- Jae Seok! - Hey.

2256
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:46,960
Seok Jin is right here.

2257
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,700
(Young Sixty is right on their tail.)

2258
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:50,230
- Where are they? - Se Chan.

2259
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:51,670
Bo Mi, run!

2260
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:57,870
(Seok Sam chases them by himself.)

2261
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:55,170
- Hurry! - Go!

2262
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:58,410
- Bo Mi, run! - Okay!

2263
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:00,380
- Give me that. - Jong Kook!

2264
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,340
(Jae Seok takes the briefcase and keeps going.)

2265
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,380
Good.

2266
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:06,250
Jong Kook! Why aren't you coming? I'm the only one...

2267
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,750
Jae Seok, it's just Seok Jin.

2268
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,820
(Out of battery in just 1 minute)

2269
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,250
Bo Mi, it's Seok Jin.

2270
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,490
It's okay.

2271
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:15,820
(Panting)

2272
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,200
(Right then, Young Sixty starts running again.)

2273
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,260
Hey!

2274
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,600
Run!

2275
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,970
Jae Seok! It's Seok Jin.

2276
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:27,370
(Seok Sam's still got it!)

2277
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,330
- Gosh, why is he so fast? - Hey.

2278
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,740
Why is Seok Jin such a fast runner?

2279
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,940
Gosh, why are you so fast?

2280
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,670
(Coming through.)

2281
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,580
(Overtaking the young ones)

2282
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,610
Why are you so fast?

2283
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,210
(He charges for the briefcase.)

2284
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,440
- My gosh. - Jae Seok!

2285
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:39,250
- Grasshopper! - Gosh, Seok Jin has...

2286
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,620
such great stamina.

2287
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,080
Hey, Grasshopper!

2288
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,920
- He can't catch up. - Unbelievable.

2289
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,150
(Jeoktoma charges ahead.)

2290
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,620
(Will he get the briefcase back?)

2291
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:49,420
(Panting)

2292
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,330
Gosh, that grasshopper...

2293
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,230
(In the end, he's completely drained.)

2294
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:57,230
(A deep breath)

2295
00:59:57,830 --> 00:59:59,230
Seok Jin, give up.

2296
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:01,140
- Don't worry about it. - Just give up.

2297
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,770
- How do you have so much stamina? - Me?

2298
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:05,670
Because I have to survive.

2299
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,510
Because I have to survive.

2300
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,440
- I work out. - He runs a lot.

2301
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,080
(Seok Jin represents 60-year-olds in Korea.)

2302
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,080
- This won't do. - You can do it.

2303
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,110
Thank you.

2304
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:15,850
(He proves that he's still standing about halfway.)

2305
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,120
Hey.

2306
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,050
We'll make sure to get Briefcase B.

2307
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:20,660
(The younger ones came belatedly.)

2308
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:19,490
- Let's get Briefcase B. - Are we going with B?

2309
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,960
- Yes, for now. - Okay.

2310
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:25,790
(Team Jae Seok ran away with Team Jong Kook's Briefcase B.)

2311
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,490
- The briefcase is back there... - That team took Briefcase A, right?

2312
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,790
- Yes. No, they took B. - Did they take B? Our briefcase?

2313
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:30,430
(Team Jong Kook is left with Briefcase A.)

2314
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,800
Seok Jin, but the lighter one...

2315
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,130
I think this is lighter.

2316
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,570
- Do you remember the other one? - The lighter one...

2317
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:37,340
(They try lifting Briefcase A Team Jae Seok handed.)

2318
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:32,430
- Let me see. - Gosh, I can't tell.

2319
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:34,040
- Let me see. - It's such a minute difference.

2320
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,340
- The lighter one... - I think the lighter one is real.

2321
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,610
- It might be the real one. - I think...

2322
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:42,910
(2nd-place hint: The gold briefcase weighs differently.)

2323
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:38,810
- this is heavier. - This one is heavier.

2324
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:40,270
- I think this is heavier. - It is, right?

2325
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,240
- This is heavier. - Our hint is different for second.

2326
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,540
- You picked it up earlier, right? - Those guys...

2327
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,610
(1st-place hint)

2328
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,450
- It's the lighter one. - might've been told it was lighter.

2329
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,680
- The lighter one is real. - Yes, it might be the lighter one.

2330
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:48,780
(Team Jong Kook's deduction)

2331
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,980
We don't know yet. Let's go.

2332
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,890
(They must've taken Briefcase B because it's lighter.)

2333
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:52,220
They have the first-place hint. Wouldn't it be B then?

2334
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:58,090
(They think Briefcase B they stole is the gold briefcase.)

2335
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,990
- But they're similar. - We shouldn't have lost it.

2336
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:56,260
- Similar. A very minute difference. - They're similar.

2337
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,330
- But with this... - Why is that, though?

2338
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:01,860
Potato, mato, mato, ma, to, potato, tomato.

2339
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:05,230
(Team Haha is still stuck.)

2340
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:05,170
Ma, mato, ma, to, to...

2341
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:07,270
- Incorrect. - What...

2342
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,270
(Sighing)

2343
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,140
Unfortunately, the other two teams succeeded in the mission.

2344
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,140
You've failed to win a hint.

2345
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,240
Don't lie to me.

2346
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,440
In 30 minutes,

2347
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:21,820
(From now on, each team will discuss their strategy for 30 minutes.)

2348
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,780
we'll hold the mission...

2349
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,210
- for the second hint. - Okay.

2350
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:22,050
Until then, you may strategize or seek out the other teams...

2351
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:23,890
and spend this time freely.

2352
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:26,120
Let's move for now. Let's go to the next location.

2353
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,690
(The ambushed Team Jong Kook will take Briefcase A and move.)

2354
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,690
- I'm so shocked right now. - Let's go for now.

2355
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,560
But look.

2356
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:33,230
We might pick up Briefcase C, and it could be lighter.

2357
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,630
- Right. Those guys, with C... - Right, they haven't tried it yet.

2358
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,330
- They haven't picked up C yet. - They haven't picked up C yet.

2359
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:38,330
- Right. - They haven't tried C.

2360
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:39,730
- That's right. - You never know.

2361
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:40,670
(Team Jae Seok doesn't know how heavy Briefcase C weighs.)

2362
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,700
But Seok Jin, what we know for sure...

2363
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:44,740
- This is heavier. - Briefcase B was in the very front.

2364
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,970
(When they were choosing a briefcase)

2365
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,010
- B, A, and C. - B, and A and C behind it.

2366
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,040
(Team Jong Kook was standing next to Briefcase C.)

2367
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:48,180
- Right, C. - Yes, C was close to us.

2368
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,740
- Right. - C was...

2369
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,110
- C was the most... - The lightest one...

2370
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:53,450
shaky. Like this.

2371
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,220
- Oh, it shook? - Did it?

2372
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:57,420
(Nam Joo says Briefcase C looked the lightest.)

2373
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:56,950
- I see. - But this is...

2374
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,790
Then, I'll call Ji Hyo to see where she is.

2375
01:01:58,790 --> 01:01:59,920
I'll ask her to have coffee with us.

2376
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,390
- Yes, let's ask her to grab coffee. - Yes.

2377
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:05,630
(They try calling Team Haha that has Briefcase C.)

2378
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:02,890
- Lure her out to a cafe. - Let's see where she is.

2379
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:05,590
But do we just walk around like this?

2380
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,030
- I know, right? What do we do? - It's so...

2381
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:10,060
(Team Haha, in last place, is still at the restaurant.)

2382
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,530
Well... What?

2383
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:11,430
- Hey, Seok Jin. - Ji Hyo.

2384
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:13,130
- Yes? - Where are you?

2385
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,100
- Us? - Yes.

2386
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,140
Where are you?

2387
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,670
(It's suspicious.)

2388
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,170
- What? - Don't tell him.

2389
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:18,210
- Where are you guys? - What does he want?

2390
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,710
They drove us here, so I don't know.

2391
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,440
- Why? - Seok Jin, where are you?

2392
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,480
(They raise their guard as Seok Sam is looking for them.)

2393
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,410
But why are you trying to find us?

2394
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,180
- What? - Why are you trying to find us?

2395
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,620
I mean, you guys got third place, didn't you?

2396
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:29,880
(Flustered)

2397
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,250
Did you do that tomato thing?

2398
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:33,490
Yes, I did.

2399
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:35,790
- For real? - I succeeded.

2400
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,630
- Did Ye Eun do it too? - Oh, the game?

2401
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:40,390
(She can't believe it.)

2402
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:40,330
- Ye Eun did it too. - Gosh, I'm good at stuff like that.

2403
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,130
Only fools are on that team.

2404
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:43,330
- What? - Right?

2405
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:44,470
- What did you say? - Only big fools.

2406
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:46,170
You can't even... Oh, what?

2407
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:49,900
Ssaebssaeb! Why are you there? These guys are all together.

2408
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,170
- Seok Jin. - Ssaebssaeb! Why are you there?

2409
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:56,080
(Seok Sam thought he heard Ssaebssaeb's voice.)

2410
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:53,410
- These guys are all together. - Where?

2411
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:54,440
- Where is Ssaebssaeb? - Are we going to a cafe?

2412
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,840
- They went to try the briefcase. - They went to try it.

2413
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,680
- They went to try the briefcase. - They went to try picking it up.

2414
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,480
(A big misunderstanding)

2415
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,150
All right. Hang tight for now.

2416
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,650
(Puzzled)

2417
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,680
Oh, but...

2418
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,120
(What's the matter with him?)

2419
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,850
What? Who is he talking to?

2420
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,490
Hey, these guys are together.

2421
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,790
(Mistaken)

2422
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:07,590
- Oh, these guys... - They went to try it.

2423
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:10,930
(Due to his misunderstanding, the call ended with nothing achieved.)

2424
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:08,960
- Ssaebssaeb is there. - They did go to try it out.

2425
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,730
- He must've gone to try it. - He went to try picking it up.

2426
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:14,200
(Team Haha thinks it's suspicious.)

2427
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:13,530
Hey, why do you think he called us?

2428
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:17,200
But Seok Jin sounded so rushed as he asked for us.

2429
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:19,130
- But Seok Jin wouldn't be so... - Did he sound rushed?

2430
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:21,900
(Why would they look for us when they have a hint?)

2431
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:21,570
- Was he rushed? - Did he do that on purpose?

2432
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,410
- Jae Seok's team got first place. - Did they have A?

2433
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:27,010
Since they were in first place, they would've gotten a better hint.

2434
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:29,810
Were the hints different for 1st and 2nd place?

2435
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:32,350
(Team Jae Seok: 1st-place hint, Team Jong Kook: 2nd-place hint)

2436
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:32,180
Hey, try calling Bo Mi right now.

2437
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:36,450
(They try calling Team Jae Seok that has the 1st-place hint.)

2438
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:35,220
- Wait. - Do you have it?

2439
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,750
Oh, Ji Hyo is calling.

2440
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,620
- Hey, Ji Hyo. - Se Chan.

2441
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,820
Yes, what's up, Ji Hyo?

2442
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,190
- I was wondering where you were. - What is it?

2443
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:47,300
- What? We're in Yongin now. - I was wondering where you were.

2444
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,130
(He starts by telling a childish lie.)

2445
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,500
- Oh, Yongin? We're in... - Yes.

2446
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,600
- Hey, Ssaebssaeb. - Yes, Haha?

2447
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,300
Let's make sure that our two teams don't get the penalty.

2448
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,640
- You're right about that, but... - We just got last place.

2449
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:59,770
(Lying)

2450
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,370
We used the chance card because we were so mad.

2451
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:01,710
And you must've seen ours just now.

2452
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:02,280
(Pretending that they used the chance card)

2453
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,250
That's why we should team up.

2454
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:07,220
- This must not be it. - B?

2455
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,720
(I guess Briefcase B isn't the gold briefcase!)

2456
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,480
Haha, okay. Tell me honestly.

2457
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,220
Haha, did you see the hint for Briefcase A or B?

2458
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:13,690
(Which hint did you check using the chance card?)

2459
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:16,190
It sounds like someone is making you say that next to you.

2460
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,690
- Se Chan. - Who? What, Haha?

2461
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:20,190
(Hanging up)

2462
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,660
(He hung up on them.)

2463
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,400
What...

2464
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,700
Do we have to get Briefcase A back?

2465
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:24,700
There's no need for...

2466
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:25,930
- a useless war of nerves with him. - Oh, okay.

2467
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:27,640
Let's just be totally honest.

2468
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,470
(Hanging up)

2469
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,870
See this? Look at this guy.

2470
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:32,410
Anyway, all we can do now is to see their reactions.

2471
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:34,910
(They don't have a hint.)

2472
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,880
That's all we can do. So, we have to fish for clues.

2473
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,410
Right now, let's pretend like this is precious.

2474
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:39,450
- Yes, totally. - I think that's right.

2475
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:42,720
If they seem to want ours, it's right that we protect this.

2476
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,120
- We'll try to protect it for now. - Try to protect it.

2477
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:45,690
(Team Haha's strategy: Let's act like we cherish Briefcase C...)

2478
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,520
And if they seem to want this really badly...

2479
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:48,360
(and see if the other teams want to take it.)

2480
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:48,890
- Then... - This...

2481
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:51,760
What Haha means by teaming up right now...

2482
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,330
- is that he has a hint about A. - Right.

2483
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:54,900
(It was originally ours.)

2484
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:55,130
That's why he called us.

2485
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,400
(Se Chan's deduction: Team Haha wants Briefcase A.)

2486
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,730
- We have Briefcase B right now. - Yes.

2487
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:59,230
Did he call to become allies with us or to find us?

2488
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:02,270
He says he wants to be allies, but he was trying...

2489
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,700
- to take our briefcase. - He was trying to take it.

2490
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:06,440
But the worst-case scenario is if Briefcase A is the gold, right?

2491
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,210
- Right. - If that's the case, Jae Seok,

2492
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,910
- we just worked for nothing. - We would end up as fools.

2493
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:14,120
(If that's true, they practically gave the gold briefcase to them.)

2494
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,210
- Everything would be useless. - But...

2495
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:14,980
- our hint is the best one. - But...

2496
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,620
Look. We picked up both of them,

2497
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,090
- and we couldn't tell at all. - Right.

2498
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,550
I think that means they're not it.

2499
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:23,020
Anyway, there's another one left. Let's try picking up Briefcase C.

2500
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,530
If none of the three stand out,

2501
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,360
it's just like you said. Since Haha targeted us,

2502
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,160
- A is likely to be it. - That's true.

2503
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,330
(Team Jae Seok's deduction: Briefcase C is the most likely.)

2504
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:31,400
You're right.

2505
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:34,640
(If not C, then it must be A.)

2506
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:36,900
I personally think it's C. As of now, I think it's C.

2507
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,340
- Totally. Haha's, right? - Me too.

2508
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:40,210
(They think Team Haha's Briefcase C is the gold briefcase.)

2509
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,280
- If we just try picking it up... - Yes.

2510
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,540
But since we took another team's briefcase once,

2511
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:46,010
- they'll try not to lose theirs. - Right.

2512
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:49,680
I think it was good that we went in before opening their hint.

2513
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:50,480
(Team Jong Kook's hint)

2514
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,520
- Right. - That's true.

2515
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,150
Jae Seok, you barely went in at all.

2516
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:54,520
Come on, I was...

2517
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,860
- I was biding my time, Bo Mi. - Oh, the timing.

2518
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,230
- I was biding my time, - Oh, timing.

2519
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:01,430
(Coward Yu was almost forced to go in.)

2520
01:05:58,230 --> 01:05:59,790
- and I brought it back amazingly. - Right.

2521
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:00,830
- You agree, right? - Yes.

2522
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:02,230
- You were practically pushed in. - But...

2523
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:05,600
did you know that you went in looking totally scared?

2524
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:06,970
(Scared)

2525
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,130
I couldn't go in bravely.

2526
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:09,040
Jae Seok, did I push you too hard earlier?

2527
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,070
I pushed you too hard from behind, didn't I?

2528
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,040
(Shaking his head)

2529
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:13,970
- I think I pushed too hard. - No.

2530
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,340
I didn't feel that at all. I went in of my own accord.

2531
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:18,210
You think you pushed me, don't you?

2532
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,050
- I went in on my own time, Bo Mi. - Oh, really?

2533
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:22,680
Jae Seok was practically squished like this.

2534
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,920
- It was good timing. - Is that right?

2535
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,290
(Firm)

2536
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:30,760
We're the weakest team.

2537
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:32,630
- Why? - I know.

2538
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:33,630
- No, we're not. - I said, "I know."

2539
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:35,030
- Hey, come on, Cho Rong. - Cho Rong.

2540
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:36,730
(Upset)

2541
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,960
- We didn't even do anything... - What are you saying right now?

2542
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:40,270
(The scaredy-cats are offended to be called the weakest.)

2543
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:39,900
- Why are we the weakest? - What do you mean by that?

2544
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,600
No, Cho Rong. He was a better runner than I thought.

2545
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,340
- Of course. - He's a great runner.

2546
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,610
- Well, fleeing is fine, - But why...

2547
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:46,870
but if we go face-to-face...

2548
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:49,340
- "Fleeing?" - What do you mean, fleeing?

2549
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:50,410
That was all part of the strategy.

2550
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,950
Cho Rong, did this look like fleeing?

2551
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:54,250
(Cho Rong figured them out accurately.)

2552
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:53,050
- Cho Rong. - It was a strategy.

2553
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,280
You saw him hesitate in front of the door, didn't you?

2554
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,250
The weakest team? No, we're strong.

2555
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,990
- Jong Kook's team is the strongest. - Gosh, this is so frustrating.

2556
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:01,220
Then, it's us.

2557
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:02,560
- Is that right? - Besides, Jong Kook's team...

2558
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,020
- only looks strong because of him. - Right.

2559
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:06,690
(The strategy meeting ended up with a bitter conclusion.)

2560
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:06,690
Other than Jong Kook, we're pretty much the top team.

2561
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:10,800
(All the teams will gather at the mission spot.)

2562
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:08,800
We'll move to the next mission location.

2563
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,530
- Yes. - Let's protect the briefcase well.

2564
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:11,930
- Okay. - Here, I'll carry it.

2565
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:13,630
Oh, Cho Rong.

2566
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:16,840
(Everyone's target is Team Haha's Briefcase C.)

2567
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,440
- So, you're that good at games. - Was the gukbap tasty?

2568
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:19,310
- It was so tasty. - Hey, so...

2569
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:21,580
(Holding tightly)

2570
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,510
- What? - No, I'm just looking.

2571
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:23,380
- Why? What? - Ha Young, are you sure about that?

2572
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,880
- Are you sure about that? - Why are you holding it like that?

2573
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,850
What... Why are you...

2574
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:29,820
(They tied the briefcase with their sleeves.)

2575
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,950
That must be the real one. Is it?

2576
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:32,350
(Team Haha decided to act like they cherish their briefcase...)

2577
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,990
Is that the real one? Do you actually believe it's real?

2578
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:34,920
(and see how they react.)

2579
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:34,960
But Haha's team used the hint earlier.

2580
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:39,490
(Both teams are smacking their lips.)

2581
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,420
- They used it. - Yes.

2582
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:37,690
I don't understand.

2583
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:39,460
Why do they cherish that bag so much?

2584
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,300
Ha Young, is that real?

2585
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,300
- This bag? - Yes.

2586
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,430
What do you think?

2587
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,630
She's good. That was a charming retort.

2588
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:47,100
(A 1-dimensional psychological war)

2589
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:51,970
(They need more clues to narrow the search.)

2590
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,370
It looks...

2591
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,970
It looks real.

2592
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:54,070
- This game... - We need to win.

2593
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,840
- It's a decisive one. - That's right.

2594
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,250
- It's nearly the last one. - It's a decisive one.

2595
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:59,780
(The second chance to get a hint about the gold briefcase)

2596
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:00,210
- That's right. - The hints are hard.

2597
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:04,150
(Which team will earn a hint this time?)

2598
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,820
Now comes the hidden hint.

2599
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,450
It won't be easy.

2600
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:05,950
The mission for the second hint...

2601
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:08,260
(The mission for the gold briefcase)

2602
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:08,220
- on the gold briefcase is... - It's...

2603
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,120
- important. - I'm So Sick of Having No Wits.

2604
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:12,130
(Mission 3: I'm So Sick of Having No Wits)

2605
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,160
- I'm So Sick of Having No Wits. - I'm So Sick of Having No Wits.

2606
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,960
Two teams will enter.

2607
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:16,300
(2 of the 3 teams will play the game.)

2608
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,330
From the one remaining team,

2609
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:19,800
(And the remaining team will run the game.)

2610
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:19,770
one representative will help with running the game.

2611
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,240
All of us have no wits, right?

2612
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:22,200
(Dissing again)

2613
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:25,110
For the mission, two members from each team will enter...

2614
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:27,640
- and sit alternatively. - Alternatively.

2615
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,850
The host will stand behind the players...

2616
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:33,580
and move a sponge bar above their heads.

2617
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:35,750
When one sitting player yells, "Stop,"

2618
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,490
(Stop!)

2619
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,090
the bar will stop.

2620
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:42,320
Then the player who yelled "Stop" will pick a number from 1 to 5.

2621
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,730
Then the host will strike down that many times...

2622
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:45,860
from the stopped position.

2623
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,630
Can we do this when a player yells, "Stop?"

2624
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,070
- Okay. - Okay.

2625
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:52,970
- All right. Stop. - When a player yells, "Stop..."

2626
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,700
(He immediately came up with a trick.)

2627
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,130
- Can we do that? - "Stop."

2628
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,670
- You can't do that. - Okay.

2629
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:57,510
(They need to stop the moment they're told to stop.)

2630
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:57,270
- I'll follow my conscience. Okay. - Be precise.

2631
01:08:57,270 --> 01:09:00,610
Points will get deducted in correspondence with...

2632
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:02,480
the number of times you get struck.

2633
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,080
If you feel like the sponge bar is above you...

2634
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,080
or your teammate,

2635
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:10,120
- say a small number. - That's right.

2636
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,420
After a total of six rounds,

2637
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:14,220
- the team with the highest score... - Good.

2638
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,490
- will get a hint. - That sounds good.

2639
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:17,320
- We need to win. - Pick two members...

2640
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,960
from the 2 teams that'll go 1st.

2641
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,960
- Let's go. - Okay. Bo Mi, let's go.

2642
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,130
- Are we entering now? Okay. - I want to be the hitter.

2643
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:24,570
(From Team Jae Seok, Se Chan and Bo Mi enter.)

2644
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:28,040
(From Team Haha, Eun Ji and Haha enter.)

2645
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:27,840
- Okay. - It's doable.

2646
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,970
- That's right. - Seok Jin is fair.

2647
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:31,770
(In Round 1, Seok Jin holds the bar.)

2648
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,970
This is a game.

2649
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:33,970
- Say, "Get ready. Set, go." - Okay.

2650
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:36,010
(Se Chan will be the first to say stop.)

2651
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:37,280
- Se Chan will go first. - This is scary.

2652
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,280
It looks pretty scary.

2653
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,750
Close your eyes.

2654
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:40,850
- Sponge bar. - You won't be able to predict it.

2655
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:41,980
I'll start at a strange point.

2656
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:43,420
Sponge bar. Set, go.

2657
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:44,790
Set, go.

2658
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,650
(The sponge bar starts moving.)

2659
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:46,320
Who is going first?

2660
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,620
- Am I going first? - Se Chan.

2661
01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:50,490
Stop! Five!

2662
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,430
Stop! Five!

2663
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:52,660
(He bravely picks 5.)

2664
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:55,230
(He gets chosen.)

2665
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,070
(Gritting his teeth)

2666
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,530
Someone got struck with a club.

2667
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,940
(Shaking)

2668
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,870
- This is scary. - All right.

2669
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:03,040
This is fun.

2670
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,840
Let me stand in the back later just once.

2671
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:10,080
(He saw his chance and hit him out of frustration.)

2672
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:08,240
- Are you okay? - Seok Jin, it was great.

2673
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,310
- You got chosen by chance. - Seok Jin, it was great.

2674
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:13,180
- You stole our briefcase earlier. - Yes.

2675
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:12,510
(This is my revenge.)

2676
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:14,480
(Se Chan loses 5 points.)

2677
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:14,820
- That's what you get. - Eun Ji.

2678
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:15,950
It's Eun Ji's turn.

2679
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,480
(It's Eun Ji's turn to say stop.)

2680
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:17,690
- Let's move the sponge bar. - You don't know where you'll begin.

2681
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:19,320
- No, I don't. - Sponge bar, start.

2682
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,390
Stop!

2683
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,520
Stop!

2684
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:25,230
(She gets chosen as soon as the sponge bar sets off.)

2685
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:26,460
Two.

2686
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:29,000
(Eun Ji loses 2 points.)

2687
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:32,070
(The cowardly member is totally scared.)

2688
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:34,470
He starts...

2689
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:36,370
- wherever he wants. - I start wherever I want.

2690
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:37,640
- He makes it fun. - I see...

2691
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:38,870
- how he does it. - He likes games.

2692
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,480
(Seok Sam's Whac-A-Mole)

2693
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,210
It's Bo Mi's turn.

2694
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,540
- He's moving it around. - Sponge bar,

2695
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,710
start.

2696
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:45,310
(It's Bo Mi's turn to stop it.)

2697
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:46,450
You shouldn't do that.

2698
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,480
Stop.

2699
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:49,950
Three.

2700
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:54,920
(Eun Ji, who was chosen twice in a row, loses 3 points.)

2701
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:53,650
Gosh, Eun Ji.

2702
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:55,960
Eun Ji, you keep getting caught. For goodness' sake.

2703
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,860
(Lastly, it's Haha's turn.)

2704
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:57,960
It's Haha's turn.

2705
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:04,160
- Stop. - I should've tightened my muscles.

2706
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,370
It's me. I think it's me.

2707
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:07,030
(He gets another chance to have his revenge.)

2708
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:08,670
- Four. - It's me.

2709
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,040
It's me. My goodness.

2710
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:12,940
(Full swing)

2711
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,040
My goodness.

2712
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,340
- You know, - What a sound.

2713
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:16,310
(It's way off from the the game's intention.)

2714
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:15,810
what a sound.

2715
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,410
Let me stand in the back later just once.

2716
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,250
- Let me do that just once. - You have to do it.

2717
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,350
(He got his revenge without thinking about the consequences.)

2718
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,280
- I'll make sure... - You have to do it.

2719
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,950
the entire Yeouido shakes.

2720
01:11:21,950 --> 01:11:23,150
- You have to do it. - Just once.

2721
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:25,220
(Team Jae Seok: Minus 9 points, Team Jong Kook: 0 points)

2722
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:24,390
You took our briefcase earlier, right?

2723
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,890
- Yes. - Right?

2724
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,290
(Team Haha: Minus 5 points)

2725
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,390
He asked again.

2726
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:29,690
- Team Pink and Team Green will go. - Okay.

2727
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:30,820
(They switch players in Round 2.)

2728
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:31,130
- Okay. We'll enter. - Go ahead.

2729
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:32,360
You and I should go.

2730
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:35,330
- Will the two of you go? - It's scary.

2731
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:37,400
(They'll try without untying their sleeves.)

2732
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,830
- Shall we send it to the back? - Shall I sit?

2733
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:39,270
We need to alternate.

2734
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,970
(Shall we send the briefcase to the back?)

2735
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,700
Shall we send it to the back?

2736
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:42,970
- No, let's keep it at the front. - It must be heavy.

2737
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:44,140
(It's uncomfortable.)

2738
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,200
Sit down.

2739
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,940
Why did you bring the briefcase?

2740
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:47,640
We couldn't help it.

2741
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,380
- For goodness' sake. - That must be the gold one.

2742
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:53,010
(The others become suspicious as they cherish the briefcase.)

2743
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:50,880
What's this?

2744
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,980
- Is that the gold one? - Scoot over.

2745
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:55,620
- It's tied. - Ye Eun can untie it.

2746
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:59,390
(Tightly tied)

2747
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:57,480
- You can't untie it. - We tried it.

2748
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,350
- You have to cut it with scissors. - Seriously.

2749
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:02,490
To take it, we need to pull out the handle.

2750
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:03,490
That's the only way to take it.

2751
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,090
- You could pull out their arms. - I could pull out their arms.

2752
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:06,090
You know,

2753
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:08,060
(They switched places.)

2754
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:07,630
- it can't be helped. - I'm scared.

2755
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:08,930
Ha Young will go first.

2756
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:10,130
- Okay. - For goodness' sake.

2757
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,630
The players who are sitting down, close your eyes.

2758
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,670
(This time, Ssaebssaeb holds the bar as he wished.)

2759
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:13,770
- I'm so scared. - Sponge bar,

2760
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:14,840
start.

2761
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:16,640
- Seriously. - Gosh.

2762
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:19,310
I can feel the air moving. Stop.

2763
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:21,440
(Ye Eun gets chosen.)

2764
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:22,640
Four.

2765
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,710
- I said, "Stop." - Really?

2766
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:25,310
- For the love of... - My goodness.

2767
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:28,680
(Solemn)

2768
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,880
- For the love of... - My goodness.

2769
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,090
(It looks like he's disciplining her.)

2770
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,850
It was funny.

2771
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,520
For the love of...

2772
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:36,820
- I mean... - What?

2773
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:36,620
(Feeling much better)

2774
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:38,660
- What are you doing? - What?

2775
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:40,690
- Listen, Se Chan. - Is this revenge or what?

2776
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:43,160
- Only Ye Eun will get picked. - What?

2777
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,100
- Say, "Stop." - Stop.

2778
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:47,030
(Ha Young's direction)

2779
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,440
(Ye Eun gets chosen.)

2780
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:51,870
- Try it again. - No!

2781
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:53,040
(For goodness' sake)

2782
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:53,170
- No matter how hard you shake it... - Hey.

2783
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:54,210
- Try it again. - No!

2784
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:55,580
- No matter how hard you shake it... - Hey.

2785
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,680
- Try it. - Stop.

2786
01:12:57,310 --> 01:12:58,450
- Try it. - Stop.

2787
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:01,450
(The result of the experiment is the same.)

2788
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:00,310
You need to move your arm.

2789
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:01,880
- If you swing the sponge bar... - All right.

2790
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,050
I can feel the wind. Stop.

2791
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,820
(It has been verified.)

2792
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:06,690
- That's right. - All right.

2793
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:07,990
Ye Eun, he's right.

2794
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:10,120
(The last hit doesn't count.)

2795
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:09,420
That's so funny.

2796
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,360
- Do you feel the air? - That's right.

2797
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,930
(He's moving his arm properly.)

2798
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,630
- It's Ye Eun's turn. - Close your eyes.

2799
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,190
- Is it my turn? - I can feel the air.

2800
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,230
(It's Ye Eun's time to stop it.)

2801
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:20,100
- Gosh. - Stop.

2802
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,840
(Did Ye Eun get chosen again?)

2803
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:21,940
Three.

2804
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,310
(This time, it's Ha Young.)

2805
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,470
(Ha Young loses 3 points.)

2806
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:30,810
(It shook her awake.)

2807
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:28,910
- Gosh. - I was biting my tongue.

2808
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:29,910
- Let's go. - Next.

2809
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,210
- I was biting my tongue. - Good.

2810
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:32,350
- All right. - Ha Young.

2811
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:34,010
(Next is Ji Hyo.)

2812
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,110
It's Ji Hyo's turn.

2813
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,890
(They can feel the strong wind over their heads.)

2814
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,280
Hey, they can feel the air.

2815
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,520
- It's too fast. - Se Chan, they can feel the air.

2816
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,620
There you go.

2817
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:41,760
Stop.

2818
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:45,590
(The sleeping tiger gets chosen.)

2819
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:48,030
(The onlookers become more shocked.)

2820
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:50,830
(Will he be able to strike Jong Kook?)

2821
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,500
- Three. - His eyes are twinkling.

2822
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:53,400
(Hitting hard)

2823
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:54,770
(Hitting hard)

2824
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:59,410
(A proper beating)

2825
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:03,110
(It takes courage to beat Jong Kook up.)

2826
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:03,210
- Good. - Gosh, Se Chan.

2827
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:04,910
It's a game.

2828
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:06,780
(Jong Kook loses 3 points.)

2829
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:07,350
Okay. Is it my turn?

2830
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,120
(Twitching)

2831
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:09,580
We're filming.

2832
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:11,350
(Jong Kook is the last to go.)

2833
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,690
I don't feel the air. He must be going slow.

2834
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:15,960
He must be going slow.

2835
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,290
I don't feel the air.

2836
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:19,030
He's sharp.

2837
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:21,090
He's sharp. He's coldhearted.

2838
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,530
- It feels like daggers. - The atmosphere is frigid.

2839
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:24,900
Stop!

2840
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:28,340
Five!

2841
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,700
Stop!

2842
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:32,170
(Ye Eun gets chosen again.)

2843
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:34,110
- Five! - That's insane.

2844
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:34,780
(His nostrils flare.)

2845
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:35,980
For the love of...

2846
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:38,410
For the love of...

2847
01:14:39,650 --> 01:14:42,350
(Ddochi gets beaten up until the very end.)

2848
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:45,020
(Chuckling)

2849
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:44,120
Ye Eun.

2850
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:46,150
- It's so funny. - Ye Eun got chosen.

2851
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:46,620
(Team Jae Seok: Minus 9 points, Team Jong Kook: Minus 5 points)

2852
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:48,220
(Team Haha: Minus 8 points)

2853
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:48,490
- She went, "For the love of..." - It hurt.

2854
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,690
(It's followed by the next round.)

2855
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:49,790
Gosh, Ye Eun.

2856
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,260
I think it's going this way.

2857
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,560
This way. Stop!

2858
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:56,560
- It's you. - It's you.

2859
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:58,170
Five.

2860
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:01,900
(Jae Seok figured out that it was above Seok Jin.)

2861
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:05,010
(Accurate)

2862
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,540
Stop!

2863
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,080
(He points at Seok Jin.)

2864
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:07,980
Five! Hit hard!

2865
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,380
(Jae Seok was accurate this time as well.)

2866
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:13,450
I knew it was above him.

2867
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:13,880
(Prankster Yu beat Team Jong Kook with his powerful instinct.)

2868
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:16,750
The scores have been added.

2869
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,580
(They kept racking up points in the next round...)

2870
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:19,090
Team Jae Seok took first place.

2871
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:22,160
It depends on luck.

2872
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:25,130
(and took 1st place again, following their win in the Tomato Game.)

2873
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:23,720
- It depends on luck. Seriously. - No way.

2874
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,830
This is great.

2875
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,230
I think we placed last again.

2876
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,360
This is great.

2877
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,460
We'll give a hint.

2878
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:30,130
- Will only the first place get it? - Yes.

2879
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:32,100
(Only the 1st place will receive a hint about the gold briefcase.)

2880
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:31,270
Okay.

2881
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:32,970
How do you do it?

2882
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:35,400
- Check it out in secret. - It's so nice.

2883
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,700
This really isn't easy.

2884
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:41,510
(They haven't figured out which one is the gold briefcase yet.)

2885
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,570
- Hold on. - Bo Mi and Cho Rong.

2886
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:40,770
- What? - Let's go to the back.

2887
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,310
- Have you lifted it up? - No.

2888
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:45,350
(They head to the corner to check the hint.)

2889
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:45,450
They tied it with clothes.

2890
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:49,880
(What's the hint on the gold briefcase?)

2891
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:50,020
- What is it? - What?

2892
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,790
Isn't it a magnet for the briefcase?

2893
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:53,950
(A magnet)

2894
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,150
We can put it on the briefcase.

2895
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:57,060
(A crucial hint for identifying the gold briefcase)

2896
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:58,560
(Only the gold briefcase...)

2897
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,360
(makes the magnet stick!)

2898
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:02,130
Isn't it a magnet for the briefcase?

2899
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,070
We can put it on the briefcase.

2900
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:07,500
Doesn't it stick to gold?

2901
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:10,540
(It's easy to test because all the briefcases are here.)

2902
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,740
It doesn't stick to gold.

2903
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:10,540
- Quiet down. - We should check...

2904
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,040
our briefcase first.

2905
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:13,570
I guess it sticks to the gold briefcase.

2906
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,610
We'll share the last rules.

2907
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:18,280
(They go back to their seats.)

2908
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:16,910
Let's go.

2909
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,450
This is hard.

2910
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:22,650
(Trying to deceive them)

2911
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:21,950
- This is hard. - This race is meaningless.

2912
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:24,250
After 30 minutes,

2913
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:26,090
today's race will end.

2914
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:27,520
- What? Already? - Really?

2915
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,090
The Judgment Stand is hidden...

2916
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,960
somewhere in the Yeouido Park.

2917
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:35,130
(The Judgment Stand is hidden in the big Yeouido Park.)

2918
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:34,930
Find the Judgment Stand.

2919
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:36,400
On the Judgment Stand,

2920
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:40,000
(The 2 final hints are on the Judgment Stand.)

2921
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,370
you'll find the last two hints.

2922
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:41,270
- We need to find it 1st. - The 1st team to arrive...

2923
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:43,240
will receive the best hint.

2924
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:45,540
The second team to arrive will receive the next-best hint.

2925
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:47,110
The third team to arrive won't receive a hint.

2926
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,580
After receiving the hints,

2927
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:50,940
make deductions...

2928
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,010
and put what seems like the real gold briefcase...

2929
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:55,250
on the Judgment Stand.

2930
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:56,720
We don't know the result yet.

2931
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,290
Thirty minutes remain.

2932
01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:01,050
(The countdown begins.)

2933
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:00,490
- Please begin. - Let's go.

2934
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,590
Shall we go?

2935
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:03,460
Tying it up like that is a bit...

2936
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,030
Is it okay to tie it to the arms?

2937
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:06,360
- You need to follow... - It's...

2938
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:09,760
(They raise concerns about their sleeves.)

2939
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,930
- the official rules of SBS. - our unique method.

2940
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:10,300
- We haven't received a single hint. - No.

2941
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,870
You need to follow the official rules.

2942
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,970
(Sneaking)

2943
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:14,370
- Untie it. - We either need to cut...

2944
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:16,040
(He approaches them from behind after getting them argue.)

2945
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:15,970
- the wrists or clothes. - Otherwise...

2946
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:17,140
- It's a bit tricky. - Do you need...

2947
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,670
(Locating the briefcase)

2948
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,910
- our briefcase? - It's a bit... No.

2949
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,910
- Shouldn't you untie it? - No.

2950
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:24,240
(Jae Seok is trying to spot a chance to put the magnet on it.)

2951
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:22,440
We'll untie it in the car...

2952
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,510
before entering the Yeouido Park.

2953
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:26,150
- For goodness' sake. - We'll untie it in the car.

2954
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:27,980
We need to come up with a strategy.

2955
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:30,780
(The briefcase is in a deeper location than he thought.)

2956
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:29,220
Do you need our briefcase?

2957
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,380
Come on.

2958
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,420
(It doesn't look easy to put the magnet on it.)

2959
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,150
You can't tell by weight.

2960
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:34,690
- Let us hold it... - Okay.

2961
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:36,220
- at the very least. - Hold it.

2962
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:38,230
- Shall we cut it with scissors? - Otherwise,

2963
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:38,990
(That's it.)

2964
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:40,290
- we need to cut it with scissors. - Seriously.

2965
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:41,290
Hold it.

2966
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:43,960
(Ha Young doesn't know about the weight hint.)

2967
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,860
- Shall we cut it with scissors? - Otherwise,

2968
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:44,500
we need to cut it with scissors.

2969
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,300
(1st-place hint: The gold briefcase is the lightest.)

2970
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,370
- Seriously. - Do you need our briefcase?

2971
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:49,200
(They let him hold Briefcase C.)

2972
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:48,470
- Listen. - We need to compare them.

2973
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:49,500
Hold it now.

2974
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,670
Hold it now.

2975
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:51,710
- We... - Hold on.

2976
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:53,410
We prepared a hand axe.

2977
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:53,370
(Grabbing)

2978
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:56,910
(A crucial opportunity to assess Briefcase C)

2979
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:54,640
- An axe? - Yes.

2980
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:58,410
Is it light? Is it heavy?

2981
01:17:58,410 --> 01:17:59,580
- I don't know. - Let me hold it.

2982
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,110
What?

2983
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,420
- It's hard to tell, right? - It's hard to tell.

2984
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,380
(Looking meaningful)

2985
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,790
(If Briefcase C is the lightest, it really is the gold briefcase.)

2986
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:06,150
It's the same. You never know.

2987
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:07,820
Let's go.

2988
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:10,090
Jae Seok, it's totally light.

2989
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:11,830
What should we do? How will we take it?

2990
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:15,430
(Briefcase C is way lighter?)

2991
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,090
Jae Seok.

2992
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:14,860
How will we take it? It's tied.

2993
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:16,130
Come here.

2994
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:18,100
(Spotting Se Chan)

2995
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:20,970
- I think it's light. - What?

2996
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:24,570
I think they checked the weight to find the light one.

2997
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:27,110
I see. They know by holding it...

2998
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:28,580
- since the gold briefcase is light. - It's light.

2999
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:31,380
(They figured out the hint after seeing Team Jae Seok.)

3000
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:30,480
It's the opposite. It isn't the heavy one,

3001
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,950
- but the light one. - The fact that they want ours...

3002
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:36,150
shows that they still don't know which one has gold.

3003
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,080
(Team Haha became sure it's Briefcase C...)

3004
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:38,290
- Right now... - We need to go.

3005
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,820
(after seeing the reactions from the other two teams.)

3006
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:41,520
- We need to be careful. - Gosh, it's scary.

3007
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:44,220
(The three teams travel to the Yeouido Park separately.)

3008
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,860
Let's find the Judgment Stand first.

3009
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,790
Our team looks cool right now.

3010
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:47,030
- The basketball court. - Go to the basketball court.

3011
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:51,060
(Team Jong Kook and Team Haha head over to the Yeouido Park.)

3012
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:50,530
Please go to Exit Five of Yeouido Station.

3013
01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:51,570
That's right.

3014
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:54,470
(Meanwhile, Team Jae Seok)

3015
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,430
Try this side as well.

3016
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:55,900
Here.

3017
01:18:55,270 --> 01:19:00,640
(They use the magnet hint they received earlier.)

3018
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:00,870
Try this side as well.

3019
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:05,880
The production crew gave us a magnet...

3020
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,380
(As the hint)

3021
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:08,420
- to find the one it sticks to. - That's right.

3022
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:10,080
- It doesn't stick to ours. - It doesn't stick to ours.

3023
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,520
- Ours don't contain gold. - It isn't the gold briefcase.

3024
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:12,790
It doesn't stick to ours, right?

3025
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:14,390
- No. - No, it doesn't. Also,

3026
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:16,120
(They're certain Briefcase B where the magnet doesn't stick...)

3027
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:17,790
- Seok Jin's briefcase... - Didn't it stick to theirs?

3028
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,230
(isn't the gold briefcase.)

3029
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:19,460
- We need to try it. - I see.

3030
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,630
If we consider the weight,

3031
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:24,130
- Briefcase C is especially light. - It's especially light.

3032
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:28,840
(Jae Seok's deduction: Team Haha's Briefcase C felt especially light.)

3033
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:25,300
- Right? - Yes.

3034
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,700
- It's really light. - Briefcase C.

3035
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:29,370
- It must be empty. - It's especially light.

3036
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:30,640
It has to be Briefcase C.

3037
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:32,710
- After all... - Right? It has to be Briefcase C.

3038
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:35,080
- After all, they're so certain. - That's right.

3039
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,610
(Bo Mi's deduction: It's really suspicious that they made a fuss...)

3040
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:36,740
They aren't interested in other briefcases.

3041
01:19:35,610 --> 01:19:37,940
(by tying the briefcase with clothes.)

3042
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:38,410
- Seriously. - There's no other explanation.

3043
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:39,950
They must've received a big hint.

3044
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:41,150
(Touching)

3045
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:42,850
Although it was tied to their arms, it was really light...

3046
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:45,120
- when I held it. - That's right.

3047
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:47,220
- Right? - Yes, it was light.

3048
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:51,960
Even if we know, we can't do anything about it.

3049
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,290
(The answer)

3050
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,560
I know. I don't know how we'll take it.

3051
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,060
We'll have to do something.

3052
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:59,300
(Doubtful)

3053
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,200
- How? - For goodness' sake.

3054
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:02,770
(She finds the weakest member doubtful.)

3055
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:02,200
- I don't think there's a way. - Bo Mi, just you wait.

3056
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,440
- Seriously. - He has 30 years of experience.

3057
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,910
(In the entertainment industry)

3058
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,140
- That's right. Let's go. - Okay?

3059
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:08,440
(Perfect teamwork)

3060
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,710
- He didn't waltz to the top. - It took hard work.

3061
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:11,040
What? It opened.

3062
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,350
What? Is it supposed to open?

3063
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:13,450
What? It opened.

3064
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,750
(What?)

3065
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:14,850
What? Is it supposed to open?

3066
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:19,090
(Se Chan guessed the password correctly!)

3067
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:18,120
What? It opened.

3068
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,250
What? Is it supposed to open?

3069
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:21,050
It's a dud.

3070
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:23,390
(Dud)

3071
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:22,920
- I see. - No way.

3072
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:23,960
How did I open it?

3073
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,590
- You figured it out. - How did you open it? Seriously.

3074
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:26,490
(Fascinated)

3075
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:28,060
- No way. - You guessed it correctly.

3076
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:30,500
(Se Chan figured out the three-digit password.)

3077
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,260
How did I open it?

3078
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:34,300
- It isn't ours. - It isn't ours. It's a dud.

3079
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:35,700
(Thanks to that, the answer is narrowed down.)

3080
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,600
It has to be Briefcase C.

3081
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:37,970
- The gold briefcase must be light. - Ours is light.

3082
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:40,070
(Team Haha's Briefcase C is more likely to be the gold briefcase.)

3083
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:38,970
Ours is light.

3084
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:41,210
Ha Young, use the chance card at the right time.

3085
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:42,810
(Chance card: The other team freezes for a minute...)

3086
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:42,610
- You're quick-witted. - We need to work together.

3087
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:44,410
- Don't use it too quickly, okay? - Yes.

3088
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:44,610
(when it's used.)

3089
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:46,950
They don't know about our chance card.

3090
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:49,920
(They're thinking of lifting the briefcases using the chance card.)

3091
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:48,580
- No. - If we go, "Everyone, freeze,"

3092
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,080
they'll be confused.

3093
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,920
Run away while the production crew explains.

3094
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,320
(The lighter one)

3095
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:54,620
Eun Ji, run away with it. Okay?

3096
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:56,760
But Ha Young is really good at hiding.

3097
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,920
- Really? - But...

3098
01:20:57,490 --> 01:21:00,530
(Recommending Ha Young)

3099
01:20:58,190 --> 01:21:00,060
- this briefcase is too big. - I lack creativity,

3100
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,630
so I always get caught.

3101
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,460
Ha Young, run with the briefcase.

3102
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,270
After assessing other briefcases,

3103
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:07,100
(Team Haha's strategy: Use the chance card...)

3104
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:07,430
I'll go to you.

3105
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,700
(and lift the other teams' briefcases.)

3106
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:08,470
- Okay, Eun Ji. - Okay.

3107
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:10,570
Just hide anywhere.

3108
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:12,270
(Ha Young will run off with the lighter one.)

3109
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:12,540
- Let's do that. - I'll go as far as possible.

3110
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,070
Shall I take the subway?

3111
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:15,580
- The subway? - Then they won't follow me.

3112
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,410
But we need to put it on the Judgment Stand...

3113
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:19,050
(They must place it on the Judgment Stand before time's up.)

3114
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:19,310
- in 30 minutes. - That's right.

3115
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:21,350
Just act crazy and enter the KBS building.

3116
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:22,550
Shall I do that?

3117
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:23,820
Just enter the KBS building.

3118
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,190
What are they going to do?

3119
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,450
Ji Hyo, that's a crazy idea.

3120
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:28,620
Then...

3121
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,760
(While Lady Song gives a crazy idea)

3122
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:31,630
You must be intuitive.

3123
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,060
(Team Jae Seok, Team Haha, Team Jong Kook)

3124
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,330
Please go to Exit Five of Yeouido Station.

3125
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:36,930
(The three teams get close to the Yeouido Park.)

3126
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:35,730
- Please go there. - Go to the basketball court.

3127
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:41,530
(Somewhere in the park are the last hints and Judgment Stand.)

3128
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:40,300
There are two hints on the Judgment Stand.

3129
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,600
Let's run.

3130
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:46,310
- The subway. - We need to stick together, okay?

3131
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:48,410
(Team Haha arrives at the Yeouido Park first.)

3132
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:47,640
- Okay. - The subway.

3133
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,380
We need to yell, "Everyone, freeze!"

3134
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,480
Stick together.

3135
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:53,910
(Team Jae Seok chases Team Haha.)

3136
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:51,950
We need to find it first.

3137
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:53,910
- Let's find it first. - Yes. Let's find it quickly.

3138
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:56,050
- Let's go to the center... - Okay.

3139
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:57,050
(Right then, Team Haha got off the van.)

3140
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:58,250
and search for it. Which way will you run to?

3141
01:21:57,550 --> 01:21:59,720
(Later)

3142
01:21:58,420 --> 01:21:59,720
I'll take the subway.

3143
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,050
But going to the subway station will take time.

3144
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:04,090
(Looking for routes to run off)

3145
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:02,890
You don't know where the subway station is located.

3146
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:05,030
- I'm looking. - It's all the way over there.

3147
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:06,960
The basement of the KBS building.

3148
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,730
One team is getting off.

3149
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:10,760
- The basement of the KBS building. - One team is getting off.

3150
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,130
Let's get out and do our best...

3151
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:15,740
(Team Jong Kook get off near where Team Haha is.)

3152
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:14,600
- to find it. - Okay.

3153
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,640
- There's no other way. - Okay.

3154
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,670
They're gathered around.

3155
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:21,010
- I'm holding it tight. - Okay.

3156
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:22,110
(Nervous)

3157
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,080
- I don't know. - Run away right away.

3158
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:25,810
- There they are. - Let's find the hint.

3159
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:26,910
(The tiger is approaching.)

3160
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:26,850
There they are.

3161
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:30,380
(Team Haha is about to be hunted.)

3162
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:29,250
If we spread out, we can... They're coming.

3163
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:30,650
- Okay. - They're coming.

3164
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:32,990
I don't think it's here. It must be somewhere over there.

3165
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,690
Let's look for a hint first.

3166
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,390
Let's look for a hint first.

3167
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:38,060
They aren't coming after us.

3168
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:43,100
(Team Jong Kook walks past Team Haha to look for the hint.)

3169
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:40,090
We need to look for a hint first.

3170
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:41,630
They don't know anything for sure.

3171
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:43,200
They don't know...

3172
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:44,960
(The briefcase Jong Kook is holding)

3173
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,370
- anything for sure. - This place is huge.

3174
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:49,470
(Briefcase A might have gold.)

3175
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,800
Their briefcase might have gold.

3176
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,570
Let's run over and check the weight.

3177
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:54,170
Eun Ji, run over and yell, "Everyone, freeze!"

3178
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,940
(Chance card)

3179
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:55,980
- Then check the weight. Do it now. - Really?

3180
01:22:54,940 --> 01:23:00,010
(It can only be used until the last chance is revealed.)

3181
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,180
- Check the weight. - Do it now.

3182
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,210
We can't use it once they find the hints.

3183
01:22:58,210 --> 01:22:59,510
- Okay. Let's go. - We can't use the chance card.

3184
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:00,510
We can't use the chance card.

3185
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:02,650
- Let's go. - Check which one is lighter.

3186
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,220
(Instead of Boss Ha who has a back issue,)

3187
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:08,960
(the three fairies surround Team Jong Kook.)

3188
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,220
Once they find the hints, it's over.

3189
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:09,660
- But the other team isn't here. - Use it now. Go.

3190
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:11,730
(Turning around)

3191
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:11,830
What?

3192
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:14,090
- What? Why are they running? - Seok Jin.

3193
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,100
We're looking for a hint.

3194
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,560
(Acting)

3195
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:18,670
(Do it now!)

3196
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:20,600
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

3197
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,540
- Freeze! - Freeze!

3198
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:23,940
- What? - What?

3199
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,210
(Using the chance card)

3200
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:26,040
- Freeze! - They used the chance card.

3201
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,070
Everyone except for Team Haha must stop.

3202
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:30,210
(Team Jong Kook will stop moving for a minute.)

3203
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:30,280
- What's this? - You can't move for a minute.

3204
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:31,910
(Realizing)

3205
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:31,710
Did they use the chance card now?

3206
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:33,550
- No, we won't take it. - Okay.

3207
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:35,420
Hurry up and compare the two.

3208
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:37,420
We won't take it.

3209
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:38,620
- Relax the arm. - This is...

3210
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:40,190
You can still hold it.

3211
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:42,220
(They start measuring with hands.)

3212
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:41,790
- They're checking the weight. - Hold the two together.

3213
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:43,190
Hold the two together to compare.

3214
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:44,620
Jong Kook isn't letting go.

3215
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:49,430
(Jong Kook holds out with force so that it's hard to compare.)

3216
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,960
- He isn't letting go. - Would you let go just once?

3217
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,260
- I don't want to do that. - He froze.

3218
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:50,300
I froze.

3219
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,600
- I don't want to do that. - He froze.

3220
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,600
I froze.

3221
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:54,030
I see.

3222
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:56,140
(Ji Hyo figures something out.)

3223
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,140
I see.

3224
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:56,470
I get it.

3225
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:58,200
I see.

3226
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,310
- They aren't sure either. - What is it?

3227
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:04,380
(Ji Hyo's signal for her to run)

3228
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:09,850
(Ha Young understands the signal and begins to run.)

3229
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:09,620
- Ha Young, run with the briefcase. - Okay. Just hide anywhere.

3230
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,420
- Are you sure? - Yes.

3231
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:16,360
- Ours is much lighter. - One minute is up.

3232
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:19,090
(The chance card is used up.)

3233
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,420
Bye.

3234
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,260
Where did Ha Young go?

3235
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:25,870
(Is the light Briefcase C the real gold briefcase?)

3236
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:20,930
She ran that way.

3237
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:26,970
I don't know. They told me to run.

3238
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:29,770
(Ha Young even crosses the 5-lane road.)

3239
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,670
Ji Hyo told me to run.

3240
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:34,070
(Ha Young has Briefcase C!)

3241
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,810
Ji Hyo told me to run.

3242
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:37,910
(Team Jae Seok is after Briefcase C.)

3243
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:37,440
It isn't here, is it?

3244
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:39,780
Is it by the hot air balloon?

3245
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:42,150
(The three teams think the Judgment Stand is here.)

3246
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:42,150
Is it by the hot air balloon?

3247
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:45,290
- No, that's it. The airplane. - The airplane.

3248
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:46,820
(Which team will find the Judgment Stand first?)

3249
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,390
Ours is much lighter. In terms of weight,

3250
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:48,490
Team Jong Kook's...

3251
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:51,930
Hey, the Judgment Stand is over there. Run!

3252
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:54,530
(Captain Ha spots the Judgment Stand.)

3253
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:53,530
Hurry up and run!

3254
01:24:53,530 --> 01:24:54,890
- Where? - Ji Hyo was right.

3255
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:58,100
(General Song runs fast.)

3256
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:56,030
It was by the airplane.

3257
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:00,970
Why are they running?

3258
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:04,340
(After spotting them, Seok Jin runs as well.)

3259
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:03,740
Why are they running?

3260
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,510
(Team Jae Seok is coming from the opposite side.)

3261
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:05,740
What?

3262
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:06,810
Jae Seok.

3263
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:11,240
(With 7 minutes remaining, Ji Hyo finds the Judgment Stand.)

3264
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:17,020
(Team Haha gets the 1st-place hint.)

3265
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,250
The thickest?

3266
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:22,220
(1st-place hint: The gold briefcase is the thickest.)

3267
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:22,220
The thickest?

3268
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:23,560
It's here.

3269
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:25,360
It's here!

3270
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,530
Can we only take one?

3271
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:30,460
(Team Jong Kook gets the 2nd-place hint.)

3272
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:29,500
Yes, there are 1st-place and 2nd-place hints.

3273
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:31,760
(2nd-place hint: The gold briefcase has a different shape.)

3274
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:32,770
It has a different shape?

3275
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,270
(It's more vague than the hint about the thickness.)

3276
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,300
Hey.

3277
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:36,170
It has a different shape?

3278
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,200
Really?

3279
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:39,010
(Team Haha has a meeting.)

3280
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:43,910
(1st-place hint: The gold briefcase is the thickest.)

3281
01:25:39,310 --> 01:25:40,970
- I think so. - Ours is thicker, right?

3282
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:42,680
Yes, I think so.

3283
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,010
- I think so too. - Really?

3284
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:47,280
(Team Haha came to believe that Briefcase C is the gold one.)

3285
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:46,310
- Ours feels thicker. - Really?

3286
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:49,150
Okay. Let's call Ha Young and ask her where she's at.

3287
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,450
It'll be over once we put it on the Judgment Stand.

3288
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,250
Can you have her pass the briefcase to you,

3289
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:55,260
get through defense, and put it there like rugby?

3290
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:57,420
- Ji Hyo, help her. - I'll help her.

3291
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:01,290
(Meanwhile, Ha Young is on the big road.)

3292
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:00,960
Eun Ji should call me.

3293
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,130
What? It's Eun Ji.

3294
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:03,800
Eun Ji, where are you?

3295
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:06,370
Where are you? We're by the airplane.

3296
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:07,900
By the airplane?

3297
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:08,970
I'm near.

3298
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,070
(Ha Young is hiding behind the bushes.)

3299
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:10,640
I think that's the airplane.

3300
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,670
I think I see it.

3301
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:15,210
(Team Jae Seok, Team Haha, Judgment Stand, Team Jong Kook)

3302
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:14,010
- I think you're right. - Really?

3303
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:15,240
You're over there.

3304
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,840
Do you think it's our briefcase?

3305
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,750
- Yes. We received a hint. - Okay.

3306
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:20,780
According to the hint,

3307
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:23,920
the gold briefcase is the thickest.

3308
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:25,120
I see.

3309
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:28,250
I think ours is thick.

3310
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:30,390
(Is Briefcase C the real gold briefcase?)

3311
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,590
They met.

3312
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:34,790
(Team Jae Seok came close to the Judgment Stand belatedly.)

3313
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:33,260
Did the two teams meet?

3314
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:36,300
I was thinking about getting the briefcase from you...

3315
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:39,100
(Team Haha and Team Jong Kook are all here.)

3316
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,900
and putting it on the Judgment Stand.

3317
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,330
- All right. Let's play. - Haha is over there.

3318
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,970
And Ha Young is hiding.

3319
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:44,100
She's hiding.

3320
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,170
- She'll come out when it's time. - They're certain.

3321
01:26:44,370 --> 01:26:48,580
(Team Jae Seok realized that only Ha Young is missing.)

3322
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:48,040
- We could give ours away. - It doesn't matter.

3323
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,610
- Don't tell them. - They untied the briefcase.

3324
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:51,440
- Don't make it obvious. - Ha Young ran away.

3325
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:51,440
(The clothes tied to the briefcase)

3326
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,150
- She's hiding. - Really?

3327
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,680
(With the briefcase)

3328
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,950
(Meeting the other teams)

3329
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:54,910
- May we hold it? - What?

3330
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:56,420
- Hold it. - Let us hold it.

3331
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,220
- Where is your briefcase? - Let us hold it.

3332
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:59,920
- Where is your briefcase? - We hid it.

3333
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:00,990
It's definitely theirs.

3334
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:02,690
- Where did you hide it? - We need to find Ha Young.

3335
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:05,460
(They're certain that Ha Young has the gold briefcase.)

3336
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:04,960
It'll be faster to find Ha Young.

3337
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:09,060
(Team Jae Seok begins searching for Ha Young right away.)

3338
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:08,030
- Maybe she's in the van. - Ha Young has it.

3339
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:10,500
- We need to find Ha Young. - In three minutes,

3340
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,060
(Right then)

3341
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:11,830
the Judgment Stand will close.

3342
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:14,130
(3 minutes before the race is over)

3343
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:13,130
- We don't have time. - We don't have time.

3344
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:15,100
The team that puts a briefcase on the Judgment Stand...

3345
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:16,970
(Only one briefcase can be placed on the stand,)

3346
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:16,740
- will get it assessed. - Ha Young...

3347
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:17,870
- is hiding. - We need to put it there.

3348
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:19,870
(and it'll be decided as soon as it's placed.)

3349
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:19,510
We need to put it there in three minutes.

3350
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:21,570
Tell her to run over right away...

3351
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:23,580
(The other teams)

3352
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:22,910
- when they spread out. - Okay.

3353
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:24,640
- Ha Young, where are you? - Stay on the phone.

3354
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,410
(Don't hang up.)

3355
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:26,050
Stay on the phone. Don't hang up.

3356
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:26,680
(Team Haha)

3357
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:27,980
Tell her to run over right away...

3358
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:29,950
(Team Jong Kook)

3359
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:29,420
when Team Jong Kook gets away.

3360
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,050
Let's block them.

3361
01:27:31,050 --> 01:27:32,250
- Maybe it isn't ours. - Hold on.

3362
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:33,790
- Hold on, Seok Jin. - The production crew...

3363
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:35,490
- Right. - might've done this.

3364
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:37,290
They might say, "We gave you the three briefcases,"

3365
01:27:37,290 --> 01:27:38,660
"but we never said they were the briefcases."

3366
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:39,830
- Right. - They might say that.

3367
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:41,130
- They play with words. - Right?

3368
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,030
(Team Jong Kook moves while making wrong guesses.)

3369
01:27:41,190 --> 01:27:42,500
- Right. - They might say that.

3370
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,200
They play with words.

3371
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,800
They've moved away. They've all moved away.

3372
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:51,500
(They're near the empty Judgment Stand!)

3373
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:51,200
- They've all moved away. - Where are you?

3374
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:54,010
Where are you? Run quickly!

3375
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:57,710
(Will Ha Young succeed in the touchdown?)

3376
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:56,180
Should I go around it...

3377
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:58,040
- and head to the location? - That's right.

3378
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,880
A tall friend didn't come here, right?

3379
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:04,920
(Meanwhile, they're searching for the giant.)

3380
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:03,850
- Who? - Did a tall friend come by?

3381
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:05,820
- All right. - All right.

3382
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:08,120
I think she's over there.

3383
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:12,060
(Bo Mi pointed to the exact place Ha Young hid.)

3384
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:14,560
- Bo Mi. - Why is my body so heavy?

3385
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:14,630
(She runs to it.)

3386
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,800
I think there's someone at the front.

3387
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,870
I'm scared they might suddenly appear.

3388
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:22,800
No.

3389
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,200
It's Jae Seok.

3390
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:26,270
(Ha Young Search Team found Ha Young.)

3391
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,310
- There's Ha Young. - Where?

3392
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:30,040
- Go forward. I'll go to the back. - All right.

3393
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:33,950
(They will close in from both sides, like a rabbit drive.)

3394
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:37,620
They're here. I'm at the back,

3395
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:37,380
(Ha Young runs off to the back.)

3396
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:38,890
at the tail end.

3397
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:41,050
(Jae Seok appears from the side.)

3398
01:28:41,050 --> 01:28:43,390
(She makes a quick U-turn.)

3399
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,360
The back side of the tail.

3400
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:47,560
(Se Chan is in front of her!)

3401
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,960
- Go, Jae Seok! Drive her. - Hold on.

3402
01:28:48,730 --> 01:28:49,960
Run this way!

3403
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:50,800
(Screaming)

3404
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:51,030
Now.

3405
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:54,230
- Can we go now? - Ha Young was caught.

3406
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:56,140
- Where was she caught? - Jae Seok caught her.

3407
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:57,940
- Where is she? Go quickly. - Where is she?

3408
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,540
(Trudging)

3409
01:28:57,940 --> 01:29:00,340
- Where is she? - Where is she?

3410
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:03,180
(They only have 1 minute and 30 seconds!)

3411
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,080
Where is she?

3412
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,940
- Go, Jae Seok! Drive her. - Hold on.

3413
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:06,250
(Ha Young is trapped.)

3414
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:06,580
Run this way!

3415
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:10,420
- Ha Young. - Yes?

3416
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:10,880
(She was caught, leaving 1 minute and 20 seconds.)

3417
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:13,020
I'm on the left side of the back of the tail.

3418
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,950
(Rushed)

3419
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:14,650
(The plane)

3420
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:14,750
The left side when you look at the tail. Hold on.

3421
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:15,860
Which side should we face to see left?

3422
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:16,960
The left side when you look at the tail?

3423
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,930
I think she's over there.

3424
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:21,660
(Eun Ji comes to the rescue.)

3425
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:21,790
Goodness.

3426
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:23,560
- Here. - No.

3427
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,900
(The mean Protruded Brothers are trying to take Briefcase C.)

3428
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:26,030
- No. - Give it to me.

3429
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,970
I'm sorry. I can't give you.

3430
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:30,940
- Jae Seok. Hold on. - Right.

3431
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:33,540
(Ha Young decides to hang on.)

3432
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:32,310
- Ha Young. - Okay.

3433
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:33,810
- Okay. - Hold on.

3434
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:35,540
- Let's take it. - Now...

3435
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:37,380
(Flustered)

3436
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:36,540
If you use force...

3437
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:39,050
If you use force, it will make things more difficult.

3438
01:29:39,550 --> 01:29:41,580
Where are you, my team members?

3439
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:41,780
(Loud)

3440
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:42,820
I'm sorry, Ha Young.

3441
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:44,820
- I can't give it to you. - Take it.

3442
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:44,820
(Turning down outright)

3443
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,790
(She even uses outer leg interlocking.)

3444
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:51,860
- You'll get hurt, Ha Young. - You'll get hurt, Ha Young.

3445
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:53,130
(Two grown men are trying to take it from her,)

3446
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:53,690
- Ha Young. - Do you have to do this?

3447
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:56,060
(but General Oh hangs on with bare hands.)

3448
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,700
If you go this far...

3449
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:58,630
(His ear turned red.)

3450
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:58,030
- You'll get hurt. - Where are my team members?

3451
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,870
Goodness.

3452
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,340
Take it. Take it quickly.

3453
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:06,510
(Ha Young hangs on with willpower.)

3454
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:06,810
- Guys. - Ha Young.

3455
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:08,270
Are you really going to do this?

3456
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:10,940
Hold on.

3457
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:12,210
(That moment)

3458
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,550
- Take it. Take it quickly. - Hold on.

3459
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:14,850
Take it. Take it quickly.

3460
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:16,050
(Strong Oh ends up losing the bag.)

3461
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:15,850
Take it!

3462
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:19,620
(Se Chan leaves mercilessly.)

3463
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:21,720
- Jae Seok. - Take it to the Judgment Stand.

3464
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:23,490
(Holding on to her jacket in case she runs after him)

3465
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,820
This is a very dirty method.

3466
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:26,190
I was on a very dirty show.

3467
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,130
(Flapping)

3468
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:29,800
Jae Seok. You're the national MC.

3469
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,130
- Ha Young. - To you, 3.75g of gold is nothing.

3470
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:32,600
- Go quickly. - Ji Hyo!

3471
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,730
Se Chan!

3472
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:36,770
Catch Se Chan, Ji Hyo!

3473
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:37,000
(Eun Ji and Ji Hyo are trying to stop Se Chan.)

3474
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:38,270
We have 30 seconds left.

3475
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,340
(30 seconds remain.)

3476
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:39,970
Put it on the Judgment Stand.

3477
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:43,710
Stop him!

3478
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:49,550
What? That's not the one.

3479
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:52,590
That's Briefcase B.

3480
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:55,050
That's not the one. That's Briefcase B.

3481
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:57,320
(Was Briefcase B a dud?)

3482
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:58,690
Do you have to do this?

3483
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:01,130
(Did the briefcases get switched when they got tangled together?)

3484
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,490
If you go this far...

3485
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:04,560
Put it on there quickly!

3486
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:04,330
(Se Chan runs with the bag without knowing that.)

3487
01:31:05,570 --> 01:31:08,500
(The only person to stop him is Haha with a broken back.)

3488
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:07,930
I can't stop him now!

3489
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:13,470
(Ha Young followed with another briefcase.)

3490
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:13,870
It's you, right? This is the real one.

3491
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:16,810
(Around 10 seconds remain.)

3492
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:16,340
I knew it. That's a fake, right?

3493
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:18,810
- We were so close. - Put it on the stand, Bo Mi!

3494
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:20,650
(He passes it to Bo Mi!)

3495
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:23,680
(Bo Mi gets it...)

3496
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:25,250
(and goes straight for the touchdown.)

3497
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:30,060
(Team Jae Seok succeeds in placing the case on the stand.)

3498
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:29,220
The timer was stopped.

3499
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:30,420
- I'll make the final judgment. - This is ours.

3500
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:31,790
- Is this real? - You?

3501
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:33,390
- You changed it to B, right? - I changed it.

3502
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:35,460
It's C, not B.

3503
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,330
(Earlier...)

3504
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:46,410
(He stuck sticker B on Briefcase C she was holding.)

3505
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:42,840
- I can't give it to you. Jae Seok. - Hold on.

3506
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:46,540
- Jae Seok. Hold on. - Ha Young. If you...

3507
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,480
(He pretended to wobble...)

3508
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:49,080
If you...

3509
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:51,810
If you...

3510
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:57,950
(and stuck sticker C on their Briefcase B.)

3511
01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:54,850
- One, two, three. - Okay.

3512
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,020
- You'll get hurt, Ha Young. - You'll get hurt, Ha Young.

3513
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:58,180
You'll get hurt, Ha Young.

3514
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:00,190
- Who changed the stickers? - They did.

3515
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:02,660
(Ssaebssaeb gave Ji Hyo the slip by switching the stickers.)

3516
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:01,190
- Did you change them? - Yes.

3517
01:32:01,190 --> 01:32:03,120
That was really close.

3518
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,260
- That's... - A lot happened to that briefcase.

3519
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:07,930
(A sign of fierce fight)

3520
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:07,830
- What happened? - That bag...

3521
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:09,160
Ha Young...

3522
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:10,930
(Shaking his head)

3523
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:10,860
- You can't. - You can't...

3524
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:12,130
- take it from her. - If I were alone, I'd have failed.

3525
01:32:12,130 --> 01:32:13,430
- She's really strong. - Her strength...

3526
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:16,340
I interlocked his leg, but he wouldn't go easy on me.

3527
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:17,640
The only thing she didn't do was curse.

3528
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:19,610
- I wasn't sure enough to take it. - Bo Mi...

3529
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:22,280
(Time for the final verdict)

3530
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:21,570
I'll make the final judgment.

3531
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:23,040
- I hope it's a dud. - Team Jae Seok...

3532
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:26,110
(They'll open the case and check its content themselves.)

3533
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,040
- Three, nine, seven. - will open and check...

3534
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,150
- Do it. - the briefcase.

3535
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:30,180
(Will Briefcase C be the gold briefcase like they deducted?)

3536
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,620
- Please. - Please.

3537
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:33,690
(Or will it be Briefcase A, Team Jae Seok's first briefcase?)

3538
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:31,980
- What? - It might not be the one.

3539
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:33,020
It doesn't feel right.

3540
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:36,660
(What's inside Briefcase C?)

3541
01:32:34,190 --> 01:32:36,860
One, two, three!

3542
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:38,420
- Wait. - Gosh.

3543
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:40,090
- I guess it's not. - It is.

3544
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:42,630
(It's the gold briefcase!)

3545
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:41,160
It is.

3546
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:43,730
It's gold!

3547
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:46,100
(They got it right.)

3548
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:47,970
Congratulations.

3549
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,170
(Tenacious Team Jae Seok is the final winner!)

3550
01:32:47,970 --> 01:32:49,540
- Well done. - Well done.

3551
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:52,370
Team Jae Seok's briefcase is the gold briefcase.

3552
01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:53,470
- Goodness. - It's gold.

3553
01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:55,040
- Was there gold? - It's there.

3554
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:56,310
(The hints that the members caught on)

3555
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,210
- Amazing. - This is why we couldn't tell.

3556
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:57,610
(Hint 1: The gold briefcase weighs differently.)

3557
01:32:57,210 --> 01:32:58,380
They have different weights.

3558
01:32:57,610 --> 01:32:58,840
(The gold briefcase is the lightest.)

3559
01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:02,520
- Briefcase C is very light. - It's very light.

3560
01:33:00,050 --> 01:33:03,520
(It's 300g lighter!)

3561
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,820
- Ours is heavier. - Let's go.

3562
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:07,390
(Hint 2: Magnet)

3563
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:07,250
They gave us a magnet to find something that sticks.

3564
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:09,720
- The one that doesn't stick... - These...

3565
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:10,590
(The fake briefcases aren't magnetic.)

3566
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:10,720
- isn't the one with gold. - aren't the right briefcases.

3567
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:11,920
(As for the gold briefcase...)

3568
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,060
It's definitely C.

3569
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:14,460
(The magnet sticks on the side.)

3570
01:33:13,190 --> 01:33:14,490
It's definitely C.

3571
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:15,760
(Hint 3: The gold briefcase is the thickest.)

3572
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,260
It's the thickest?

3573
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,060
(The gold briefcase has a different shape.)

3574
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,130
Thicker than this? Our was thick, right?

3575
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:20,730
- It felt like that to me. - Me too.

3576
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,930
(It's much thicker when seen from the side!)

3577
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,970
- It was placed like this. - So this was it.

3578
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:23,840
(Team Jae Seok made a remarkable achievement...)

3579
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,010
(with both brains and execution standing out.)

3580
01:33:24,270 --> 01:33:26,640
Let's give this to Bo Mi.

3581
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:30,510
(He gives the gold to the juniors who visited after a long time.)

3582
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:28,810
Cho Rong and I will share it.

3583
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:31,880
It was the one.

3584
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:34,850
(Meanwhile, Team Haha that was close to winning)

3585
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:34,280
It's so annoying. We picked really well.

3586
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:35,380
We did well.

3587
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:37,280
- Well done. I'm sorry. - Don't be.

3588
01:33:35,650 --> 01:33:41,820
(Boss Ha and the three fairies console each other.)

3589
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,320
- Don't be. - No, we did well.

3590
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,390
- We were so close. - Right.

3591
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,320
Still, we all lived.

3592
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:44,190
- Was there gold? - It was inside.

3593
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:44,920
(She envies them.)

3594
01:33:44,190 --> 01:33:45,190
- Yes. - Amazing.

3595
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:46,330
That was it.

3596
01:33:46,430 --> 01:33:48,830
Excluding Team Jae Seok,

3597
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:50,560
the other two teams will get the penalty.

3598
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:51,560
Yes.

3599
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:53,830
The penalty is getting the ink sponge.

3600
01:33:52,530 --> 01:33:57,140
(Today's penalty: Ink sponge)

3601
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:55,070
- Goodness. - Okay!

3602
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:56,240
- All right. Let's go. - That's fine.

3603
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:57,240
That's fine.

3604
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:58,500
- How is it done? - I guess it's fine.

3605
01:33:58,540 --> 01:34:01,410
- Is it random? - Among the eight sponges,

3606
01:33:58,570 --> 01:34:02,580
(8 candidates for penalty, 8 sponges)

3607
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:03,680
six of them have ink,

3608
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:05,340
- They're... - and two of them have water.

3609
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:06,780
- It's water? That's nice. - There's water as well?

3610
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:08,310
- Yes. Two will survive. - This is hard.

3611
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:11,620
(2 people can go home without getting the ink.)

3612
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:10,120
- Two. - It's promising.

3613
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:12,080
- Two people? - Two will survive.

3614
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,890
Apink can go first.

3615
01:34:12,890 --> 01:34:15,860
(Apink will choose first.)

3616
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:16,260
- I'll choose number 4. - Number 4.

3617
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,360
- Number 8. - Number 8.

3618
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:19,560
- Number three. - Go forward.

3619
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,360
It's no joke.

3620
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,900
- I should go with number 5. - Whose is number 6?

3621
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:24,630
(Everyone is done making a choice!)

3622
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:23,900
- Mine. - I feel nervous.
If number five is empty, I should go with that.

3623
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:27,030
- There's ink on the corner. - It's a random game.

3624
01:34:27,030 --> 01:34:28,230
- It's random. - Get ready.

3625
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:30,100
- Seok Jin has water. - One, two,

3626
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:31,200
(The penalty begins.)

3627
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,340
- How should I do it? - three!

3628
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,540
They got it!

3629
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:36,710
(Eun Ji, Ha Young, and Nam Joo get the ink makeup.)

3630
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,110
Where is it?

3631
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,050
Goodness.

3632
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:42,550
I survived, right?

3633
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:45,720
(Haha, Ji Hyo, and Ye Eun also get the ink makeup.)

3634
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:45,890
Yes!

3635
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:50,360
(The 2 survivors are Seok Sam and Jong Kook!)

3636
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:48,420
Did I survive?

3637
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:50,260
Yes! I survived!

3638
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,020
Nothing works!

3639
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,790
- She's strong. - She's strong.

3640
01:34:53,190 --> 01:34:57,500
(Amid the shouts, today's race ends.)

3641
01:34:53,790 --> 01:34:55,630
- She's really strong. - Ha Young is strong.

3642
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:57,560
Please give Apink another round of applause.

3643
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,370
- Yes! - Thank you!

3644
01:34:59,370 --> 01:35:00,800
Thank you.

3645
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,370
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3646
01:35:01,330 --> 01:35:03,900
(We'd like to thank Apink for coming as whole...)

3647
01:35:02,370 --> 01:35:04,700
- Okay! - Ha Young. You're really strong.

3648
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:06,210
(and making the show entertaining.)

3649
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,210
You still took it from me!

3650
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:08,510
(The exciting orientation day of Running University)

3651
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:09,040
- Running University, class of 2026. - Who on Running Man...

3652
01:35:08,970 --> 01:35:10,980
(Fresh and old freshmen)

3653
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:11,110
This is how university students look like.

3654
01:35:11,110 --> 01:35:12,340
It's been a while, Seok Sam.

3655
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:14,450
- "Seok Sam..." - Hey, don't get smart with me.

3656
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:14,250
(One person drives the uncle-aged classmates crazy.)

3657
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:15,550
(Out of the blue)

3658
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:15,510
Congratulations on getting married!

3659
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:18,650
(The youngest of the class of 2026, Kwon Eun Bi, doesn't back down.)

3660
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:17,280
- Now? - Now?

3661
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,680
Is that a wig, or did you use hair fibers, or did you plant them?

3662
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,490
Hey. It's my hair.

3663
01:35:19,050 --> 01:35:20,590
(A lesson to build teamwork...)

3664
01:35:20,490 --> 01:35:22,560
- What's that? - That's...

3665
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:22,520
(with the lovely classmates)

3666
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,090
- You know the adjective, right? - Five,

3667
01:35:24,090 --> 01:35:25,390
- About to throw up? - four...

3668
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:27,930
(Teamwork, my foot...)

3669
01:35:26,230 --> 01:35:28,160
"About to throw up" isn't an adjective.

3670
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:31,660
(Their shallow teamwork is falling apart.)

3671
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:31,800
- Throw him. You have to throw him! - Ji Hyo is amazing.

3672
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,430
(The scheme of the orientation day quietly begins.)

3673
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:34,930
- Hello? - Hello?

3674
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:36,870
- A mission! - There's something today!

3675
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:38,170
(One by one, the classmates begin to change.)

3676
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:39,710
(Fear rushes in.)

3677
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:39,840
- What? - What's wrong with her?

3678
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:42,070
(Accomplish the secret mission without anyone knowing.)

3679
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,410
- I'm scared. - No!

3680
01:35:41,410 --> 01:35:43,280
- What is Eun Bi doing? - Into pieces!

3681
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:43,340
(Merciless)

3682
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:45,210
(The fierce bond among classmates stands in its way.)

3683
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:45,140
- Well done! - Hold on!

3684
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:46,180
Let's do it like this.

3685
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:47,750
- Jae Seok! - Seriously!

3686
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:47,580
(Which student of the class of 2026...)

3687
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:48,780
(will survive the mysterious orientation day?)

3688
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:48,880
What are you doing?

3689
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:50,680
I can never do that.

3690
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:50,680
(The Lucky 2026 Orientation Day)

3691
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:55,720
(Running Man)
