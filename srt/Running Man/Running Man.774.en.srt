1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,540
Gosh, the weather is...

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,240
Fall is finally here.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,580
(One day in fall,
when the weather turned cool)

4
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,750
- This is amazing.
- Hello!

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,450
- Hello.
- The weather is perfect.

6
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,850
- Hello.
- How nice.

7
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,280
The weather is really...

8
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,290
Fall is officially here!

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,320
- Nice.
- On a day like this,

10
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,450
- an outdoor wedding would be nice.
- It's fall.

11
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,460
It's great.

12
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,920
- An outdoor wedding.
- Right.

13
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,060
This is an outdoor wedding venue.

14
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,990
I like the smell of grass.

15
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,290
Jong Kook is back
from his honeymoon.

16
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,000
- Stay quiet.
- Did you have a good time?

17
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,030
I bet you went to someplace nice.

18
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,830
(Shouting)

19
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,940
- Don't talk about it.
- What is he doing?

20
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,100
Why is he being like that?

21
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,610
(The newlywed has become even cuter
while we didn't see him last week.)

22
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,210
(By the way,
one member is not here.)

23
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,010
Today, Ye Eun can't join us
for the shoot.

24
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,310
- I know.
- Right. Ye Eun.

25
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,380
She's not coming today.

26
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,180
- Actually,
- Right, yes.

27
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,920
- we talked about burnout...
- Yes.

28
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,290
- with Ye Eun the other day.
- Right.

29
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,520
- We did.
- Because of what we said back then,

30
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,560
some people think this has something
to do with that.

31
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,530
- Not at all.
- Some people might think that way.

32
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,030
- That's not the case.
- She works like crazy.

33
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,300
- No.
- She's just being treated now.

34
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,930
Ye Eun is just undergoing
some treatment.

35
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,070
- Right.
- Yes.

36
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,500
The health checkup results
indicate that...

37
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,900
- Exactly.
- she needs treatment.

38
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,710
- It's just like what Seok Sam did.
- It's just like my case.

39
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,710
That's right.

40
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,040
- She's undergoing treatment.
- Right.

41
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,210
She will come back right away...

42
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,710
- once the treatment is done.
- Right.

43
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,150
I talked to her on the phone.

44
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,710
- She says she's a lot better now.
- Right.

45
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,520
I talked to her too,
and she was doing fine.

46
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,850
All right. Today,

47
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,950
- we have some guests to join us.
- Okay.

48
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,090
In the parking...

49
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,590
- We have guests today?
- I saw one of them.

50
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,290
- It's Kang Woo.
- What?

51
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,390
- Who?
- Isn't he Kim Kang Woo?

52
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,590
I saw Kang Woo.

53
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,100
(Actor Kim Kang Woo)

54
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,860
- It's been a while.
- He's really good-looking.

55
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,870
I haven't seen Kang Woo in a while.

56
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,430
- They're here.
- Hello.

57
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,440
- Hello.
- My goodness.

58
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,000
(Actors Yang Se Jong,
Bang Hyo Rin, Byun Yo Han)

59
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,340
(An actor whose name itself
is a modifier, Byun Yo Han)

60
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,210
(The monster in the independent
film industry, Byun Yo Han,)

61
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,080
(has won awards at all three
major award ceremonies.)

62
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,590
(An actor with no limits
to his acting, Kim Kang Woo)

63
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,060
(We are finally meeting
Bang Hyo Rin of "Aema,")

64
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,130
(who beat the odds of 2,500 to 1.)

65
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,330
(The rising star of Chungmuro,
Bang Hyo Rin)

66
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:12,600
(He made his debut as the cheeky
Do In Beom in "Dr. Romantic.")

67
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,710
(Yang Se Jong performed
enthusiastically as Hee Dong...)

68
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,310
(in the drama that attracted
a lot of attention, "Low Life.")

69
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,280
- They are all here today.
- What?

70
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,810
(The 4 special guests
are here together!)

71
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,050
- Nice to meet you.
- Goodness.

72
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,050
- We met earlier in the morning.
- Hey.

73
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,520
Hee Dong is here.

74
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,390
- Hello.
- Hee Dong.

75
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,050
- Ji Hyo.
- You're here.

76
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,120
- Hey, Mr. Byun.
- What are you doing here?

77
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
- Nice to meet you.
- They look so cool.

78
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,060
- Hey.
- Hello.

79
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,230
- Hello. My gosh.
- Mr. Byun.

80
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,860
- Come here.
- Hello.

81
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,900
- Move over, mister.
- Why? Yo Han...

82
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,960
- Move over.
- I'm acquainted...

83
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,900
- with Yo Han.
- Mister, move over.

84
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,970
- Move where?
- Make room for them.

85
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,500
- Move over.
- They can go over there.

86
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,540
It's not balanced.

87
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,640
- Come here.
- Just strike a balance.

88
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,770
Come over here.

89
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,140
(They bicker in front of the guests
today too, as always.)

90
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,140
You can go over there.

91
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,340
- Seriously...
- Next to Mr. Byun.

92
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,710
(Dumbfounded
by the Running Man-style welcome)

93
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,550
We have four guests here today.

94
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,810
- Welcome.
- This is amazing.

95
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,120
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

96
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,720
It's been a long time.

97
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,850
Right.

98
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,450
Yo Han, isn't this your first time
on Running Man?

99
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,520
It's my 1st time in 40 years.

100
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,460
- Is it your 1st time?
- In 40 years?

101
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,930
- Your 1st time in 40 years?
- I see.

102
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,660
Why did I think he was here before?

103
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,960
I don't think I've met Se Jong
in a variety show before.

104
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,200
- Right.
- That's true.

105
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,370
- Am I right?
- Yes.

106
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,400
I enjoyed your drama.

107
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,770
- He was Hee Dong.
- Right.

108
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,470
- What was that?
- It's "Low Life."

109
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,610
- "Low Life."
- Something about digging.

110
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,810
- "Low Life."
- Right. "Low Life."

111
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,880
It wasn't like...

112
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,880
- Digging like this?
- Yes. In "Low Life."

113
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,680
Se Jong, isn't this
your first time on a variety show?

114
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,510
- Yes, it is.
- Right?

115
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,850
By the way,
why do you seem so nervous?

116
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,250
I'm just...

117
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,820
- Did you not sleep well?
- He's always like this.

118
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,460
We were feeling
very nervous in there.

119
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,920
- We wanted to run away.
- Really?

120
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,030
There are too many cameras.

121
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,330
(A little while ago,
while they were waiting)

122
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,700
- As we enter...
- Why am I feeling nervous?

123
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,960
(Why am I feeling nervous?)

124
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,930
Earlier, I thought I'd run away
if they told me to run.

125
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,170
Let's try our best.

126
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,300
- Okay.
- Okay.

127
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,140
If he ran away,
it would be big trouble.

128
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,710
- Right.
- It would be big trouble.

129
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,440
- He was wearing the microphone.
- What should we do then?

130
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,540
- He can't do that.
- Take off the microphone first.

131
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,240
And we have Bang Hyo Rin here.

132
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,150
Hello.

133
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,080
- She was on "Aema."
- "Aema."

134
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,580
She was on "Aema."

135
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,220
(I see.)

136
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,220
You didn't watch it, did you?

137
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,490
- I did.
- I watched it.

138
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,290
- It's about driving a good car.
- No.

139
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,890
(Revving a car)

140
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,930
(The fan of "Aema"
covers things up with a skit.)

141
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,000
It's "Aema." All right.

142
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,900
- And we have Kang Woo.
- Yes!

143
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,230
- Kim Kang Woo.
- He's really handsome.

144
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,570
He's so cool.

145
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,840
- Thank you.
- Isn't this your first time here?

146
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,140
This is my first time here.

147
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,470
We've been doing...

148
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,480
- Running Man for a long time,
- Gosh, Kang Woo.

149
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,310
but Kang Woo is here
for the first time.

150
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,680
- Right.
- This is my first time.

151
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,710
Yes.

152
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,880
All right. For the next 15 minutes,
you will find seed money...

153
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,280
- hidden here and there.
- What did you say?

154
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,950
For the next 15 minutes,
you will find seed money...

155
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,520
- hidden here and there.
- What did you say?

156
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,720
The money you find
will be your mission fund for today.

157
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,030
- We have to find it?
- We are not done talking.

158
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,030
- Find money all of a sudden?
- What?

159
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,060
- What's going on?
- Wait.

160
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,260
- Find seed money?
- Here?

161
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,230
(The countdown begins right away.)

162
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,370
- All of a sudden like this?
- Find seed money?

163
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,470
- Seed money?
- What is going on?

164
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,870
(They start the search anyway
as they are told!)

165
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,000
(The money they find will be
their mission fund for today.)

166
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,310
What does it look like?

167
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,710
It has to be here.

168
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,840
I'm sure it's here.

169
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,010
Here it is.

170
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,310
This is an easy one.
This is too easy.

171
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,310
Just find something blue.

172
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,880
Ji Hyo, you're good at this.

173
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,680
They can't just tell us to look
for something all of a sudden.

174
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,190
I should go downstairs.

175
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,220
Downstairs?

176
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,460
(The older members quickly rush
to occupy the lower floor.)

177
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,720
We should go downstairs too.

178
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,660
- What is going on?
- We should go down.

179
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,930
We were interviewing the guests.

180
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,460
- What are we doing?
- We aren't done talking.

181
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,000
My goodness.

182
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,030
- Where would it be?
- The seed money is here?

183
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,240
It could be in a place like this.

184
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,270
You're not good at finding things.

185
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,040
I'm terrible at this.

186
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,540
- It could be here.
- I found one!

187
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,840
What does it look like?

188
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,040
I found it.

189
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,850
Gosh, let me have one.

190
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,510
I just found one.
Why would I give it to you?

191
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,220
This is the seed money.

192
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,490
Is it two dollars?

193
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,820
What? It's only two dollars.

194
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,890
(It's only 2 dollars.)

195
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,990
Hang on. Is there more?

196
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,460
- It's here.
- Hey, mister!

197
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,960
- No.
- Mister, move over.

198
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,060
No. This is mine.

199
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,300
- It's here.
- Where?

200
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,330
I found more seed money.

201
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,900
Here's one.

202
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,140
- There are a lot here.
- It's here.

203
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,170
It's here.

204
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,070
- You're good at finding it.
- There are a lot.

205
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,780
(Jae Seok is quick
to find the seed money everywhere.)

206
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,540
The seed money is easy to find.

207
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,650
Where's the seed money?

208
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,150
It's here.

209
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,720
(He gains momentum and goes
to other places to find the money.)

210
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,050
They are only one dollar each.

211
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,620
(He found many envelopes,
but they're all 1 dollar each.)

212
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,330
(Haha found something in a corner.)

213
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,500
(He found 10 dollars.)

214
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,870
(Large sums of money are hidden
in places that are hard to find.)

215
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,100
When it's easy...

216
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,500
My gosh. It's ten dollars.

217
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,570
It's ten dollars.

218
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,240
(Jong Kook also found 10 dollars.)

219
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,510
I found some of them
in hard-to-find places.

220
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,080
It should be in a place like this.

221
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,980
See?

222
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,410
See, Se Chan?

223
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,520
I knew it.

224
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,550
(What's the amount
that was found in the pillow?)

225
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,720
I bet it's ten dollars.

226
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,290
(It's whopping 50 dollars.)

227
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,530
(The members are easily finding
even the large sums of money.)

228
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,630
Daniel.

229
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,260
(The members are easily finding
even the large sums of money.)

230
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,330
This is amazing.

231
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,630
I'm sure...

232
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,800
it is hidden in a place like this.

233
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,840
(One person is left
on the empty rooftop.)

234
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,210
Where did they hide them?

235
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,910
(Se Jong is searching alone.)

236
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,150
(Surprised)

237
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,020
(Did he finally find an envelope?)

238
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:31,460
(He found something,
but it's just a plastic bag.)

239
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,490
(He just circles the same spot
over and over again.)

240
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,560
What...

241
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Yes!

242
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,340
(He finally manages
to find one envelope.)

243
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,440
Can I open this?

244
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,640
(He finally manages
to find one envelope.)

245
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,910
(His first harvest is 1 dollar.)

246
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,020
Can I find more?

247
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,820
(He leaves the rooftop
after finding one envelope.)

248
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,990
It's here.

249
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,960
(He heads to the hall that was
already swept by the veterans.)

250
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,130
I got it. Yes.

251
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,200
Se Jong,
we already searched this place.

252
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,670
- Really?
- You said you were nervous.

253
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,070
- What are you doing?
- I have to find something.

254
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,240
- You can't be so passive like that.
- I'm sorry.

255
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,040
You have to search the place
more enthusiastically.

256
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,810
- How many did you find?
- I've...

257
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,550
found about seven envelopes.

258
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,420
We've already swept
through this place.

259
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,720
(He's finally realized
his achievements.)

260
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,460
(On the other hand, Yo Han
found one as soon as it began.)

261
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,360
This is fun.

262
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,600
(Giggling)

263
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,000
(He finds more.)

264
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,060
Good job, Yo Han.

265
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,630
There's one.

266
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,930
(He finds more envelopes.)

267
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,700
You're good at this.

268
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,240
Someone up there is helping me.

269
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,710
(Yo Han is excited to be here
for the 1st time in 40 years.)

270
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,490
(He's opening
all the doors he sees.)

271
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,950
I'm getting more competitive.

272
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,420
(He's about to search
the entire building.)

273
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,660
I can't find it.

274
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,370
You're not good
at finding things either.

275
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,770
I'm lucky.

276
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,840
(It's his first time here,
but he's quite skilled.)

277
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,140
I'm shortsighted.

278
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,240
This is hard.

279
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,040
There's nothing.

280
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,150
(Kang Woo is back on the rooftop,
which is empty.)

281
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,580
I don't see anything.

282
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,180
I can't find anything.

283
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,320
I'm tired.

284
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,160
I need to sit down for a moment.

285
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,290
(I need to sit down for a moment.)

286
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,830
This is a difficult show.

287
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,700
(The middle-aged man
is out of energy.)

288
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,770
(Hyo Rin hasn't found anything yet.)

289
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,970
Are they in here?

290
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,040
(Hyo Rin hasn't found anything yet.)

291
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,480
- Did you find anything?
- No.

292
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,980
No? Why are you running away
all of a sudden?

293
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,920
It should be around here...

294
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,230
(An envelope is hidden
under the lamp.)

295
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:32,870
(She will find it
as soon as she raises her head.)

296
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,510
I should check this place too.

297
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,710
(Jong Kook approaches Hyo Rin
at the moment.)

298
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,980
What's that? Here?

299
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,250
It's here. I saw that right away.

300
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,220
(Surprised)

301
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,780
It's here. I saw that right away.

302
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,090
(He quickly finds envelopes
in places Hyo Rin has overlooked.)

303
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,920
Gosh, there's one.

304
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,560
(Hyo Rin can't understand
why it is happening.)

305
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,860
It's everywhere.

306
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,760
I already checked those places.

307
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,430
There's one.

308
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,370
(After missing a lot of envelopes,
she finally finds one.)

309
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,410
(She finds another one.)

310
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,940
- She found another one.
- Gosh.

311
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,050
Hyo Rin, can I have one of those?

312
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,650
Sure.

313
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,020
I took one of hers.

314
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,520
(She gave him half of her assets
just because he asked.)

315
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,990
Gosh. Only those who find them
continue to find them.

316
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,320
- It's over.
- Hey!

317
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,830
- Hold on.
- What's wrong?

318
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,700
(Habitual pickpocketing)

319
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,900
- Sorry about that.
- Hyo Rin, run!

320
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,170
That's how we get
to know each other.

321
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,600
I startled her really badly.

322
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
(Embarrassed)

323
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,770
Why did you steal?

324
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,270
- Is there not one here?
- She...

325
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,470
(Someone almost stole
the only envelope she had.)

326
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,540
- Seok Jin, would you like it?
- Sure.

327
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,650
(In a heartbeat)

328
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,010
(Oh, no...)

329
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,820
(Going the opposite direction
from Seok Sam?)

330
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,280
- Hyo Rin.
- Yes?

331
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,290
It was a joke.

332
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,990
- I can find another one.
- It was a joke.

333
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,820
I was messing with you.
Please take it back.

334
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,960
Please take it back.
That was sweet of you.

335
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,730
- Hyo Rin.
- Yes?

336
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,760
I'll look weird on the show
if we leave it like this.

337
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,400
- I can look for another one.
- Hyo Rin!

338
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,530
- But... Hyo Rin, wait.
- Yes?

339
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,100
I'll look weird.

340
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,740
- It's all right.
- How can you be this kind?

341
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,440
- You can have that one.
- What?

342
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,170
- I'll find another one.
- Did you steal hers?

343
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,110
- Did you steal hers?
- Why would you steal from Hyo Rin?

344
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,480
Why did you steal from her?

345
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,580
- Hyo Rin!
- How could you?

346
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,450
- Hyo Rin!
- That was mean.

347
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,080
- Hyo Rin, please take this back.
- Unbelievable.

348
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,620
- I'll come off as nasty.
- What's wrong?

349
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,090
I stole hers,
and she let me keep it.

350
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,220
- Why would you steal from her?
- Hyo Rin, wait.

351
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,360
Hyo Rin! Please take this back.

352
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,130
I think I'll be fine.

353
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,560
- I'll look for another one.
- You're killing me.

354
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,300
- Hyo Rin.
- Yes?

355
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,730
Hyo Rin, come on.

356
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,470
- Here.
- Can I see how much this is?

357
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,710
- Sure, go ahead.
- Are you sure?

358
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,510
Sometimes, it's a dud.

359
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,680
- Is it a dud?
- Yes.

360
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,580
The one you gave me was a dud.

361
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,380
- Anyway...
- It's a dud.

362
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,850
How can you survive in this world
when you're this kind-hearted?

363
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,480
- Should I keep it?
- What?

364
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,190
- You should keep it.
- She's such an innocent soul.

365
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,650
Are you kidding me?

366
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,720
Hyo Rin, come back!

367
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,530
I took a dollar out, you see.

368
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,190
(Seok Sam actually took a dollar
from the envelope.)

369
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,960
Hyo Rin, here you go.

370
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,260
- Is there money?
- There was a dollar.

371
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,670
I've never seen anyone this innocent
on a variety show before.

372
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,900
(While Seok Sam is flustered...)

373
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,100
(by a never-before-seen character
on variety shows)

374
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,770
(The other members...)

375
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,810
What's this?

376
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,480
- No way!
- How many were under there?

377
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,080
Get lost.

378
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
(How dare you.)

379
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,720
(Shooting familiar words
of blessing)

380
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,160
- But that's weird.
- It's weird.

381
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,460
How is it weird?

382
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,960
- Where are you headed?
- Where are you going?

383
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
How is it weird?

384
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,860
(She got caught
trying to walk past them.)

385
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,300
- Where are you going?
- We were just chatting.

386
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,500
Have a cup of coffee.

387
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,030
- Sure.
- Do you like coffee?

388
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,730
I just got this
from the coffee machine.

389
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,600
- I can't drink coffee but...
- He didn't even take a sip.

390
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,670
- If you can't drink it...
- What?

391
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,210
- I can't drink coffee but...
- He didn't even take a sip.

392
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,640
(Startled at the same time)

393
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,680
- If you can't drink it...
- You don't have to.

394
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,910
- You didn't have to drink it.
- You should've declined.

395
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,850
- I mean...
- How can you drink what you can't?

396
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,250
An Americano
would be terrible for you.

397
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,620
- That would've been disastrous.
- No way.

398
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,190
- Why were you going to drink it?
- You can't drink coffee.

399
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,990
You don't have to drink
whatever we give you.

400
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,620
- Time's up, everyone.
- Let's head upstairs.

401
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,060
Are we out of time?

402
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,560
Se Jong, were you able
to find a lot?

403
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,100
- I found three.
- Wait.

404
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,030
You shouldn't tell us
how many you found.

405
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,430
- It's not like we know the amount.
- He found some.

406
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,700
Why do you look so pale?

407
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,570
(The race hasn't started yet,
but he's already out of it.)

408
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,610
- That game had me sweating.
- Really?

409
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,470
Stop looking for more
and hurry over here.

410
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,010
Look at the envelopes...

411
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,340
- Yo Han has.
- What on earth?

412
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,750
(A heap)

413
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,350
- He found a lot.
- How did you find so many of them?

414
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,080
Who taught you to give
empty envelopes like this?

415
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,850
- I can't believe him.
- Nice one.

416
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,920
Come over here.

417
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,490
- Hold on.
- That's a mean thing to pick up.

418
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,720
Jong Kook, here you go.

419
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,460
- That's a cash gift.
- What on earth?

420
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,230
- This is a trick, isn't it?
- It's not.

421
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,300
I couldn't attend the wedding
since I wasn't invited,

422
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,000
- so here you go.
- Here's what I think.

423
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,000
I bet there were
a lot of these at the wedding.

424
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,240
Someone's tricking me again.

425
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,640
- Go ahead and open it.
- Let's do that.

426
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,210
- Let's take a look.
- No, don't.

427
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,370
- Take a look.
- Should I check it later?

428
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,010
- His name is on the envelope.
- It has his name on it.

429
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,180
He wrote his name.

430
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,910
- Take a look.
- Sure.

431
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,980
- I should take a look.
- Come on.

432
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,050
- I really hope you wouldn't.
- See how generous he is.

433
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,380
On Running Man...

434
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,780
(A dollar!)

435
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,290
- He gave you his seed money.
- I'm more than grateful.

436
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,820
- It was his seed money.
- Seriously.

437
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,090
- I thought it was fake.
- He offered his seed money.

438
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,130
- Who knew?
- A dollar in seed money...

439
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,130
is basically a hundred dollars...

440
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,160
- in real life.
- Exactly!

441
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,060
I thought he had put in a leaf.

442
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,100
- How generous of Kang Woo.
- That's so nice.

443
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,930
- How generous of him.
- That's about a third...

444
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,200
- of the money I found today.
- Exactly.

445
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,440
Regarding the money
we'll need for today...

446
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,070
He wants to get
on Jong Kook's good side.

447
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,640
I'm just amazed
it wasn't fake money.

448
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,710
Are they here to promote
the movie, "Run to the West?"

449
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,310
- "Run to the West?"
- "Run to the West."

450
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,110
Does it hit theaters on October 15?

451
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,450
- Yes.
- Can you tell us about the movie?

452
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,850
(Hitting theaters on October 15)

453
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,790
(Korea's first
AI-driven feature film)

454
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,990
("Run to the West"
is an action-packed film...)

455
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,990
(featuring AI-generated creatures.)

456
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,530
It's about the middle realm...

457
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,890
between the underworld
and the world of the living.

458
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,800
The souls that drift
in the middle realm...

459
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,960
That must be why
you look ghostly pale today.

460
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,500
You're floating around looking pale.

461
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
(He was embodying the essence
of the movie.)

462
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,300
Those souls...

463
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,210
go head to head
with zodiac-inspired angels.

464
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,410
- I see.
- Really?

465
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,410
It's also Korea's first
AI-driven feature film.

466
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,380
- AI?
- It's AI-driven?

467
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,510
- Not CGI, but AI-driven.
- But AI?

468
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,650
- It looks so realistic these days.
- Tell me about it.

469
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,720
It's so lifelike.

470
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,550
We're the only actors in the movie.

471
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,790
- What?
- Really?

472
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,590
That sounds like fun.
It's also meaningful...

473
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,660
- to be the only actors in it.
- Exactly.

474
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,930
(They're here together,
but Se Jong isn't with his group.)

475
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,830
I should check that movie out.

476
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,100
Why aren't you standing
with your costars?

477
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,370
- I like standing on the side.
- With a fellow brother.

478
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,940
- His name is like Se Chan's.
- We're the Yangse Brothers.

479
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,070
No wonder I felt close to you.

480
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,170
(The new Yangse Brothers)

481
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,940
Yangse Brothers. You know,

482
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,440
Se Jong actually looks like
one of the members.

483
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,480
- He's seamless.
- I sense that too.

484
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,210
- He's like one of us.
- He's like Se Chan's friend.

485
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,250
- He's dressed like one of us.
- Right?

486
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,480
He's not dressed like a guest.

487
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,090
Today, we're joined by the cast
of "Run to the West" in a race...

488
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,060
called A World Where
Only the Average Survives.

489
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,260
We need to be average.

490
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,330
- Do you have the money you found?
- We need to be average.

491
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,490
- It's better to be in the middle.
- Having the most...

492
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,960
- Shouldn't we have found too much?
- I got that feeling.

493
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,130
- I shouldn't have done so well.
- Exactly.

494
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,200
You will split
into two teams today...

495
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,930
and compete against each other.

496
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,840
Whoever finishes third
on each team...

497
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,140
- will be the winner.
- Really?

498
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,470
- Third place? That's tough.
- Third?

499
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,380
That's too hard.

500
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,940
(You can't be too rich,
but you can't also be poor.)

501
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,510
You shouldn't do too well today.

502
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,810
- Third place?
- Being mediocre is always tough.

503
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,180
Those who finish in third place
will win a prize,

504
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,290
and the rest will be at risk
of getting a penalty.

505
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,290
- Hold on a second.
- You came up with something clever.

506
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,120
You can't finish first or last.

507
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,460
- You will be at risk...
- You can't do too well...

508
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,490
- of a penalty.
- or do poorly.

509
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,690
We really have to be mediocre.

510
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,690
We divided you into teams...

511
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,030
- to keep things balanced.
- Sure.

512
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,530
- Bring it on.
- Jong Kook, Haha,

513
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,200
- Ji Hyo, Daniel,
- All right!

514
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
- Yo Han, and Kang Woo.
- Bring it on.

515
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,240
- I like how you divided us.
- Nice.

516
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,670
Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Se Chan,

517
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,570
Se Jong, and Hyo Rin,
you are the other team.

518
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,610
- Not bad.
- I like this team.

519
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,280
- I know.
- We're a fragile bunch.

520
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,010
The members on this team
can be swayed and controlled.

521
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,220
- We're a fragile bunch.
- That team...

522
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,550
- We...
- I bet you'd hand over money...

523
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,920
if someone threatened you.

524
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,690
- You're one to talk.
- "Give me your money, darn it."

525
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,860
Meanwhile,
we'll be playing for real.

526
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,860
- Things will be cutthroat.
- Haha.

527
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,130
- Mr. Byun's no joke.
- That's right.

528
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,830
- He's no joke.
- Mr. Byun has game.

529
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,700
- We only have to be average.
- Just be mediocre.

530
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,200
- It's doable.
- You probably don't know...

531
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,640
what the middle amount is...

532
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,040
- right now.
- Exactly.

533
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,440
Out of all 11 of you,

534
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,970
we'll let you know the highest...

535
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,380
- and lowest amounts.
- Sounds good.

536
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,910
The member
with the highest amount...

537
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,750
has 90 dollars.

538
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,480
- What?
- Who has 90 dollars?

539
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,980
- It has to be Yo Han.
- Is it you?

540
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,250
- Someone has 90 dollars?
- It's him.

541
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,620
- It's not me.
- If it's you, you'd know.

542
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,750
- Ninety dollars?
- Is it Yo Han?

543
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,860
There are two bills in here.

544
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,330
(Mr. Passionate collected
as many envelopes he could.)

545
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,890
I think I collected
a decent amount of money.

546
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,060
(Yo Han swept all the higher amounts
and ended up with the most.)

547
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,360
- No way.
- How can you have 90 dollars?

548
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,070
- How can you have 90 dollars?
- He has a lot.

549
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,730
- Ninety dollars?
- No way.

550
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,840
The member with the least amount
has eight dollars.

551
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,040
(The lowest amount among the 11,
8 dollars)

552
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,340
It has to be Se Jong.

553
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,510
- Isn't it you, Se Jong?
- It's not me.

554
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,540
- Isn't it?
- It isn't.

555
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,080
Why can't I spot any envelopes?

556
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,910
(Kang Woo, who got tired early,
has the lowest amount.)

557
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,410
There isn't any over here.

558
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,680
(Kang Woo, who got tired early,
has the lowest amount.)

559
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,380
(Kang Woo's seed money:
Lowest, 8 dollars)

560
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,750
- That's too bad.
- Where's the motivation?

561
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,390
I think it's one of us.

562
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,420
- It has to be Hyo Rin.
- I bet I'm right.

563
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,460
Hyo Rin or Se Jong.

564
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,460
- It's not me.
- Isn't it?

565
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,490
- It's not.
- It's not?

566
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,360
- Really?
- Let's move to another spot...

567
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,700
and get to know the guests better.

568
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,030
- Sounds good.
- Okay!

569
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,270
It's hot outside.

570
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,270
(Money Standings)

571
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,970
Okay!

572
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,040
This is fun.

573
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,340
Wait, is this us?

574
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,570
- I think we should sit on the left.
- Really?

575
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,780
(A screening room
fit for the four actors)

576
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,710
- What's this?
- Are we having a hearing?

577
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,580
Wait, what's this?

578
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,220
- You should sit here.
- Are we having a hearing?

579
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,480
- Sit over here.
- Se Jong, come here.

580
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,980
- No, you sit on the right.
- You should sit here.

581
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,520
- But...
- Go on.

582
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,850
Why are you always glued to me?

583
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,160
- You're always with your brother.
- Do you want to sit with me?

584
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,790
- What's the deal with you?
- Come over here, then.

585
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,330
- Come on.
- What's your deal?

586
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,330
We'll be Yangse Brothers today.

587
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,430
That's so funny.

588
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,600
I love the character
he chose to play today.

589
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,100
That's the best in variety shows.

590
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,100
The four guests
are on Running Man...

591
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,700
- for the first time today.
- Really?

592
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,040
- No way.
- So we'll take a moment...

593
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,370
- to get to know them better.
- Nice!

594
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,240
- Let's get to know them.
- I love it.

595
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,950
Two guests from each team...

596
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,580
will each ask their team a question
about themselves.

597
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,720
It's up to the rest to answer them.

598
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,350
I regret not making small talk
during the break.

599
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,620
How old are you?

600
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,690
- I was born in 1995.
- In 1995?

601
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,560
You'll take turns asking questions
for two rounds each,

602
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,530
and the team
with more correct guesses will win.

603
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,600
- Two members of the winning team...
- Yes?

604
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,160
will receive a chance card...

605
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,500
that's useful for the race.

606
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,670
I need to win that.

607
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,400
To get to know what they're like,

608
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,610
we've put together an AMA session.

609
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,840
Feel free to ask anything...

610
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,940
you've been curious about,

611
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,240
or check the notes for reference...

612
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,650
- Sounds good.
- and ask away.

613
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,480
We'll start with Yo Han...

614
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,720
- Nice.
- and Kang Woo.

615
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,220
(First interviewees,
Kang Woo and Yo Han)

616
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,090
Our team is going first.

617
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:55,490
"Ask Yo Han and Kang Woo."

618
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,590
- It's like a fan meet-and-greet.
- You're right.

619
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,800
It feels like we're at one.

620
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,360
- There are a lot of questions.
- Tell us some of them.

621
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,170
- What are some of the questions?
- "What's your take..."

622
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,430
"on Haha's mustache?"

623
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,770
His is nasty!

624
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,470
"Show us a pose or expression
you're good at..."

625
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,470
- "for photos."
- All of them are good.

626
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,670
- Every pose is cool.
- That's true.

627
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,370
As an ice-breaker...

628
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:14,210
"Kang Woo's a dad of two boys.
Do you ever want to be alone?"

629
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,110
- Do you?
- Yes, totally.

630
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,580
- I do.
- When, for example?

631
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,850
Like during the school vacations?

632
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,190
- During the school vacations.
- When the kids want to play.

633
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,390
- School vacations.
- That's when you lose your mind.

634
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,390
That's when the kids are home.

635
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,160
- Yes.
- The dads are talking.

636
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,400
- The kids don't go to school.
- Right.

637
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,960
How old are your kids?

638
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,030
- Their ages.
- I have two boys.

639
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,170
Two boys are tough.

640
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,640
The first is in eighth grade.

641
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,840
Eighth grade...

642
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,640
- Did he hit puberty?
- That scary age.

643
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,940
The second one's in sixth grade.

644
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,010
Oh, my gosh. Did he hit puberty?

645
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,440
- Yes.
- Yes?

646
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,680
- Isn't eighth grade a bit...
- I know the feeling.

647
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,910
- It's that age.
- The worst is kind of over.

648
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,650
The sixth-grader
has hit puberty now.

649
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,950
He was born in 2013.

650
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,820
I bet he rarely leaves his room.

651
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,760
- He's not that type.
- He's not?

652
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,530
He's always in the living room,
but he shows he hit puberty.

653
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,730
- How?
- He took over the space.

654
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,960
He voices his displeasure
and discontent continuously.

655
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,030
Some parents of teens take off
the door handles. Didn't you?

656
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,370
- I wish he'd go to his room.
- Do you?

657
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,440
- His son's the opposite.
- He's outside.

658
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,140
He stays outside
to voice his displeasure.

659
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,640
- Unlike other kids.
- That's stressful.

660
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,680
- Why take over the living room?
- This is a different case.

661
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Go to your room instead.

662
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,010
- He's upset in the open.
- Yes.

663
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,350
Most kids go to their room
and lock the door.

664
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,120
Do you have a space of your own?

665
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,480
- Almost none.
- Where do you sit usually?

666
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,220
- Where are you? In the bathroom?
- He stays in the bathroom,

667
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,190
- That's the best spot.
- and he's on the couch.

668
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,460
- You're on the couch?
- Yes.

669
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,190
I go to the library.

670
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,430
You leave home?

671
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,460
- Yes.
- Really?

672
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,030
- You leave?
- You go outside?

673
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,630
The library?

674
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,800
- You leave?
- You go outside?

675
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,100
I went to a coffee shop once,
and he was there alone.

676
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,570
- I see.
- We met.

677
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,140
He was reading his script.

678
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,340
- You can't read at home.
- I said, "Read it at home."

679
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,540
- He has no alone time at home.
- He can't concentrate.

680
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,310
- Somewhere quiet...
- You can't focus.

681
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,650
That makes sense.

682
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,850
- Let's ask Yo Han some questions.
- Yes.

683
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,950
Yo Han, let's be friends.

684
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,750
"Which Running Man member
do you least want to befriend?"

685
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,220
Yes.

686
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,790
I wouldn't dare...

687
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,690
I'm in no position to judge.

688
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,190
Rather than not want to befriend...

689
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,530
We won't feel hurt.

690
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,160
If you can't say their name,
just gaze at the person.

691
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,730
Gaze at the person.

692
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,200
(Gazing)

693
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,240
- I just looked.
- Okay. Point taken.

694
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
Nice one.

695
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,540
- Our eyes met.
- That's funny.

696
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,580
- A clean shot.
- He bore a hole in his face.

697
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,210
It's the best description
of gazing I ever saw.

698
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,420
- Actors do it differently.
- He went into character.

699
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,390
That gaze... "This is a gaze."

700
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,260
I think we asked enough questions.

701
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,790
- We should answer them now.
- Kang Woo, here are your questions.

702
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,330
- I ask them myself?
- Questions about yourself.

703
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,400
(A prime example of mature sexiness)

704
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,430
(He's so handsome.)

705
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,030
(The man
the members want to be like)

706
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,240
- Can I start?
- Yes, go ahead.

707
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,110
(What is he like?)

708
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,440
Shortly after we'd gotten married,
something about me...

709
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,810
made my wife really flustered.
What was it?

710
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,950
(Why was Kang Woo's wife flustered?)

711
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,320
Shortly after marriage?

712
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,190
His wife got flustered
because of him?

713
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,690
What would fluster his wife?

714
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,190
- His wife?
- Let me answer!

715
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,260
Yes, you.

716
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,330
You were newlyweds.

717
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,930
- Yes, newlyweds.
- Yes.

718
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,260
You were newlyweds.

719
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,260
Is that your approach?

720
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,830
- What are you going to say?
- He's hot-blooded.

721
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,970
That's when things are the hottest.

722
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,900
What?

723
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,940
(Did he burn his wife
with his lava-like heat?)

724
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,910
Morning and night...

725
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,910
(Dopamine overload)

726
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,010
Your cuteness.

727
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,010
- It's not couple-related.
- It's not.

728
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,850
- It's not an X-rated answer.
- It's not?

729
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,050
- What's wrong, Hyo Rin?
- Try to guess.

730
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,320
- Hyo Rin.
- He's so...

731
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,760
- Yes?
- You're too happy.

732
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,520
- She's loving this.
- Your face turned red.

733
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,660
- Do you like X-rated topics?
- Say something.

734
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,060
She liked that a lot.

735
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,460
- Yes.
- A lot, I guess.

736
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,070
The way you copied...

737
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,400
You copied him.

738
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,830
- Let me answer.
- Oh, that's why.

739
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,840
(Se Jong speaks up
for the first time.)

740
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,340
Se Jong wants to answer.

741
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,740
- Because of his sleeping habits?
- Yes.

742
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,580
- Sleeping habits.
- Incorrect.

743
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,310
- Let me answer.
- Yes, Daniel.

744
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,410
Because he wore
the same socks for two days?

745
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,120
- Incorrect. I'm not...
- No?

746
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,280
- I'm not like that. I'm neat.
- She was flustered.

747
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,350
I'm neat but...

748
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,020
- Any hints?
- Give us a hint.

749
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,590
I'm a bit like Jong Kook.

750
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,790
Jong Kook?

751
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,430
(The hint is Jong Kook.)

752
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,130
- Me?
- It's about saving.

753
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,400
What's the answer?

754
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,830
You don't wear underwear?

755
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,930
- Is that it?
- What is it?

756
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,100
You don't wear underwear?

757
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,440
I don't when I'm at home.

758
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,840
I don't wear underwear at home.

759
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,940
- Yes, that.
- You're close.

760
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,170
- You're close.
- You're close.

761
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,410
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer.

762
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,580
You're like him!

763
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,580
- You're the same!
- How?

764
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,410
- You wear thongs!
- Darn you.

765
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,350
Darn you.

766
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,350
- Thongs?
- You like them.

767
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,020
No, it's not that.

768
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,190
- No.
- At home...

769
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,760
- Let me answer!
- You're almost there.

770
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,790
You wear the same underwear
for too long.

771
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,260
Yes, that's it.

772
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,930
(Is it really because he wears
the same underwear for too long?)

773
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,840
- Correct.
- I got it!

774
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,710
You wear them that long?

775
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,540
For real?

776
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,240
- You said you were neat.
- You said it wasn't dirty.

777
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,310
You said you were neat.

778
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,910
Men usually...

779
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,610
Men usually wear
the same underwear for a long time.

780
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,220
- I have my favorites.
- Oh, I see.

781
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,580
They're clean but old.

782
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,790
We can't throw away...

783
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,950
- what we feel comfortable in.
- Of course not.

784
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,960
- True.
- Right.

785
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,160
- I wore mine for 7, 8 years.
- For real?

786
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,230
- For 7, 8 years.
- For real?

787
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,860
- I can't keep them that long.
- The really comfortable ones.

788
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,100
I think...
I think I'm like that too.

789
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,230
You tortured that one pair.

790
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,100
To be honest, I keep them
even if there's a hole this big.

791
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,570
- You really wear that?
- To be honest.

792
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,670
It's airy.

793
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,040
- I throw it away if there's a hole.
- No.

794
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,650
Jong Kook,
it depends on where the hole is.

795
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,280
How long have you kept
a pair of underwear?

796
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,420
I've never thrown any away.

797
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,690
- Hey.
- Underwear...

798
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,850
I lose them,
but I never throw them away.

799
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,290
- Never?
- I never did.

800
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,790
Only Jong Kook
seems to know the feeling.

801
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,990
- Yes. It's a thing.
- Other people...

802
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,460
- The feeling of a perfect fit.
- Yes.

803
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,900
- That's very right.
- It's airy.

804
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,000
Seok Jin wears
nothing but his underwear at home.

805
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,370
I only wear my underwear.

806
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,100
He's always in his underwear.

807
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,970
His wife and son
are fully dressed at home.

808
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,540
Only he's in his underwear.

809
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,540
Aren't you all the same?

810
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,740
- Am I the weird...
- You're topless?

811
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,180
- What?
- You're topless?

812
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,050
That's what wearing
nothing but underwear is.

813
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,380
- I mean...
- I wear nothing else.

814
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,580
He's usually topless
and in his underwear at home.

815
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,050
If he wears something on top,
his wife goes, "Seok Jin."

816
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,360
"Why are you overdressed?
It looks suffocating."

817
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,660
(His wife gaslights him
into wearing his underwear.)

818
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,630
The thing is, his wife...

819
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,560
She's fully dressed.

820
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,660
- But you...
- She wears a one-piece dress.

821
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,430
She dresses normally.

822
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,640
There's something I regret even now.

823
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,640
When I'm home,
I eat with my wife and son.

824
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,910
As a dad, there are times
when I must lecture my son.

825
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,640
I do that as we eat.

826
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,810
I'm in my underwear. "Hyun Woo."

827
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,450
"When you meet someone
in the elevator,"

828
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,050
"be sure to bow politely."

829
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,690
(Semi-nude lecture on manners)

830
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,020
- But...
- In your underwear?

831
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,560
Yes. In nothing but my boxers.

832
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
In your underwear?

833
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,890
"Bow politely."

834
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,630
Seok Jin, what if you get
something hot on you?

835
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,700
Do you wince in pain
if you splash hot soup?

836
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,900
(So many questions about exposure)

837
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,330
Because...

838
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,540
The one time I had a real scare...

839
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,570
was when I splashed hot oil
while frying an egg topless.

840
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,570
"That's hot!"

841
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,740
(He almost fried a nipple instead.)

842
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,380
That was the one time
when I considered wearing a tee.

843
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,550
Frying an egg...

844
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,580
"That's hot!"

845
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,820
- I can't grill pork belly.
- No.

846
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,020
Have a go.

847
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,050
The burns are shaped
like the Big Dipper.

848
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,390
- The Big Dipper.
- My stomach hurts.

849
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,920
- That's the funniest story.
- This is crazy.

850
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,220
We'll move on to Byun Yo Han...

851
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,260
- and his question.
- Yo Han.

852
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,760
- Shall I begin?
- Yo Han.

853
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,030
After I turned 30,

854
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,400
I cried sorrowfully.

855
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,570
- After turning 30?
- In your 30s?

856
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,170
- You rarely cry at that age.
- Right. You rarely do.

857
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,110
- When was that?
- Let me answer.

858
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,010
(When did Yo Han cry sadly
after he turned 30?)

859
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,980
When you were in your 30s
and you'd never dated.

860
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,310
- No.
- I was never without a date.

861
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,320
You've been in a relationship?

862
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,350
(He's firm.)

863
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,890
Aren't you being
a bit too confident?

864
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,550
Why would you...

865
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,560
- I'll give you a hint.
- Give us a hint.

866
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,660
Where were you? Tell us that.

867
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,290
- I was at a hospital.
- A hospital?

868
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,430
- At a hospital?
- Let me answer.

869
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,800
(If it was at a hospital...)

870
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
Were you...

871
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,830
Did you get that done late?

872
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,900
- That's it.
- Did you get that done late?

873
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,240
- Wait.
- Let me answer!

874
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,670
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer. Later in life,

875
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,580
- you got...
- Gyeongpodae Pavilion?

876
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,040
(Gyeongpodae Pavilion?)

877
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,850
At that age?
That's a tough thing to do then.

878
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,150
- Did you...
- Is that it?

879
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,920
- That procedure...
- A paper cup...

880
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,390
- Stop it.
- I had that done...

881
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,390
- when I was in third grade.
- Oh, really?

882
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,160
- It's not that.
- In third grade.

883
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,420
- Let me answer.
- Yes?

884
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,090
You went to a hospital
to get a check-up.

885
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,100
- What check-up?
- An endoscopy?

886
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,830
You checked your testosterone level.

887
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,100
It was two... It was less than five.

888
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,500
It was two or three.

889
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,470
No. My testosterone level
is pretty high even now.

890
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,840
(A real masculine man)

891
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,480
- What...
- You're too confident!

892
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,540
- Why are you so proud?
- You don't have to say that.

893
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,350
Why do you comment on everything?

894
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,020
- Sorry.
- It's nothing like that?

895
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,080
- I'll give you a hint.
- Yes, a hint.

896
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,750
- It was at a hospital?
- I was at a hospital after surgery.

897
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,050
- What?
- A surgery?

898
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,290
- A surgery?
- What surgery?

899
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,460
- What surgeries are there?
- And...

900
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,620
You had surgery?

901
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,790
It's not about a person.

902
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,190
- Let me answer!
- Yes.

903
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,660
- Well...
- Yes.

904
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,670
- Your pet. Your dog...
- That's it.

905
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,370
- It was...
- It was in a bad way.

906
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,700
It wasn't bad.

907
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,000
It wasn't bad?

908
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,540
- Let me answer!
- If it wasn't bad...

909
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,940
- Why would you cry, then?
- It's healthy.

910
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,840
- It's healthy and well now.
- Let me answer.

911
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,540
Your beloved pet cat...

912
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,410
You have a cat, don't you?

913
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,580
- I have a dog.
- Incorrect!

914
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,480
- He's wrong.
- Let me answer!

915
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
- Let me answer!
- Se Jong.

916
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,050
- Let me answer! It's us.
- Go ahead.

917
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,050
- That's it, right?
- Yes.

918
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,350
- Go for it, then.
- Go ahead.

919
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,060
- So...
- Go for it.

920
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,130
- The neutering process...
- Yes, that's it!

921
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,090
(Neutering surgery is the answer.)

922
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,900
- That's correct.
- Se Jong.

923
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Oh, yes.

924
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,400
- Oh, right.
- But...

925
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,470
But why did that make you sad?

926
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,500
But why was that sad?

927
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,540
- We were almost there.
- Why was that sad?

928
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,910
He also went
to Gyeongpodae Pavilion...

929
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,640
- and had that surgery.
- Surgery to get neutered?

930
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,610
When we first got to the hospital,
it was so sad.

931
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,480
- I get that.
- Oh, really?

932
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,550
It's a male dog.

933
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,820
Well, but that's...

934
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,520
- That's true, I guess.
- It's a boy.

935
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,720
You're taking away his ability.

936
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,590
But I hear
dogs live longer that way.

937
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,390
- That's right.
- Right.

938
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,860
Anyway, we got it right.

939
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,260
Hey, Yang Se Jong.

940
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,430
(Current score:
Team Jae Seok: 2, Team Jong Kook: 0)

941
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,960
- Se Jong is quiet but doing well.
- Yes, indeed.

942
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,630
By the way,

943
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,770
you raise your hand
more than I expected.

944
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,130
(You raise your hand
more than I expected.)

945
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,900
- You raise it more than I thought.
- Are you okay?

946
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,470
- He can endure it.
- Are you all right?

947
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,600
- Did you get some sleep or not?
- Relax.

948
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,870
- I didn't.
- Oh, you didn't.

949
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,170
- Let's do our best.
- Well...

950
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,410
Now, we'll move on to Se Jong...

951
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,610
- and Hyo Rin's questions.
- Okay.

952
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,580
I'm really curious about Se Jong.

953
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,610
- Se Jong is adorable.
- Yes.

954
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,650
- Let's see what he says.
- Okay.

955
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,250
- He has a unique character.
- Let's see.

956
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,990
Actually, we don't know...

957
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,550
much about Hyo Rin either.
So, I wonder what her question...

958
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,660
Let's start.

959
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,060
- Yes.
- Sounds good.

960
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,160
- Let's hear the question.
- Okay.

961
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,590
- Se Jong, you can go first.
- Sure.

962
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,860
- Okay, Se Jong.
- We have to get this right.

963
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,930
- Let's get it right.
- We need the advantage.

964
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:07,960
(If Team Jae Seok gets this right,
they'll win right away.)

965
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,030
Yes, so...

966
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,140
I have my own style of flirting.

967
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,770
(The experienced master
of winning over older girls)

968
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,510
(Flirting 1:
Casually grabbing her hand)

969
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,740
(Flirting 2:
Calling her name in a calm voice)

970
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,150
(Flirting 3:
Suddenly asking her out)

971
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,420
I have my own style of flirting.

972
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,580
What is it?

973
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,920
- What could it be?
- What is it?

974
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,920
Flirting.

975
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,920
I'm sure he chose this question
because it's unique.

976
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,590
- Let me answer.
- Yes?

977
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,290
You pretend to be lonely.

978
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,790
(You pretend to be lonely.)

979
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,900
On purpose?

980
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,030
That would make a woman
feel protective over him.

981
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,400
- That's not it. Incorrect.
- I can see that.

982
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,370
You keep going to the corner
without saying anything?

983
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,770
Incorrect. That's not it.

984
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,470
- Incorrect, three times.
- Come on.

985
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,140
Incorrect. That's not it.

986
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,310
(What is this?)

987
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,280
- Come on. Hey.
- He said it three times.

988
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,740
Just say "Incorrect" once.

989
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,050
- It hurts our feelings.
- Oh, I know.

990
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,810
That means
you're far from the correct answer.

991
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,650
- "Incorrect!"
- Why did you say it three times?

992
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
I guess that's it.

993
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,290
- Give us a hint.
- Here's a hint.

994
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,820
You've all done this before.

995
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,990
- We've all done this before?
- We've all done this?

996
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,120
- All of you here have done it.
- Oh, let me answer.

997
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,230
- Yes?
- On purpose, you tease her.

998
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,960
- Like pulling pranks?
- Yes, you pull pranks on her.

999
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,100
That's not it.

1000
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,630
You gaze into her eyes
for more than three seconds.

1001
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,830
- That's not it.
- Let me answer!

1002
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,770
You keep looking out for her.

1003
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,070
- That's not it.
- Let me answer!

1004
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,540
- You open her water bottle for her.
- That's not it.

1005
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,570
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1006
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,040
- Here's another hint.
- A hint.

1007
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,510
It's something you will do
later on today.

1008
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,310
- All of you will...
- Let me answer!

1009
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,910
(Something they will do later?)

1010
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,110
Change outfits.

1011
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,150
- That's not it.
- Oh, let me answer!

1012
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,250
- Ask her to eat with you.
- What could it be?

1013
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,380
Correct!

1014
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,480
- Ask her to eat with you.
- What could it be?

1015
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,620
Correct!

1016
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,790
- Thank you.
- What?

1017
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,250
- What did you say?
- What?

1018
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,320
- What was it?
- A meal.

1019
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,920
- How is that flirting?
- You call that flirting?

1020
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,630
How is asking someone to eat
with you considered flirting?

1021
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,960
- What is that?
- I mean...

1022
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,900
- How is that flirting?
- "Let's grab a meal." Is that...

1023
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,460
But do you ask her
while making a cute face?

1024
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,700
"Let's eat together."
Is it that kind of vibe?

1025
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,930
- Or is it...
- How do you ask her, Se Jong?

1026
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,440
Well, I just... "Let's..."

1027
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,000
- "Let's grab a meal." Then...
- So,

1028
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,470
- do you not eat with someone...
- I say that...

1029
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,470
you don't like?

1030
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,670
Well...

1031
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,940
- Hey, Se Jong, you should...
- Why are you so...

1032
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,950
- Is this such a hard question?
- Why are you...

1033
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,580
- Why did you ask a hard question?
- Did you see him? He can't...

1034
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:08,450
What is this?
I don't get what this is about.

1035
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,990
- Well, I actually...
- What is that?

1036
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,160
I don't flirt. I really don't,

1037
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,290
but they insisted...

1038
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,320
- They asked you to pick one?
- I see.

1039
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,990
- Yes, they asked me to pick one.
- Oh, they asked you to.

1040
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,360
But why did you have to
choose this kind of question?

1041
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,700
I live such an uninteresting life.

1042
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,830
I spoke to the writer
on the phone for an hour.

1043
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,870
Over this?

1044
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,070
- We literally talked for an hour.
- This was what you came up with.

1045
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,540
I seriously apologized
for living such a boring life.

1046
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,040
I'm serious.

1047
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,940
Is there something you want to try?

1048
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,080
(They really had
an hour-long phone interview.)

1049
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,140
I don't think I have anything.

1050
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,050
I just don't do much for fun.

1051
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,510
I live such a boring life, don't I?

1052
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,280
- I'm sorry. I really...
- No, it's fine.

1053
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,350
I wish I could tell you
something else, but...

1054
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,690
No, it's okay.

1055
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,820
- I'm serious.
- Who was it?

1056
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,060
- Who was it?
- Wait, who...

1057
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,220
- Who was it?
- Which one was it?

1058
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,290
I swear.

1059
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,490
This is the first time...

1060
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,690
- I've heard such a boring answer.
- For real.

1061
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,960
I love his character.

1062
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,500
- Okay, it's Hyo Rin's turn now.
- Hyo Rin. Let's get this right.

1063
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,230
- So, this team has to...
- I'm looking forward to this.

1064
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,370
get Hyo Rin's question right...

1065
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,000
- to tie the game.
- We have to get this right.

1066
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,340
We have to get this right.

1067
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,870
- Hyo Rin.
- Yes?

1068
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,310
Give us a hint...

1069
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,010
- that will help us out.
- Give us a good hint.

1070
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,510
Hey, come on.

1071
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,850
So, here's the question. First,

1072
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:13,980
what is something I'd like to fix...

1073
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,180
- about myself?
- Let me answer!

1074
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,120
(What is something Hyo Rin
wants to fix about herself?)

1075
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,390
Your personality...

1076
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,690
of being so introverted
that you can't speak up.

1077
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,160
- Oh, that's correct.
- Okay!

1078
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,260
Okay!

1079
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,230
- Come on!
- Yes!

1080
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,730
- That wasn't fun at all.
- Hey, this was...

1081
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,760
- Hang on.
- Wait a minute.

1082
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,400
- Who interviewed her?
- What was that?

1083
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,270
- That was so boring!
- Who interviewed her?

1084
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,340
- I mean, she was...
- But...

1085
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,470
- literally showing us the answer...
- I mean...

1086
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,610
- as she was reading it.
- What are you doing?

1087
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,640
How could the answer be
that she's introverted?

1088
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,180
- Gosh, anyone can tell.
- What is that?

1089
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,980
- Also, Hyo Rin. This...
- She was reading it like...

1090
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,110
- The question is...
- Hey.

1091
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,450
Which writer did you talk to
on the phone?

1092
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,780
She even asked to do the interview
with the writer in writing.

1093
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,020
- The answer was so boring.
- How could you do that?

1094
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,190
- I mean...
- The answer was so not funny.

1095
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,350
- Hyo Rin.
- Hey, Hyo Rin.

1096
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,520
- I'm so shy when I meet people.
- You're really shy.

1097
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,660
So, sometimes, when I saw...

1098
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,760
a boyfriend I was dating...

1099
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,630
for the first time in a few days,

1100
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,230
- I'd be so shy around him.
- You were shy around him?

1101
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,270
Even when he was your boyfriend?

1102
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,370
(Then, we understand.)

1103
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,500
Even your boyfriend?

1104
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,240
Oh, I guess that could happen.

1105
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,110
- By the way, Hyo Rin.
- I think I get what you mean.

1106
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,810
Do you feel awkward
and shy around your boyfriend...

1107
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,440
even if you share physical affection
with him in between?

1108
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,980
- Yes, if I don't see him...
- Like holding hands or something.

1109
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,910
- for a few days or a week...
- If you don't see him?

1110
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,680
How do you express your awkwardness?

1111
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,350
I've even bowed to him and said,
"Hello," in a formal way.

1112
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,220
(To her boyfriend)

1113
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,220
(The oddball Ms. Bang Hyo Rin is
even shy around her boyfriend.)

1114
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,030
- Bowing and saying "Hello?"
- A formal greeting?

1115
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,030
- It's that bad?
- Seriously?

1116
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,060
- You're so peculiar.
- By the way,

1117
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,760
how does your boyfriend
respond to that?

1118
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,530
- At first,
- I'm sure he finds it cute.

1119
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,170
he was...

1120
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,570
- a little...
- I'm sure he found it cute.

1121
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,740
- offended by it sometimes.
- Oh, right.

1122
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:40,940
What else?

1123
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,510
What other episodes do you have
from being so introverted?

1124
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,710
All of my hobbies
are things I do at home.

1125
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,480
There are board game versions...

1126
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,080
- of escape rooms too.
- Oh, really?

1127
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,780
I play those by myself.

1128
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,050
- So, board games...
- Then, do you...

1129
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,050
close the door to your room
and escape from it? How do you play it?

1130
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,220
- What are you...
- Escape room...

1131
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,790
- It's a board game.
- It's a board game.

1132
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,460
When we spoke to her,

1133
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,090
we weren't really sure...

1134
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,630
how she played board games
by herself either.

1135
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,290
So, we prepared a board game.

1136
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,660
- This is the board game?
- I know this.

1137
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,960
- This one.
- Oh, I know this.

1138
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,130
This is the penguin ice game.

1139
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,370
Imagine that you're at home.

1140
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,530
But the thing is,

1141
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,970
I don't act out different parts
as I play or anything.

1142
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,240
- Imagine there are 4 players.
- So, there are 4 players now.

1143
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,740
- Go ahead.
- So,

1144
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,880
I decide that the person over here
is going to lose.

1145
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,980
- Oh, really?
- Then, by myself,

1146
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,180
- I...
- That's scary.

1147
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,920
This is starting to get scary.

1148
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,280
So, for example...

1149
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,550
(Player 1: Carefully)

1150
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,920
- And then?
- Then, I move to this spot.

1151
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:36,730
(Sliding over)

1152
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,460
- This is scary.
- Hey, this is scary!

1153
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,260
Hey, what is this? It's so scary.

1154
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,460
(Playing by herself
is pretty much like a horror movie.)

1155
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,630
Don't you say anything?

1156
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,300
- Are these two on the same team?
- Is there no talking?

1157
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,200
- Yes, they're on the same team.
- The same team?

1158
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,270
- Is she like this on set too?
- So, they're...

1159
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,300
Don't you say anything?

1160
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,410
Now, it's the next player.

1161
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,840
And for this team,

1162
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,410
- they have to do badly.
- This player has to play badly.

1163
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,980
- The bad player.
- Oh, this is the bad player.

1164
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,310
- It's the bad player.
- Then...

1165
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,910
- That's the premise.
- So, then...

1166
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,480
- But I did well.
- Oh, on purpose?

1167
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,920
- I did well.
- She says she did well.

1168
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,220
She was supposed to do badly,
but she did well.

1169
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,420
There are unexpected twists too.

1170
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,220
- Unexpected things happen too.
- Yes.

1171
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,720
- But this player...
- This player?

1172
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,290
- is on the same team.
- The same team?

1173
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,760
- Oh, right.
- But?

1174
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,760
- Act like you're bad at this.
- Play badly.

1175
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,200
You have to do badly.

1176
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
You should go...

1177
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,370
(Flustered)

1178
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,370
Did it work?

1179
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,570
Oh, the game is over.

1180
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,100
- Yes, it's over.
- It's over.

1181
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,410
Did you win, then?

1182
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,740
- I guess that's how she plays.
- Yes, that's what I do,

1183
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,910
- and I start over...
- You start over.

1184
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:25,980
- You put it back together?
- Yes.

1185
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,140
In the back, Dr. Oh Eun Yeong...

1186
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,610
is watching this whole thing.

1187
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,750
(In the back, Dr. Oh Eun Yeong
is watching this whole thing.)

1188
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,980
(This problem child is
the master of playing by herself.)

1189
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,480
- This is funny and peculiar.
- So, is this...

1190
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,780
- what you do at home?
- Gosh, this is so funny.

1191
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,820
So peculiar.

1192
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,590
Both of you have
such unique characters.

1193
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,690
She looks so excited right now too.

1194
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,190
As a result of the mission,

1195
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,360
- Team Jae Seok...
- We should've gotten it right.

1196
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,160
- got two questions correct.
- Yes!

1197
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,900
Team Jong Kook got
three questions correct.

1198
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,130
- Yes!
- Let's go!

1199
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,130
Team Jong Kook takes the victory.

1200
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,130
The winning team...

1201
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,470
will get two chance cards...

1202
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,040
that will allow you
to add or subtract...

1203
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,310
from the amount of money...

1204
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,180
that you or your teammates have.

1205
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,510
- Okay.
- We have to be mediocre.

1206
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,380
Yes, the chance cards...

1207
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,610
will be usable after the first round
of expenses.

1208
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,180
You may decide amongst yourselves...

1209
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,820
which two team members...

1210
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,880
will get to take the chance cards.

1211
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,020
- This is a rare opportunity.
- All right.

1212
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,390
Let's just play rock-paper-scissors.

1213
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,460
- Let's be fair.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1214
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,390
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- Yes, that's the only way.

1215
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,460
- Rock...
- It's different.

1216
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,490
Se Jong.

1217
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,200
- Why are you making a fist?
- Oh, right.

1218
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,700
Sorry,
but since you're not on our team...

1219
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,300
Why are you playing too?

1220
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,870
- I was so absorbed.
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1221
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,230
I feel bad.

1222
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,640
- You should take it.
- Okay.

1223
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,270
Okay, then. Let's set up
for the first round of expenses.

1224
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,740
This is the first round of expenses.

1225
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,410
Today, you must purchase
the team outfits and name tags...

1226
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,950
- and put them on.
- Oh, really?

1227
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,610
The team outfits
and the beautifully decorated...

1228
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,880
special edition name tags
come as a set...

1229
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,050
which costs 30 dollars.

1230
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,590
Oh, this is expensive.

1231
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,890
That's for all of your members.

1232
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,260
Oh, it's 30 dollars for 6?

1233
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,360
Combined?

1234
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,160
If you can't spend 30 dollars,

1235
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,890
then, for ten dollars,

1236
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,600
you may take a team vest
and empty name tag...

1237
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,360
to write your own name on it...

1238
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,030
and wear it for today.

1239
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,330
- We should do that.
- The one with...

1240
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,940
Just to let you know,
if you spend above or below...

1241
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,640
the target amount,

1242
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,440
someone will get a penalty.

1243
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,880
- If we spend more?
- If it's more than 30 dollars?

1244
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,410
It has to be exactly 30 dollars.

1245
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,350
- Let's decide on the amount.
- How about this?

1246
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,650
We'll decide on the exact amount.

1247
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,980
You'll discuss with your team
what to buy...

1248
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,220
and then make your purchase.

1249
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,650
We need to pay 30 dollars as a team.

1250
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,050
- One each.
- We should all pay.

1251
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,090
- You don't have any money.
- You'll pay one by one,

1252
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:25,690
so you should decide
who will pay what amount in advance.

1253
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,400
Let's decide on an amount
and follow through.

1254
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,530
How much are you going to pay?

1255
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,170
- We should get the clothes.
- Of course.

1256
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:34,000
- Then I'll pay about five dollars.
- We'll agree on an exact amount.

1257
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,070
What?

1258
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,370
You must want to get rid
of some of your money.

1259
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,970
- It's not that.
- I'll pay ten dollars.

1260
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:40,340
I'll pay about two dollars.

1261
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,980
- Two dollars?
- And Hyo Rin?

1262
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,780
That brings us to 17 dollars.

1263
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,020
- How much will you pay?
- About four dollars.

1264
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,220
- Add that to 17 dollars...
- Then you have to pay 9 dollars.

1265
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,450
- Then,
- That's a lot.

1266
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,720
- I'll pay six dollars.
- Six?

1267
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,830
(Angel Hyo Rin offers to pay more.)

1268
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,190
- I won't pay.
- Seok Jin.

1269
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,430
- What?
- I won't pay.

1270
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,030
- That's not allowed.
- Then, I'll pay a dollar.

1271
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,630
- That's not nice.
- Hold on.

1272
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,500
- Se Jong, pay some more.
- I'll pay four dollars.

1273
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,230
Nice. How much was it?
Are you paying six dollars?

1274
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,100
- Yes.
- Pay ten dollars together. And you?

1275
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,410
- I'll pay five dollars.
- We all have to pay.

1276
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,140
- We need 15 dollars more.
- I'll cover 15 dollars.

1277
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,380
- You must have a lot.
- He must have a lot of money.

1278
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,780
He has a lot.

1279
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,110
Shouldn't we stop him from paying?

1280
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,950
I'll pay even more and have
someone receive the penalty.

1281
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,350
- Oh, right.
- So, in fact...

1282
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,880
You'll pay 15 dollars. You'll pay 5.

1283
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,890
- You won't pay any.
- Four dollars and then six.

1284
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,520
- That means I don't have to pay.
- Listen to this.

1285
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,020
Going over 30 dollars will result
in someone receiving a penalty.

1286
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,060
- Okay.
- That's true.

1287
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,260
We need to pay the exact amount.

1288
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,130
- Five dollars?
- I'll pay five dollars.

1289
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,460
- Four dollars and six.
- I won't pay.

1290
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,830
- What about me?
- You'll pay 15 dollars.

1291
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,400
- Shall we?
- Sure.

1292
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,430
Let's go, one by one.

1293
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,070
No funny business, Jae Seok.

1294
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,030
Of course not.

1295
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,470
I'm good as long as I don't
get the penalty.

1296
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,570
(Jae Seok,
who's ranked in the middle,)

1297
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,910
(agreed to pay 5 dollars.)

1298
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,040
I'm sorry.

1299
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,140
(He'll stay in the middle
if he pays the agreed amount.)

1300
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,350
We should go off the rails
from the very beginning.

1301
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,280
I'll pay five dollars.

1302
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,920
(He pays 5 dollars as agreed)

1303
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,920
We're going to have to do
a lot of thinking today.

1304
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,260
(Seok Sam, who's in last place,
agreed to pay nothing.)

1305
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,590
I won't pay anything.

1306
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,230
(I won't pay.)

1307
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,460
I can't.

1308
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,070
(He didn't pay anything,
but he still has the lowest amount.)

1309
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,800
The others don't have
a lot of money.

1310
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,270
(Ssaebssaeb agreed
to pay 15 dollars.)

1311
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,740
For now,
I need to feel out the others.

1312
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:17,970
That's how I'll begin the race.

1313
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,380
Let's see if Se Jong and Hyo Rin
like to shake things up.

1314
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,480
- Se Jong, you're up.
- Sure.

1315
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,650
(Only the two guests remain
for Team Jae Seok.)

1316
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:28,520
Do we have to pay the amount
that we agreed on earlier?

1317
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,720
No.

1318
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,560
(Se Jong,
who's shy on variety shows,)

1319
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,790
(actually asked a question?)

1320
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:37,590
I need to be able
to rank in the middle, right?

1321
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,200
Will we have more chances later on?

1322
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,530
You'll have other chances
to spend your money.

1323
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:45,570
In that case,
I'll save my money for now.

1324
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,070
(Did the two easygoing guests
keep their promise?)

1325
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,780
I don't have a lot of money
and would rather not spend it.

1326
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,480
- I don't have a lot.
- Just so you know,

1327
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,150
- we need to spend the exact amount.
- That's right.

1328
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,650
- Of course.
- That way...

1329
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,650
- Who wants to spend a lot?
- I'd like to spend some money.

1330
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,690
- Really?
- Yes.

1331
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:03,850
- I'd like to spend some money.
- Really?

1332
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,320
- Yes.
- How about 30 dollars?

1333
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,060
- Why don't I...
- Are you willing to spend 30?

1334
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,820
- We don't have to pay, then.
- Let's get the nice clothes.

1335
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,160
- Let's get the nice ones.
- Are you okay with 30 dollars?

1336
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,200
Are you really okay
paying 30 dollars?

1337
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,760
I need to spend my money.

1338
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,930
- He needs to spend money.
- Right.

1339
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,570
Yo Han's the one with 90 dollars.

1340
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,670
Totally.

1341
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,600
- Yo Han, are you willing to...
- Sure, I'll pay for it all.

1342
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,810
Okay, good.

1343
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,310
That's what we'll agree on.

1344
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,310
How about this instead?

1345
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,380
We'll all agree to that. Okay?

1346
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,540
He's right.

1347
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,380
Spend your money in some other way.

1348
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,850
- Sure.
- For now, we'll agree on this.

1349
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:32,850
- You're buying.
- Sure.

1350
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,850
An additional person...

1351
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:37,090
will receive a penalty if the money
isn't exactly 30 dollars.

1352
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,350
(Yo Han will spend 30 dollars
while the rest spend nothing.)

1353
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,060
(Team Jong Kook will now
spend their money.)

1354
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,090
Here we go.

1355
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,430
(Team Jong Kook will now
spend their money.)

1356
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,690
(Team Jong Kook, Haha: 26 dollars,
Daniel, the median)

1357
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,160
We'll wait and see for now.

1358
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,530
Well, we all agreed on this.

1359
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,170
(Zero)

1360
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,770
(The others pay nothing
without a second thought.)

1361
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:53,840
Do I hand this in?

1362
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,040
Right, okay.

1363
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,070
I'm one to keep my word.

1364
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,280
(Team Jong Kook,
Daniel: 19 dollars, the median)

1365
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,180
(Apart from Yo Han,
they all paid nothing as agreed.)

1366
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,210
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

1367
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:07,820
(Lastly, the rich man enters.)

1368
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,550
(Yo Han, who has 90 dollars,
has to spend a lot of his money.)

1369
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,650
Thank you.

1370
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,520
(Did he only spend
exactly 30 dollars?)

1371
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,760
Don't I get a receipt?

1372
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,260
I bought the clothes.

1373
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,000
- Let's go.
- Sure.

1374
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,970
- Okay.
- What's that mischievous grin?

1375
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,000
- It's nothing.
- What's that mischievous grin?

1376
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,770
- It's nothing.
- Did you spend 50 dollars?

1377
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,610
I wouldn't do that
when we're trying to buy clothes.

1378
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,070
He has 90 dollars in total...

1379
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,170
and needs a way to spend it.

1380
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,880
There's something mischievous
about him right now.

1381
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,980
- You're wrong.
- See?

1382
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,310
- Yo Han...
- I'm just happy to be here.

1383
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:40,550
I wouldn't mess things up
from the very first round.

1384
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:43,490
You've all gone ahead
and made your payments.

1385
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:47,790
Both teams bought
the 30-dollar special edition set.

1386
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,630
Team Jong Kook...

1387
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:54,030
- should have paid 30 dollars.
- What?

1388
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,230
(Should have?)

1389
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,630
Are you kidding me?

1390
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,730
- Wait. Who broke their word?
- Hold on.

1391
00:44:58,730 --> 00:44:59,800
You've got to be kidding.

1392
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,470
The amount you paid
was exactly 30 dollars,

1393
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:04,270
so no one will receive a penalty.

1394
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,080
(The loyal Yo Han
only paid 30 dollars as promised!)

1395
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,910
- Nice.
- See?

1396
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,610
- You didn't serve any twists.
- I almost questioned you.

1397
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,050
- I wouldn't do that.
- You kept your word.

1398
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:13,480
I'm worried about our team.

1399
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,720
- What if we paid more or less?
- Team Jae Seok...

1400
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,690
also agreed to buy
the 30-dollar uniform set.

1401
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,260
(Apart from the guests,
everyone paid the agreed amount.)

1402
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,630
You should've paid
30 dollars in total.

1403
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:25,630
What?

1404
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,330
But only 27.5 dollars was paid.

1405
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,770
- What?
- Who was it?

1406
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,440
(One of the two paid less.)

1407
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,640
Why didn't you pay
what we agreed on?

1408
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,370
You should've paid
what we agreed on.

1409
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:40,540
This is scary. I totally get it now.

1410
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,580
- Hey.
- Why didn't you pay?

1411
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,640
- Who paid in 50-cent increments?
- I paid four dollars.

1412
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,610
- Hyo Rin, was it you?
- Of course not.

1413
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,250
- Se Jong, was it you?
- I paid exactly four dollars.

1414
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,720
Did you pay four dollars?
What about you?

1415
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,120
- I paid 6 dollars.
- Are you sure you paid 6?

1416
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,450
Who of the two...

1417
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,020
Why would you not even pay
what we agreed on?

1418
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,160
(One of the two is lying.)

1419
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,190
Yang Se Jong, you.

1420
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,990
- If it's one of you two...
- I think it was you.

1421
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:58,860
- It was Jae Seok.
- No, it was him.

1422
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,460
- It was Jae Seok.
- You've got to be kidding me.

1423
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:04,470
(The agreed amount,
Se Jong: 4 dollars)

1424
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,740
(The agreed amount,
Hyo Rin: 6 dollars)

1425
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,570
(Who paid 1.5 dollars?)

1426
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:14,080
(It was Se Jong.)

1427
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,410
Can I pay in 50-cent increments?

1428
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,110
Only in whole dollars
or 50-cent increments.

1429
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,480
I'll pay 1.5 dollars.

1430
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,520
(Se Jong thought he had less money
than everyone else...)

1431
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,150
(and decided to save his.)

1432
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,790
(He betrayed everyone
with that innocent face of his.)

1433
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,350
Who paid in 50-cent increments?

1434
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,820
I paid 15 dollars,
like I said I would.

1435
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,330
That means one of you
will receive a penalty today.

1436
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,060
If only one of you gets the penalty,

1437
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,800
it'll be whoever has
the least money.

1438
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,430
If two people receive the penalty,

1439
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,870
it'll be the ones
with the highest and lowest amounts.

1440
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,270
- The highest?
- Yes.

1441
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,210
If three people receive the penalty,

1442
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,280
the third will be the one
with the biggest gap...

1443
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,640
from the median.

1444
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,110
- No way.
- Got it.

1445
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:53,250
Why did we have to lose this round
for being just 1.5 dollars short?

1446
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,180
I don't get it, that's all.

1447
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,150
They could've paid a lot more
if they'd had money to spend.

1448
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:58,650
I just don't get why someone
wouldn't pay enough.

1449
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,820
(Se Jong's conscience
is eating at him.)

1450
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,730
Now that the first round
of spending is over,

1451
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,060
we'll reveal
each team's median amount.

1452
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,360
- Nice.
- The median amount.

1453
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,000
- We won't tell you who...
- This is good.

1454
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,400
- but just the amount.
- This is something we need.

1455
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,040
You can't show your happiness.

1456
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,700
- You should stay calm.
- Be expressionless.

1457
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,440
The median amount
for Team Jae Seok...

1458
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,180
is 33 dollars.

1459
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,410
(Jae Seok was able to hold
the median position.)

1460
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:23,480
Did she say 33 dollars?

1461
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,850
(Seok Sam, having the lowest amount,
is at risk of a penalty.)

1462
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:26,880
(Team Jae Seok,
Jae Seok: 33 dollars, the median)

1463
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,920
That's quite a lot.

1464
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,050
The median amount
for Team Jong Kook...

1465
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,160
is 19 dollars.

1466
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:36,230
(Daniel was also able
to hold his position too.)

1467
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,760
(Yo Han still has the most,
even though he spent 30 dollars.)

1468
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,330
That isn't a lot.

1469
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:43,400
Kang Woo and Daniel
who have chance cards...

1470
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,330
- can go ahead...
- No way.

1471
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,700
- They're at a huge advantage.
- and use them.

1472
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,910
You need that.
Having a chance card is huge.

1473
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:52,440
By using the chance card,
you could shift...

1474
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,980
- the median amount.
- Of course.

1475
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,040
How can you when you don't know
how much the others have?

1476
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,280
- But...
- Don't you think the two of us...

1477
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,350
will be able to shift it?

1478
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,450
(Daniel has to keep holding
the median amount.)

1479
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,180
Do you have a lot of money?

1480
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,920
- The median amount.
- I'm practically broke.

1481
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,890
(Daniel is the first to cash in
his chance card.)

1482
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:09,560
I'm the one with 19 dollars.

1483
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:10,890
I have 19 dollars.

1484
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,130
What do I do?

1485
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,930
Let me think.
The uniform was 30 dollars,

1486
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,470
and lunch will be 20 dollars
or something.

1487
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:20,300
I'll need some money to spend.

1488
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,140
(Chance Card: 11 dollars)

1489
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,970
I'll go up to 30 dollars.

1490
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,080
(He gives himself 11 dollars
to prepare for future games.)

1491
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,910
I'll go up to 30 dollars
and spend some of it.

1492
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,550
Let me see.

1493
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,780
Will I be adding money
to the amount I have?

1494
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,950
- That's right. This amount?
- You can add or subtract.

1495
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,590
I'm broke.

1496
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,090
(I'm broke.)

1497
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,120
Then...

1498
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,530
(Let's get a taste of money.)

1499
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,960
So it begins.

1500
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,160
No one should notice, right?

1501
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,330
(How much will Kang Woo get?)

1502
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,370
(Chance Card: 42 dollars)

1503
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:51,470
Let's get about that much.

1504
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,100
I need money for lunch.

1505
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:57,440
(He added a large amount,
but Yo Han still has more.)

1506
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,580
The two of them
cashed in their chance cards.

1507
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:04,480
You'll now head out
to get some lunch.

1508
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,420
- Let's spend some money!
- We'll head to one of the places...

1509
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,120
that was recommended...

1510
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,550
- by the guests.
- Really?

1511
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,850
They must've wanted a certain dish.

1512
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,720
- Will we go to different places?
- They like sundaeguk.

1513
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,890
Team Jae Seok will have
Se Jong's favorite, which is...

1514
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:18,760
fermented skate
and steamed pork with kimchi.

1515
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,560
(Taem Jae Seok will have
what Se Jong loves.)

1516
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,030
Hold on a second.

1517
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,870
Just now,
I was thinking to myself...

1518
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:27,600
about what kind of food
Se Jong and Hyo Rin would like.

1519
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,040
Fermented skate
and steamed pork with kimchi?

1520
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,540
His mouth is watering.

1521
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,240
Se Jong, are you sure
you want that for lunch?

1522
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,340
Fermented skate
and steamed pork with kimchi? Why?

1523
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,740
That seems to heavy for lunch.

1524
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,910
Well, you see...

1525
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,880
- Did you make a deal earlier?
- Yes.

1526
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,150
- Of course.
- But that dish for lunch?

1527
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,690
- Is it a dish you like?
- I'm loving his character.

1528
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,520
- Fermented skate...
- Do you enjoy it?

1529
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,290
I can't eat the liver
or intestines yet.

1530
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:50,060
I haven't been able to try those.

1531
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,990
- But with kimchi...
- However,

1532
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,930
I enjoy fully fermented skate.

1533
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,730
- Really?
- It's a dish he must love.

1534
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,500
- He's a huge fan of it.
- He loves it.

1535
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,370
He's really into fermented skate.

1536
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:02,900
As for Team Jong Kook...

1537
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,110
Lately, Yo Han has been...

1538
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:08,010
only eating poke bowls
because of his diet.

1539
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,780
- Poke bowls? Not bad.
- I like poke bowls.

1540
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,610
- I like poke bowls.
- I like that.

1541
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:13,720
- You can add a lot of protein.
- Nice.

1542
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,550
- It reminds me of Hawaii. Nice.
- You can add a lot.

1543
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:17,920
Haha doesn't look so happy.

1544
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:21,120
- Oh, Haha. Poke bowls.
- Poke bowls.

1545
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,220
- Poke bowls are good.
- You really don't look like...

1546
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,360
a poke bowl kind of guy.

1547
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:26,160
It's nice if you add some raw fish.

1548
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,160
- It's a clean meal.
- It's fine.

1549
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,330
- Yes, you can...
- Okay, then.

1550
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,800
- Get changed, and let's move.
- Gosh, seriously.

1551
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,700
- Yes.
- Okay!

1552
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,240
How much is it? Just tell me that.

1553
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,610
- Just tell me.
- Haha.

1554
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:38,510
I'll tell you later.

1555
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,540
- Later.
- How much is it?

1556
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,110
I like fermented skate
and steamed pork with kimchi.

1557
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,910
But I've never had it
for lunch before.

1558
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,110
Se Jong, do you have any siblings?

1559
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,520
I'm an only child.

1560
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,520
- I see.
- Yes.

1561
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,790
You have an only-child vibe.

1562
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,850
You sort of give off that vibe.

1563
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:54,390
- What about you, Hyo Rin?
- I have an older sister.

1564
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:55,420
She's five years older...

1565
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,460
- than me. Yes.
- Five years older?

1566
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,460
How do you feel around your sister?

1567
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,790
Do you feel awkward
after a long time apart?

1568
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,630
Well, no. Not with my sister.

1569
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,970
- Not with your sister.
- Is it awkward with your parents?

1570
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:07,600
With my parents... Sometimes?

1571
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,670
- You feel awkward?
- It's sometimes awkward?

1572
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,070
- Sometimes.
- Do you speak formally...

1573
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,110
or casually with your parents?

1574
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,740
- I speak casually,
- Yes?

1575
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:16,510
- but sometimes, with my dad...
- It's awkward with your dad?

1576
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:18,710
- You speak formally?
- Yes, I sometimes do.

1577
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:21,220
Then, how does your dad react?

1578
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,420
Does he just go like,
"There she goes again?"

1579
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,620
Yes,
I think my family understands me...

1580
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,560
- for the most part.
- I'm sure.

1581
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,890
Se Jong,
what kind of son are you at home?

1582
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:32,660
Well, I am...

1583
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,400
My mother mostly calls me...

1584
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,500
to say that she needs money.

1585
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,900
(Se Jong is so honest.)

1586
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,500
So,
that's the kind of dynamic you have.

1587
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,010
"Son."
That's what my mom sounds like.

1588
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:47,280
Then, I go, "What? Why?"

1589
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:48,910
I know how that goes.

1590
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,780
So, do you give her lots of
spending money? What is it like?

1591
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,520
I give her just the right amount.

1592
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,550
- But that right amount...
- Not too much.

1593
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,320
- is just your own standard.
- Not too much.

1594
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,890
That's because the month after that
or in the future,

1595
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:04,590
- if I give her too much before...
- Right.

1596
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:05,890
- Yes.
- Sometimes, you have to...

1597
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:07,700
slam on the brakes too.

1598
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,760
- If you give them a lot...
- The brakes...

1599
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,700
- Yes, you have to hit the brakes.
- Se Hyeong and I...

1600
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,600
sometimes hit the brakes
really hard.

1601
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,240
- "Mom, this isn't right!"
- Right.

1602
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,440
"Think about it.
We don't make money easily."

1603
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,440
That's right.

1604
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,180
- Then, Mom goes, "Right."
- You're right about that.

1605
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,650
"I went overboard."

1606
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:24,810
(Feeling awkward)

1607
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:25,810
"Sorry."

1608
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:28,380
I hit the brakes hard too.

1609
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:31,020
(Suddenly slamming on the brakes)

1610
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,920
I guess you slam on the brakes
harder than I thought.

1611
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,120
Well...

1612
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,320
- I'm firm.
- You run a tight ship.

1613
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,630
I'm very firm. I don't budge
on things I don't approve of.

1614
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,130
- Do you clearly say no?
- I do.

1615
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,500
- That's better than false hope.
- You have to do that.

1616
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,260
But it does weigh on my mind.

1617
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,970
- Of course it does.
- I'm sure.

1618
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:45,700
- Yes, so...
- Oh, what's that?

1619
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,800
- Is that...
- Oh, there it is.

1620
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,370
- This is a famous place.
- Fermented skate and steamed pork.

1621
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:49,400
- Oh, steamed pork.
- Steamed pork.

1622
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,340
- Skate, steamed pork, jokbal.
- Seok Jin, you can eat here.

1623
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,480
Gosh, it's been a while,

1624
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,910
but we'll get to eat the fermented
skate combo lunch thanks to you.

1625
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,610
It's been about 3 or 4 years
since I've had this.

1626
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,350
- They sell webfoot octopus too.
- Thank you.

1627
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,880
I can smell it. My goodness.

1628
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,980
We've prepared fermented skate
with steamed pork and kimchi,

1629
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,250
which Se Jong often enjoys.

1630
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,560
Enjoy the meal, and on your way out,

1631
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,530
you just have to pay for your meal.

1632
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:12,990
- Gosh, it does look good.
- Seok Jin.

1633
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,600
- Look at that.
- The color itself...

1634
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,630
- looks delicious.
- Gosh, the smell is pungent.

1635
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,770
- It looks mild.
- Thank you.

1636
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:21,270
Gosh, that's pungent.

1637
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,140
(Gulping)

1638
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,510
So, how do you eat this combo?
Do you dip it in sesame oil?

1639
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:27,380
- All right. So, this combo...
- I know.

1640
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,010
Jae Seok, you know
how experts eat this, right?

1641
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:31,650
- They just take this on its own...
- Do they just eat it on its own?

1642
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:34,250
- That's right.
- They just eat it with chojang.

1643
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,550
- Right.
- Hey, you should try it.

1644
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,150
(How experts eat fermented skate:
only fermented skate and chojang)

1645
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,720
(Strongly agreeing)

1646
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,260
- All right. I'll give it a try.
- Shall we all try it?

1647
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,290
(Jae Seok, who enjoys fermented
skate quite a bit, goes first.)

1648
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:43,490
- Oh, indeed.
- My goodness.

1649
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:47,430
Gosh, I bet that stings your nose.
How is it?

1650
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:49,430
Well, that guy is pretty much...

1651
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:51,230
- in the same group as skates.
- This is...

1652
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:55,000
- It's all right. This is...
- Yes, it's okay.

1653
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,070
- It's not too fermented.
- Back in the day...

1654
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,610
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1655
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,510
(It cleared his sinuses.)

1656
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,640
- That's nice.
- Is it okay?

1657
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,180
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1658
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,780
Thank you for the food.

1659
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,650
- How is it, Jae Seok?
- My goodness.

1660
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,090
You must like fermented skate.
You're eating it right away.

1661
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,750
- Is it okay? Does it sting?
- It's delicious.

1662
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:15,460
- Gosh, since it's been a while...
- Does it sting?

1663
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:16,690
(Adding a piece of meat)

1664
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,390
It's not too strong.

1665
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,130
No, it's not too strong.

1666
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,500
(Adding a piece of kimchi)

1667
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:24,470
Like this. You have to eat
all three as a combo.

1668
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,370
Oh, the triple combo.

1669
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:32,070
(Hyo Rin, who isn't used to eating
fermented skate, tries the combo.)

1670
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,540
Seok Jin, how does it taste?

1671
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:35,380
It hits you at the end.

1672
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,510
(Savoring the taste)

1673
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:37,680
You have to eat it like this.

1674
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,710
- Hyo Rin, you're eating well.
- Am I?

1675
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,320
(Hyo Rin is eating it
better than they expected.)

1676
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,790
- But the smell...
- Does it have a strong smell?

1677
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:44,990
(Se Chan hasn't had it in a while,
but he goes for the pure taste.)

1678
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,090
I think it's similar.

1679
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,560
- It's slightly less. The pork is...
- Gosh, that's good.

1680
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,590
Eat the fermented skate first.
Why are you going for the pork?

1681
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:55,060
Come on. I can have it as a combo.

1682
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,500
- The triple combo.
- It's not too strong.

1683
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,600
(A piece of kimchi)

1684
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,370
(A piece of fermented skate)

1685
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:03,070
You have to dip it in this.

1686
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,210
(Some water parsley)

1687
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,470
You have to eat it like this.

1688
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,210
(Some spinach)

1689
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:10,510
(He adds a bit of everything
to make it smell as little as possible.)

1690
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,250
(How will it taste?)

1691
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,420
Gosh, this is great.

1692
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,520
(How will it taste?)

1693
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,020
Hey, this is tasty.

1694
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,620
- It's not bad.
- It hits you at the end.

1695
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:26,360
(The smell hit him.)

1696
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,900
It hits you at the end.

1697
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,130
- At the end, it hits you hard.
- My gosh.

1698
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:32,270
It hit me all at once.

1699
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:34,670
It hits you at the end.

1700
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,710
(Coughing)

1701
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,140
(Almost gagging)

1702
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,270
(Gasping for air)

1703
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,810
You don't think this is strong?

1704
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,640
I think it's just right.

1705
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,250
(It suits
Se Jong's tastes perfectly.)

1706
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,410
- You're good at eating this.
- Se Jong, do you like it?

1707
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:47,520
Yes, it's delicious.

1708
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,880
He's only eating the skate.

1709
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,150
It's good,
but I feel bad for you guys.

1710
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,690
Hey, some pieces are...

1711
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:57,260
- stronger than others.
- But it does taste good.

1712
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,790
But really,
fermented skate for lunch...

1713
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,560
- I've never had it before.
- is a first for me.

1714
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,500
You usually eat fermented skate
for dinner for some reason.

1715
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,870
Only experts eat fermented skate
for lunch.

1716
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:09,140
- This has...
- The meat is good.

1717
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,470
a certain charm
when you keep eating it.

1718
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:13,340
But this is...

1719
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,040
I get why people get hooked.

1720
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:18,150
Se Jong is quietly eating well.

1721
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:19,250
This is good.

1722
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,650
So, this is what
fermented skate tastes like.

1723
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,890
Hey, this restaurant has great food.

1724
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,120
My goodness.

1725
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,260
Hey, I can see you really like
fermented skate.

1726
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,890
You really do.

1727
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:30,430
Here comes something else.
It's makguksu.

1728
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:31,460
Oh, my.

1729
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:33,030
My goodness.

1730
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,800
Here come the noodles.

1731
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,100
Gosh, this green onion jeon
looks incredible.

1732
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,530
Hey, it looks like pizza.

1733
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:43,870
(He takes a bite of
the freshly served, hot jeon.)

1734
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:45,410
- It's good, isn't it?
- Yes.

1735
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:46,540
Gosh, this is...

1736
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,910
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1737
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:48,910
(Crispy)

1738
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:51,410
- There's some sauce too.
- Oh, right.

1739
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,150
It's good, isn't it?

1740
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,920
(The noodle lover slurps up
the makguksu.)

1741
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,190
- It's good, isn't it?
- Yes.

1742
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:00,220
- Gosh, this is...
- Hey, this is much better.

1743
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,320
- The others are having poke bowls.
- Right.

1744
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,390
Would they have this stuff...

1745
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:05,860
- at a poke restaurant?
- They wouldn't.

1746
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,300
- Right?
- I'm sure Haha is hating it.

1747
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,070
The fermented skate combo
is much better than that.

1748
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,500
(Meanwhile, Team Jong Kook...)

1749
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,000
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1750
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,370
Thank you for the food.

1751
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:17,810
- Yo Han, do you really eat this...
- Hey, this is good.

1752
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,010
every morning?

1753
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,710
I try to have a poke bowl
for one meal a day, at least.

1754
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,440
- That's great. Really.
- Yes.

1755
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,480
I have a protein shake
for breakfast,

1756
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,610
and for lunch, after working out,

1757
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,280
- I have this with added protein.
- Of course.

1758
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,720
Why? Are you on a diet?

1759
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,250
- Yes, because of a project.
- I see.

1760
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,720
Before working out,
you should have some carbs.

1761
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,890
Then, after you work out,

1762
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:35,290
it's good to eat something clean
with protein like this.

1763
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,390
- Yes.
- My goodness.

1764
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:39,590
You can eat plenty
as long as you work out intensely.

1765
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,260
You burn everything you eat
if you work out a lot.

1766
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,530
You burn it all off.

1767
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:45,370
This is nice and neat.

1768
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,100
- Try the salmon.
- But this is...

1769
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,500
- This is good.
- What is...

1770
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,910
- It's so good.
- Are you enjoying it?

1771
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:55,280
(A meal for the testosterone-fueled guys
who care about their health)

1772
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:58,080
Hey, poke bowls are tasty.

1773
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:00,110
I wish there were a restaurant
like this near my house.

1774
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,920
But when I'm really short on time,
I eat a burger. Is that okay?

1775
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,590
A burger isn't bad. That has...

1776
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,860
It has a good amount of protein.

1777
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,400
(Picking at his food)

1778
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,500
(Mr. Free Meals seems so dejected,
unlike his usual self.)

1779
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,100
It has a good amount of protein.

1780
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,410
(Pouring in the sauce)

1781
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:26,010
(Getting every last drop)

1782
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:27,910
Okay, this is so healthy.

1783
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,780
(Trying to convince himself,
Totally oblivious)

1784
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,720
Hey, this is good quality meat.

1785
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,720
Yo Han, do you really eat this...

1786
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,420
(His reactions have disappeared.)

1787
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,320
Does anyone want the rest
of my sauce?

1788
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,530
I would love that.

1789
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:47,530
(Getting a refill on sauce)

1790
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,400
(He added two servings of sauce...)

1791
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,140
(and tries to sound excited.)

1792
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,140
(Feeling bad for him)

1793
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:00,680
Is the other team eating
fermented skate right now?

1794
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:03,380
- Yes.
- Fermented skate.

1795
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:04,710
(Laughing)

1796
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,050
- I can't imagine that.
- Gosh, those guys...

1797
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,520
The set over there
must be really smelly.

1798
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,020
Gosh, I'm full.

1799
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,790
(Despite Team Jong Kook's worries,
they're enjoying their meal.)

1800
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,960
So far, the food you've ordered...

1801
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,790
is exactly 100 dollars
at the price set for the staff.

1802
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:20,160
- That's what you'll have to pay.
- Did you say 100 dollars?

1803
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,900
- We're in trouble.
- We should each pay 20 dollars.

1804
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,770
If you pay the exact amount
of 100 dollars this time,

1805
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,430
no one else will have to
get the penalty.

1806
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:29,370
If you pay too much or too little,

1807
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:31,310
two members from your team
will get the penalty.

1808
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:33,170
In that case, the members with
the highest and lowest amounts...

1809
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,510
will get the penalty.

1810
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:36,240
- That's what I mean.
- Hey, but right now,

1811
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,710
- the people in the middle...
- Let's just pay the exact amount.

1812
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,820
- The median was 33 dollars.
- Yes, 33 dollars.

1813
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,450
But would that person pay a lot?

1814
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,390
- Of course not.
- So, we're already going to fail.

1815
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:46,150
- That person won't pay.
- But that person...

1816
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,890
Seriously, I don't know who it is,
but that person should get ready...

1817
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:50,530
to get whipped in the legs
wearing nothing but underpants.

1818
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:51,760
I don't know who it is.

1819
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:55,130
But Seok Jin,
someone has a lot of money, right?

1820
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,630
As long as that person pays
a big chunk of money,

1821
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,070
we'll be able to pay 100 dollars.

1822
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,370
Let's pay.

1823
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:02,970
Paying 100 dollars is better
than having a person...

1824
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:03,970
- That's right.
- receive the penalty.

1825
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:07,580
Even if 33 dollars is in the middle,
that person will need to pay.

1826
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:08,610
- Of course.
- That person will need to pay.

1827
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:09,980
- That person will need to pay.
- The rankings will change.

1828
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,850
Otherwise, the amount will be
in first place.

1829
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:15,450
So, we need to pay no matter what.

1830
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:17,520
- The current moment is important.
- Right.

1831
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,420
Before we do that,
let's find out who didn't pay...

1832
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,790
and put the matter at rest.

1833
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,490
Who didn't pay?
Let's go over this first.

1834
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,490
(Se Jong broke his promise and paid
1.50 dollars instead of 4 dollars.)

1835
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,860
(Blinking)

1836
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,500
- I paid less.
- You paid less.

1837
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,000
- Who paid 50 cents?
- I didn't pay 50 cents.

1838
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,730
Why did you pay less, Se Jong?

1839
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,140
I didn't have much money.

1840
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,370
- Really?
- Yes.

1841
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,070
That was why I paid less.

1842
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:39,010
I paid 2 dollars
instead of 4 dollars.

1843
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:42,310
(I paid 2 dollars
instead of 4 dollars.)

1844
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:43,410
- Really?
- Did you pay two dollars?

1845
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:44,480
Then it was you.

1846
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,510
Then who was behind 50 cents?

1847
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:46,550
- Who was it?
- I didn't pay 50 cents.

1848
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,450
- Then it was you.
- Then who was behind 50 cents?

1849
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:50,920
- Who was it?
- I didn't pay 50 cents.

1850
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,760
(Confused)

1851
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,090
I didn't pay 50 cents.

1852
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:57,190
(Brazen)

1853
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,360
Really?

1854
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:01,000
- Did you pay four dollars?
- Why did you chuckle?

1855
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,260
It wasn't me.

1856
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,700
- Did you pay 5.50 dollars?
- It really wasn't me.

1857
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:07,640
- Was it you?
- Then why did you chuckle?

1858
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:08,870
Just because.

1859
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,740
It really wasn't me.

1860
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:12,410
It was you.

1861
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,240
- It was you.
- Hyo Rin, it was you.

1862
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,440
I'm serious.

1863
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,410
It really wasn't me.

1864
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:19,850
- I'm serious.
- Then we're short of 50 cents.

1865
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:22,250
- I don't know if I trust Jae Seok.
- I paid five dollars.

1866
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,350
You paid five dollars.

1867
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:24,650
- Fifteen dollars. Twenty dollars.
- Twenty dollars.

1868
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:25,920
- He paid 2 dollars.
- Then it was 22 dollars.

1869
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,090
- It was 22 dollars.
- I paid 2 dollars.

1870
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:28,460
- You said you'd pay six dollars.
- Then...

1871
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,490
- she paid 5.50 dollars.
- No, I paid 6 dollars.

1872
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:32,530
- No.
- Be honest. We'll forgive you.

1873
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:34,730
I seriously paid six dollars.

1874
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,530
- Really?
- Yes, I'm serious.

1875
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:37,700
- Do you swear?
- I swear.

1876
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,430
- I don't believe it.
- Then who was behind 50 cents?

1877
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:40,670
Who was behind 50 cents?

1878
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,740
Paying 50 cents less is so cheap.

1879
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,840
Yang Se Jong!

1880
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,370
You paid 1.50 dollars, right?

1881
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:46,840
(You paid 1.50 dollars, right?)

1882
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,940
- What?
- You paid 1.50 dollars.

1883
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,210
What's wrong with him? Hey!

1884
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:50,380
(What?)

1885
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,480
What's wrong with him? Hey!

1886
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,580
- He's weird.
- Se Jong.

1887
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:53,680
- I mean, why...
- Why...

1888
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,020
(Oh, my.)

1889
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,350
- I mean, why...
- Why...

1890
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:58,520
- Why did you lie?
- He's weird.

1891
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,090
- Hold on.
- Okay.

1892
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:01,190
(Clearing his throat)

1893
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,620
I paid 1.50 dollars.

1894
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,030
(I paid 1.50 dollars.)

1895
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:05,690
- It was you.
- Listen.

1896
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:07,460
I was at fault. I'm sorry.

1897
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,430
It's okay. It was your choice.

1898
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:11,170
- Hyo Rin, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1899
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,900
- I'm sorry.
- We caught the culprit.

1900
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,370
- Seriously.
- Please don't misunderstand.

1901
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,370
The interrogation was so intense
that I became flustered.

1902
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:18,870
We needed to know
who was responsible last time.

1903
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:20,480
- That's right.
- Let's make it happen this time.

1904
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,680
- Let's put in an effort.
- Let's do it this once.

1905
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,980
- Jae Seok.
- Seriously.

1906
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,180
I'll pay ten dollars.

1907
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,850
- Pay 10 dollars.
- Okay. Pay 10 dollars.

1908
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:28,320
- I'll pay 25 dollars.
- Pay 25 dollars.

1909
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,720
Can you pay 25 dollars?

1910
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,020
I can do it. I'll pay 25 dollars.

1911
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,590
Then you and I will pay 50 dollars.

1912
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,260
- I'll pay 24 dollars.
- We have a lot of money.

1913
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,760
You'll pay 24 dollars.
In that case, I...

1914
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:39,460
- Jae Seok, pay 16 dollars.
- I'll pay 16 dollars.

1915
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:41,160
- Do you have that much?
- We're set.

1916
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,400
I can barely meet that amount.

1917
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,170
We'll pay the amount
for real, right?

1918
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:46,200
- Let's do that.
- Exactly 100 dollars, right?

1919
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,170
That way, we won't get
another penalty taker.

1920
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,800
- Okay.
- Paying the exact amount...

1921
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,940
- is worth it.
- I'll pay ten dollars.

1922
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,240
- Make sure you do that.
- If the amount isn't 100 dollars,

1923
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,280
- I won't sit still.
- That shouldn't happen.

1924
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:56,740
I'll be back.

1925
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:58,980
It won't take long.

1926
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:04,090
I'll pay 25 dollars.

1927
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,750
How much do you have?

1928
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:06,790
I have 13 dollars.

1929
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:08,720
(I have 13 dollars.)

1930
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:09,720
(Currently, Seok Jin has
the lowest amount of money.)

1931
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:10,890
I was bluffing.

1932
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,230
I wanted to throw them off.

1933
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:15,060
I can't pay at all at this point.

1934
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,130
(I can't pay at all at this point.)

1935
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,900
(Team Jae Seok,
Jae Seok: 33 dollars, the median)

1936
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,100
I'll pay this much.

1937
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,870
(He pays 0 dollars
this time as well.)

1938
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:23,370
(Seok Jin's betrayal
breaks the promise already.)

1939
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,910
Still, a promise is a promise.

1940
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:27,510
(They now need to aim
to come in the middle.)

1941
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,110
(Except for Se Jong,
who keeps his promise belatedly)

1942
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,480
I'll pay...

1943
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,480
I'll pay 26 dollars.

1944
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,880
(Everyone uses a strategy...)

1945
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,290
I'll pay 30 dollars.

1946
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:40,450
(to enter the middle realm.)

1947
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,120
People with money
must've paid a lot.

1948
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:49,060
(He needs to spend
anywhere between 16 and 20 dollars.)

1949
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:54,770
This much.

1950
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:57,940
(Jae Seok pays.)

1951
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,510
I won't place first, will I?

1952
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,340
Hey, Jae Seok...

1953
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,310
The way he's grunting
is already suspicious.

1954
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:07,010
All right.

1955
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,850
- It'll work this time.
- All right, everyone.

1956
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:11,120
You've finished paying.

1957
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:14,090
It's a surprising result.

1958
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,160
- I'll give you the median amount.
- Okay. How much is it?

1959
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,590
The median amount is...

1960
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:22,230
seventeen dollars.

1961
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,630
Seriously, you guys are too much.

1962
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:27,840
(How about Jae Seok, who had
the median amount before?)

1963
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:29,900
(Second place)

1964
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,940
Seventeen dollars.

1965
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,140
Hold on.

1966
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:35,210
It looks like the person
with 33 dollars didn't pay at all.

1967
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,340
Isn't that right?

1968
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:38,250
- That person didn't pay.
- I'll pay five dollars.

1969
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,580
The calculations don't make sense.
The person with 33 dollars...

1970
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,980
The middle one must be
very surprised too.

1971
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,120
(He lost the median amount
by being cheap.)

1972
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,820
- Are you flustered?
- Hey, 33 dollars...

1973
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,090
- Are you flustered?
- Are you flustered?

1974
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:48,460
- What?
- The middle one.

1975
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,290
- Is the median amount 17 dollars?
- Yes.

1976
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:52,290
- The median amount is 17 dollars.
- It's 17 dollars.

1977
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:54,500
- Okay.
- You paid...

1978
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,200
- seventy-one dollars.
- Come on.

1979
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,730
(Total amount paid: 71 dollars)

1980
01:04:58,370 --> 01:04:59,900
- Really?
- You guys are too much.

1981
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,040
- Thus,
- You guys are too much.

1982
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,370
two people will receive the penalty.

1983
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,870
Now, the members with the highest
and lowest amounts....

1984
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:07,410
- Yes.
- will receive the penalty.

1985
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:09,380
- The highest and lowest amount.
- The highest and lowest amount.

1986
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,010
We should pay just a little bit.

1987
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,980
Only three of us will survive.

1988
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:15,750
For a chance card...

1989
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,720
- to get the median amount,
- That sounds good.

1990
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,650
you'll play Find the Initials.

1991
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:20,920
- Find the Initials?
- Yes.

1992
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,520
When I give you an initial,
find and bring an object...

1993
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,230
that starts with it.

1994
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:26,460
(Find and bring an object
that starts with the initial.)

1995
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,560
If I give you giyeok,

1996
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,160
- bring me a bag...
- Scissors.

1997
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,970
- or scissors.
- Scissors.

1998
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,140
If you're 1st, you get 5 points.

1999
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,140
If you're 2nd, you get 4 points.

2000
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:38,270
If you're 3rd, you get 3 points.

2001
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:39,740
You'll play a total of three rounds.

2002
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:42,410
Only the first place
will receive the chance card.

2003
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:44,710
Only the first place
will receive it.

2004
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:48,480
I'll give you the first initial.

2005
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,720
- The initial is...
- He has an advantage.

2006
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:52,150
jieut.

2007
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,260
- Jieut.
- Jieut.

2008
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,260
- Then...
- Jieut.

2009
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:56,990
(Find an object
that starts with jieut.)

2010
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:58,730
I'm bad at such games.

2011
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:02,430
(Round 1 initial: Jieut)

2012
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:03,560
(Se Chan spots something!)

2013
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,600
What?

2014
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,730
Does "Electricity" work?

2015
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:06,770
No.

2016
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:08,400
- That isn't electricity.
- That isn't electricity.

2017
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:10,500
Jieut.

2018
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:16,210
Jieut.

2019
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,580
(Hyo Rin spots something!)

2020
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:19,880
Hold on.

2021
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,220
Jieut.

2022
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:26,220
(Se Jong spots a spatula
almost at the same time as Hyo Rin.)

2023
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,220
No!

2024
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:28,420
Chopsticks.

2025
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,420
I got it.

2026
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:32,560
- I have it!
- Hold on.

2027
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:34,360
(The three members
have similar speeds.)

2028
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,200
(Who will place 1st?)

2029
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,470
- Hold on.
- I have it!

2030
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:38,570
- Rice paddle.
- Rice paddle.

2031
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:39,630
- Chopsticks.
- Chopsticks.

2032
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:40,870
- I have it!
- Hold on.

2033
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:44,110
(Hyo Rin gets pushed to the back
despite arriving first.)

2034
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:45,440
- Paper.
- Third place.

2035
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,740
- Third place. It's over.
- Okay.

2036
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,110
- Okay.
- Is it over?

2037
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:49,440
(1st place: Se Jong,
2nd place: Jae Seok, 3rd place: Hyo Rin)

2038
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:50,880
Kettle.

2039
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:52,980
Kettle.

2040
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:55,480
Is there no kettle?

2041
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,080
(There are so many options,
but he only looks for a kettle.)

2042
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,120
Jieut.

2043
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,520
Kitchen scissors.

2044
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:01,590
Jieut.

2045
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:03,220
- Okay.
- Okay.

2046
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,290
- Is it over?
- Okay.

2047
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:05,860
- Which items did you guys bring?
- Thank you.

2048
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:06,960
Rice paddle. What else?

2049
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,100
- Paper.
- I see.

2050
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,300
I didn't think of paper.

2051
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,870
- Me neither. You're good.
- You're a genius.

2052
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:11,970
- Chopsticks.
- Hey.

2053
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:13,700
I could only think of electricity.

2054
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:15,670
This is driving me crazy.

2055
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:18,370
Now, I'll give you
the second initial.

2056
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,170
It's...

2057
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:21,410
(Determined)

2058
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:22,710
It's...

2059
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,780
- digeut.
- Digeut?

2060
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:27,880
- Digeut.
- Digeut?

2061
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,250
(Round 2 initial: Digeut)

2062
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,750
Digeut.

2063
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:33,420
I... Iron.

2064
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,020
(He stomps his feet
without leaving to find an item.)

2065
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:37,260
I...

2066
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:39,330
Leg!

2067
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,430
Leg.
(Jae Seok grabs a leg!)

2068
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,330
Leg.

2069
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,170
- "Leg" counts.
- Okay.

2070
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:46,270
Leg? Seriously?

2071
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:49,270
(1st place, Jae Seok)

2072
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,500
Leg.

2073
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:52,270
(Gasping)

2074
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:53,440
(Se Jong becomes anxious
upon seeing Jae Seok's success.)

2075
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,480
- Hold on.
- Me!

2076
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,640
Solomon's seal tea.

2077
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:59,910
(He moves like a wasp,
but Se Chan is faster.)

2078
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:00,920
That counts.

2079
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,950
(Solomon's seal tea, success)

2080
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:02,980
Second place.

2081
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,750
- Third place remains.
- Let's drink Solomon's seal tea.

2082
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:05,990
- Third place.
- Hey.

2083
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:07,490
(What remains is 3rd place.)

2084
01:08:07,490 --> 01:08:09,190
(Oh, no)

2085
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:14,430
(Hyo Rin finds something
in the fridge!)

2086
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:16,200
(It's too bad.)

2087
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,470
- What is it?
- Packed lunch.

2088
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,370
(She avoids Seok Jin!)

2089
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:21,600
- Packed lunch.
- Packed lunch.

2090
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,670
"Packed lunch" counts.

2091
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:24,770
How is this a packed lunch?
This isn't a packed lunch.

2092
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:26,270
- This isn't a packed lunch.
- Yes, it is.

2093
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,580
Okay.

2094
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:29,110
- In this round,
- The last round.

2095
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:31,010
you've acquired 5, 4, and 3 points
respectively.

2096
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:32,980
- The last round.
- Now comes the last round.

2097
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:34,420
- The last round.
- It'll be fun...

2098
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:35,820
to play the game with the family.

2099
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,220
- You're right.
- The last initial is...

2100
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:40,120
- rieul.
- Rieul?

2101
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,360
- Rieul?
- Rieul.

2102
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,420
Radio?

2103
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:44,120
Ra...

2104
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:45,430
Ramyeon.

2105
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:48,000
Ramyeon. Ra.

2106
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,560
Is there ramyeon?

2107
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:50,870
It's in the kitchen.

2108
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:55,400
(Seok Jin runs to find ramyeon.)

2109
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,400
Where...

2110
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,770
Where is it?

2111
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:00,840
(It's right in front of him,
but he can't find it.)

2112
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,910
Ramyeon.

2113
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:03,740
(Jae Seok belatedly leaves
to find ramyeon.)

2114
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,910
(These 3 look for ramyeon.)

2115
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:07,280
Rieul.

2116
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:10,380
(These two are serious
about the mission.)

2117
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:15,260
(At that moment)

2118
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:19,330
(Hyo Rin finds something
under the counter!)

2119
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:20,900
She found something. Oh, no!

2120
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:21,930
(She found something. Oh, no!)

2121
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,160
Lotion!

2122
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,700
Lotion. First place.

2123
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,200
(Hyo Rin places 1st
for the 1st time!)

2124
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,470
(But if Jae Seok places 2nd or 3rd,
he'll beat her.)

2125
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,670
- Ra.
- Second and third places remain.

2126
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,480
That one.

2127
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:37,340
Ra.

2128
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,610
- Hold on.
- Ra.

2129
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:41,280
- Remote control.
- "Remote control" counts.

2130
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,650
- Ramyeon.
- "Ramyeon" counts.

2131
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:43,950
- "Ramyeon" counts.
- Remote control.

2132
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:44,990
Ramyeon.

2133
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:48,390
(Jae Seok loses to Seok Jin.)

2134
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:51,060
(The game ends
as he stomps his feet anxiously.)

2135
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:53,530
(1st place: Hyo Rin,
2nd place: Se Jong, 3rd place: Seok Jin)

2136
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:54,630
For goodness' sake.

2137
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:56,200
- Four points for Se Jong.
- Yes.

2138
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:58,430
- In 1st place is...
- I found it all 3 times.

2139
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,800
Hyo Rin.

2140
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,270
(1st place, Hyo Rin)

2141
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:04,370
(Final score, 1st place: 11 points
2nd and 3rd places: 9 points)

2142
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:05,540
What's her score?

2143
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:06,670
It's 11 points.

2144
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:09,380
Se Jong and Jae Seok
scored nine points.

2145
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:10,840
Se Chan scored four points.

2146
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,080
Seok Jin scored three points.

2147
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:15,280
(He gets a headache.)

2148
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,020
Hey, you're so disappointed.

2149
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:20,050
When you played the game...

2150
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:22,990
He's fast when he plays games.
He's slow at other times.

2151
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:25,390
Hyo Rin, I'm disappointed in you.

2152
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,560
- She's good at games.
- Where did you find it?

2153
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,200
- She's seriously good at games.
- Where did you find it?

2154
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:29,560
It was over there.

2155
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,900
She was so fast.

2156
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:32,700
(Team Jong Kook needs to pay
after the meal.)

2157
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,130
Did you enjoy the food?

2158
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:36,540
- Yes.
- The total is 105 dollars.

2159
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,910
- Did he say 70 dollars?
- It's 105 dollars.

2160
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:40,870
- Did he say 100 dollars?
- It's 105 dollars.

2161
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,410
Please take turns and pay.

2162
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:44,650
- We need to have a discussion.
- Hold on.

2163
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,310
Yo Han only has 60 dollars, right?

2164
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:49,150
Yes.

2165
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:50,680
What?

2166
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:53,350
- Think about it.
- Come on. Would you ask again?

2167
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,660
- Yo Han should pay 40 dollars.
- He should pay...

2168
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,730
- forty dollars.
- Forty dollars.

2169
01:10:57,730 --> 01:10:58,890
How much do you have?

2170
01:10:58,890 --> 01:10:59,990
- Me?
- Yes.

2171
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:01,160
(Laughing)

2172
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,300
I have less than 60 dollars.

2173
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,530
- So...
- But more than the median amount?

2174
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:06,200
- To be honest...
- That must be it.

2175
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:09,540
I can pay about 20 dollars.

2176
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:11,610
- That's a lot.
- Really?

2177
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:13,140
- Really?
- Twenty dollars?

2178
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,910
(Why would he pay 20 dollars
when he only has 26 dollars?)

2179
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:16,810
If Yo Han promises to pay
40 dollars,

2180
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:17,850
I'll pay 20 dollars.

2181
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:20,280
We need to pay the exact amount...

2182
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,620
so that there won't be
another penalty taker.

2183
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:24,420
We need to have teamwork.

2184
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:26,320
I can't pay that much.

2185
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,520
- Me neither.
- Be honest.

2186
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,520
- Let's be honest.
- Be honest.

2187
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,990
- Honestly, I can pay 15 dollars.
- What?

2188
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,130
- Really?
- Really?

2189
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:35,200
- Honestly, I can pay two dollars.
- Jong Kook.

2190
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,100
- Okay. That's good.
- My goodness.

2191
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:38,500
- Can you pay 10 dollars?
- I can pay 2 or 3 dollars.

2192
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,730
- Really?
- Yes.

2193
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:41,170
- I can't pay.
- Are you serious?

2194
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:42,340
- I'm serious.
- I really can't pay.

2195
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:45,040
Can't anyone pay more?

2196
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:46,370
Is it impossible?

2197
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:47,610
My goodness. More?

2198
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:48,610
(They're nowhere near 105 dollars.)

2199
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:50,110
- I really can't pay more.
- More?

2200
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:51,810
- My goodness. More?
- Is it impossible?

2201
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:52,810
I really can't pay more.

2202
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:54,250
How much do you have?
Tell me that much.

2203
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,680
- No.
- Up or down?

2204
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,190
In any case, we need to do this.
We need to pay 105 dollars.

2205
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:02,760
I'll pay 48 dollars.

2206
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,490
- Forty-eight dollars?
- Forty-eight dollars.

2207
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:06,390
(Yo Han offers to pay more
for the team this time as well.)

2208
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:07,660
Pay that much.

2209
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,930
Then I'll pay five dollars.

2210
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:11,600
- Will you seriously do that?
- Seriously.

2211
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,370
- Then I'll pay five dollars.
- If you do that...

2212
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:16,240
Then I'll believe in you.

2213
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,770
- Let's do this.
- We're set.

2214
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:19,270
- Okay.
- Seriously.

2215
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:20,410
(They decide to believe in Yo Han,
the loyal man.)

2216
01:12:21,610 --> 01:12:22,710
I'll be back.

2217
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:24,080
(If they keep going this way,
no one will take the penalty!)

2218
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:27,010
It's almost a given.
It's a 50-50 chance.

2219
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,920
(Team Jong Kook,
Daniel: 30 dollars, the median)

2220
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,490
As for them...

2221
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:33,850
Even if the total is low,

2222
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:35,660
they'll pay only a little
and maintain the amount...

2223
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:38,060
with the excuse
that they don't have much money.

2224
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:43,060
They want me to use up my money.

2225
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:48,270
If Yo Han pays over 50 dollars...

2226
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:49,670
If he pays all of his money,
the median will change.

2227
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:51,910
- The median amount will change.
- That's what I think.

2228
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,440
He won't know what to do.

2229
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,510
How much does Yo Han have?

2230
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,180
- If...
- He might be pretending...

2231
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:00,280
- to play along.
- That's right.

2232
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:02,350
It's a matter of probability.

2233
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,920
(What will be Yo Han's choice?)

2234
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,520
Let's share the burden then.

2235
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:09,460
I'll pay 30 dollars.

2236
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,860
(He only pays 30 dollars.)

2237
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:14,760
Yo Han, come on out.

2238
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,460
Yo Han, what are you doing?

2239
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,700
I'm doing calculations.
It isn't working.

2240
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:21,070
The payment.

2241
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:23,740
I can hear him racking his brain.

2242
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:26,170
He's acting like someone
who's getting a loan at the bank.

2243
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:27,780
Come on.

2244
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:30,040
I'm sorry. The payment
didn't go through at once.

2245
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:32,050
(Excuse me?)

2246
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:33,310
I'm sorry.

2247
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:35,150
- Did you use a card?
- I used a different card.

2248
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:36,720
(Laughing)

2249
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,190
(Still, Yo Han is close
to the median amount.)

2250
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:39,220
His head is full of thoughts.

2251
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,860
We won't be able to pay
the exact amount.

2252
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:44,890
We need to pay more later, right?

2253
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:46,860
This place doesn't sell cheap stuff.

2254
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,700
(The teammates realize
that Yo Han has betrayed them.)

2255
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,800
I'll pay zero dollars.

2256
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,400
I need to pay next time.

2257
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,040
(Everyone pays with the goal
of reaching the median amount.)

2258
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,110
In any case, I need to avoid having
the highest or lowest amount.

2259
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:03,940
I think I should spend this much.
It's an awkward amount.

2260
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,550
I don't know.

2261
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:07,850
(After working separately,
who will take the median amount?)

2262
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,120
Let's hear
what the median amount is.

2263
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:13,290
Please tell us
what the median amount is.

2264
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:14,990
Team Jong Kook...

2265
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:17,290
- should've paid 105 dollars.
- Yes.

2266
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:19,890
The teammates paid 59 dollars.

2267
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:21,530
- My goodness.
- That's too much.

2268
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:22,760
(Total amount paid: 59 dollars)

2269
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:25,430
- My goodness.
- That's too much.

2270
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:27,600
- It's half the amount.
- Seriously.

2271
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,970
Since the team has paid less,

2272
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,470
one more member
will receive the penalty.

2273
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,010
Currently, the number
of penalty takers is one.

2274
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:36,110
- I'll share the median amount.
- Half the amount.

2275
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:37,950
It's 25 dollars.

2276
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:39,950
- How much?
- The median amount is 25 dollars.

2277
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:43,780
The median amount
went from 19 to 25 dollars.

2278
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:44,790
Nineteen dollars.

2279
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:46,720
The person in third place...

2280
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,260
has 25 dollars.

2281
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:51,360
Someone who had less
than 19 dollars...

2282
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,160
- went up.
- That's right.

2283
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,000
Yo Han must be anxious.

2284
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:58,730
The person with the lowest amount
will take the penalty.

2285
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,770
- Twenty-five dollars?
- Twenty-five dollars?

2286
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:01,970
Hold on!

2287
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:03,300
- What's wrong with him?
- Jong Kook!

2288
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,470
(They have a mission
for 3 chance cards.)

2289
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:07,470
(Despite multiple opportunities,
they fail to win the chance cards.)

2290
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:10,580
You'll now leave
for the last round of expenses.

2291
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:13,850
Purchase the prize
that'll go to the member...

2292
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:15,820
with the final median amount.

2293
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:17,280
The category of the prize...

2294
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,590
reflects the guests' taste.

2295
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,150
Hyo Rin...

2296
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:24,320
likes bread a lot.

2297
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:27,530
So, you'll buy bread...

2298
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:29,130
- as a prize.
- Bread.

2299
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,630
- Okay.
- You like bread a lot.

2300
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:33,470
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2301
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:34,870
She's serious about bread.

2302
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:36,200
- Here it is.
- Here it is.

2303
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,270
This must be the place.

2304
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:38,910
It looks nice.

2305
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,810
Seok Jin will want everything.

2306
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:42,510
Seok Jin will want everything.

2307
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:43,940
He'll be as enthusiastic as you.

2308
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,880
I can smell the bread already.

2309
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,510
It'll be tasty with coffee.

2310
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:48,920
This is incredible.

2311
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,950
This is amazing.

2312
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,720
- Hyo Rin, go inside first.
- Okay.

2313
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,550
- Hello.
- My goodness.

2314
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,920
I can smell the bread already.

2315
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:58,260
- Hyo Rin will love this place.
- This is incredible.

2316
01:15:58,530 --> 01:15:59,790
This is incredible.

2317
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,730
You haven't been to a place
like this in a while, right?

2318
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,600
- Hold on. We need a tray.
- Everything looks delicious.

2319
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,200
Had I known...

2320
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:09,800
Jae Seok, are we getting
a tray each?

2321
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,200
- What?
- Are we getting a tray each?

2322
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,910
- Of course.
- Okay. Let's hold a tray each.

2323
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:15,540
Everything looks delicious here.

2324
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,880
- Look at the French toast.
- My goodness.

2325
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:21,450
Gosh, it looks so tasty.

2326
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:23,520
- Look at the butter. It's insane.
- It looks so tasty.

2327
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,250
What are you pouring at the bottom?

2328
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,820
It's pistachio cream.

2329
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:28,220
(Excited)

2330
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,490
It looks amazing.

2331
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:30,520
(Their reactions are much bigger
than the time they had skate.)

2332
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,130
You're excited.
You absolutely love bread.

2333
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:33,630
I want one.

2334
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,200
- Look at this.
- What's this?

2335
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,030
- It's no joke.
- It's a French toast.

2336
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:40,070
(She spots
a custard cream French toast.)

2337
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:41,770
What's this cream?

2338
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,070
It's custard cream.

2339
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,610
Custard cream!

2340
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:46,240
Let's take these.

2341
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,310
Carry that one.

2342
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,280
This is incredible.

2343
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:52,450
Had I known that there'd be
something so tasty...

2344
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:54,550
(The bread lover is sad
because he's full.)

2345
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:56,350
- Then we wouldn't have eaten.
- I know.

2346
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:57,420
Come here.

2347
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:59,850
This is incredible.

2348
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:02,020
Do you want to try the cornbread?

2349
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:03,060
How fascinating.

2350
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:05,960
(Impressed)

2351
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,030
You have to eat it.

2352
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,500
(Hyo Rin tries a bite
of the matcha French toast.)

2353
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:15,670
(Her eyes go wide.)

2354
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:20,110
(She isn't shy around the bread
she's seeing for the first time.)

2355
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,210
(Her excitement level goes up.)

2356
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:26,650
It's so tasty.

2357
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:30,350
(He's less excited than the time
he had the fermented skate dish.)

2358
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:32,820
- Se Jong, you didn't sleep much.
- No.

2359
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,960
My insomnia has gotten bad
these days.

2360
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:37,520
(Solemn)

2361
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,860
- Why did you bring up insomnia?
- He really can't sleep.

2362
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:42,530
Do you get three hours of sleep
in a day?

2363
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,700
- In a day?
- You take naps, right?

2364
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,000
- Yes, I take naps.
- Right.

2365
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,140
I fall asleep in the morning.

2366
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,670
- You fall asleep in the morning.
- Yes.

2367
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:50,970
- I fall asleep in the morning.
- Do you wake up at night?

2368
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:52,270
Yes, I wake up at night.

2369
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,380
Do you have many worries these days?

2370
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:57,880
These days...

2371
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,450
I think so.

2372
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:00,480
Don't share them.

2373
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,150
I feel like you'll actually share
your worries.

2374
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,420
(His honesty makes them worried.)

2375
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:09,160
He doesn't lie.

2376
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,790
He's a character we haven't seen.

2377
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:13,060
He's like King Sejong.
He doesn't lie.

2378
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:14,160
It's so tasty.

2379
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,060
Hyo Rin, you're eating with gusto.

2380
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:20,230
Hyo Rin ate a lot earlier too.

2381
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:22,300
She doesn't gain weight
despite the amount she eats.

2382
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:23,470
How is that possible?

2383
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:24,500
(She eats a lot
without saying a word.)

2384
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:27,370
The thing is,

2385
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:29,480
my manager said this to me.

2386
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:34,380
Not as an actress, as a person...

2387
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:38,120
(Not as an actress, as a person...)

2388
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,920
I eat a lot.

2389
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:41,960
I eat a lot.

2390
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,720
(Food escapes from his mouth.)

2391
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,760
Jae Seok.

2392
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:46,990
- Jae Seok.
- Jae Seok's tooth came out.

2393
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:48,130
You know...

2394
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,030
Jae Seok must've been incredulous.

2395
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:51,230
His tooth came out.

2396
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:52,270
- He must have been so shocked.
- He...

2397
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,770
- I didn't realize...
- It came out.

2398
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:57,340
I thought she was about to say
something incredible.

2399
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,610
- "Not as an actress."
- I mean...

2400
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:00,740
- "Not as an actress, as a person."
- "As a person."

2401
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:02,280
- "I eat a lot."
- I thought she was going to say...

2402
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,740
something philosophical.

2403
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,850
- I mean...
- But she said she eats too much.

2404
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:08,320
- Her talk really pulls you in.
- I know.

2405
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,780
It really pulls you in.
It's a Dyson talk.

2406
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:11,790
- Right.
- She speaks calmly.

2407
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:13,520
Se Jong and Hyo Rin
should come again.

2408
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,790
Right.

2409
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:16,090
- Right.
- Come again next time.

2410
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,190
You two should come again.

2411
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:19,890
- They should come.
- It'd be fun when we do surveys.

2412
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:21,760
- Right.
- Come when we have those.

2413
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,100
I think Se Jong is going to come.
He said he would.

2414
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,100
You don't lie.

2415
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,500
I'll come whenever you call me.

2416
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,400
- Right.
- He means what he says.

2417
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,740
Right. Let's have a special episode
where no one lies...

2418
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:33,540
and have Se Jong and Hyo Rin.

2419
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:36,210
I've never seen people
who don't lie so much.

2420
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:37,610
I've never seen anyone.

2421
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:38,710
Hyo Rin also doesn't lie.

2422
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:39,750
- Se Jong.
- Yes?

2423
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:40,810
Is he good-looking?

2424
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:42,420
(Smiling)

2425
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:47,920
(Laughing)

2426
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,720
- You're really nice.
- He's truthful.

2427
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:50,990
- Hey, you!
- You're honest.

2428
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:53,090
- He can't lie.
- You really don't lie, do you?

2429
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:55,000
- He really can't say empty words.
- He can't lie.

2430
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
- The response...
- He can't say empty words.

2431
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,300
He really doesn't lie.

2432
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,200
- Empty words aren't lies.
- Right.

2433
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,400
- He can't say empty words.
- I just couldn't respond.

2434
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,100
I needed some time to think.

2435
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,370
- He can't lie. Let's ask Hyo Rin.
- Yes.

2436
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:07,370
- Hyo Rin.
- Yes?

2437
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:08,610
Is Se Chan good-looking?

2438
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:11,750
- Okay.
- Yes.

2439
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:14,180
Yes... Well...

2440
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:17,020
(She tried to lie,
and her brain crashed.)

2441
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:19,220
- Her inner self is at war.
- Right.

2442
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,820
- Her inner self is at war.
- Since I'm right in front of her,

2443
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:22,990
she can't bring herself to do it.

2444
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:24,490
- Her inner self is at war.
- The good heart...

2445
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:26,760
that can't say mean things
is fighting with the lies.

2446
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:27,760
They're fighting.

2447
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:28,800
They're fighting
since she can't lie.

2448
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,860
- It's a fierce battle.
- Yes.

2449
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:30,900
The one with 19 dollars
was in 3rd place,

2450
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:33,330
- The level rose.
- but now it's 25 dollars.

2451
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,170
Someone here has the median amount.

2452
01:20:35,170 --> 01:20:39,070
Shall we all say who they think
has the median amount?

2453
01:20:39,370 --> 01:20:41,170
- Let's start with Yo Han.
- Okay.

2454
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,780
- I think...
- The middle person.

2455
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,410
(Team Jong Kook:
Daniel, 25 dollars, median)

2456
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:46,110
(Glancing)

2457
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:47,110
Me?

2458
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:49,050
(Yo Han guessed the right person.)

2459
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:50,920
(Nodding)

2460
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,420
(Team Jong Kook:
Daniel, 25 dollars, median)

2461
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:53,620
- This...
- It's a bit...

2462
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:54,790
This feels like...

2463
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:56,560
- Right?
- "I'm the middle?"

2464
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:58,260
Then he agreed.

2465
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,530
- He's already the middle person.
- He couldn't prepare a response.

2466
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:02,260
- Right.
- It was sudden.

2467
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:04,230
That's not true.
It was the first time...

2468
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:06,400
- I looked straight into his eyes.
- He's weird.

2469
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,640
- It felt awkward.
- It felt like this.

2470
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,940
- That's a lame excuse.
- When I asked if it was him,

2471
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:12,810
- he couldn't react.
- Right.

2472
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,610
"Think however you want."

2473
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:16,480
It was a reaction
of a middle schooler.

2474
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,540
Right.

2475
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,510
- A middle schooler's reaction.
- A middle schooler's reaction.

2476
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:21,720
"Think however you want."

2477
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,320
- That's what it felt like.
- A middle schooler's reaction.

2478
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,920
That was a good expression.
I could relate to it.

2479
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:27,420
It's certain
that you have 25 dollars.

2480
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,420
- Do you know what's for sure?
- The calculation...

2481
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:31,390
Yo Han is still in the first place.

2482
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:32,530
- That's for sure.
- He's firmly in first place.

2483
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:34,660
- The good thing about that...
- He can turn that at the end.

2484
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,630
- For Yo Han,
- At the end.

2485
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:37,800
- if he plays it well,
- Right.

2486
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,500
- he can be in the third place.
- Right.

2487
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,270
It depends on how much
the people who have money spend.

2488
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:42,600
Right.

2489
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,100
It's been a while since I came here.

2490
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,740
It really has been a while.

2491
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:48,380
Go! Let's all go.

2492
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:49,810
- I want to have an ice cream.
- Me too.

2493
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:51,510
Should I buy one for you?

2494
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:53,950
- Hey.
- He's loaded.

2495
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:55,620
- Yo Han.
- You're no joke.

2496
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:56,780
- I'm...
- You're...

2497
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:59,250
Yo Han is in first place.

2498
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:01,120
Do you want an ice cream each?

2499
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,420
That would be nice.

2500
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:04,090
- It's my treat.
- That would be nice.

2501
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:06,090
- He's in a rush.
- Right.

2502
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:08,400
I'm in a rush.
I'll just be honest with that.

2503
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,730
I'm in a rush.

2504
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,700
I'm not in such a hurry.

2505
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,700
- We're here.
- Let's see.

2506
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:14,830
- Let's see what's here.
- Goodness.

2507
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:16,740
- I hope the swimsuit is expensive.
- Baby clothes.

2508
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:18,100
The swimsuits here...

2509
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,870
What size do you wear?

2510
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,010
- What size do you wear, Haha?
- Well...

2511
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:24,210
- I'll buy one for you.
- He'll buy us one.

2512
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:26,210
- Really? You have to buy for us?
- You have to...

2513
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:28,180
- Quickly.
- Really?

2514
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:29,620
- Haha.
- I'll just...

2515
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:31,320
I'll just give it to you
as a gift first.

2516
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,690
- I'll get one swimming goggles...
- Okay.

2517
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:35,760
for your daughter.

2518
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,120
What about swimming goggles?

2519
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:40,160
- Swimming goggles?
- I should get one for you. Hold on.

2520
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:41,360
I'll get you this as a gift.

2521
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,300
It's okay. All right, then.

2522
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,100
He's just spending his money.

2523
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,300
The cheapest one is 69 dollars.

2524
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:49,040
- The size...
- This one...

2525
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,140
The bottom part opens.

2526
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,610
It would be really refreshing.

2527
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:53,740
- This is really nice.
- I know.

2528
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:55,780
- It is my style.
- It's really pretty.

2529
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:57,480
(The mesh design
makes it sexy and functional.)

2530
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,780
- See if it fits.
- This looks small.

2531
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,010
- What's the size?
- Try it.

2532
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:01,720
Does it fit him?

2533
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:03,950
- I think it would roughly fit.
- At the back...

2534
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:05,420
- Get this.
- I'll get this as a gift too.

2535
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:06,750
- This is really pretty.
- Okay.

2536
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:09,290
The final payment
will be made at the end.

2537
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:11,490
No way. French toast.

2538
01:23:11,490 --> 01:23:14,990
You finished your shopping
and you've each got your gifts,

2539
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,900
but the amount was so high
that we gave you a discount.

2540
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:20,270
So, each team has to pay...

2541
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:22,200
- seventy dollars.
- Seventy dollars? Hold on.

2542
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,200
This makes it difficult.

2543
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,400
- Seventy dollars? Hold on.
- Okay.

2544
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,710
I think Hyo Rin has a lot of money.

2545
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:26,770
- But...
- I don't have so much.

2546
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:30,280
- Hyo Rin has the chance card.
- I thought I had a lot.

2547
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,180
- She can check later...
- Right.

2548
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:33,810
- She can edit it.
- and edit it if it's too much.

2549
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:35,580
- She can edit it?
- You can adjust it accordingly.

2550
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:37,550
If we exclude Hyo Rin,

2551
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:40,020
we have to fight for one spot.

2552
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:42,860
- That's right.
- We have to fight for one spot.

2553
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:44,390
- How much do you want to pay?
- Me?

2554
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:46,960
How much can you pay?
We have to make 70 dollars.

2555
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,700
You won't make that amount.

2556
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:49,760
No.

2557
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,270
I'm sorry, but I'm...

2558
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,700
I can't pay anything.
I don't have money.

2559
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,300
Let's not say how much
we're going to pay.

2560
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,740
- Okay.
- It's meaningless.

2561
01:23:57,740 --> 01:24:00,070
- Also, in the end,
- Jae Seok.

2562
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:01,570
three of us are going to get
the penalty.

2563
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:02,680
That's right.

2564
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:04,410
- This is crazy.
- So how much...

2565
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:05,850
Se Jong can go first.

2566
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:06,880
I'll get going.

2567
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:08,450
(This is the last payment.)

2568
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:10,150
(The person with
the median amount at the end...)

2569
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:11,280
(will have the final victory.)

2570
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,290
Right now...

2571
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:16,260
I think I'm in the 4th or 5th place.

2572
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:18,560
Should I not pay?

2573
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,100
(Team Jae Seok,
Se Chan: 17 dollars, the median)

2574
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:26,130
It felt like I should write
zero dollars.

2575
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:28,270
- Yes, thank you.
- I understand.

2576
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:30,340
(Team Jae Seok,
Se Chan: 17 dollars, the median)

2577
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:31,940
This is complicated.

2578
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:33,370
(The next top-ranking member,
Jae Seok)

2579
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,680
I have 17 dollars.
How did the amounts change?

2580
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:39,150
What would have happened?

2581
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:41,350
About 15 dollars?

2582
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:46,320
(Pausing)

2583
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:48,920
Eighteen dollars?

2584
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:52,660
(Team Jae Seok,
Se Chan: 17 dollars, the median)

2585
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,330
Jae Seok.

2586
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:58,160
I don't know. Here.

2587
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:59,670
(He paid 15 dollars.)

2588
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:01,940
- I have 13 dollars left, right?
- Yes.

2589
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:03,000
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin:
13 dollars, the median)

2590
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,400
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin
have the median amount.)

2591
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,840
Please.

2592
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:10,940
(He could remain in the middle
depending on what the rest do.)

2593
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,450
It's very annoying.

2594
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:15,680
(It's Seok Sam's turn,
who is currently in the middle.)

2595
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,380
I have 13 dollars.

2596
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,320
People are going to pay.

2597
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:22,560
I'll make it 11 dollars.

2598
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,820
- Eleven dollars?
- Yes.

2599
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:26,260
- Seok Sam!
- That's two dollars.

2600
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:28,090
(Seok Sam's ranking went down.)

2601
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:29,900
(Thanks to that,
Jae Seok is in the middle alone.)

2602
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,360
- Yes.
- We can hear you think.

2603
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,030
What's taking you so long?

2604
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:36,300
The median amount.
Three people will get a penalty anyway.

2605
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,310
I gave 8 dollars.
I want to leave 8 dollars.

2606
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:42,110
I have a high amount now.

2607
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:43,740
(He has to pay some money.)

2608
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:45,810
Goodness.

2609
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:47,780
(Team Jae Seok,
Jae Seok: 13 dollars, the median)

2610
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:50,420
I'll just leave four dollars.

2611
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:52,590
Four dollars.
How much do I have to pay?

2612
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:54,620
- Is it 13 dollars?
- Yes.

2613
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:55,860
Right. It's 13 dollars.

2614
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:56,890
(Thanks to him,
Se Jong has the median amount now.)

2615
01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:59,230
That's done. I'm worried...

2616
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:01,560
this amount would be the lowest.
That would be annoying.

2617
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,060
- Ssaebssaeb.
- Yes?

2618
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:05,900
(Team Jae Seok,
Se Jong: 12.5 dollars, the median)

2619
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:09,770
(Hyo Rin, the last member,
goes next.)

2620
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:17,640
I want to leave 11 dollars.

2621
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,310
In that case,

2622
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:21,310
you can pay 19 dollars.

2623
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:22,780
(Hyo Rin and Seok Sam
have the median amount.)

2624
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:24,720
(Hyo Rin hasn't used
the chance card yet.)

2625
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,320
You should take the chance card.

2626
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,320
(Hyo Rin and Seok Sam
are the leading candidates.)

2627
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,390
If three people
end up getting the penalty,

2628
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:31,190
the person with the highest amount,
the lowest amount,

2629
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:32,990
- The person in the middle...
- and the next person will get it.

2630
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:34,830
The person closest
to the middle will win?

2631
01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:35,830
This is meaningless.

2632
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:37,730
What will you do?
Will we not discuss?

2633
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:39,270
- Let's pay on our own.
- Let's pay on our own.

2634
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:40,870
- Let's decide for ourselves.
- Okay.

2635
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:42,570
(Team Jong Kook,
Daniel: 25 dollars, the median)

2636
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:45,340
This is really tricky.

2637
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:47,810
Since the person with the highest
amount will also get a penalty,

2638
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:49,540
they'll all reduce their amounts.

2639
01:26:50,410 --> 01:26:53,480
I should leave it like this.
I'll just write one dollar.

2640
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:54,610
(Team Jong Kook,
Daniel: 25 dollars, the median)

2641
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:56,420
I might get lucky
and get in the middle.

2642
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,280
(Haha paid a really small amount.)

2643
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:01,290
(Remaining amount: 16 dollars
Issued by Running Bank)

2644
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:05,090
We have no choice.
The people with a low amount...

2645
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:06,530
have no other choice.

2646
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:07,930
(Team Jong Kook,
Daniel: 25 dollars, the median)

2647
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:10,760
(He chooses to stay
with the amount.)

2648
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:13,400
(Ji Hyo is also
among the low-ranking members.)

2649
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,000
It's 9.5 dollars.

2650
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,900
(Unlike the cowardly guys,
Ji Hyo wrote a bold amount.)

2651
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,170
I'll make it 10.5 dollars.

2652
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,540
(It's the turn of Byun Yo Han,
the original wealthy man.)

2653
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:27,650
The median amount
was 25 dollars earlier.

2654
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:31,620
(He's in 2nd place now
after spending a lot earlier.)

2655
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:34,050
I currently have 30 dollars.

2656
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:37,590
Haha and Jong Kook kept saying
they didn't have money.

2657
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:40,790
Ji Hyo is going
with the beggar concept.

2658
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:43,430
So I'll just...

2659
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:48,700
I think I should make a big bet.
So...

2660
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,770
Yo Han is really using his brain.

2661
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:53,810
Mr. Byun is taking a long time.

2662
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:56,140
Yo Han is taking too long.

2663
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,410
(Laughing)

2664
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,680
The card isn't working.

2665
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:05,080
I'll leave 12 dollars.

2666
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:06,550
- Twelve dollars?
- Twelve dollars.

2667
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:08,820
(Yo Han drastically lowered
his amount.)

2668
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:12,460
The people in the lower end
can't do anything.

2669
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:13,590
That's right.

2670
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:14,930
Twelve dollars.

2671
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:15,930
(Would Yo Han's plan work?)

2672
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:17,800
They're all thinking they're safe
as long as the amount...

2673
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,630
stays above ten dollars.

2674
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:22,400
(Daniel made the payment.)

2675
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,040
I'm safe.

2676
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:28,470
I'll just write this amount.

2677
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,210
(Who will have the median amount
in the end?)

2678
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:34,310
- You all made your final payments.
- Yes.

2679
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:37,780
- There will be no more members...
- Yes.

2680
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:39,220
- receiving the penalty...
- I bet my entire fortune...

2681
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:40,620
- that it won't work.
- if you collected 70 dollars.

2682
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:43,560
The amount Jong Kook collected...

2683
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:46,560
was 66.5 dollars.

2684
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:47,960
- That's close.
- We almost made it.

2685
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,130
That's amazing.

2686
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:50,130
- We'll have two penalty receivers.
- Yes.
It's less than 70 dollars,

2687
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:52,130
so two more members
will get the penalty.

2688
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:53,830
- We're in trouble.
- Two out of six people?

2689
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:55,030
I have no idea how it will turn out.

2690
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:57,240
I'll announce
the current median amounts then.

2691
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,110
I'll announce the result
of Team Jong Kook first.

2692
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:00,870
- She's announcing it.
- Aren't they nervous?

2693
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:04,840
The member in third to receive
the prize with the median amount is,

2694
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:08,380
(Kang Woo
with a lot of money to spend?)

2695
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:11,320
(Or Daniel?)

2696
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:15,090
(Byun Yo Han,
the gambler who bet big?)

2697
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:16,860
(Will Haha or Jong Kook
get lucky and win?)

2698
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:20,760
The member in third to receive
the prize with the median amount is,

2699
01:29:21,290 --> 01:29:22,930
with 12 dollars,

2700
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:24,960
- Byun Yo Han.
- Yes!

2701
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,730
(Byun Yo Han wins.)

2702
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:28,840
(Shouting)

2703
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,370
He got 12 dollars.

2704
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:32,440
(Shocked)

2705
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,210
- He got 12 dollars.
- Those from "Run to the West..."

2706
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:36,610
The actors of "Run to the West"
are truly amazing.

2707
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:37,640
You're in third place?

2708
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:38,640
(You had a lot of money earlier.)

2709
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,750
(Screaming)

2710
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,910
Hey, Yo Han.

2711
01:29:40,910 --> 01:29:42,050
- You're in third place?
- You did a great job.

2712
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:43,250
- Gosh, how did you do that?
- My goodness.

2713
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:45,920
- He's very clever.
- He's shrewd.

2714
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,090
He had 90 dollars at first,
but he came down to 12 dollars.

2715
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:49,260
(Mr. Byun won with his great skills
to cut down on the amount.)

2716
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:50,260
How did you do that?
He's really good.

2717
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:53,330
That was impressive.

2718
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:55,290
Who are the members
with the highest and lowest amounts?

2719
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:56,660
Your team has two members...

2720
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:58,030
- to get the penalty.
- Yes.

2721
01:29:58,030 --> 01:29:59,770
I said that the members
with the highest and lowest amounts...

2722
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:00,830
- will get the penalty.
- Right.

2723
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:02,570
Who's the one with the highest amount?
Who will you tell us first?

2724
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:04,070
The lowest amount...

2725
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:05,300
- is nine dollars.
- What?

2726
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,370
- Oh, no.
- Who's that?

2727
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:07,810
It's Choi Daniel.

2728
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:09,540
- Yes!
- Wait.

2729
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:11,040
- No. Wait.
- Hey.

2730
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,450
- There should be eight dollars.
- You went down too far.

2731
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,250
- But...
- You used your brain!

2732
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:16,820
- He's...
- Hang on.

2733
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:18,250
- I said it'd be over ten dollars.
- It should be at least ten dollars.

2734
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:19,790
- That's what he said.
- Right.

2735
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:22,190
- I'll tell you the highest amount.
- That's better.

2736
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:23,760
The highest amount
of Team Jong Kook...

2737
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:25,730
is 16 dollars.

2738
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:26,790
Darn it!

2739
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:29,360
(Haha, Jong Kook,
and Daniel will get the penalty.)

2740
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,100
I also have 16 dollars.

2741
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:32,700
You two have the same amount.

2742
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:33,830
Darn it!

2743
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:35,600
- We both will get the penalty?
- Both of us?

2744
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:36,940
- You must be annoyed.
- Wait.

2745
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:38,000
- This is...
- We're safe!

2746
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,910
Ji Hyo and Kang Woo
have 10.5 dollars.

2747
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:42,140
- They're exempt from the penalty.
- I didn't see this coming.

2748
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:44,010
- You...
- I couldn't even imagine it.

2749
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,110
For Team Jae Seok,

2750
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:48,550
the total amount is...

2751
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:50,180
forty-nine dollars.

2752
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:51,350
- That's a lot.
- That's a lot.

2753
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:52,950
Do you know why?
They all reduced their amounts.

2754
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:54,750
- You guys...
- That's a lot.

2755
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:56,690
They wanted
to have the median amount.

2756
01:30:56,690 --> 01:30:58,520
Among the five members,

2757
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,990
- three will get the penalty.
- Okay.

2758
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:01,630
- We have 1 spot left.
- Only 1 spot.

2759
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:03,030
- Only one spot.
- Yes.

2760
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:05,000
I'll now announce
the median amount...

2761
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,770
- of Team Jae Seok.
- Okay.

2762
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,170
It's 11 dollars.

2763
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:09,440
(Hyo Rin and Seok Jin
have 11 dollars.)

2764
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,700
It's 11 dollars.

2765
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:12,070
(It's me!)

2766
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:13,810
It's 11 dollars.

2767
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:15,170
- What?
- The median amount?

2768
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:16,680
- It's 11 dollars.
- It's 11 dollars.

2769
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:19,010
It's 11 dollars.

2770
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:20,480
- What?
- The median amount?

2771
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,220
- It's 11 dollars.
- Is it 11 dollars?

2772
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:23,780
(Jae Seok, Se Jong, and Se Chan
are the candidates for the penalty.)

2773
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:25,080
No!

2774
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:26,450
What's this?

2775
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:28,750
My money! Give my money back!

2776
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,820
- No!
- Oh, dear.

2777
01:31:32,230 --> 01:31:33,590
- What is all this?
- This is crazy.

2778
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:35,190
I was so close.

2779
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:37,700
- What is happening now?
- After Hyo Rin uses...

2780
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:40,100
her chance card, I'll announce
the final results of Team Jae Seok.

2781
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:41,830
Hyo Rin has the chance card.

2782
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,470
- I'll be back.
- Good luck.

2783
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:45,340
- Use it well.
- Good luck.

2784
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:47,210
(With the chance card, she can
adjust one member's amount.)

2785
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:48,840
- Good luck.
- I'll see you soon.

2786
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:49,910
- Good luck.
- Remember what I told you?

2787
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:51,110
- Use it well.
- See you.

2788
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:52,950
- We had fun together today.
- Yes.

2789
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:54,010
- See you.
- See you.

2790
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:56,450
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, dear.

2791
01:31:56,450 --> 01:31:58,080
What is going on?

2792
01:31:58,380 --> 01:31:59,920
(Surprised)

2793
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,050
I'm in the middle!

2794
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:02,920
I'm...

2795
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,860
in first place, right?

2796
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:06,290
I'm really...

2797
01:32:06,290 --> 01:32:07,830
- I gave it a lot of thought.
- You're in the middle, right?

2798
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:09,200
He's staying quiet.

2799
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:10,430
I hesitated a lot.

2800
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:12,670
- No.
- You have more than that?

2801
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:13,870
No.

2802
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,500
One of you will survive.

2803
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:17,540
- Why?
- Why?

2804
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:19,640
I think one of them
has the median amount.

2805
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:20,840
No. It's not me.

2806
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,780
(Se Jong suddenly hit the nail
on the head with a dry voice.)

2807
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:24,810
- No. It's not me.
- Me neither.

2808
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,480
(Awkward)

2809
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:27,680
- Hang on. Guys...
- Who is it?

2810
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:29,650
- It's not me.
- I'm out.

2811
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,490
- It's not me.
- I'm out.

2812
01:32:33,650 --> 01:32:35,250
- It's Seok Jin.
- One of these two...

2813
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,990
- Hyo Rin, it's Seok Jin.
- No.

2814
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:38,660
- Hyo Rin, it's Seok Jin.
- I said no.

2815
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:39,830
Beware of false rumors.

2816
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:41,030
Hyo Rin, it's Seok Jin.

2817
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:42,360
- It's not me.
- Hyo Rin!

2818
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:43,560
It's Seok Jin.

2819
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:45,560
- It's not me.
- It's Seok Jin.

2820
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,300
I gave it a lot of thought.

2821
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,300
- No!
- Hyo Rin.

2822
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:49,370
Raise his amount.

2823
01:32:49,370 --> 01:32:50,870
- That's a lie.
- It's true.

2824
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:52,570
It's Jae Seok.

2825
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:54,740
Jae Seok...
No, write down Seok Jin's name.

2826
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:56,810
- Hyo Rin, it's Seok Sam.
- No.

2827
01:32:56,810 --> 01:32:59,080
- Seok Jin is in the middle.
- No.

2828
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:01,310
- Are you back?
- Yes.

2829
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:03,220
- Did you choose it well?
- All right. I'll now announce...

2830
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:05,380
the final results of Team Jae Seok.

2831
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:06,420
First...

2832
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:08,690
The median amount...

2833
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:10,220
- Is it a lot?
- has been changed.

2834
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:12,290
(The median amount
has been changed!)

2835
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:14,190
- Why?
- Us?

2836
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:16,260
(Team Jae Seok's fate changed
after the chance card was used.)

2837
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:17,900
- It's changed?
- Because of Hyo Rin.

2838
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:19,930
- That's right.
- Director.

2839
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:24,470
The member to receive the prize
with the median amount...

2840
01:33:24,470 --> 01:33:27,370
- Who is it?
- It's 12.5 dollars.

2841
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,510
Hyo Rin?

2842
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:30,380
- It's Yang Se Jong.
- What?

2843
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,240
- How did you use the chance card?
- What?

2844
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,610
- Why?
- Why did I win?

2845
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:38,850
(Se Jong suddenly
became the winner?)

2846
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:40,250
What?

2847
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:41,620
- How did you use the chance card?
- What?

2848
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:43,860
- Why?
- Mine wasn't the median amount.

2849
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:45,020
- Hang on.
- Before the chance card...

2850
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:46,830
Hyo Rin and Seok Jin...

2851
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:49,100
- had the same amount, 11 dollars.
- What?

2852
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:50,130
We had the same amount?

2853
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:51,160
- Yes.
- I had 11 dollars.

2854
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,600
But Hyo Rin used the chance card...

2855
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,970
and added ten million dollars
to Seok Jin.

2856
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:56,040
Hey!

2857
01:33:57,070 --> 01:33:59,270
(Seok Jin got
an extra 10 million dollars.)

2858
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:01,670
(Seok Jin: 10,000,011 dollars)

2859
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:02,810
- You're rich.
- He got ten million dollars.

2860
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:03,910
He's super rich.

2861
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:06,380
- Now he has 10,000,011 dollars.
- My goodness.

2862
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:08,010
He's really rich.

2863
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:09,880
- You became rich.
- He has ten million dollars.

2864
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:11,350
- You're rich.
- You're rich.

2865
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:12,690
- I'm jealous.
- I got ten million dollars.

2866
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:14,290
No.

2867
01:34:14,290 --> 01:34:16,320
- It's true.
- To Jee Seok Jin.

2868
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:18,190
I'll give him ten million dollars.

2869
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:19,990
(I'll give 10 million dollars
to Jee Seok Jin!)

2870
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,500
It's 10,000,011 dollars.
What do I do?

2871
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:23,860
(The difference between Jae Seok
and Se Jong is 50 cents.)

2872
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:25,230
(The difference between Se Jong
and Hyo Rin is 1.5 dollars.)

2873
01:34:25,230 --> 01:34:27,130
(Seok Jin, Hyo Rin, and Se Chan
will get the penalty.)

2874
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:28,330
(Hyo Rin wanted to build memories
with Seok Sam until the end.)

2875
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:29,800
(10 million dollars to Jee Seok Jin.
Be rich. Thank you, and I'm sorry.)

2876
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,340
(Hyo Rin wanted to build memories
with Seok Sam until the end.)

2877
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:33,470
(She couldn't bring herself to take
money from others,)

2878
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:35,570
(so she ended up
getting the penalty with Seok Jin.)

2879
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,510
- "Thank you, and I'm sorry."
- So...

2880
01:34:37,610 --> 01:34:39,910
She put me in trouble,
but she sounds so polite.

2881
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:43,620
Hey! You said you wanted
to be on the same team with me.

2882
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,350
- Before coming here today.
- Hang on. Then...

2883
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:46,950
- We have one spot left.
- I'll tell you...

2884
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:48,050
the amounts of each member.

2885
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:50,960
Jee Seok Jin has 10,000,011 dollars,
so he's in first place.

2886
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,360
- He has 10,000,011 dollars.
- And...

2887
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:54,590
- Jae Seok has 13 dollars.
- I have 13 dollars.

2888
01:34:54,590 --> 01:34:56,300
And Yang Se Jong...

2889
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:57,760
- has 12.5 dollars.
- He has 12.5 dollars.

2890
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,800
And Bang Hyo Rin...

2891
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,170
- has 11 dollars.
- I see.

2892
01:35:01,170 --> 01:35:03,340
Yang Se Chan has four dollars.

2893
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,540
- Jae Seok is exempt.
- What?

2894
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:07,670
- All of them will get the penalty.
- Seok Jin, Hyo Rin, and Se Chan...

2895
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:09,240
- will get the penalty.
- Hey.

2896
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:11,940
- Jae Seok survived?
- It's Jae Seok.

2897
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:13,580
- Because of you...
- He's so lucky.

2898
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:16,220
- He's so lucky.
- Thank you, Hyo Rin.

2899
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:18,350
You bought the prize earlier.

2900
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:19,820
Yang Se Jong gets...

2901
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:21,790
the bread he bought earlier.

2902
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:23,390
He doesn't like bread.

2903
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:25,060
He doesn't like bread.

2904
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:27,090
- He's so lucky.
- Right.

2905
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:28,490
- I bought them.
- Byun Yo Han...

2906
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:30,200
will also get
what he bought earlier.

2907
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:32,730
- Why did you want the swimsuit?
- Is this your size?

2908
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,400
It has the mesh part
on the buttocks.

2909
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,940
If you don't like it, give it to me.
I'll wear it at home.

2910
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,270
No.

2911
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:38,570
- Are they your underpants?
- This is my first appearance...

2912
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:39,810
- in Running Man, so...
- Okay.

2913
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:41,540
- Okay.
- Yes!

2914
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:43,140
This is for your daughter.

2915
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:45,310
Thank you.

2916
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:46,910
Here's the penalty.

2917
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:50,950
It's for your new movie,
"Run to the West."

2918
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:53,650
You will draw a black line
in the middle of your face.

2919
01:35:53,650 --> 01:35:56,620
(Today's penalty: Drawing a line
in the middle of the face with ink.)

2920
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:58,120
- In the middle?
- Yes.

2921
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,190
(She is the only guest
to get the penalty.)

2922
01:35:59,190 --> 01:36:00,930
This is perfect. That's it.

2923
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:03,030
- Done.
- I should draw it one more time.

2924
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:04,100
One more time.

2925
01:36:04,530 --> 01:36:05,700
He looks cute.

2926
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:06,830
He's really cute.

2927
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:08,000
This is great.

2928
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:10,670
(Jong Kook and Se Chan,
who lost to Haha...)

2929
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:13,210
(in the game of rock-paper-scissors,
get the penalty.)

2930
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,040
- By the way...
- It's a little...

2931
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,110
Can I really do this?

2932
01:36:17,110 --> 01:36:18,180
- Yes.
- All right.

2933
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:23,520
Oh, no.

2934
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,620
(He groans after laughing.)

2935
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:26,150
(Giggling)

2936
01:36:26,590 --> 01:36:28,190
- She still looks pretty.
- Hey, you're...

2937
01:36:28,190 --> 01:36:29,360
Hyo Rin is really...

2938
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,560
- Hyo Rin is...
- She looks pretty.

2939
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:32,830
Hyo Rin looks really nice.

2940
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:33,960
- Let me see.
- Let me see.

2941
01:36:34,230 --> 01:36:35,730
- You look good.
- Nice.

2942
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:36,830
By the way...

2943
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:38,700
I guess there is some big event
taking place today.

2944
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:40,200
- We're performing.
- Right.

2945
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,970
(The performers
from the netherworld)

2946
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:44,570
"Run to the West."

2947
01:36:44,570 --> 01:36:45,600
- His face...
- I should draw it here.

2948
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,070
- Draw his glasses here.
- He's...

2949
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:48,470
- His face is...
- Say "Run to the West."

2950
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:50,680
- Say something about your movie.
- Say something.

2951
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:51,740
"Run to the West."

2952
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:53,950
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2953
01:36:54,210 --> 01:36:56,080
(Please support "Run to the West...")

2954
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,820
(starring Byun Yo Han, Kim Kang Woo,
Bang Hyo Rin, and Yang Se Jong.)

2955
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:01,990
(Thieves are gathering after hearing
about the gold on the sandy beach.)

2956
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:03,390
(Jong Kook,
which gang do you work for?)

2957
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:04,860
(In front of the petty ones,
whose origins are unclear,)

2958
01:37:05,190 --> 01:37:06,690
(familiar Gold Hunters
appeared like the wind.)

2959
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:08,490
(Yang Se Hyeong, Jeon So Min)

2960
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:10,530
(He can steal a bicycle
in three seconds.)

2961
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:11,960
(The skills of Ssaebssaeb's teacher)

2962
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:13,800
(Today, he's here to steal gold
instead of a bicycle.)

2963
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,470
(Former Madam Jeon,
Current Chewed Gum...)

2964
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:17,000
(focuses on her character.)

2965
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,300
(Hang on.)

2966
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:19,710
(She gives the gum she chewed
to Seok Sam.)

2967
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:20,970
(This is why you're Chewed Gum.)

2968
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:22,310
(I'm here to make money today.)

2969
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:23,980
(She claims that she steals
to make a living.)

2970
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:25,240
(But in reality,
she's just a paper doll.)

2971
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:26,550
(Se Chan, use this
to make people laugh.)

2972
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:27,710
(His brother provokes him.)

2973
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:30,180
(He's taller and bigger,
but he's pushed around by his brother.)

2974
01:37:30,450 --> 01:37:32,180
(Will you ever be able
to beat Se Hyeong?)

2975
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:34,090
(He holds grudges for too long.)

2976
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:35,920
(Have you kissed anyone
in the past week?)

2977
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,090
(Hey, come here.)

2978
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:38,120
(Are you going to kiss him now?)

2979
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:39,190
(Romantic Frog is back.)

2980
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:42,030
(The whole thing is a warm-up
to find hidden gold.)

2981
01:37:42,030 --> 01:37:43,060
(A hint is hidden.)

2982
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:45,600
(Who will be able to unravel
the mystery and claim the gold?)

2983
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,070
(Finders Keepers, Gold Hungers)
