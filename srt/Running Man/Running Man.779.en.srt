(Running Man)

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,780
- Hello. - The ginkgo trees are beautiful.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,290
(Dyed in different colors, it's a clear fall morning.)

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,720
- Okay! - This is my first time here.

00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,090
(The members meet at a university.)

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,490
- The weather is nice. - Hello.

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,060
- Hello. - Seok Jin.

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,360
- Today, Seok Jin has... - Yes.

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,530
all his back hair pulled forward.

12
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,460
- I said it wasn't like that. - It's like "borrowing hair."

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,570
He borrowed his hair from the back.

14
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,100
He said it was "borrowed hair."

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,370
- "Borrowed hair?" - He borrowed all his hair.

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,040
(He went all-in on borrowed hair...)

17
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,310
- What? - He used all the hair on his head.

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,180
(without thinking about what comes after.)

19
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,510
"Borrowed hair."

20
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,210
- People might believe you! - So...

21
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,550
- So... - That's not true!

22
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,610
(A true all-in spender on hair)

23
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,010
- "Borrowed money." - The back of his head is empty.

24
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,750
Under the sunlight.

25
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,380
- "Borrowed hair." - I'll stand...

26
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,850
in the shade then.

27
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,290
Seok Jin, when you got your hair done...

28
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,390
- Anyway... - Seok Jin, here...

29
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,390
(Suddenly)

30
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,730
- Darn it! - Gosh.

31
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,330
(He explodes with rage.)

32
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,430
Jae Seok, I just...

33
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,030
- Seok Jin... - I get it. What?

34
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,100
Don't say anything.

35
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,600
- Are you jealous? - Don't say anything, Seok Jin.

36
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,070
- Don't talk. - I saw a premature...

37
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,270
- I just saw a gray hair. - What?

38
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,310
- Don't talk to her. - A gray hair?

39
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,870
- He's old enough to have it. - I do have gray hair.

40
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,110
(Rubbing salt in the wound)

41
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,210
Even I have it.

42
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,010
- Ji Hyo is so considerate. - Even I have gray hair.

43
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,110
She said it was premature gray hair.

44
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,850
- I dyed my hair. - Don't do that.

45
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,280
- I dyed it. - You're old enough to have it.

46
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,690
(Jee-rasoni finally manages to start today's show.)

47
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,480
- Right. Of course. - I also have gray hair.

48
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,550
I dyed my hair.

49
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,050
- Today, - All right.

50
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,820

51
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,860
(We have guests!)

52
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,390

- Hello. - Who are they?

55
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,190
- Hello. - It's you, Eun Jin.

56
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,590
It's been a while.

61
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,400

Mu Jun.

67
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,740
(She recently played a grandmother who regained her youth...)

68
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,340
I'm sorry. I saw it again, but I'm still surprised.

69
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,140
(in "Genie, Make a Wish.")

70
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,480
I'll tell you everything.

71
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,710
(Ahn Eun Jin who proved herself, winning the Best Actress Award...)

72
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,150
(for her role in the drama "My Dearest")

73
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,220
Please don't do anything.

74
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,120
(And he played Crown Prince So Hyeon in the drama "My Dearest.")

75
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,890

76
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,160
(Kim Mu Jun, a brilliant scene-stealer...)

77
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,660
I will smash them all.

78
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,960
(in "Genie, Make a Wish")

79
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,020
He did everything?

80
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,930
(They reunited in the SBS drama, "Dynamite Kiss!")

81
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,500
Are you acting like this because you can't forget my kiss?

82
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,700
(A crazy love triangle with Jang Ki Yong)

83
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,500
- Who are you? - I'm her husband.

84
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,930
Why did you tell me that you didn't have a boyfriend?

85
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,000
(Eun Jin and Mu Jun, who always succeed when they work together,)

86
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,370
I don't have a boyfriend. I just have a husband.

87
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,740

88

92
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,610
- Hi. - It's been a long time.

Do you know each other?

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,050
- Eun Jin. - Do you know her?

98
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,050
We went to the same school.

99
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,220
- Hello. - Eun Jin, it's been a while.

100
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,290
(Ye Eun and Eun Jin both went to Korea National University of Arts.)

101
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,820
- You did? - She's your senior?

102
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,120
- Eun Jin was her senior at school. - I see.

103
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,820

104
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,830

- Hey. - Hello.

106
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,930

(Daniel and Mu Jun met in the drama, "Sorry Not Sorry.")

108
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,360
- Have you been doing well? - Yes.

109
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,670
- Eun Jin is back as a star. - Right.

110
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,840
(Welcoming them)

111
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,840
Yes.

112
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,970
Actually, Running Man made Eun Jin famous.

113
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,310
- Exactly. - She's back...

114
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,240
- after becoming a star. - That's true.

115
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,510
All right. Now that you agree with me, I feel bad.

116
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,950
It was when I played games in Running Man.

117
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,520
- Right. - That's when it started.

118
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,220
- It was Cry in Silence, right? - It was Cry in Silence.

119
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,590
- I guess I was possessed... - She's really good.

120
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,690
by the variety deity.

121
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,220
- I see. - That's right.

122
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,690
(They played Cry in Silence 4 years ago during the stock market boom.)

123
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,220
Let's go, Eun Jin.

124
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,590
(Samsung Electronics)

125
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,490
- Samsung Electronics. - I should do this.

126
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,260
(Investor Ahn suddenly shouted out the name of a blue-chip stock.)

127
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,200
What is she doing?

128
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,560
-Te... - Te...

129
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,270
Tesla.

130
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,000
Tesla?

131
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,800
(It's going up.)

132
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,900
It goes up.

133
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,840
(Eun Jin's explanation became the talk of the town.)

134
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,310
(Asking Ahn Eun Jin about stocks)

135
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,570
- It went viral back then. - I know.

136
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,010
- I look forward to it today. - All right.

137
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,640
- Yes. - Seriously.

138
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,610
(Looking forward to Eun Jin's role)

139
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,550
She's well prepared.

140
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,520
By the way, before our show,

141
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,180
(Promotion time before moving forward)

142
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,750
- a trailer for their drama aired. - Right.

143
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,850
I kept watching it.

144
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,320
- I see. - Is it the SBS drama?

145
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
It's "Dynamite Kiss."

146
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,560
("Dynamite Kiss" is airing amid rising popularity.)

147
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,190
- Right. - Yes.

148
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,820
- I see. - "Dynamite Kiss."

149
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,190
What is the drama about? Is it about a kiss?

150
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,790
- Do you two... - How...

151
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,900
- I did kiss. - Do you kiss?

152
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,200
- You did. - You kissed, and?

153
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,470
- I did. - But you're not supposed to kiss.

154
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,500
- I was attracted, so I kissed. - I see.

155
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,470
But I wasn't supposed to kiss him.

156
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,340
- Is that it? - That's enough. Just say that much.

157
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,440
(It's already a dopamine party.)

158
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,410
- That sounds fun. - I'm curious.

159
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,940
- I'm curious. - Hey, it sounds fun already.

160
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,380
Mu Jun is my best friend in the drama.

161
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,710
- He's a friend. - Yes.

162
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,680
Is Jang Ki Yong your lover?

163
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,050
- That's right. - Jang Ki Yong.

164
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,690
It's a love triangle.

165
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,420
- By the way, Mu Jun, this is... - Yes.

166
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,490
(It's Mu Jun's first time on Running Man.)

167
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,730
- our first time meeting today. - Yes.

168
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,190
Please introduce yourself.

169
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,160
Okay. Hello. I was...

170
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,630
- born in 1998. - I see. I went to college in 1998.

171
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,400
The France World Cup was held in 1998.

172
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,300
- That's right. - I see.

173
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,400
- I see. - They're old men.

174
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,670
- Old men calculate people's age... - Old men?

175
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,910
based on the World Cup.

176
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,540
- Based on sports games. - Right.

177
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,480
- Old men calculate people's age... - Old men?

178
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,980
(Kim Mu Jin, born in 1998, laughing awkwardly)

179
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,710
They base it on the World Cup.

180
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,880
We lost 5 to 0 to the Netherlands.

181
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,620
(The Netherlands match)

182
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,020
- Ha Seok Ju was there. - Right.

183
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,190
With his left foot.

184
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,220
- The master of the left foot. - He got a red card.

185
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,020
(The oldies are excited,)

186
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,590
- He got a red card after a goal. - Yes.

187
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,960
(talking about 1998 when things were on a roll.)

188
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,020
- I see. That's what it was. - Yes.

189
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,230
- It was against Mexico. - Right.

190
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,590
(The 1998 baby is lost.)

191
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,790
- We lost 5 to 0 to the Netherlands. - Yes.

192
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,800
(He came to his senses.)

193
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,400
- I'm sorry. We suddenly... - It's all right.

194
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,230
- We were reminded of the old days. - We all watched the games.

195
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,500
I think I watched them too.

196
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,430
- You did? - Cha Bum Jun was the coach.

197
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,400
He says he watched it.

198
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,640
- By the way, have we met before? - What?

199
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,270
- Where? - Jae Seok?

200
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,940
(Mu Jun has already met Jae Seok?)

201
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,040
- When? - It was...

202
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,110
- about 12 years ago. - Was it 12 years ago?

203
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,380
- It was when you were little. - Yes.

204
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,180
- I was a 9th grader. - You were in the 9th grade.

205
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
- You were in the 9th grade. - It was...

206
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,120
(How did they meet?)

207
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,790
- when you were hosting... - Yes.

208
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,250
- "Same Bed, Different Dreams." - Right.

209
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,560
I was there as part of the audience.

210
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,820
- No way. - Audience?

211
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,930
(Surprised by the amazing encounter)

212
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,390
- As part of the audience? - In the audience?

213
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,700
(About 10 years ago, he was the MC of "Same Bed, Different Dreams.")

214
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,630
- As part of the audience? - In the audience?

215
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,630
Really?

216
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,830
- No way. - With whom?

217
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,900
This is how you meet them again.

218
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,700
I went there with a friend.

219
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,900
- This is funny. - That's interesting.

220
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,740
I asked you to shake hands with me, and you did.

221
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,900
- I... - Amazing.

222
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,770
- It's interesting. - I told you.

223
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,870
- When we're doing TV shows, - On a TV show.

224
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,880
(He's grown from a middle school audience...)

225
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,910
- It happens. - some of the people we met there...

226
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,380
(to a cast member on the same show!)

227
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,650
- become our colleagues. - Right.

228
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,980
He was part of the audience.

229
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,610
How interesting.

230
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,720
- It's good to see you. - Likewise.

231
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,820
- Goodness. - Right.

232
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,390
He went to the Seoul Institute of the Arts?

233
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,720
- An alumnus of Jae Seok's school? - Right.

234
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,120
- What was your major? - The same school.

235
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,990
(Their ties continue.)

236
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,320
Right.

237
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,730
- What was your major? - The same school.

238
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,260
- I majored in theater. - The department of theater?

239
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,330
The names of the departments changed after my generation.

240
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,060
But you didn't graduate.

241
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,100
(Jae Seok)

242
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,200
- Right. - I see.

243
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,670
- I went to school for four years. - Right.

244
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,370
- What? - I also didn't...

245
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,540
- You didn't graduate? - You didn't graduate?

246
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,010
- No. - I see.

247
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,040
He is your junior.

248
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
- You should've graduated. - They're the same.

249
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,540
(A school reunion of the non-graduates)

250
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,440
He is your junior.

251
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,280
- You should've graduated. - They're the same.

252
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,710
- He's just like me. - He is.

253
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,580
(Happy to meet him)

254
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,780
You also went to the Seoul Institute of the Arts.

255
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,150
I went to the Korea National University of Arts.

256
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,490
Mu Jun...

257
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,790
(Embarrassed)

258
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,520
Mu Jun went to the Seoul Institute of the Arts.

259
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,590
You made a mistake.

260
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,620
- See? - They just hugged each other.

261
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,090
- She hugged Ye Eun. - Ye Eun went to the same school.

262
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,160
It's Ye Eun.

263
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,500
(A senior and junior from Korea National University of Arts)

264
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,500
- Do you know Ye Eun then? - Yes.

265
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,560
- Do you know each other? - Did you go to school together?

266
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,760
- How many years apart were you? - She went to school in 2010.

267
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,570
- Are we three years apart? - Four years.

268
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,830
(Entered the university in 2014 and 2010)

269
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,170
- Four years? - That much?

270
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,240
- She's your senior? - Right.

271
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,640
Isn't Ye Eun older?

272
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,970
- Ye Eun isn't older. - No.

273
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,040
How is that possible?

274
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,370
- Isn't Ye Eun her senior? - Seriously?

275
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,010
- Ye Eun is... - Is Ye Eun younger?

276
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,180
- Eun Jin looks younger. - Is Ye Eun really younger than her?

277
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,810
(Teasing)

278
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,350
Hey.

279
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,250
I thought you'd be older than her.

280
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,150
(Teasing again)

281
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,450
- You look young. - I'm the senior.

282
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,950
- Are you older? - She looks young.

283
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
(Actually by 3 years)

284
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,620
- I'm four years older than her. - Eun Jin is the senior.

285
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,820
What?

286
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,790
(Teasing once again)

287
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,220
Is she younger?

288
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,920
(Slapping)

289
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,290
(He ended up getting slapped after teasing her.)

290
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,430
(The little Long Legs finally took care of the big Long Legs,)

291
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,530
(who kept getting on her nerves.)

292
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,930
She went to college in 2014, and you did in 2010.

293
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,100
(Arranging)

294
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,970
Ye Eun looks older.

295
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,040
And Seok Jin went to college in 1986... When was it?

296
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,540
Stop it. Why would you bring that up?

297
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,940
- I went to college in 1991. - That's when I was born.

298
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,810
(Shamelessly)

299
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,810
(1986)

300
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,140
- He went to college in 1986. - In 1991.

301
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,180
Why would you bring that up?

302
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,340
The 1986 Asian Games?

303
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,610
- Yes. - My goodness.

304
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,380
When did you go to college, Mu Jun?

305
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,680
In 2020.

306
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,980
- Gosh, he went to college in 2020. - In 2020.

307
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,290
- You went to college in 1986? - He's the youngest one.

308
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,560
(Running Man features people who went to college in 1986 and 2020.)

309
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,420
He's so young.

310
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,590
Today, we have...

311
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,730
- a variety of prizes prepared. - What?

312
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,730
- Really? - Yes.

313
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,700
Please bring in the prize table.

314
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,970
(Revealing the prize from the very beginning?)

315
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,700
What is that?

316
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,900
We get the prizes from the beginning?

317
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,140
They will show us the prizes and stop us from winning them.

318
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,570
(Spoiling the mood from the start)

319
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,570
- Come on! - I'm sure.

320
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,810
There must be some ridiculous things.

321
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,640
(Suspicious)

322
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,680
- There's a lot. - What's all this?

323
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,910
(Are the prizes as ridiculous as Detective Kim predicts?)

324
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,010
- Pine mushrooms. - Something ridiculous...

325
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,040
I want pine mushrooms.

326
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,280
- There's a lot. - Something ridiculous...

327
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,880
What's this?

00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,520
- There must be ridiculous things. - I want pine mushrooms.

329
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,520
(Onnuri gift certificates, fruit basket, pine mushroom)

330
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,250
- I need rice. - I want Onnuri gift certificates.

331
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,690
(Fortunately, there are a lot of decent prizes!)

332
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,090
- I want pine mushrooms. - What are Onnuri gift certificates?

333
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,890
- What's that? - What is the lead role ticket?

334
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,660
- What is this? - This is amazing.

335
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,190
(Rice, pork set, cup noodles, vitamin drink,)

336
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,620
(pine mushroom, fruit basket, Onnuri gift certificates,)

337
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,060
I want cup noodles.

338
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,430
(lead role ticket)

339
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,660
- This is amazing. - What's all this?

340
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,800
- There must be ridiculous things. - I want pine mushrooms.

341
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,200
(A total of 67 decent prizes)

342
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,060
- I want rice. - What's this?

343
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,930
This is the best one. Onnuri gift certificates.

344
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,400
(Excited)

345
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,530
- This is really good. - Onnuri gift certificates are nice.

346
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,600
(Pine mushroom)

347
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,570

- Onnuri gift certificates. - Lead role ticket?

351
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,310
(Lead role ticket)

352
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,370
- What's the lead role ticket? - Look at this.

353
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,640
- They are nice. - What's the lead role ticket?

354
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,140
(There are only 2 lead role tickets.)

355
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,910
What's the lead role ticket? What's this?

356
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,010
- What should I take? - Pine mushrooms.

357
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,950
Onnuri gift certificates are good. They're practically money.

358
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,110
- I'll take them no matter what. - All right.

359
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,620
(Motivated)

360
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,820
- Me too. - You can freely choose...

361
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,390
as many prizes...

362
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,260
- as you want. - Are you serious?

363
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,890
- What? - The members...

364
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,260
(Surprised)

365
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,460
who are exempt from the penalty...

366
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,260
will receive all the prizes they chose.

367
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,400
- All of them? - That's insane.

368
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,530
- All of them? - That's insane.

369
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,370
- If you don't get the penalty. - Then, one each...

370
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,300
- We should take one of each. - All of them.

371
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,170
Let me tell you about the lead role ticket you asked about.

372
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,310
(Revealing what the lead role ticket is)

373
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,410
It is a chance card that makes you the star of a race...

374
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,210
or gives you a special authority during a race.

375
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,410
- I should get it. - So, if you win the ticket,

376
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,850
we will plan a race only for you.

377
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,520
- Focused on the person? - For the entire episode... Yes.

378
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,990
- To make them the star of the day. - That's too much for me.

379
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,150
- I don't like it. - Right.

380
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,460
- It's a little uncomfortable, - To be honest...

381
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,920
- but it sounds nice. - Seok Jin would love it.

382
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,960
- Seok Jin likes it. - I like it.

383
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,960
That means I can get my own way.

384
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,060
Right.

385
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,760
Seok Jin, let's say you can get your own way.

386
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,900
Who do you want to get rid of first?

387
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,030
Of course, it's you.

388
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,300
You.

389
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,970
- Who's next? - It's you, you darn brat.

390
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,040
These three.

391
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,940
- You three are out. - You'll get rid of us?

392
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,310
- With his borrowed hair. - Borrowed hair.

393
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,580
(Teasing)

394
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,580
Borrowed hair.

395
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,780
(Will he get the lead role ticket?)

396
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,980
You may take the prizes...

397
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,750
(They can now choose the prizes they want.)

398
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,350
you want now.

399
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,380
- Really? - Yes.

400
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,120
- First, I'll take cup noodles. - I want these two.

401
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,950
(Crowding)

402
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,820
- I need Onnuri gift certificates. - I take Onnuri gift certificates.

403
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,060
Onnuri gift certificates.

404
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,190
- I want these two. - I need Onnuri gift certificates.

405
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,090
(Seok Sam picks up the lead role ticket first.)

406
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,690
I take Onnuri gift certificates.

407
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,090
(Next)

408
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,730
- Pine mushrooms. - Let's take them all.

409
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,530
- I need Onnuri gift certificates. - I take Onnuri gift certificates.

410
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,500
- Onnuri gift certificates. - I need Onnuri gift certificates.

411
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,330
(The Onnuri gift certificates are gone in seconds.)

412
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,630
Let's take them all.

413
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,870
- Hang on. Rice. - Rice.

414
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,910
(While the members pick without yielding)

415
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,800
- Pork set. - Let's take them all.

416
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,140
- Pork set. - Cup noodles.

417
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,870
- Cup noodles. - I think...

418
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,240
- At the end of the race... - What about the vitamin drinks?

419
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,110
- Vitamin drinks. - I should take the fruit basket.

420
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,650
- Pine mushrooms is good. - Can we take them all?

421
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,710
- All of them? - You can take them all.

422
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,950
- Fruit. - Let's take them all.

423
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,880
- Good. Rice. - Cup noodles. Let's take them all.

424
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,390
- All right. - Nice.

425
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,090
(The experienced Eun Jin chooses her prizes.)

426
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,750
I don't want cup noodles.

427
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,490
- Cup noodles. - I need the fruit basket.

428
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,890
(Mu Jun, born in 1998, is lost.)

429
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,030
Can we take them all?

430
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,560
Mu Jun, if you're like that, you can't take anything.

431
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,100
Let's take them all.

432
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,030
(I want some too.)

433
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
- Pork set. - Cup noodles. Let's take them all.

434
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,070
- Cup noodles. - Good.

435
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,640
(While Mu Jun is hesitating)

436
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,700
- I took them all. - Me too.

437
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,640
(Only the cheapest prizes are left.)

438
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,370
- How many? - I got eight.

439
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,010
Why aren't you taking this? I'll take it.

440
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,840
(In a rush)

441
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,810
- Can I have one? - Are you all done?

442
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,940
No, I...

443
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,610
(He only got 2.)

444
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,340
- One each. - Can I take more than one?

445
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,780
- I got seven. - Then...

446
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,620
(And another person is just watching.)

447
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,020
- I don't need cup noodles. - I'm done.

448
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,050
Two, four,

449
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,490
- six... - Why did you not take many?

450
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,350
I don't want cup noodles.

451
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,260
(Pork set and Onnuri gift certificates)

452
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,890
I just took what I needed.

453
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,120
- You can take this. - You're greedy.

454
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,760
(Bag Man has changed a lot.)

455
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,060
Are you all done?

456
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,630
I got five.

457
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,160
- Why did you not take more? - The thing is,

458
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,400
I don't need the other items.

459
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,270
- I just want these two. - I got a lot.

460
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,330
(Showing off the 2)

461
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,370
- You only took protein and this. - This is enough.

462
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,770
(Shocked)

463
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,900
This is enough.

464
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
(Giving some away)

465
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,070
(Excited)

466
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,170
She gave me the pork set.

467
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,370
Why did you not take more?

468
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,910
- How many pork sets did you take? - I just...

469
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,810
(Eun Jin)

470
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,040
- I got many pork sets. - I got two. Really?

471
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,310
- Eun Jin. - How many pork sets did you take?

472
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,780
(Thick)

473
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,980
How many pork sets did you take?

474
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,980
(Giving some away again)

475
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,910
- I'm sorry. I wanted to eat pork. - This is nice.

476
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,180
Vitamin?

477
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,180
Do any of you have an extra pine mushroom card?

478
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,390
I have one. Pine mushrooms.

479
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,490
(Giving the pine mushroom away)

480
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,420
Okay. Thank you.

481
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,820
- I have one more. - I have the vitamin drink one.

482
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,690
(Despite giving one away)

483
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,160
I got a lot.

484
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,590
I didn't take Onnuri gift certificates.

485
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,060
- Mu Jun, why did you not take more? - Okay.

486
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,360
- Hey. - How nice.

487
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,530
(She finally spots the prizeless junior.)

488
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,200
- You should give him some. - Why did you take only two?

489
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,070
(Here.)

490
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,300
- Thank you. - What?

491
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,130
- You took a lot. - Take the vitamin drink.

492
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,000
(Being generous)

493
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,230
Hey, you...

494
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,170
- I have four items now. - Give him cup noodles.

495
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,500
- Do you have the pine mushroom? - Something expensive.

496
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,810
- Do you want cup noodles? - Pine mushrooms

497
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,810
- Take this. - Yes.

498
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,080
- Pine mushrooms? - I suddenly got a lot.

499
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,440
- Do you want fruit? - Yes. Thank you.

500
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,540
Thank you, Seok Jin.

501
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,010
- Do you want fruit? - I have more items than you.

502
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,110
(Laughing)

503
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,120
- You should take this. - It can't be helped.

504
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,480
- You have a lot now. - I have nine items.

505
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,450
- It suddenly became nine. - He got it from everyone.

506
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,060
(A bumper year of donation)

507
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,490
- Right. - Show us what you got.

508
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,960
- It's time to talk. - Yes.

509
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,090
I got rice...

510
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,960
- You should do it like this. - Okay.

511
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,190
(Being kind)

512
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,230
Rice.

513
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,400
Fruit basket.

514
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,460
Cup noodles.

515
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,560
Pine mushrooms.

516
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,600
Vitamin drinks.

517
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,930
Vitamin drinks.

518
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,970
Pork set.

519
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,670
- Cup noodles. Vitamin drinks. - I see.

520
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,570
You got three boxes of vitamin drinks.

521
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,510
Rice. Pork set.

522
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,710
Cup noodles.

523
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,310
I got two boxes of cup noodles.

524
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,140
Pine mushrooms. Two fruit baskets.

525
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,180
That's a lot.

526
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,520
(The guests have packed a bunch.)

527
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,450
- That's a lot. - I'm quite greedy.

528
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,050
I got two boxes of pine mushrooms.

529
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,850
(8 items, 7 items, 6 items, 5 items, 5 items, 5 items, 5 items)

530
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,320
- The lead role ticket. - Lead role ticket.

531
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,990
(The other members have picked quite a lot as well.)

532
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,890
You got a lot.

533
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,790
- Just set a date. - He's greedy.

534
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,620
I got Onnuri gift certificates,

535
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,660
rice...

536
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,960
Three bags of rice.

537
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,130
Three bags of rice?

538
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,900
- Ji Hyo has an addiction to carbs. - Three?

539
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,060
- Three bags of rice? - Carbohydrate addiction.

540
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,200
Three bags of rice?

541
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,900
- This is why she's getting bigger. - Right.

542
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,640
Three pork sets.

543
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,370
Fruit basket.

544
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,670
Fruit basket.

545
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,870
- Well... - Cup noodles.

546
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,740
- That's a bulk-up diet. - A bulk-up diet.

547
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,450
All right. You all managed to get the items you wanted.

548
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,210
(Big Portions has picked up the most.)

549
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,820
Let me explain the rules of the race where you can win the prizes.

550
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,950
(Today's race has prizes.)

551
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,520
Today, we're having a race...

552
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,750
with the actors from the SBS drama, "Dynamite Kiss."

553
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,920
It is called the Dynamite Abandonment Race.

554
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,220
- The Dynamite Abandonment Race. - The Dynamite Abandonment Race.

555
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,790
It's an individual race.

556
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,960
Each member currently has...

557
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,830
- twenty penalty balls. - Oh, no.

558
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,530
The number of your penalty balls...

559
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,470
increases or decreases...

560
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,700
each time you give up something during the race.

561
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,670
You can also reduce your penalty balls through missions.

562
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,510
(The number of penalty balls changes...)

563
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,040
(according to each individual's choice.)

564
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,810
I will announce the teams...

565
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,810
you'll be participating in the mission with.

566
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,450
- Okay. - Team Jae Seok.

567
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,550
Yu Jae Seok, Jee Seok Jin, Haha,

568
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,620
Choi Daniel, and Ahn Eun Jin.

569
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,020
- The members... - Okay!

570
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,360
- Good. - Team Jong Kook.

571
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,390
Kim Jong Kook, Song Ji Hyo, Yang Se Chan,

572
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,660
- Ji Ye Eun, and Kim Mu Jun. - Okay!

573
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,200
- We will win. - Good.

574
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,440
(Team Jae Seok, Team Jong Kook)

575
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,130
Mr. Borrowed Hair, come here.

576
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,100
Good. Okay.

577
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,900
We will now give you the prizes...

578
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,740
(Revealing the preliminary team mission with the prizes on the line)

579
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,440
you just chose.

580
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,310
- You should work with your team... - Okay.

581
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,080
and put these prizes in your team car.

582
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,150
But this is...

583
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,080
Put these prizes in your team car.

584
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,920
But this is...

585
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,420
(As they expected, something was fishy!)

586
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,590
- Okay. - The car is...

587
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,190
parked down there.

588
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,290
(The car is within a 7-minute walking distance.)

589
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,860
- It's far. - It's a 6 to 7-minute walk.

590
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,830
(They must carry the items they chose.)

591
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,860
That doesn't make sense.

592
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,960
A sack of rice weighs 20kg.

593
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,430
It is quite heavy.

594
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,930
It will take a long time.

595
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,530
It will take 20 minutes.

596
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,930
We have to bring them to the car.

597
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,830
(Laughing bitterly)

598
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,300
If you get exhausted on your way to the car...

599
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,670
and give up your prize,

600
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,540
you and your team members will receive...

601
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,410
three penalty balls each for each prize you give up.

602
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,610
- What? - That's too many.

603
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,220
- That's ridiculous. - Come on!

604
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,650
- That's mean! - For everyone?

605
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,120
How are we supposed to manage...

606
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,650
- with a carb-lover on our team? - I can't believe you two.

607
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,990
- That's insane. - How many rice sacks did you take?

608
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
(3 sacks of rice)

609
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,160
Ji Hyo took too much rice.

610
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
How are we supposed to manage with a carb-lover on our team?

611
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,690
I shouldn't have taken so much rice.

612
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,890
(There was a reason the members could choose as they wished!)

613
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,590
- How many did you take? - It's not like I need it.

614
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,330
- How many did you take? - Carry three on your head.

615
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,130
(Motivated)

616
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,730
- Oh, no. - How can we carry these?

617
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,130
- We can't give anything up. - Unbelievable.

618
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,870
I knew it was odd that they let us take whatever we wanted.

619
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,470
Exactly. You're absolutely right.

620
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,470
Eun Jin, why did you take so much?

621
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,870
What's worse is that they're all heavy.

622
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,110
(What's more)

623
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,640
- It's worse than that. - You have the most.

624
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,010
- Fruit baskets and all that. - This is where greed leads you.

625
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,310
She's left with that much after giving a lot away.

626
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,250
You're right. She gave hers to Mu Jun.

627
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,350
Mu Jun didn't have so much.

628
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,080
- I only had two to begin with. - Unbelievable.

629
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,390
Tell me about it.

630
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,950
- I should've given him some more. - I only had two.

631
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,260
- He has a lot now. - And now...

632
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,590
Your van will take off in exactly ten minutes.

633
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,930
What you didn't load will count as prizes you gave up.

634
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,470
- Which leads to penalty balls. - So you must hurry.

635
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,470
Why did you park the car so far away?

636
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,940
(Annoyed)

637
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,200
Why are you so angry?

638
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,840
(Mr. Jee raises a fundamental question.)

639
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,270
- Why are you angry? - You're so angry today.

640
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,210
- It was for a reason. - Why is he so angry about it?

641
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,440
- They could've parked it there. - Big vans may not be allowed.

642
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,310
But the parking lot is right over there.

643
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,480
(Will they transfer the prizes to the end without giving up?)

644
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,850
For now, let's do our best.

645
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,720
- You're right. We've got this. - Hear me out.

646
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,950
Please bring in the prizes.

647
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,950
(Revealing the prizes in person)

648
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,520
What do we do?

649
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,350
- There's too much to carry. - What do we do with Ji Hyo's?

650
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,590
- Why do we have so much? - You have three sacks of rice.

651
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,590
Are those all the prizes?

652
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,090
- We have too much to carry. - They're both theirs.

653
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,230
- Both? - Two?

654
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,830
(Our team's)

655
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:01,730
(28 of Team Jae Seok's prizes are loaded onto 2 carts.)

656
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,200
Two carts, not one?

657
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,560
- Is there two? - How should we do this?

658
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,300
- Eun Jin. - What do we do?

659
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,700
- There's too much. - Jae Seok, look.

660
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,940
- It's called Locust Rice. - It's Locust Rice.

661
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,540
It's perfect.

662
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,110
Can we use the carts?

663
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,110
- You can't. - No?

664
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,310
- You may not use the carts. - We can't use the carts?

665
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,180
Ours fills up two carts as well.

666
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,180
No way. Wait, there are three.

667
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,080
- Check this out. - We have three carts.

668
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,620
- Three? - They have three carts.

669
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,820
(39 of Team Jong Kook's prizes are loaded onto 3 carts.)

670
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,590
- Seriously. - Come on!

671
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,160
- The ramyeon... - What on earth is this?

672
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,490
(To avoid extra penalty balls, they must transfer everything.)

673
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,620
Ours fills up three carts.

674
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,390
- Check out the vitamins. - This is for real.

675
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,690
First, take yours. Ye Eun, here you go.

676
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,700
Take yours.

677
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,730
- Pine mushroom for Ye Eun. - Isn't this heavy?

678
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,000
(Pine mushrooms)

679
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,570
- Ramyeon can't be this heavy. - Wait, this is heavy.

680
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,500
- This has to be fake. - Why is this heavy?

681
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,370
(The boxes are strangely heavy?)

682
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,640
I bet you added something in these ramyeon boxes.

683
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,970
Ramyeon can't be this heavy.

684
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,570
- How can pine mushrooms be heavy? - No way.

685
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,270
(Starting to nitpick)

686
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,970
- Why is this heavy? - Are you kidding me?

687
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,610
Check this out. Try carrying that.

688
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,910
The pricier items are designed to be heavier.

689
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,950
(Writer)

690
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,580
The pricier items are designed to be heavier.

691
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,680
(Pricier items were designed to be heavier.)

692
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,010
How are we supposed to carry these?

693
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,550
What about these gift certificates?

694
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,250
- Are pricier items heavier? - Pricier items...

695
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,120
(He understood.)

696
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,290
were designed to be heavier.

697
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,320
The lead role ticket?

698
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,920
(The best one is the lead role ticket.)

699
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,120
Wait. Someone should take this.

700
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,760
(It won't budge.)

701
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,660
See?

702
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,690
(The weight of the prizes:)

703
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,530
The lead role ticket is no joke!

704
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,200
(Cup noodles 3kg, vitamins 3kg,)

705
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,060
- You're right. It's a challenge. - Can we go back and forth?

706
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,100
(rice 10kg, pork 10kg, fruits 10kg, pine mushrooms 15kg,)

707
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,570
(Onnuri gift certificate 30kg, lead role ticket 30kg)

708
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,430
Within ten minutes, you can go back and forth...

709
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,770
- as much as you want. - Yes, that's allowed.

710
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,270
- Jong Kook, we're playing... - Yes.

711
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,670
- as a team today. - Right.

712
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,610
It'll be in our favor to load as much as we can.

713
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,740
(Obviously)

714
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,940
That's true.

715
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,480
Jong Kook, let's carry as much as we can.

716
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,010
(They all try to carry as much as they can!)

717
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,680
Se Chan.

718
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,820
(Pork 10kg and fruits 10kg)

719
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,780
Ye Eun!

720
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,380
Ye Eun, just carry two lighter things.

721
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,050
That's it. We should minimize the penalty balls we have to add,

722
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,590
(While everyone is struggling and figuring it out)

723
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,250
- so carry the lighter ones. - Got it.

724
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,520
- This and... - I'll do this.

725
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,220
- That and the pork. - Jong Kook!

726
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,430
- Here. Can I give up all of mine? - Try carrying those.

727
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,230
(Happily)

728
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,030
- Hold on. - What is it?

729
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,930
(Mu Jun, a first-timer on Running Man,)

730
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,430
Hold on.

731
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,600
You can't think about giving up so soon. If you do...

732
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,300
(slips up in front of Jong Kook.)

733
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,170
Carry whatever you can.

734
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,370
What are you willing to take?

735
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,470
The two boxes of vitamins.

736
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,770
Are you serious?

737
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,580
(2 boxes of vitamins are 6kg.)

738
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,640
Hold on a second. Grab a box of pine mushrooms.

739
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,180
- Got it. - Good.

740
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,110
(Kim Turbo, who debuted in 1995,)

741
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,110
- Also... The pine mushrooms. - This.

742
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,880
(disciplines the junior born in 1998.)

743
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,320
- Get a tight grip on it. - A grip.

744
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,480
- There you go. - I'm good.

745
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,420
(Mu Jun's items: Mushrooms 15kg,)

746
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,790
- Grab a heavier prize. Yes, good. - Got it.

747
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,820
Okay.

748
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,990
(vitamin drink 3kg)

749
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,050
You too.

750
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,160
This will burst.

751
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,960
- Pine mushrooms and pork. - The lead role ticket.

752
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,460
(Jong Kook's items: Pork 10kg, mushrooms 15kg)

753
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,490
Pine mushrooms and pork.

754
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,890
(They all carry as much as they can.)

755
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,060
I can come back for more.

756
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,270
(Team Jong Kook's item status, Carrying 11 out of 39)

757
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,530
Sure. You won't have a lot of time.

758
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,700
We need to run.

759
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,800
- I know. - Take what's yours first.

760
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
- Take yours. - Let's get going for now.

761
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,000
(Similarly, Team Jae Seok has a pile of items.)

762
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,540
Eun Jin, you won't be able to carry both fruit baskets.

763
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,310
(Eun Jin's items: Cup noodles 3kg, rice 10kg,)

764
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,870
- You might throw out your back. - Are you kidding me?

765
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,140
- The fruit... - It's like Eun Jin's moving.

766
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,110
(fruits 10kg, pork 10kg,)

767
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,240
- Why are the mushrooms so heavy? - Carry these.

768
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,950
(mushrooms 15kg)

769
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,610
- Why... - Why are there only these?

770
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,740
Where are my other prizes?

771
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,610
Isn't the rice all yours?

772
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,220
Are you saying they have my name on them?

773
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,350
It says so.

774
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,120
Having "locust" written on them doesn't make them mine.

775
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,020
- Really? What a bummer. - My name's written on mine.

776
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,960
(She failed to hand off the locust rice to the locust.)

777
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,790
What do I do?

778
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,190
No way.

779
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,260
Daniel, can you help me...

780
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,390
- Sure. - with these?

781
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,830
- Can you carry those? - What about this, Jae Seok?

782
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,400
(Eun Jin uses her bag strap to hoist the rice sack.)

783
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,470
What if I carried this for you? Wait, this is light.

784
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,440
We can carry each other's.

785
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,470
The van is parked down there by the entrance.

786
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,540
(Carrying a box of cup noodles too)

787
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:01,480
(Eun Jin's items: Cup noodles 3kg, rice 10kg)

788
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,710
- It's a downhill road. - No way.

789
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,710
Daniel, can you help me?

790
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,610
- What is it? - Can you get me...

791
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,150
- another box of ramyeon? - Ramyeon?

792
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,980
- Eun Jin, I'm impressed. - Eun Jin, wait.

793
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,680
- I can't give up so easily. - Here?

794
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,620
- Of course. We can't give up. - Right. Thank you.

795
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,720
Okay. Wait, did you secure it with your strap?

796
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,820
I think I can carry these.

797
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,090
Are you sure? Be careful.

798
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,130
I can do this.

799
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,030
- Can you reach down there? - I've got it!

800
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,900
(With a useful trick, Eun Jin carries a whopping 16kg.)

801
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,530
- I can carry all three. - Really?

802
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,770
What now?

803
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,070
Daniel, help!

804
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,700
(Jae Seok's items)

805
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,070
- Sure, Haha. - Here.

806
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,000
(As a result of the other members carrying a heavy load)

807
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,940
- Can you grab these for me? - Which one?

808
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,470
Even the lead role ticket.

809
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,270
(Seok Jin's items: Mushrooms 15kg, lead role ticket 30kg)

810
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,170
Everything I chose is heavy.

811
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,380
(Team Jae Seok's item status)

812
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,950
(Carrying 12 out of 28)

813
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,340
- This might fall. - Can you place that on top?

814
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,710
- Right here. - On top?

815
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,150
- When can you go? - Right now.

816
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,580
- Get ready. - I'm glad I got this much.

817
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,650
(The 10-minute time limit starts.)

818
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,350
The current time is 10:30am.

819
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,550
- Ye Eun, let's go for now. - Come on.

820
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,750
- Head out for now. - Jong Kook.

821
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,150
- Are you sure about this? - Okay, let's go.

822
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,490
(The items they fail to load onto the team's bus...)

823
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,060
- Are you sure? - All right, come on.

824
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,030
(within the 7-minute walking distance are eliminated.)

825
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,390
- Here. - I've got this.

826
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,160
(You'll get penalty balls...)

827
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
(depending on how many items you failed to load.)

828
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,900
I'm starving.

829
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,340
I'm so hungry.

830
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,840
(The players in the lead stride ahead.)

831
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,810
Where's the van?

832
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,380
- Good. - Oh, no.

833
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,410
(Meanwhile, those trailing behind are groaning and moaning.)

834
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,780
(Lead role ticket 30kg)

835
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,720
(Mushrooms 15kg)

836
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,160
(Mushrooms 15kg, vitamin drink 3kg, cup noodles 3kg)

837
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,690
Se Chan, you're carrying a lot.

838
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,830
(Se Chan stops for a second.)

839
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,900
I can't do this. No way.

840
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,960
I can't hold onto them.

841
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,330
- Oh, no. - Seriously, I'd like to drag these.

842
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,400
I can't hold onto them.

843
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,300
- Darn. - I couldn't hold onto them,

844
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,710
- so I left that behind. - This is crazy.

845
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,580
(He gives one up not long after he takes off.)

846
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,850
(The weak Ye Eun moves at a snail's pace with a 10kg box.)

847
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,610
This is crazy.

848
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,810
This is crazy.

849
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,120
No!

850
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,750
- Forget the rice. - What...

851
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,050
This must be at least 50kg.

852
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,460
(Haha gives up the 10kg rice.)

853
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,360
Forget the rice.

854
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,290
Hey, Mu Jun!

855
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,090
Hold on.

856
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,560
(Meanwhile, Mu Jun...)

857
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,700
Hello.

858
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,900
(Greeting the cameraman)

859
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,240
(He's carrying 15kg of mushrooms and 2 boxes of 3kg vitamins.)

860
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,040
Hold on a second.

861
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,010
(He suddenly puts down his items.)

862
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,340
Mu Jun, what are you doing?

863
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,480
- I... - It's too soon for a break.

864
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,380
(He's going back?)

865
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,450
- Mu Jun! - Yes?

866
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,820
(Mu Jun comes back to where the items are.)

867
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,390
How about this?

868
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,290
I'll be moving five at once.

869
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,160
I could go back and forth like this.

870
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,730
(Can he make the round trip in 10 minutes?)

871
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,830
(Meanwhile, those in the lead)

872
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,770
(Carrying 16kg by herself)

873
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,540
Gosh, look at Eun Jin go.

874
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,840
Oh, no!

875
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,240
(Oh, no!)

876
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,110
(Spilling)

877
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,780
- Are you okay? - Eun Jin, oh no.

878
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,980
Eun Jin, are you all right?

879
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,780
(Crying)

880
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,420
- That's huge. - Are you okay?

881
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,720
- Aren't you hurt? - I'm all right.

882
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,850
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

883
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,690
- I'm fine. - Gosh, this is really heavy.

884
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,950
(Cheering herself on)

885
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,950
I can't believe it.

886
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,090
Eun Jin, give me the rice.

887
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,690
- That's all right. - Or give me one of the boxes.

888
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,860
How about this, then?

889
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,430
- I'll take one. - Hold on.

890
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,400
(Senior Locust offers a helping hand.)

891
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,500
- Here. - What if we swap these?

892
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,570
I don't mind.

893
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,870
No, put that on top of this.

894
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,540
- That'll be too heavy. - Place it on top.

895
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,670
I'm fine.

896
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,910
(Tossing one of Eun Jin's cup noodle boxes)

897
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,640
- That'll be too heavy. - I'm good.

898
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,610
- It's not that heavy. - Sometimes, less is better.

899
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,140
(Spoiling the mood)

900
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,870
Let's go.

901
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,280
(Creating a heartwarming scene on a university campus)

902
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,710
No way. Jae Seok is carrying four items.

903
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,150
(Jae Seok, the college dropout)

904
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,650
Darn.

905
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,720
- Can you carry those? - Sure.

906
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,120
(Eun Jin finds the strength to take off again.)

907
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,420
My gosh.

908
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,190
Darn.

909
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,490
Where's the van?

910
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,430
(At that moment,)

911
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,360
Do we have to go downhill?

912
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,970
(a steep downhill appears before the item expedition team.)

913
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,560
Are you kidding me?

914
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,260
Do we have to go down there?

915
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,670
Where's the van?

916
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,700
- No way. - Seriously?

917
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,300
(Time remaining)

918
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,600
(About half of the 10 minutes has passed.)

919
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,040
Gosh, this is too heavy.

920
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,140
If I could, I'd throw them all.

921
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,010
(Only if they transfer the items without giving up...)

922
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,510
Haha, you've gotten stronger.

923
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,880
(will they earn them as prizes!)

924
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,080
- You have five minutes left. - Hold on.

925
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,980
(Destination)

926
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,580
(With 5 minutes remaining, Eun Jin is halfway there.)

927
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,780
- Really? - Wait.

928
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,080
(Sighing)

929
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,180
(Panting)

930
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,590
Is this "Physical: 100?"

931
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,620
Stay focused!

932
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,320
(A sudden change)

933
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,360
Okay, let's go.

934
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,390
(While Eun Jin wonders what show she's on)

935
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,400
(The oldest player is unsteady on his feet.)

936
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,200
I'm good. I'm doing fine.

937
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,630
I'm all right.

938
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,500
(Wobbling)

939
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,770
I'm...

940
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,870
I'm all right.

941
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,370
I can do this.

942
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,970
Guys, I need your support!

943
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,580
(Cheering)

944
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,010
Thanks!

945
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,580
(Seok Sam's cheering squad suddenly forms.)

946
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,980
Go, Seok Jin.

947
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,710
I say "Jee," you say "Seok Jin."

948
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,280
- Jee. - Seok Jin!

949
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,620
I say "go," you say "Seok Jin."

950
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,050
- Go. - Seok Jin!

951
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,320
(Groaning)

952
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,890
(Seok Jin drops.)

953
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,830
Jee Seok Jin.

954
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,130
(Coughing)

955
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,760
- Jee Seok Jin. - Jee Seok Jin!

956
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,170
Jee Seok Jin.

957
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,900
(Slipping)

958
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,400
- Jee... - Seok Jin.

959
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,900
Thank you. I'll do my best.

960
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,610
(Mushrooms of 15kg and lead role ticket of 30kg)

961
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,540
How much does this actually weigh?

962
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,750
(Seok Sam ended up carrying the heaviest items.)

963
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,750
I can't give up the pine mushrooms...

964
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,520
(The dilemma)

965
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,880
or the lead role ticket.

966
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,820
Darn. Darn it.

967
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,590
I should take this first...

968
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,090
(He takes off with the more valuable lead role ticket first.)

969
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,420
and come back for this later.

970
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,090
I'll come back for that.

971
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,130
If I only bring these two,

972
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,870
Jong Kook will chew me out.

973
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,030
(Correct)

974
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,140
(He puts down the two cup noodle boxes.)

975
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,070
(He runs back for the mushrooms and vitamin drinks he left behind)

976
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,480
- All right. Let's go. - Make it count while you're at it.

977
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,410
(He pushes forward with these items.)

978
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,340
- Go, Seok Jin. - Okay.

979
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,650
(Destination)

980
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,780
I think I moved the most so far. Five items.

981
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:45,390
(An odd strategy where he moves two items a short distance.)

982
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,160
I moved five items.

983
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,330
Hang on.

984
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,890
(While Mu Jun is struggling)

985
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,930
(Destination)

986
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,330
(Jae Seok's in the lead and has almost reached the car.)

987
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,740
(Team Jong Kook's car, Team Jae Seok's car)

988
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,570
Where do I put these?

989
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,380
(1st to arrive)

990
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,710
My gosh.

991
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,920
(Jae Seok's items: Cup noodles 3kg, vitamin drink 3kg,)

992
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,420
(rice 10kg, Eun Jin's cup noodles 3kg)

993
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,390
- I can't make another trip. - There's no way.

994
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,320
- You can't. There's no way. - You...

995
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,660
(Jong Kook arrives after Jae Seok.)

996
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,260
- You'll rip your forearm muscle. - Go for quality over quantity.

997
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:28,770
(Jong Kook's items: Pork 10kg, mushrooms 15kg)

998
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,160
You'll rip a forearm muscle.

999
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,830
Don't your arms hurt really bad?

1000
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,200
It's no joke.

1001
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
I mean...

1002
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,700
(Daniel arrives with cup noodles, vitamin drink, and rice.)

1003
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,340
- I thought I'd ripped a muscle. - Me too. Okay!

1004
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:38,040
(Time remaining)

1005
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,810
- It's no joke, is it? - How did you carry all four?

1006
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,110
(Tenacious Eun Jin arrived with 3 minutes to spare.)

1007
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,610
(With Jae Seok's help)

1008
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,710
I got these too.

1009
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,720
(Eun Jin's items: Cup noodles 3kg, rice 10kg)

1010
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,180
- My gosh. - I'm done.

1011
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,820
(Haha's mushrooms and pork are safely loaded too.)

1012
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,560
Hey, taxi. Taxi!

1013
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,390
Sorry.

1014
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,030
(Groggy state)

1015
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,800
Give me that. I'll take it.

1016
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:05,170
(Team Jong Kook's Se Chan brought his mushrooms and cup noodles.)

1017
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,170
Okay.

1018
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,040
(And Ji Hyo's rice and pork have arrived.)

1019
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,440
Give me that.

1020
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,570
- Jong Kook. Thanks. - Sure.

1021
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,180
Hey. Where is she? Hurry up.

1022
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,550
Se Chan!

1023
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,520
(He delivers Ye Eun's fruit right before the deadline.)

1024
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,680
Run. Bring two.

1025
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,120
There's no time. Move it.

1026
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,120
(With 3 minutes remaining, the ones left are...)

1027
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,690
You have three minutes left!

1028
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,720
Where's the car?

1029
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,990
(Team Jae Seok's Seok Sam and Team Jong Kook's Mu Jun.)

1030
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,660
- Three minutes! - Is this it, Eun Jin?

1031
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,760
Yes!

1032
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
Seok Sam, you brought that one thing?

1033
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,600
No. I'll go back.

1034
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,260
(To get the mushrooms)

1035
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,160
- We have three minutes. - There's just three minutes.

1036
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,430
I'll go back anyway.

1037
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,470
- Where's the rest? Halfway here? - Darn.

1038
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,670
I'll get them.

1039
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,570
What do I do with this?

1040
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,610
(The heaviest lead role ticket is safe.)

1041
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,040
Put it on the top.

1042
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,710
- You don't disappoint. - You brought just two, Mu Jun?

1043
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,040
(And Mu Jun is carrying the cup noodles.)

1044
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,980
- It's better than too much. - Give me something. I'll help.

1045
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,980
- Move faster. - Give me something. I'll help.

1046
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,950
(The opposing team)

1047
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,320
- No, I'm fine. - Let me help.

1048
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,680
I can manage.

1049
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,190
No, seriously!

1050
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,950
(Taking it)

1051
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,150
(Screaming)

1052
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,490
That's mine! Wait!

1053
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,960
(Stealing it)

1054
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,390
- She took mine. - I stole it.

1055
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,590
- Hey! - It's ours now.

1056
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,130
(Laughing)

1057
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,060
- Hey! - It's now ours.

1058
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,960
- It's mine! - Don't we have that already?

1059
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,370
- Yes. - Takers keepers.

1060
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,800
- Put it in our car. - Ahn Eun Jin!

1061
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,630
Hang on. That's mine.

1062
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,340
(She arrives at her team's car with the other team's item.)

1063
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,440
That's mine.

1064
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,940
That's mine.

1065
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,070
(Mu Jun is dumbfounded.)

1066
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,710
- Hey. - Eun Jin.

1067
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,740
That's...

1068
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,580
Hang on.

1069
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,310
(He loads one box first.)

1070
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,710
- Ahn Eun Jin. - Isn't it over if I load it?

1071
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,980
- No, it has his name on it. - My name's on it.

1072
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,780
It belongs to the team that loads it in their car.

1073
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,420
(The witty trick is acceptable.)

1074
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,990
- What? - What? For real?

1075
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:34,120
(It belongs to the team who puts it in the trunk.)

1076
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,190
- Good job. - Then...

1077
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,960
- Come here. - Yes!

1078
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,930
(Meanwhile, Team Jae Seok is off to get...)

1079
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,730
- Where's the rest? - I left something.

1080
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,100
Where did you put it?

1081
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,360
(the mushrooms Seok Sam left behind.)

1082
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,830
Where did I leave it?

1083
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,600
(They go far back...)

1084
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,170
Where are we going?

1085
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,070
- Whose is this? - Take it.

1086
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,070
- Can we take another team's? - Let's take it.

1087
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,670
(The two boxes of vitamin drink and mushrooms...)

1088
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,170
Pine mushrooms?

1089
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,980
(belong to Mu Jun.)

1090
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,510
- Let's go. - Pick it up.

1091
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,880
(Stealing them right away)

1092
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,350
Take that end. One, two, three.

1093
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,650
- I know. - We can rip this.

1094
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,220
Rip off the name tag.

1095
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,490
- Rip it. - Take it off.

1096
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,620
(Kim Mu Jun)

1097
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,620
Let's take these.

1098
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,630
(He leaves his mushrooms and takes Mu Jun's vitamin drinks.)

1099
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,890
Go. Let's go.

1100
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,300
We're thieves.

1101
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,270
Let me help you.

1102
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,800
(At that moment, they meet Mu Jun.)

1103
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,570
Let me help you.

1104
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,170
- No, we're fine. - Let me help.

1105
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,570
- It's okay. - No, thanks.

1106
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,970
- Keep going. - Is that mine?

1107
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,410
- No, Mu Jun. - It's not yours.

1108
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,640
It's not mine?

1109
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,880
It is yours. Sorry.

1110
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,310
Let me help.

1111
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,780
(Just then, they bump into Team Jong Kook's bandit.)

1112
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,880
- No. - Leave it.

1113
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,450
- Give it to me. - No.

1114
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,050
- It's ours. - Okay.

1115
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,050
(Lying)

1116
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,780
- It's ours. - It's ours.

1117
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,150
(Not realizing it belongs to Mu Jun,)

1118
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,550
- We'll help. - No. It's ours.

1119
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,690
- No! - It's ours.

1120
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,420
(they let the mushrooms go.)

1121
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,120
Hey!

1122
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,820
- No! - Hey!

1123
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,960
(However, they successfully take the vitamin drink.)

1124
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,360
You have 30 seconds to go.

1125
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
- Thirty seconds. - No.

1126
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,700
Let's rip that off.

1127
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,500
(A box of vitamin drink and mushrooms...)

1128
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
- No. - Wait.

1129
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,600
(belonging to Team Jong Kook's Mu Jun...)

1130
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,330
- It's ours. - Give it to me.

1131
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,700
- It's ours. - Get it inside.

1132
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,640
(is now with Team Jae Seok.)

1133
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,700
It's ours.

1134
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,140
We got the lead role ticket too.

1135
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,840
(Mu Jun managed to get one box of drinks back.)

1136
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,880
- Did you get it? - I stole one.

1137
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,340
My... What?

1138
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,350
(Mu Jun has realized something is off.)

1139
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,480
My... Wait.

1140
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,350
Here... The golden box...

1141
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,350
(Empty)

1142
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,080
My vitamin...

1143
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,920
(Flustered)

1144
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,390
What...

1145
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,960
(To the cameramen)

1146
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,220
Did you film everything?

1147
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:15,960
How...

1148
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,630
(While Mu Jun's fumbling around,)

1149
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,560
The time is up.

1150
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,030
(time is up.)

1151
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,800
We'll check what you brought over and loaded so far.

1152
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,570
- Okay. - The lead role ticket.

1153
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,100
(It's 30kg.)

1154
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,900
How much does it weigh?

1155
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,800
- The... - It must weigh like 50kg.

1156
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,370
You... Did you run over with my stuff?

1157
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,610
- No. - No.

1158
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,380
- No. - I was carrying your stuff,

1159
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,710
(Mu Jun got caught off guard.)

1160
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,410
but he took it from me.

1161
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,780
- What a relief. - That was yours?

1162
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,250
- No. - No.

1163
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,420
Your name isn't on it.

1164
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,450
(Brazenly)

1165
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,720
- No wonder. - Is your name on it?

1166
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:44,090
(They've already taken the stickers off.)

1167
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,950
- No. - It's a fake.

1168
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,990
- We... - Your name's not on it.

1169
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,090
It's ours.

1170
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,360
- I offered to help. - Well...

1171
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,030
(The pure youth carried 5 and had 4 stolen.)

1172
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,320
You ran off, saying you could manage.

1173
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,590
It was ours, Mu Jun.

1174
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,360
It was ours. You were mistaken.

1175
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,530
(Playing innocent)

1176
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,460
Close the trunk.

1177
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,730
You...

1178
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,500
- I... - You have a crush on Eun Jin.

1179
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,870
- I don't. - Okay.

1180
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,070
- You're ready to kiss her. Okay. - No.

1181
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,400
(Seizing the chance to promote)

1182
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,770
I get it now.

1183
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:07,740
(Their loads will be given out as prizes.)

1184
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,980
We'll head to the next location with the items...

1185
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,140
- you loaded in the trunk. - Okay.

1186
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,550
- Got it. - Get in the car.

1187
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,150
(As a result of adding as many penalty balls...)

1188
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,410
- We don't drive these cars? - We go that way?

1189
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,550
(as the number of items they gave up)

1190
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,120
- We ride that? - We go back?

1191
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,150
- I lost everything. - Good job!

1192
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,720
(Item transfer result)

1193
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,050
- That was my workout for the day. - All the effort to bring them...

1194
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,750
(Team Jae Seok, gave up 13 out of 28,)

1195
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,820
(39 penalty balls along with individual ones)

1196
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,020
(Team Jong Kook, gave up 22 out of 36,)

1197
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,590
It weighs 30kg. Gosh.

1198
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,260
(66 penalty balls along with individual ones)

1199
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,590
Okay!

1200
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,890
That's Jong Kook's seat.

1201
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,960
(Getting on the tour bus)

1202
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,960
- Is it? - No.

1203
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,530
- It's the seat of power. - No.

1204
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,600
- What on earth? - My seat belt.

1205
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,960
What do you mean?

1206
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,730
- What on earth? - Why say that?

1207
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,430
(The two giants bicker.)

1208
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,300
- What's going on? - What's up with you two?

1209
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,800
- What's happening? - He follows me around.

1210
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,140
(Shamelessly)

1211
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,900
I sat down first.

1212
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,140
(The rotten romantic subplot is showing signs of revival.)

1213
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,780
It looks like Niel found a target.

1214
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,910
He did.

1215
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,710
Ye Eun, what do you think about Mu Jun?

1216
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,710
- What? - A younger guy...

1217
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,780
You don't go for younger guys? Okay.

1218
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,750
- Mu Jun. - Why are...

1219
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,190
the love triangle people...

1220
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,490
- Is that so? - sitting in the front?

1221
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,460
- Hello. - Open your mouth.

1222
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,720
Open wide.

1223
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,790
You're being looked after.

1224
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,730
- It's because Ye Eun... - Yes.

1225
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,200
While she was ill...

1226
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Yes, she felt comforted.

1227
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,100
That's when you really think.

1228
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,500
- Yes. - Also,

1229
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,800
- Se Chan might have said something. - Yes.

1230
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,400
- Yes. - "There's nothing to it."

1231
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,270
- You never know. - Go for a caring guy.

1232
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,440
- That's the best. - You talked to Se Chan a lot.

1233
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:13,310
(The two often talked on the phone while Ye Eun took a break.)

1234
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,940
- Yes. - Look at that gaze.

1235
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,110
My gosh.

1236
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,710
It was so annoying how he kept calling.

1237
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,820
(Ddochi's counterattack)

1238
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,250
Hey!

1239
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,620
- Se Chan. - That's how you took it?

1240
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,620
- Se Chan. - I mean...

1241
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,490
You never call me once.

1242
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,120
(Suddenly jealous)

1243
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,490
- How could you? - My gosh.

1244
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,520
- He was obsessed. - Me?

1245
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,630
- You never call me. - I was obsessed?

1246
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,890
Say I miss his call but don't call him back.

1247
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,960
He calls me again.

1248
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,700
He'll never make you feel lonely if you were to date him.

1249
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,530
(Out of the blue)

1250
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,430
- Yes. - You'll never feel uneasy.

1251
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,040
- Yes. - Eun Jin.

1252
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,440
(What was that just now?)

1253
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,800
- Eun Jin. - What?

1254
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,970
What do you think?

1255
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,240
He's great.

1256
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,040
(Thumbs up)

1257
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,780
- Gosh. - It means "get lost."

1258
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,780
- She doesn't care. - I should disappear.

1259
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,280
(A sign that she's not interested)

1260
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,150
- Once you fall, there's no way out. - Right.

1261
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,720
- That's true. - An idol singer fell for him once.

1262
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,690
(Starting again)

1263
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,620
- His idol singer ex. - Stop it.

1264
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,250
- Goodness. - Anyway,

1265
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,260
I hope Se Chan...

1266
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,320
(With Ye Eun)

1267
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,560
- finds someone soon. - Yes.

1268
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,890
What if you had to pick between Se Chan and Niel?

1269
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,890
What about you?

1270
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,860
- Me? - Yes. What about you?

1271
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,460
(A balance game nobody asked for suddenly begins.)

1272
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,260
You should tell too.

1273
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,300
- Yes. - What about you?

1274
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,270
(Is it Se Chan or Niel?)

1275
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,130
Take your pick. Is it Niel...

1276
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,140
- You choose. - Yes.

1277
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,870
I really don't like younger guys.

1278
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,670
(Avoiding)

1279
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,140
- Just pick. - Be honest.

1280
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,670
- Forget our age. - Put their ages aside.

1281
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,270
Eun Jin, you can say.

1282
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,280
(The question is tossed to Eun Jin.)

1283
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,380
What if you had to pick?

1284
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,780
- Who is it? - It's just these two.

1285
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,310
- Eun Jin. - Actually,

1286
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,080
I don't know either of you that well.

1287
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,080
What's your MBTI?

1288
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,050
- My MBTI? It's ISFP. - Yes, ask that.

1289
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,480
- It's ISFP. - You're ISFP?

1290
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,620
- Yes. - ISFP.

1291
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,590
- ENTP. - ENTP?

1292
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,620
- Yes. Isn't it good? - This is a tough one.

1293
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,330
- Why so? - Then...

1294
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,590
Then...

1295
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:39,960
(Who will Eun Jin pick?)

1296
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,530
Then I must say...

1297
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,530
Then I must say...

1298
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,400
- ISFP? - Se Chan.

1299
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,600
Wait.

1300
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,970
Can you answer again without saying "I must say?"

1301
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,870
Whatever the case, it's you.

1302
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,070
- Why? - Why him?

1303
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,510
- Why did you ask? - Why ask for his MBTI?

1304
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,580
(Why did she pick the monkfish?)

1305
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,480
I don't know them well, so I wanted to get a feel.

1306
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,810
He's pretty witty.

1307
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,250
You didn't consider their looks.

1308
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,350
- You don't care how they look. - But he's cute.

1309
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,450
- He's cute? - You must look approachable.

1310
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,050
- He's cute? - You must look approachable.

1311
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,420
- You're so nice. - Eun Jin.

1312
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,890
- Are you serious? - She doesn't care for looks.

1313
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,460
Eun Jin, didn't you say I was your ideal type?

1314
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,330
- Did you say that? - You're really cool.

1315
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,630
("Ahn Eun Jin's Ideal Type is Choi Daniel")

1316
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,630
- You're cool, but... - When did you say that?

1317
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,670
(It's surprisingly real.)

1318
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,030
- You said that? - Did you really?

1319
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,730
- When I was in my 20s... - In her 20s.

1320
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,170
- Long ago. - You said that in an interview.

1321
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,340
- You watched "High Kick." - My sitcom days.

1322
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,400
(Nodding)

1323
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,340
- She liked you on "High Kick." - That was it?

1324
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,310
She liked your character, not you.

1325
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,670
(An extreme thinker)

1326
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,440
I saw him on TV and thought...

1327
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,180
he was smart and cool.

1328
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,580
- Him? - He's not.

1329
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,680
- He spilled milk down the front. - Yes.

1330
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,780
He's a bit silly in real life.

1331
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,650
(What she must've seen)

1332
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,880
- What? - Okay, next.

1333
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,990
(Who will Ye Eun pick?)

1334
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,150
- Ye Eun's next. - Me?

1335
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,150
- Ye Eun's next. - Me? I pick Se Chan.

1336
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,060
(Answering right away)

1337
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,060
- Why? - Me? I pick Se Chan.

1338
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,260
- Why? - I see.

1339
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,430
I need a reason.

1340
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,990
(Laughing)

1341
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,930
Look at Daniel's face.

1342
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,130
- Why? - I need a reason.

1343
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,660
Look at Daniel's face.

1344
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Look.

1345
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,270
Daniel's expression is turning darker.

1346
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,340
This is no fun.

1347
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,900
(Sulking)

1348
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,370
- Why is this not fun? - It's not fun at all.

1349
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,070
- You used to be... - It's no fun.

1350
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,840
(In the past)

1351
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,570
Choi Daniel on "High Kick."

1352
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,880
Yes. He peaked then.

1353
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,350
We need to hear the reason.

1354
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,610
(Why did she choose Se Chan?)

1355
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,350
- Yes. - What's your reason?

1356
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,680
Se Chan is way more quick-witted.

1357
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,980
- Yes. - And way more funny.

1358
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,980
Yes, good.

1359
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,690
- That was a good one. - Why won't you even look at him?

1360
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,260
I can only see the back of your head.

1361
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:13,790
(She has her back turned to him.)

1362
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,590
She's sitting with her back to him.

1363
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,320
- I can only see your back. - Daniel's so funny.

1364
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,290
(Lastly, who will Ji Hyo pick?)

1365
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,190
- Then... - It's the charm factor.

1366
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,630
- Why can't you say? - Name someone.

1367
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,500
- Me? Se Chan. - Yes.

1368
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,930
(Yang Se Chan got all the votes.)

1369
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,570
What does that make him?

1370
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,070
- Why didn't you name him? - Yes.

1371
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,170
This is really no fun.

1372
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,070
You have to pick one of us, Se Chan.

1373
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,940
- Yes, Se Chan. - Three women chose you.

1374
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,510
- Three... - They all chose you.

1375
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,380
(It's time for Yang Se Chan, the landslide winner, to pick!)

1376
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,780
Se Chan. Will this day ever come?

1377
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,650
- Yes. You never know. - Gosh.

1378
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,210
This is a beautiful day for me.

1379
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,250
Hey, this is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of day, for sure.

1380
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,820
(Acting pretty?)

1381
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,350
It's the best day.

1382
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,690
- What if it's these three? - Yes.

1383
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,160
(Three women are competing for Baby Octopus Prince's hand.)

1384
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,790
- At the same time. - They're all clinging to you.

1385
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,790
- Try to imagine it. - Be honest.

1386
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,830
- Really honest. - You have to date one of us.

1387
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,090
- You have to go out with her. - That's right.

1388
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,160
There would be articles about you.

1389
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,060
(Who will be chosen by Se Chan?)

1390
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,660
- Articles? - You have to date one of us.

1391
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,960
- He's so happy. - Who will it be?

1392
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,500
I pick Ji Ye Eun.

1393
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,470
(Energetically)

1394
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,140
(He picks Ji Ye Eun.)

1395
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,570
Why?

1396
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,440
- Why is he doing that? - What?

1397
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,970
- What did you say? - She likes it!

1398
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,040
I pick Ji Ye Eun.

1399
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,340
(Bummed out?)

1400
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,570
- Oh, no! - Why?

1401
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,140
- No! - Hey, what?

1402
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,540
- What was that? - No!

1403
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,910
(Smiling brightly for the first time in a while)

1404
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,910
- My goodness. - Look at his face.

1405
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,280
- Look. - This is for real.

1406
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,580
- Ahn Eun Jin... - I mean...

1407
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,750
- Listen to my reason. - Hey, you...

1408
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,120
- If Ahn Eun Jin... - I mean...

1409
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,620
Hey, this is fun!

1410
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,860
(The popular guy explains his reason.)

1411
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,460
- My gosh. - He said this was fun.

1412
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,490
- But... - Ahn Eun Jin.

1413
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,890
- If you and I... - Ahn Eun Jin was eliminated.

1414
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,660
(Eun Jin)

1415
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,430
- were dating and rumors spread, - She was eliminated.

1416
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,530
everyone would be focused on you.

1417
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,560
That's how I feel.

1418
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,900
- You think people will hate on you? - Yes, kind of.

1419
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,070
- I think that might happen. - That's right.

1420
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,840
But if I were to date Ye Eun, I would just...

1421
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,910
Look at her face.

1422
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,540
It would just be a lot of fun.

1423
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,880
- You mean she's easy? - Just enough...

1424
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,180
(What is he saying?)

1425
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,210
- Just enough. - You two are similar.

1426
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,910
There would be a scandal if I were to date Ji Hyo too.

1427
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,080
(Yang Se Chan keeps annoying her.)

1428
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,880
How could I ever date Song Ji Hyo?

1429
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,350
What's wrong with him?

1430
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,220
Oh, do you think she is the easy choice,

1431
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,890
- to put it lightly? - Is that how it is?

1432
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,020
The headline of the article would be like,

1433
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,390
"Yang Se Chan finally seduces Ji Ye Eun in three seconds."

1434
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,520
("Ji Ye Eun Falls for Yang Se Chan in 3 Seconds")

1435
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,090
I think it would say something like that.

1436
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,090
(Predicting the article title)

1437
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,160
It's so funny that Eun Jin was rejected too.

1438
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,430
I'm going to write in my diary tonight as I cry.

1439
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,730
This is so funny.

1440
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,600
She's good at acting, but she's also good at variety shows.

1441
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,930
(Eun Jin can do everything from humoring others to acting well.)

1442
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,830
- Eun Jin can sing well too. - She's a good singer.

1443
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,540
- She has a great personality too. - She's a great singer.

1444
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,040
- Mu Jun. - I'm good at doing cartwheels too.

1445
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,970
Are you good at cartwheels? So am I.

1446
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,670
- Can you do cartwheels? - I'm good at cartwheels.

1447
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,280
(A cartwheel rival has appeared.)

1448
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,770
Oh, really?

1449
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,040
- Mu Jun. - Yes?

1450
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,410
Mu Jun, what are you good at?

1451
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,110
He studied modern dance.

1452
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,950
(Suddenly)

1453
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,110
- Really? - Is that so?

1454
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,850
(There's a tip-off that he knows how to do modern dance.)

1455
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,680
How long did you study modern dance for?

1456
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,120
Not that long.

1457
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,020
- Not that long? - I did it for college admissions.

1458
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,290
Hey, did you do modern dance?

1459
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,290
By the way,

1460
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,960
- on the phone before coming here, - Yes?

1461
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,590
since it's Mu Jun's first time on a variety show,

1462
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,530
I asked him, "Mu Jun, did you prepare a couple of talents?"

1463
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:33,100
(Chatting)

1464
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,630
And he asked, "Eun Jin, do I have to prepare something?"

1465
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,560
"Of course. Are you trying to be a freeloader?"

1466
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,130
(Eun Jin is adding fuel to the fire.)

1467
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,730
- What did he prepare? - "You can't do that."

1468
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,730
"You can't behave that way."

1469
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,100
"We have to try our best."

1470
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,570
- Then... - Right, we're going there now.

1471
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,770
(They have...)

1472
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,040
So, he's still thinking about it.

1473
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,700
(great teamwork.)

1474
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
- Later on... - Oh, okay.

1475
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,140
- Oh, Mu Jun. - Yes.

1476
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,270
Mu Jun can do a backflip.

1477
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:49,150
(Another baseless tip-off about Mu Jun's personal talent)

1478
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,710
- A backflip. - Really?

1479
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,250
- Hey, do we get to see it today? - Well, it's not that.

1480
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,550
Have you prepared an acrostic poem with Running Man?

1481
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,720
- Okay, let's go. - Let's see it.

1482
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:56,550
(They arrive at the place where Mu Jun will play a big role!)

1483
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,920
That's a huge talent.

1484
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,850
- Indeed, teasing you is the best. - A backflip.

1485
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,720
So, we'll start the first mission...

1486
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:01,660
(The first mission that'll help reduce the penalty balls)

1487
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,590
where you can reduce the number of penalty balls.

1488
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,690
- What is it? - The mission is...

1489
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,390
Dynamite Peck.

1490
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,260
(Dynamite Abandonment Mission 1: Dynamite Peck)

1491
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,390
- What's that? - Oh, what?

1492
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,260
You must find the one person...

1493
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,900
who gave the other team's representative a peck.

1494
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,500
(Arrested)

1495
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,470
- What? - We have to give them a peck?

1496
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,700
- A peck on the cheek? - Really?

1497
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,440
(In short, just like the Mafia Game, they must find who the kisser is.)

1498
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,770
- We have to give them a peck? - Are we allowed to do this?

1499
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,410
You can give them a peck on their hand too.

1500
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,670
Or if you want to, you can kiss them on the cheek.

1501
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,340
The people who will be kissed...

1502
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,680
and give a kiss...

1503
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,550
- will be decided randomly. - Randomly?

1504
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,810
- Randomly? - Yes.

1505
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,620
- Oh, my. - He's moisturizing his lips.

1506
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,450
(At that moment)

1507
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,250
- Look at Se Chan. - Hey.

1508
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,550
He's moisturizing his lips.

1509
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,420
Hey, why are you putting lip balm all over your face?

1510
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,760
(Se Chan prepares thoroughly.)

1511
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,860
- He put it on his philtrum. - Hey.

1512
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,830
- Why put it all the way there? - What are you doing?

1513
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,060
I want to give a big, wet kiss.

1514
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,130
You might get it all over your face at this rate.

1515
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:42,870
(The winner of the popularity vote is determined today.)

1516
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,400
Gosh, no.

1517
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,070
- His face will feel greasy now. - Everyone hates it right now.

1518
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,570
If you guess the person who gave you a kiss correctly,

1519
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,170
the entire team can reduce...

1520
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,840
their number of penalty balls by ten each.

1521
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,140
- We have to get this right. - For real.

1522
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,180
(Team Jong Kook's penalty ball status, Each has 86)

1523
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,940
- We have to do this. - We really do.

1524
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,480
- We have to get this right. - For real.

1525
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:58,010
(Team Jae Seok's penalty ball status, Each has 59)

1526
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,150
- We have so many. - It is a lot.

1527
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,410
- I can just tell by looking. - But...

1528
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,710
if you guess incorrectly,

1529
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,350
the other team will lose ten penalty balls each.

1530
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:04,320
- So, you have to get it right. - I can really guess this well.

1531
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:05,420
(It's their chance to widen the gap by 20...)

1532
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,890
So, each team will get one chance.

1533
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,020
(if they succeed in both deduction and arrest.)

1534
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,960
- Who will go first? - First,

1535
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,560
decide which team will give a kiss.

1536
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,760
(Deciding the order)

1537
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
The kisser?

1538
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,630
- The kisser? - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1539
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,900
Eun Jin, play rock-paper-scissors with Mu Jun.

1540
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
- With Mu Jun. Rock-paper-scissors. - All right.

1541
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:17,030
- Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1542
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,600
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1543
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,240
(Eun Jin wins.)

1544
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,270
Hey, Mu Jun.

1545
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,870
- You have really weak energy. - Yes.

1546
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,980
- No, I was going easy on her. - What? No.

1547
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,640
- Since she's a girl... - He is weak.

1548
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,780
Her energy is dominating yours.

1549
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,050
(Team Jae Seok has the right to decide.)

1550
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,850
- He is being dominated. - Right.

1551
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,810
- It's better to be the Mafia first. - If we go after...

1552
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,880
Should we go second?

1553
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,020
(Getting pecked on)

1554
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,080
- Going second is better. - I think so too.

1555
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,120
- It's better to see how it goes. - Let's see it first.

1556
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,250
- It's better to see it first. - Yes.

1557
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,120
But aren't we going to see the thing he has prepared?

1558
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,820
Oh, right. Mu Jun has prepared...

1559
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,960
Mu Jun. I hear he has...

1560
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,930
(The news that Mu Jun has prepared a talent show,)

1561
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,930
- a lot of stuff prepared. - You said you'd do a backflip.

1562
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,060
(reported by Reporter Ahn earlier)

1563
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,430
- Yes, show us what you've prepared. - Right.

1564
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,430
- That way, you'll be energized. - But...

1565
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,730
I have to do that so suddenly, before a kiss?

1566
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,460
- Do a backflip before the kiss. - Just do it.

1567
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,670
(Don't worry.)

1568
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,570
Then, you can give a kiss.

1569
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,830
- Mu Jun, there's no time. - We have no time.

1570
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,600
(Let's see it now.)

1571
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,570
- Let's see it. - It's not that.

1572
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,900
- Show off your charm. - There's no time for it.

1573
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,940
- Do whatever you prepared now. - The space is a bit...

1574
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,610
- We'll make space for you. - Let's widen the space.

1575
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,240
- Hey, do it back there. - Hey.

1576
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,240
- Back there. - The grass.

1577
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
Do it out there and come back.

1578
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,750
- Over there. - Yes, this will be so cool.

1579
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,450
(Recommending the outdoor stage)

1580
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,550
- Hey. - Hang on a minute.

1581
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,020
- The grass is a good idea, right? - Go outside and do it.

1582
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,150
- Hey, over there... - Go outside...

1583
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,590
- Go on. It's okay. - I have to check the ground.

1584
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,620
- He's so cute. - Check the ground.

1585
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,850
- Kim Mu Jun! - Here he goes.

1586
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,960
(What's the back tumbling like that Mu Jun will show on the big stage?)

1587
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,620
Gosh, he's quite a scaredy-cat.

1588
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,330
- Warm up. - The grass is good.

1589
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,290
(Excited)

1590
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,330
- It's fine. The grass is soft. - Hey, but...

1591
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,660
Do you want to do that or dance for us?

1592
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,800
(Turning)

1593
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,840
- Oh, is that it? - What was that?

1594
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,740
- You have to do it in the air. - Was that it?

1595
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,810
Hey.

1596
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,340
(The tumbling was quite simple.)

1597
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:32,980
Hey, Korean dance.

1598
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,410
- Hey, Korean dance. - That was good!

1599
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,110
- Hey, modern dance. - Show us some modern dance.

1600
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,880
(Requesting another personal talent to make up for it)

1601
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,650
Go on.

1602
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,180
He's going to do modern dance.

1603
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,580
- Modern dance. - Oh, boy.

1604
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,650
- Modern dance. - I don't remember.

1605
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,250
(Dancing)

1606
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,720
(Flapping)

1607
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,050
What's that?

1608
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,790
- It was like a bow and arrow. - He shot an arrow.

1609
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,290
(What? That's also a bit...)

1610
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,130
- It was like a bow and arrow. - He shot an arrow.

1611
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,130
- He shot an arrow. And then? - He shot it.

1612
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,160
- He shot it. - Well,

1613
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,200
he's not that great at this.

1614
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,100
(Talking behind his back)

1615
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,570
He's not that great.

1616
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,500
- About this much. - Good.

1617
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,400
(Ending the show abruptly)

1618
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,570
- I really... - Modern dance.

1619
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,740
(Good job!)

1620
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,800
Good.

1621
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,870
Eun Jin.

1622
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,010
- Hey, Eun Jin. - Yes?

1623
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,610
Didn't you say you could do a cartwheel?

1624
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,010
Daniel, do you want to do it with me?

1625
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,480
- Yes, go. - Shall we do it?

1626
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,750
- Can you really do it? - Guys,

1627
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,110
- Eun Jin wants to do a cartwheel. - But... Should I try it?

1628
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,050
- A cartwheel. - Eun Jin, you're doing a cartwheel?

1629
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,920
(Eun Jin has been motivated by the modern dance dancer.)

1630
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,050
- Nice. - Do it.

1631
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,350
Eun Jin is doing a cartwheel?

1632
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,790
- Hey, she's doing a cartwheel. - Let's watch the cartwheel show.

1633
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,620
- Let's watch the cartwheel show. - A cartwheel.

1634
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,360
(The news makes the cameras move in groups.)

1635
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,260
What? Why is she doing this?

1636
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,590
- Why is she doing this? - Then,

1637
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,230
- let's go like this. - Okay.

1638
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,560
(Planning to spin at the same time)

1639
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,030
- Still, the cartwheel... - Are they doing it together?

1640
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,960
- Oh, they'll do it together? - They'll go the other way.

1641
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,330
- It'd be funny if they collided. - They're going the opposite way.

1642
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,500
It would be funny if they collided.

1643
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,740
Ready, go.

1644
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,640
(Here goes their cartwheel.)

1645
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,040
- One, - One,

1646
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,240
- two, - two,

1647
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,710
- three. - I hope this makes it on TV.

1648
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,280
I hope this makes it on TV.

1649
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,850
- You're good. - Why did they do that?

1650
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,650
(It was another simple performance.)

1651
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,650
- Why did they do that? - That was good. Go inside.

1652
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,820
- Go inside. It wasn't that great. - Daniel wasn't too bad.

1653
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,980
- It wasn't that impressive. - They're wondering...

1654
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,320
if this will make the cut or not.

1655
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,320
We'll have to see.

1656
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,290
- Let's see how things go. - Well, Eun Jin...

1657
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,560
- just seems to like cartwheels. - I think so.

1658
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,390
- But I don't know why I did it. - I don't know either.

1659
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,830
(Fortunately, the cartwheels made it onto the show.)

1660
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,600
All of a sudden...

1661
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,960
Well, Eun Jin... Hey.

1662
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,930
The cameraman has to come in behind you.

1663
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:08,470
(Encountered a mishap from going outside needlessly)

1664
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,700
Hey, man. What did you do?

1665
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,440
- You can't shut the door. - The cameraman has to come in.

1666
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,910
- The cameraman has to come back. - I'm sorry.

1667
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:15,240
(After the quite abstract performances)

1668
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,310
Gosh, that was funny.

1669
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,710
Ten balls are on the line.

1670
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,080
(Starting again from choosing the order)

1671
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,310
Which team will go first?

1672
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,710
- Let's just do it. - We'll give a kiss first.

1673
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,450
- I'll do it. - If that's your decision,

1674
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,850
(Team Jae Seok will attack first.)

1675
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,650
- Team Jae Seok will go outside. - Shall we? Okay.

1676
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,220
- What a relief. - What? Why?

1677
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,320
- Just go outside. - No.

1678
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:28,020
(Team Jae Seok goes outside to choose the kisser.)

1679
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,590
- They're just bluffing. - We're glad.

1680
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,620
- This is the right thing to do. - Gosh, I'm so glad.

1681
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,960
Is this right? I'm so confused.

1682
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,560
- Are we being kissed? - Yes.

1683
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,090
- Nice. - Be attractive.

1684
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,800
Please decide who will be kissed.

1685
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,400
(Randomly choosing who will be pecked from Team Jong Kook)

1686
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,930
- The first person is Yang Se Chan. - Me? Okay.

1687
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:40,170
(Yang Se Chan has been chosen.)

1688
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,770
- You will receive a kiss. - You do it, Se Chan.

1689
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,140
- They might kiss my forehead. - That's right.

1690
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,110
(The pecking zone)

1691
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,440
You could be able to tell by the surface area of the lips.

1692
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,380
They might give him a light peck on purpose.

1693
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,050
They might do that.

1694
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,150
But they need to leave a lip print.

1695
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,950
Like this.

1696
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,020
Don't let your stubble touch.

1697
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,990
(He's suddenly practicing pecking on the back of his hand?)

1698
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,450
Can you stick your lips out all the way?

1699
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,860
- I don't have any stubble. - Oh, really?

1700
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,090
So, you can tell when Jae Seok kisses you.

1701
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,230
With people who have protruding mouths like me,

1702
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,460
- you can feel the pressure. - Do your teeth touch?

1703
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,760
- The front teeth touch first. - The pressure.

1704
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,100
You can feel the pressure, so you can tell if it's Jae Seok.

1705
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,840
(Analyzed that pouty mouths' teeth touch first)

1706
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,100
But when you give a kiss, you have to do it differently,

1707
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,470
like blowing air or something.

1708
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,310
I hope I don't get picked.

1709
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,480
They'll be able to tell it's me.

1710
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,710
- I laugh way too easily. - I know.

1711
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,250
(The pecking mafia of Team Jae Seok is also chosen at random.)

1712
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,180
- Right. I can't burst out laughing. - They'll be able to tell it's me.

1713
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,310
- You can't hide it. - We've picked a name.

1714
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,550
We've picked a name.

1715
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,780
I would definitely get caught.

1716
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:30,150
(One name has been revealed.)

1717
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,150
- Who is it? - Who is it?

1718
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,520
Oh, nice.

1719
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,150
- All right, then... - Oh, no.

1720
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:33,920
(Who is the pecking mafia among them?)

1721
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,460
So, this...

1722
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,420
But if you laugh easily,

1723
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,130
- or if you're wearing fragrances... - That's why I can't do it.

1724
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,690
- I'm wearing cologne too. - Cologne.

1725
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,230
Or should we all wear the same fragrance?

1726
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,600
- That's a great idea! - Do you have some?

1727
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,870
(Clapping)

1728
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,170
- Would hand cream be better? - I have some here.

1729
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,230
- Let's go with hand cream. - Let's all wear...

1730
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,300
- the same scented hand cream. - Hand cream.

1731
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,970
- Wear it on your neck. - Yes, on your neck.

1732
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:51,270
(Concealing their body odors with Haha's hand cream)

1733
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,200
All right. Come here.

1734
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,340
- Okay, then... - Put some on.

1735
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,710
- We all have to put some on. - We all have to.

1736
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,810
- We all have to put it on. - At first, Eun Jin...

1737
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,150
- No. I suddenly had a great idea. - What is it?

1738
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,180
So, that idea is...

1739
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:01,750
- Hey, you're seriously so... - That's good.

1740
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,090
(Eun Jin's idea surprises everyone.)

1741
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,090
How are you so smart?

1742
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,220
- We have to win. - You're a genius.

1743
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,990
- You're so meticulous. - Like that...

1744
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,560
Hey, you look so much like your mother.

1745
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,930
Hey, Jae Seok's mother.

1746
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,630
- Your mother... Jae Seok's mother. - Seriously.

1747
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,430
- Lady Velvet Dress Ok Jung. - Hey, I also think...

1748
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,360
(A spitting image)

1749
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,630
- You look like yours. - You look just like your mother.

1750
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,100
- The short hair suits you. - You look just like her.

1751
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,400
(Madam Ok Jung's personal color is red lips.)

1752
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,440
Ms. Ok Jung, hi.

1753
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,270
- You look just like your mother. - The short hair suits you.

1754
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,510
Ms. Ok Jung, hi.

1755
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,280
And now...

1756
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,680
Ms. Jee, my gosh.

1757
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,950
- You look like an old lady. - Totally.

1758
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,150
A lady you'd see in a salon.

1759
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,080
(While salon Director Jee is getting ready)

1760
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,520
Before they enter, you'll all cover your eyes.

1761
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,290
(Everyone on Team Jong Kook puts on a blindfold.)

1762
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,590
- This won't be easy. - I agree.

1763
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:38,820
Yes, cover your eyes.

1764
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,790
Even if Eun Jin is chosen,

1765
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:43,760
(The mafia)

1766
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,620
- she won't find this to be easy. - Exactly.

1767
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,530
- I'm betting on that with her. - It won't be easy.

1768
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,630
You never know. She's an actress, after all.

1769
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,460
- Exactly. - She might just do it,

1770
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,630
- like she was playing a character. - Right.

1771
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,130
- Then... - Then I'll be grateful.

1772
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,570
Eun Jin...

1773
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,500
- I'd be grateful. - She's quite competitive.

1774
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,510
- That's right. - That makes sense.

1775
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:57,870
Are my lips in good condition today?

1776
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,480
The lip contact might be nothing to her.

1777
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,740
That's true.

1778
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,680
They'll come back in now.

1779
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,980
(The pecking mafia enters.)

1780
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,710
- Sure. - Okay.

1781
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,480
I wonder who'll do it.

1782
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,920
- "Who will do it?" - I'm curious.

1783
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:13,020
(Team Jae Seok enters quietly.)

1784
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,690
We couldn't hear them from in here.

1785
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,190
- I know. - The room blocks out sounds well.

1786
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,160
They'd better not be able to see anything.

1787
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,400
(They carefully approach after seeing their target.)

1788
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:21,800
Everything you say...

1789
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,600
- We can't see a thing. - will be considered acting anyway.

1790
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,140
(Making the members smell the hand cream)

1791
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,870
I smell perfume.

1792
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,500
- I just smelled it too. - They all sprayed the same perfume.

1793
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,200
It's not perfume. This is Haha's.

1794
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,240
- I see they sprayed perfume. - It's not perfume. This is Haha's.

1795
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,210
- They all sprayed it. - They're wearing the same perfume.

1796
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,710
(He immediately recognizes Haha's scent.)

1797
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,580
This isn't perfume. I think it's hand cream.

1798
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:37,350
(Sharp)

1799
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,250
- That's what we're smelling. - They applied the same hand cream.

1800
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,750
(Pulling back)

1801
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,550
You'll kiss my forehead? Sure.

1802
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,920
Let me be clear. You can kiss me on the lips.

1803
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,320
- I'm open-minded. - You can kiss his lips.

1804
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:52,030
That felt dirty.

1805
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,700
That felt dirty.

1806
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:57,200
(The mafia has left, leaving a kiss mark on his forehead.)

1807
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,730
That was the worst feeling.

1808
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,700
Wait. Did someone kiss me?

1809
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,870
That felt dirty.

1810
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,570
(Team Jae Seok wipes off the lipstick...)

1811
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,170
- Did it feel dirty? - Yes.

1812
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,700
- That must be their concept. - All right.

1813
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,810
(so that they can't guess who it is.)

1814
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,510
Go ahead...

1815
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,340
- and take off your blindfolds. - Okay.

1816
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,210
- Where were you kissed? - On the forehead.

1817
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,340
- I'm sure about this. - Hold on.

1818
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,880
You should know that it felt disgusting.

1819
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,920
It felt disgusting.

1820
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,320
(The mafia's kiss left him feeling dirty.)

1821
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,950
The lips...

1822
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,060
You have no idea.

1823
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,790
Come here. Let's see the shape of the lips.

1824
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:26,660
(Checking the shape of the lips first)

1825
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:25,860
Let's see.

1826
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,360
- They're plump. - The upper lip is plump.

1827
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:29,330
The lower lip isn't as thick,

1828
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,670
- which means a smaller chin. - They're plump.

1829
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,800
It means a smaller chin.

1830
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,940
(Does the mafia have a thinner bottom lip?)

1831
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,140
- Hold on. - You can tell that about the chin.

1832
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,540
(You're wrong.)

1833
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,440
Someone kissed me from above and behind.

1834
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,910
You guys are sharp.

1835
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:42,280
(Bottom lip, upper lip)

1836
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,580
Whoever kissed you has a smaller chin.

1837
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:46,650
(Can they tell who kissed him just by the shape of the lips?)

1838
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,780
Also, it felt like this.

1839
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,180
Also, it felt like this.

1840
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,120
It wasn't a peck.

1841
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,690
Their mouth was open.

1842
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,720
Their mouth was open.

1843
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,500
(Se Chan reveals that it was a deep kiss.)

1844
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,660
It was like this.

1845
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,060
It wasn't a peck but this.

1846
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,170
The bottom lip is thinner.

1847
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:05,400
(Whose lips made that mark?)

1848
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:04,900
How sharp of you.

1849
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,370
- I have a feeling... - Jae Seok...

1850
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:08,600
wiped his lips right away.

1851
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,510
(Observing closely)

1852
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,610
- Did he wipe them right away? - I think I know why.

1853
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,740
Jae Seok wiped his lips right away.

1854
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,210
That's his way of trying to trick us.

1855
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,750
(Jae Seok was wiping his lips when they lowered their blindfolds.)

1856
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:19,580
(Was it an act?)

1857
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,210
Let me see.

1858
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,350
Can you press your lips here again?

1859
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,260
Can you press your lips here again?

1860
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:30,030
(Carrying out an on-the-spot pecking investigation)

1861
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,960
Are you sure?

1862
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,560
Guys, that's just...

1863
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,760
(In perfection position)

1864
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,200
Come on.

1865
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,330
- That's just wrong. - It's just that everyone kisses...

1866
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:39,200
- in their own way. - You know...

1867
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,900
- Show us. - Come on.

1868
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,270
Just show us.

1869
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,070
- It was just like this. - This is wrong.

1870
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,340
Oh, no!

1871
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,280
Jae Seok, wait.

1872
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,320
- Darn. - Let's see it.

1873
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,390
Jong Kook, look.

1874
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,820
- They look alike. - They look similar.

1875
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,820
(The mafia's, Jae Seok's)

1876
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,460
(The lip stain has a similar shape.)

1877
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,260
- They look alike. - They look similar.

1878
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,760
- Those look similar. - They do look alike.

1879
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,860
Did it feel different?

1880
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,390
- They look alike. - It felt similar, but...

1881
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,030
- But different? - You see,

1882
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,830
the lips before were plump,

1883
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,330
- but his are thin. - Yes, they're thin.

1884
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,600
- Okay, we got it. - He opened his mouth, but still.

1885
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,340
(Mafia candidate 1: Jae Seok, similar feeling...)

1886
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,340
Wait, me too? Do you want everyone to kiss you?

1887
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,570
(but difference in lip thickness)

1888
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,600
- Did it feel different? - You'll get it from everyone?

1889
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,240
- Kiss the back of my hand. - Should everyone kiss him?

1890
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,070
Just get it on your forehead.

1891
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,710
(Like you just did)

1892
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,980
It's not like I mind,

1893
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,680
- but Eun Jin's shaking over there. - Hold on.

1894
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,250
- She'll kiss the back of your hand. - Does she have to do this too?

1895
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,620
You didn't tell me we had to kiss people for real.

1896
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,650
They...

1897
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,520
- He wants a kiss from her, right? - That's not it.

1898
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,590
He's making his way to her.

1899
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,390
Maybe he'll make his way all the way to Ye Eun.

1900
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,890
- Gosh, no. - It wasn't him.

1901
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,530
- That's not it. - He's making his way to her.

1902
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,760
- It wasn't him. - No?

1903
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,670
- I think he's faking it. - It wasn't him.

1904
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:45,200
(Se Chan denies it was Daniel right away.)

1905
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,770
It wasn't him.

1906
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,570
(Mafia candidate 2: Daniel, wider and bigger lips than the mafia's)

1907
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:48,570
It can't be Daniel. I'm sure of it.

1908
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,440
- Isn't this funny though? - Hold on a second.

1909
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,040
(Niel isn't considered a mafia candidate.)

1910
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,610
Why should we kiss him just because he asked?

1911
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,110
- Eun Jin, hold your horses. - Beats me.

1912
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,780
He wants to make his way to her.

1913
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,580
(Seok Sam pecks on his eyes.)

1914
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,520
I hate this.

1915
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,390
- What do you think? - Wasn't it me?

1916
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,920
- Most certainly... - Didn't it feel odd?

1917
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,620
- I can smell their breath on me. - Of course.

1918
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,390
Earlier, I didn't smell a dad scent,

1919
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:11,760
- but this time I did. - A dad scent?

1920
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,630
- That's not what I smelled earlier. - Watch out for your breath.

1921
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,770
(The scent of age can't be covered up.)

1922
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,060
It wasn't like that earlier.

1923
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,930
- Seok Jin's breath... - Did you smell a dad scent?

1924
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,230
I didn't smell that earlier.

1925
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:20,570
(Next is Haha's turn.)

1926
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:21,570
I think it was Haha.

1927
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,310
- I agree. - I'm sure of it.

1928
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,310
(How's the peck from Haha, the prime mafia candidate?)

1929
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,610
- I think it was Haha. - I agree.

1930
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,150
The marks can be random.

1931
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,020
He's doing that on purpose.

1932
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,850
That's deliberate. He's kissing softly on purpose.

1933
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,520
It's definitely not Haha.

1934
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,220
- How so? - It's not him. Why?

1935
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,960
You can feel his stubble even with a light kiss.

1936
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,720
- Could you feel it? - I felt his stubble.

1937
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,830
(Mafia candidate 5: Haha,)

1938
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,030
- It scratched me. - He has a stubble.

1939
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,300
- Maybe that's deliberate. - But...

1940
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:48,860
(has a beard that Se Chan couldn't feel from the mafia)

1941
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,530
- He... - He could've done it on purpose.

1942
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:48,760
He could've scratched you on purpose.

1943
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,970
That could've been deliberate.

1944
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:53,370
(Is Haha, who used his beard, the mafia?)

1945
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,600
This is a fun game.

1946
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,170
Maybe it was Seok Jin.

1947
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:54,640
- On the hand. - Are you sure about this?

1948
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:55,700
(Last is Eun Jin's turn.)

1949
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,570
- Of course, it's different. - Even from Eun Jin?

1950
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,540
(Offering his wrist)

1951
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:58,970
- Hold on. - Are you kidding me?

1952
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,040
- Guys, this is just a game. - It's only a game.

1953
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:02,080
(Don't get the wrong idea.)

1954
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,480
- It's just a game. - What did I do?

1955
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,450
- Right? It's only a game. - I can't believe you.

1956
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,320
But to think I'm actually doing this...

1957
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,680
- Do I really have to do this? - Of course.

1958
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,920
Just think of this as kissing while acting.

1959
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,490
- This much is fine. - Guys, don't push her.

1960
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,920
- It's embarrassing. - Exactly.

1961
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,630
(Is her being shy also acting?)

1962
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,160
Guys, don't push her.

1963
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,190
- It's embarrassing. - Exactly.

1964
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,860
(Or is she against it because she's the mafia?)

1965
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:18,190
Let's just see how it is.

1966
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:20,060
No, I can do it. I'll do it.

1967
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,230
- Sure, go ahead. - I can do this.

1968
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,660
- But this... - All right.

1969
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,230
Wait, is it her?

1970
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,240
Wait, is it her?

1971
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,200
Really? Did it feel similar?

1972
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:32,240
(Was Eun Jin's peck similar to that of the mafia?)

1973
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,770
- I don't think it was her. - Was that what you felt?

1974
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,940
- I don't think it was her. - Was that what you felt?

1975
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,580
- That feeling... - I bet you want to feel it again.

1976
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,880
Ask her to do it again.

1977
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,480
- Ask her again. - Don't.

1978
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,550
Plant one right here!

1979
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,180
(This time)

1980
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,220
Plant one right here!

1981
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,220
I can't.

1982
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,320
- That's just wrong. - I couldn't do it.

1983
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,390
- Se Chan. - She shouldn't have to do that.

1984
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,660
That could've been on purpose.

1985
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,160
She is pretending to be shy...

1986
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:54,600
(The forehead peck)

1987
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,490
- Right. - about kissing you on the arm.

1988
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,660
She is pretending to be shy...

1989
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,030
- Right. - about kissing you on the arm.

1990
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,230
- She's shy about it, but... - That's not it.

1991
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,530
Jong Kook, this is how it is.

1992
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,500
(Jong Kook's reasoning: Eun Jin, the mafia, is acting shy on purpose.)

1993
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,230
She's pretending to be shy about kissing your arm.

1994
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,770
- She's the Mafia. - This team...

1995
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:01,870
- She's that competitive. - Their team made a mistake.

1996
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,740
- When I was seated, - Okay.

1997
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,410
the Mafia did more than kiss me.

1998
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,310
Whoever it was placed their left hand on my shoulder.

1999
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,150
Whoever it was placed their left hand on my shoulder.

2000
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,450
(The mafia grabbed Se Chan's shoulder before the peck?)

2001
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:13,180
- But... - That could've been someone else.

2002
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,450
- They grabbed me with force. - That could've been someone else.

2003
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,420
- I was grabbed with force. - Then it was Seok Jin.

2004
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,520
(Unchanging)

2005
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:21,320
(Se Chan's reasoning: Judging by the grip, the mafia is a man.)

2006
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,360
- They grabbed me with force. - That could've been someone else.

2007
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,460
I was grabbed with force.

2008
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,560
Then it was Seok Jin.

2009
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:25,030
I didn't smell a dad scent.

2010
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:28,330
Like I said, I didn't smell a dad scent.

2011
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:28,660
(Laughing)

2012
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:31,230
- It's definitely not him. - What exactly is a dad scent?

2013
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,500
(Dad is upset.)

2014
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:32,870
- There's this unique smell... - What kind of smell is it?

2015
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:34,640
that you miss.

2016
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,670
Be sure of it. Is it a dad smell or a grandpa smell?

2017
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:40,280
(Dad Seok Sam is off the mafia candidate list forever.)

2018
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,010
- It's not the grandpa scent. - This is hilarious.

2019
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,110
The dad scent.

2020
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,340
- I smelled it on his breath. - He's still a dad, not a grandpa.

2021
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,880
And remember what I told you earlier?

2022
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,380
If it were Daniel,

2023
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,550
he would've gone over the top.

2024
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:46,210
(Se Chan's reasoning: If Niel were the mafia, he would've overdone it.)

2025
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,050
The Mafia was on the shyer side.

2026
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,980
(The mafia)

2027
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,080
Whoever touched my shoulder was gentle.

2028
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:53,220
(Dad smell is eliminated.)

2029
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,250
But I smelled it this time.

2030
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,590
If it were Daniel, he would've gone...

2031
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:54,590
(The overdoer is eliminated.)

2032
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:57,790
(Just when the candidates have gone down to three...)

2033
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:57,330
- over the top. - I heard something.

2034
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,260
- I heard something. - What did you hear?

2035
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:02,730
When you said it felt dirty,

2036
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:05,470
I heard someone dragging a chair.

2037
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:06,470
From here?

2038
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:09,300
- I heard someone dragging a chair. - From here?

2039
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:11,410
(Right after the peck, he heard the chair move near Eun Jin?)

2040
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,870
So here's what I think.

2041
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:12,770
Jae Seok's the one who kissed you,

2042
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:15,640
and Eun Jin bumped into the chair...

2043
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,950
when she reacted to it.

2044
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:21,480
- Who are you saying did it? - Exactly!

2045
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,320
- What is he saying? - What was that?

2046
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,620
- What is he trying to say? - What does that mean?

2047
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,590
- Mu Jun, who did it? - What are you trying to say?

2048
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,190
He doesn't seem like the sharpest person.

2049
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,420
Go out there and do another flip.

2050
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,390
I understood him just fine.

2051
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,100
After she kissed him, she bumped into the chair.

2052
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,060
(Interpretation of Mu Jun's language:)

2053
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,300
She could've reacted to someone else kissing him.

2054
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:40,170
(The sound was from Eun Jin backing away after the peck.)

2055
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:37,930
That's true.

2056
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,900
So what are you trying to say?

2057
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,500
- Well... - It can't be Eun Jin.

2058
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,070
(Either way, summarizing that it wasn't Eun Jin)

2059
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,100
- Yes, that's what I mean. - It can't be her.

2060
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,570
- I don't think it was Haha. - It could've been me.

2061
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,080
(It's time to choose the mafia.)

2062
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:45,670
It was Haha or Jae Seok.

2063
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,710
What is this, a detective agency?

2064
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,510
- I think it was Haha. - I think so too.

2065
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:50,680
How was it me?

2066
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,810
- Because... - Look.

2067
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,450
- His cupid's bow is flat. - Just make a guess.

2068
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,550
- They're like this. - How could you even tell?

2069
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,420
- His lips are round. - It's all about luck.

2070
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,990
(Prime candidate, Haha:)

2071
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,890
- Look at his lips. - It could've been deliberate.

2072
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,990
(Has the most similar lips)

2073
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,620
- Here. - Hurry up!

2074
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,990
(Pecked like a duck to avoid the beard)

2075
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,090
- His cupid's bow is flat. - The lips look like Haha's.

2076
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,090
- I think it was Jae Seok. - Jae Seok?

2077
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:05,660
- This is how they kissed me. - He wiped his lips...

2078
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,060
as if he was disgusted by it.

2079
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,900
Don't you think he was trying to throw us off?

2080
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,700
(Rather)

2081
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,370
(Prime candidate, Jae Seok: The mafia who wiped off right away?)

2082
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,130
Or was he startled because no one else was wiping it off?

2083
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,240
(Or was it a fake move?)

2084
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,540
He thought the others would wipe it off too.

2085
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,700
It could've been Eun Jin.

2086
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,570
- No way. - I know it wasn't Eun Jin.

2087
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,440
(Prime candidate, Eun Jin:)

2088
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,610
It was me.

2089
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,710
(A method acting by the acting genius Eun Jin?)

2090
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,880
- She likes taking part in games. - One, two...

2091
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,440
- You can't really tell. - I think it was Haha.

2092
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:24,880
Only he would've kissed my forehead. Jae Seok wouldn't have.

2093
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,010
It was me.

2094
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:30,020
(Is one of them the pecking mafia?)

2095
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,480
Think about it. Of course, it was me.

2096
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,020
See the shape of the lips.

2097
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,450
We'll go with Haha.

2098
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:33,590
- All right. On three, - We're ready.

2099
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:35,560
(What's Team Jong Kook's final decision?)

2100
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,490
please choose who you think the Mafia is.

2101
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,090
- One, two, three. - She likes taking part in games.

2102
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,660
- Haha. - Goodness.

2103
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,360
- Haha. - Goodness.

2104
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:45,100
(Is Haha the mafia?)

2105
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,400
Who on Team Jae Seok...

2106
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,830
kissed Se Chan?

2107
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,140
Was it Haha?

2108
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,440
- It's not him. - It wasn't.

2109
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,740
Was it Jae Seok?

2110
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,810
- It was Eun Jin, right? - The one who kissed Se Chan...

2111
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,940
- was Ahn Eun Jin. - What?

2112
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,310
- It was Ahn Eun Jin. - What?

2113
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,720
(Eun Jin was chosen as the pecking mafia.)

2114
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:01,450
- It's Eun Jin. - Good.

2115
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,690
(Stomping her feet)

2116
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,620
- A good idea just hit me. - What is it?

2117
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,220
The one who'll be kissed will sit like this.

2118
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,890
I'll kiss the person,

2119
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,290
but someone with bigger hands should hold them still.

2120
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,560
(Mafia Eun Jin's plan 1:)

2121
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:11,290
- Is that allowed? - Sounds good.

2122
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,990
(The one with big hands to touch the shoulder)

2123
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:13,230
Can I borrow your cap and sunglasses?

2124
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:13,860
(Mafia Eun Jin's plan 2:)

2125
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,130
- The sensation of touch. - How are you so...

2126
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,060
(Throwing them into confusion with Haha's belongings)

2127
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:18,270
I think it'll be easy if you kiss the back of the hand.

2128
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:20,000
(The location of the kiss)

2129
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:19,330
Which part would be good?

2130
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,200
- The forehead. That's so good. - Or how about on the ear?

2131
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,110
(Eun Jin's mafia strategy 3. Picking a bold spot on purpose)

2132
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,210
I'll stand on the chair and go like this.

2133
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,210
That's right.

2134
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,480
(After preparing thoroughly, the mafia sneaks in.)

2135
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,440
Well, these days...

2136
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,710
It's Se Chan. What do we do?

2137
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,750
(Her smile disappears.)

2138
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,450
This is totally...

2139
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,720
I'll stand on the chair,

2140
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:39,090
(Climbing on top of the chair so he can't tell how tall she is)

2141
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,020
and when that person is seated, go like this.

2142
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,050
That's right.

2143
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,620
I'll put my lips on the person,

2144
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,320
but someone with big hands...

2145
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,030
(Faking with Daniel's hand)

2146
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,030
- should grab that person. - Okay.

2147
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,830
(Pressing her lips as firmly as she can)

2148
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,860
That felt dirty.

2149
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,670
That felt dirty. That was the worst feeling.

2150
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,200
(Holding back her laughter)

2151
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:53,670
Hey, did you do it just now?

2152
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,970
(Like so, the mafia hid their identity perfectly.)

2153
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:54,870
That felt dirty.

2154
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,340
- It worked! - Yes!

2155
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,970
(Eun Jin's strategy was a success!)

2156
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,580
I told you.

2157
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,980
I heard the dragging...

2158
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,250
- I knew exactly. - The dragging...

2159
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,610
- You said it wasn't her. - No, but...

2160
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,820
(Gone speechless as he thinks it's unfair)

2161
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,320
- You said it wasn't Eun Jin. - The chair being dragged...

2162
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,850
- It was Ahn Eun Jin. - Yes!

2163
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,720
(And in this moment,)

2164
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,620
(one man can't hear anything.)

2165
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:12,690
- Let's go! - It worked!

2166
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:17,560
(Eun Jin kissed me on the forehead?)

2167
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:15,120
It worked!

2168
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,860
It worked!

2169
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:20,130
Hey, you look so happy right now.

2170
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,430
- Wait, but... - It worked.

2171
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:23,160
why did I feel dirty earlier?

2172
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:26,200
- I felt kind of... - I told you.

2173
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,840
Because acting like they couldn't do it here...

2174
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,570
(Se Chan was fooled by her great acting.)

2175
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,170
was way too over the top.

2176
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,310
Who grabbed my left arm like this?

2177
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:34,540
- I did. - Daniel grabbed you.

2178
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,540
I knew it. Hey.

2179
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,850
- They faked it. - Everything I said...

2180
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:40,050
(Ssaebssaeb was completely fooled by Eun Jin.)

2181
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:38,350
- was right. - It was all calculated.

2182
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,450
Team Jae Seok...

2183
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:43,280
will each have ten penalty balls taken away.

2184
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:45,020
(The mafia wins, so Team Jae Seok loses 10 penalty balls each.)

2185
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:46,790
- Eun Jin, good job! - Yes!

2186
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:47,890
- Good job. - Oh, boy.

2187
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,030
- You said it wasn't her earlier. - No, I...

2188
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:51,230
(Team Jong Kook was thoroughly fooled by Team Jae Seok's plan.)

2189
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:52,730
- It was obviously Eun Jin. - But...

2190
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:54,030
(A regret too late)

2191
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,730
- Seriously, Jong Kook, you were... - Gosh, I...

2192
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:56,670
- It was so obviously Eun Jin. - You're so scary.

2193
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,670
(They need to succeed now to make up for it.)

2194
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:58,670
- That's why a man... - Gosh, I was duped.

2195
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,170
- Let's do this too. - Gosh, really?

2196
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,140
- Then, we'll pick the kiss mafia. - Okay.

2197
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,210
(Picking Team Jong Kook's kiss mafia)

2198
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,240
Gosh, this is...

2199
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,910
(Nervous)

2200
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,440
- Ye Eun. - Me?

2201
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,610
Gosh, this is...

2202
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,650
(Who is Team Jong Kook's kiss mafia?)

2203
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,350
Please.

2204
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:16,020
- Who is it? - Ye Eun?

2205
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,790
- Is it Ye Eun? - Who is it?

2206
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,020
- Who is it? - Who is it?

2207
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,020
Ye Eun?

2208
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:22,590
(Kim Jong Kook)

2209
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,960
- Oh, it's you. - Darn it.

2210
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,060
Jong Kook.

2211
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,590
- Oh, it's you. - Darn it.

2212
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:26,130
(What a relief.)

2213
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,260
(He puts lipstick on first.)

2214
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,340
(He transformed into Kim Joker.)

2215
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,140
I'm going to do it too.

2216
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,840
Jong Kook, when you give a kiss, go like this.

2217
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:39,070
(Team Jong Kook's strategy)

2218
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,840
Just this part in the middle.

2219
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,080
Also, out of all of us here,

2220
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:40,180
(Purse his lips as closely as possible...)

2221
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,280
(so that he contacts the area as little as possible)

2222
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,140
- you have the tallest nose. - Oh, your nose.

2223
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,150
- Watch out for your nose. - When you give a kiss,

2224
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,050
don't go straight in like this. Tilt your head a bit.

2225
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,280
(Team Jong Kook's strategy)

2226
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:48,450
- Tilt my head? - Jong Kook, go like...

2227
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,050
(Tilting his head so his nose bridge doesn't touch)

2228
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:49,480
Because the moment your nose touches,

2229
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,490
they'll be able to tell it's you.

2230
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,190
You have muscles on your nose too.

2231
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,860
- Make sure not to touch... - Also, I have to inhale...

2232
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,290
(To prevent them from smelling his breath)

2233
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,490
- as I kiss. - Right, don't breathe.

2234
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:57,290
Or we could all blow air on that person.

2235
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:58,530
As you inhale.

2236
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:59,960
I'll inhale. One, two, three.

2237
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,100
(Breathing out)

2238
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:02,930
Blow out through your nose.

2239
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,130
Okay.

2240
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,800
(The target of Kim Joker who will be attacked by their breaths)

2241
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:07,140
Hey, but this time, that team...

2242
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,000
(Jae Seok)

2243
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,570
might not kiss me on the forehead.

2244
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:09,940
- Right. - Maybe the back of the neck...

2245
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,740
- Right. They might do that. - Right.

2246
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:13,980
- Or even the back of the hand. - Right, the back of the hand.

2247
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,240
(Thinking hard)

2248
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,240
Then, we should do this.

2249
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:20,550
So, instead of making them leave a lip print here, we should go...

2250
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,350
- Nice. You can do that. - Let's get lip prints like this.

2251
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:25,420
(Eun Jin suggests getting their lips pressed on a tissue.)

2252
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,720
- Yes, I'll do that right away. - Oh, nice.

2253
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,390
Do you like variety shows that much?

2254
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,560
- Hey, just join us permanently. - She's working so hard.

2255
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,820
- Just become a member. - It feels like I'm here for fun.

2256
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,790
(Humorous Eun Jin is full of passion.)

2257
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,730
Where? The creases in the lips?

2258
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,030
- No, this... - Not the crease.

2259
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:34,700
We'll get their lip prints and compare.

2260
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,130
Yes, like this.

2261
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,630
(They're going to compare even a single wrinkle on their lips.)

2262
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,500
- This is good. - I'll get them right away.

2263
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,030
- You can do it. - Right away. Yes.

2264
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,570
- One by one... - They're coming in soon.

2265
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,140
- Are they coming in? - Please cover your eyes.

2266
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:43,910
(Everyone on Team Jae Seok puts on blindfolds.)

2267
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,400
- Okay. - Okay.

2268
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:44,740
They won't be able to tell.

2269
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,410
- How can they? - They can't.

2270
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,440
But Jae Seok has a great sense of smell.

2271
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,710
They're inside.

2272
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:52,210
(They all enter with clown lips to make the shape confusing.)

2273
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:49,840
Who will do that?

2274
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:51,850
Jae Seok has a great sense of smell.

2275
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:54,420
This isn't Jae Seok's first time playing this. He's done it a lot.

2276
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,420
But some of them wear fragrances and others don't.

2277
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:59,650
(Surrounding Jae Seok like a cobra)

2278
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,690
- I'm sure they're all wearing it. - Yes.

2279
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:00,820
But holding the hand and touching...

2280
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,420
Hey, they're wearing similar fragrances.

2281
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,190
- He can just smell it. - Are they doing it now?

2282
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:06,090
(Numbing his nose with perfume)

2283
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,230
No, they'll come in front of us...

2284
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:07,300
Hang on.

2285
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:10,330
On my left, Song Ji Hyo was just here. Hang on.

2286
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:12,900
On my left, Song Ji Hyo was just here. Hang on.

2287
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:16,440
(Dog-nosed Jae Seok sensed Ji Hyo's scent.)

2288
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,100
- Song Ji Hyo was just here. - Oh, none of them are talking.

2289
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,210
(Hurry up and switch spots!)

2290
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,810
It's over if it's a man.

2291
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:20,810
Oh, their strategy is to be totally silent.

2292
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,910
(Quickly switching spots)

2293
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:22,980
- Jae Seok, still... - No, wait.

2294
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,310
They're trying to confuse me on purpose.

2295
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:26,450
Of course.

2296
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,850
(Jong Kook's hand)

2297
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,850
- They're switching spots... - They're meticulous.

2298
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:28,950
- on purpose. - Purposefully, with the hair...

2299
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:29,950
Of course.

2300
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,520
- They're switching spots... - They're meticulous.

2301
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:33,490
(The mafia holds his arm to confuse him on purpose.)

2302
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,520
- on purpose. - Purposefully, with the hair...

2303
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,960
Wait, someone pressed down on me.

2304
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,190
(I'll do it now.)

2305
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,760
The hair might be...

2306
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,760
Wait.

2307
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,260
Right.

2308
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,830
(Hold your breaths!)

2309
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:42,030
I think they're about to do it now. Oh, look at this.

2310
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,200
- Oh, my. - They're going for my forehead.

2311
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,370
Is it Song Ji Hyo? Or is it Ji Ye Eun?

2312
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,640
Is it Song Ji Hyo? Or is it Ji Ye Eun?

2313
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,610
- Is the laugh a woman's or a man's? - Wait, someone is missing.

2314
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,510
(It's Jong Sook!)

2315
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:51,670
- It's a woman. - Wait.

2316
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,580
I felt it on my forehead!

2317
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,140
- Did they kiss you? - They touched my forehead lightly.

2318
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,650
(Kim Joker left a print of his lips while pressing his lips.)

2319
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,210
- Is it done? - Did they kiss you?

2320
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:58,950
- They touched my forehead lightly. - Is it done?

2321
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:00,150
- Yes. - It's not Ji Ye Eun.

2322
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,820
(Fixing his makeup right after kissing Jae Seok)

2323
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,350
- Did they do it? - They touched my forehead lightly.

2324
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,020
All right. You may take off your blindfolds now.

2325
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,920
- Who was it? - They grazed my forehead lightly.

2326
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,960
- Let's see. Where was it? - Lightly on the forehead...

2327
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,960
- Let's see. Oh, your forehead. - Oh, is that what they did?

2328
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,020
- Hey, it's crooked. - Let me see.

2329
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,930
- Hang on. - Oh, I think I know.

2330
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:13,930
- Let me see, Jae Seok. - Hey, it's crooked.

2331
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,430
(They left a small lip print on purpose.)

2332
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:17,070
The lips are crooked. It's Yang Se Chan if it's crooked.

2333
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,870
It's Yang Se Chan if it's crooked.

2334
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,970
Please stay still for a minute.

2335
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,070
(Seducing them as if he's the mafia)

2336
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:24,140
Please stay still for a minute.

2337
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,680
Oh, you can't tell because of their makeup.

2338
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,540
(Eun Jin came with tissue.)

2339
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,580
My gosh. What are you doing?

2340
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:34,550
(Eun Jin approaches him quickly, and Monkfish's face turns red.)

2341
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,720
- What is she doing? - No.

2342
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,820
- Wait. Please sit. - Just sit down.

2343
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:37,720
(Why did she kiss him before?)

2344
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,520
- Yes, sit down. - Sit down.

2345
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,420
- This is an investigation. - Purse your lips and say, "Oh."

2346
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,860
- Was it a woman or a man? - First of all...

2347
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,730
- Okay. - I'm sure that's not it.

2348
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,930
- Who grabbed you, then? - Ji Hyo, please say, "Oh."

2349
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:48,260
(Collecting lip prints in the shape like on Jae Seok's forehead)

2350
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:46,930
- Right. - Say, "Oh."

2351
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:48,200
- To confuse you? - Yes, to be confusing.

2352
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,400
Ye Eun, "Oh."

2353
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,330
Go sideways. It's not Mu Jun.

2354
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:53,870
Why is it lighter? Say, "Oh."

2355
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:56,400
- There are creases. - Why is it lighter? Say, "Oh."

2356
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:00,070
(Even after fixing his makeup, Eun Jin noticed it had worn off.)

2357
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:59,070
- There are creases. - Then, it must be right.

2358
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,310
There are lots of creases. It's someone with lots of creases.

2359
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,080
(Pretending not to be flustered)

2360
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,280
- This is... - It must be right.

2361
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,250
- That's not it, then. - Say, "Oh."

2362
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:07,850
(Done collecting everyone's samples)

2363
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,380
- They were very careful. Also... - Pretending to have creases...

2364
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,290
- I should compare them. - I smelled their breath.

2365
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:16,420
(Mu Jun, Se Chan, Ji Hyo, Ye Eun, Jong Kook)

2366
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:11,420
This is Se Chan's.

2367
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,760
- Yes, Se Chan and Ye Eun. - Ye Eun.

2368
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,320
- Jong Kook. - Jong Kook.

2369
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,420
And Mu Jun.

2370
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,290
I can't tell from this.

2371
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:19,430
Really?

2372
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,700
- They have creases. Look. - I think it's Mu Jun.

2373
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:22,960
(Mu Jun)

2374
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,930
- It's not this one. - Not this.

2375
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,370
(Mu Jun's print is similar to the print Jong Kook left.)

2376
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,230
- Jae Seok, but... - But they look way too different.

2377
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,200
Can you let Mu Jun kiss you once?

2378
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,340
- It's Ye Eun, - Mu Jun, give me a light peck.

2379
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,940
(Asking for another kiss on his forehead in the end)

2380
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,070
- What? - Mu Jun, here. Give me a peck.

2381
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:37,350
- Then, just... This one... - Why does this look...

2382
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,810
(Not sure)

2383
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,420
- No, that wasn't how it felt. - This one was Jong Kook's.

2384
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,750
- This one looks right. - That wasn't how it felt.

2385
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:43,890
(Awkward)

2386
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,220
- That wasn't it. - It looks very uncertain.

2387
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,050
- Hey, let Jong Kook kiss you too. - Let's see.

2388
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,660
- Come on. I should be upside down. - Let me see.

2389
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:48,820
- Hey, there are creases. - No, Jong Kook...

2390
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,530
- I should be upside down. - No, Jong Kook shouldn't do it.

2391
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:52,790
Why not? But why?

2392
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:53,360
(Rejecting instinctively)

2393
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,030
- I should be upside down! - I don't want him to.

2394
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,960
(Being clingy)

2395
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,530
(Brilliant acting of being disappointed)

2396
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,330
- No, not him. - Is it not him?

2397
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,070
- I don't need him to do it. - I should be upside down.

2398
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,270
- Because... - It's meaningless.

2399
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,340
he was one of the people who grabbed me.

2400
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,640
- Yes, he grabbed me. - Still, let him do it.

2401
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,570
(A strategy that was effective)

2402
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,740
- No. - I have creases.

2403
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,240
It's not someone who says he has creases.

2404
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,240
Let me see. Give me a light peck.

2405
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,910
Hey, don't cover the actual mark.

2406
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:13,210
- What? - Why?

2407
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,420
- Does that feel right? - Oh, hang on.

2408
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:18,290
- Is Se Chan a Simpson? - Oh, Yang Se Chan.

2409
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:20,460
(Twitching)

2410
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,520
- Does that feel right? - Oh, hang on.

2411
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,590
(The corners of his mouth turning up...)

2412
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,030
- Is Se Chan a Simpson? - Oh, Yang Se Chan.

2413
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:24,660
(as they're narrowing down to Se Chan)

2414
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,630
- Hey. - Se Chan, are you a Simpson?

2415
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:26,730
- Oh, Yang Se Chan. - Hang on.

2416
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:27,760
- Let me see the creases. - Did it feel the same?

2417
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,300
- It felt like Yang Se Chan. - Really?

2418
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,600
(Jae Seok is completely mistaken.)

2419
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,430
- No, it can't be. - It was Yang Se Chan.

2420
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:32,430
You're not in your right mind...

2421
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:33,470
- since it's your first time. - No.

2422
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:35,070
- No. - You're not in your right mind...

2423
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,670
- since it's your first time. - No.

2424
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:36,670
(Chuckling)

2425
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,940
- Why, Jae Seok? - It's Ye Eun.

2426
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,410
It was a light peck, but it was Yang Se Chan.

2427
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,540
(Horrible hunch)

2428
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:40,580
- Then, it must be right. - Why?

2429
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:41,580
We have to go by the sensation.

2430
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,680
No, this is why it's not Se Chan.

2431
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,310
From the beginning, he was acting like...

2432
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:47,520
(Seok Jin thinks Se Chan only acted like the mafia.)

2433
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,650
- it was him. - Seok Jin, look.

2434
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,050
- Usually... Here. - He was acting like it was him.

2435
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,750
- Listen to me. - They grabbed you like this...

2436
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:55,520
People with strong grips grabbed my shoulders from the side.

2437
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,330
Those who would take this role would be Jong Kook...

2438
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:58,530
Right. Then, it wouldn't be them.

2439
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:00,600
(Jae Seok thinks it's not Jong Kook because he grabbed him.)

2440
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,060
- And Mu Jun. - But Jae Seok...

2441
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,330
- But it looks way too different. - Is it different?

2442
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,760
(He also doesn't think it's Mu Jun.)

2443
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:04,030
- But this is why I think this. - It's not him.

2444
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:06,670
- I went to each person, - You got their lip prints.

2445
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:09,340
- and I said to purse their lips. - You stamped their lips.

2446
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,310
They all made an "Oh" shape,

2447
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:12,510
but Mu Jun went like this.

2448
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,440
(Eun Jin thinks it's Mu Jin because he's the only one...)

2449
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:13,940
He said "Eh."

2450
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,640
(who made a different lip shape.)

2451
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,640
- He must be anxious. - The lips...

2452
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,840
The lips...

2453
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:19,680
Right now, Mu Jun's lips are much more squishy.

2454
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,720
- The lips of someone in his 20s. - Then, let them kiss you once more.

2455
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,550
Mu Jun's lips are much more squishy. The lips of someone in his 20s.

2456
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:24,850
Okay.

2457
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:27,620
(Jae Seok's deduction is on point this time.)

2458
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:26,190
- Oh, they were moist. - Why are you feeling it...

2459
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,490
- in such detail? - Wasn't it someone young?

2460
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:29,420
- No, you can just tell. - Well...

2461
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:30,290
(Awkward)

2462
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,860
- You can, right? - Yes, you can.

2463
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,230
- They must've been moist. - You will decide anyway.

2464
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,530
You can only tell how moist it is...

2465
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:35,300
(The dryness can't be hidden.)

2466
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,800
- when you receive the kiss. - Sure, you decide.

2467
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,130
- I think you should trust your gut. - Mu Jun's lips were too soft.

2468
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,070
- It's either... - But one other thing.

2469
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:39,770
(She spotted something.)

2470
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,640
The two who feel relaxed are sitting down.

2471
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,670
It's not him.

2472
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,600
The two who feel relaxed are sitting down.

2473
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,940
(Those who feel comfortable)

2474
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,610
It's not him.

2475
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:46,670
- And the ones who are... Me? - The nervous ones.

2476
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:50,750
The three who are nervous are standing.

2477
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:48,540
(Those who are anxious)

2478
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,710
(Eun Jin's deduction saw right through their inner thoughts.)

2479
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,880
- Earlier... - But!

2480
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,420
His arms are relaxed, and their arms are crossed.

2481
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,880
- These two are anxious. - Why are you...

2482
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,320
And their arms are crossed. These two are anxious.

2483
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,690
Why are you sitting alone? You're anxious, aren't you?

2484
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,520
(Avoiding their eyes)

2485
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:01,720
- Look. He's acting like it's him. - It's just...

2486
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,090
It's Jong Kook.

2487
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,790
- Judging by the sensation... Yes. - Eun Jin has a point.

2488
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:06,790
- Is it Jong Kook? - Jong Kook?

2489
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:09,200
- I know. I think it's Jong Kook. - You might be right.

2490
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:10,160
(Jong Kook is narrowed down as a mafia in no time...)

2491
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,730
- He looks awkward, doesn't he? - Yes.

2492
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,200
(and takes him by surprise.)

2493
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:12,500
- No. - Are you sure he isn't acting?

2494
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,400
- It's Mu Jun. - Hey!

2495
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:19,570
(No.)

2496
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,640
- But when he received the kiss, - Mu Jun...

2497
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,140
it didn't feel like the lips of someone in his 20s.

2498
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:20,510
No, Jae Seok. It's Mu Jun.

2499
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:22,640
No, Jae Seok. It's Mu Jun.

2500
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:21,610
(Mu Jun versus Jong Kook)

2501
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:24,480
(The guesses are split between the two.)

2502
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,980
I know. Between Jong Kook and Mu Jun...

2503
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,250
- I think it's one of them. - Who do you think it is?

2504
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,450
- What do we do? - Look.

2505
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:27,580
Then, let's put it to a vote.

2506
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,420
- Jong Kook. - I say it's Jong Kook.

2507
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,650
(Jong Kook)

2508
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,850
Gosh, I think it's Mu Jun.

2509
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:33,150
- Then, vote for Mu Jun. - I think it might be Mu Jun too.

2510
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,320
- I think it's Mu Jun. - Vote for Mu Jun.

2511
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,720
- I think it's Mu Jun. - Then, vote for Mu Jun.

2512
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,790
(Choose Mu Jun.)

2513
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,030
I think it might be Mu Jun too.

2514
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:39,460
(Holding his laughter)

2515
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:39,490
- I think it's Mu Jun. - Vote for Mu Jun.

2516
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:41,430
- He's acting. - Well, I...

2517
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:42,600
- Jae Seok! It's not Mu Jun. - I say it's Yang Se Chan.

2518
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,630
When everyone said it was him,

2519
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,930
- It's not Mu Jun. - He likes it.

2520
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:46,230
- Go with Kim Jong Kook. - Kim Jong Kook.

2521
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,300
- Let's go. - I say it's Jong Kook.

2522
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,510
- Kim Jong Kook? In 1, 2, 3. - Yes. In 1, 2, 3.

2523
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:51,570
- Kim Jong Kook! - Kim Jong Kook!

2524
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,340
- You chose Kim Jong Kook? - Yes.

2525
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:54,440
(They managed to catch him.)

2526
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:56,840
The person who gave Yu Jae Seok a kiss...

2527
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,450
Kim Jong Kook...

2528
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:59,950
is correct.

2529
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,480
(We caught him!)

2530
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,650
No way!

2531
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:08,760
No way!

2532
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:09,790
(The mafia is caught by Eun Jin's excellent deduction!)

2533
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,930
My gosh. How did they...

2534
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,530
- Yes, I got it right! - Hey, you...

2535
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:16,160
When Eun Jin narrowed down the candidates to those two...

2536
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:17,330
and they crossed their arms,

2537
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:19,070
- I became nervous. - Same here.

2538
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:20,540
- "What's going on?" - She's good at deductions.

2539
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:23,840
(She succeeded as the mafia and catching the mafia as well.)

2540
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,840
- She's good at deductions. - Yes.

2541
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:25,270
Team Jae Seok eliminated penalty balls twice in a row.

2542
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:27,140
(Team Jae Seok succeeded in both rounds.)

2543
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:28,210
Team Jae Seok members will lose 20 penalty balls each.

2544
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:30,380
(They lose 20 penalty balls each.)

2545
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:30,340
That's right.

2546
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,850
You'll now move to a new location and eat lunch.

2547
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:34,380
(They'll move to the next location for lunch.)

2548
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,620
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2549
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:36,180
- All right. - You figured it out.

2550
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:38,690
(Current status on Penalty Balls, Team Jae Seok, Team Jong Kook)

2551
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,790
- Of course. - That's right.

2552
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,320
It looks delicious.

2553
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:42,320
(A lunch table welcomes Eun Jin.)

2554
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,790
I'll sit here.

2555
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:46,060
- What? - What's going on?

2556
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:46,760
(Amazing)

2557
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,160
- What? - I mean...

2558
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:48,800
This is insane. My goodness.

2559
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,400
- I'll eat this. - It looks delicious.

2560
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,330
(They're awakened by the menus.)

2561
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,430
It's chicken.

2562
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,140
- Jae Seok and Haha. Yes. - Are we eating separately?

2563
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:56,900
(Jae Seok and Haha sit separately as they model for another brand.)

2564
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,270
It's nice.

2565
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:00,610
What's this water for?

2566
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,610
(Why is there a king-sized water container?)

2567
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,040
What's up with the water container?

2568
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,780
Did we get water for spicy food?

2569
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:07,380
- What's the water for? - Why is there water?

2570
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,450
(The production crew wouldn't give lunch easily.)

2571
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,580
What's this water?

2572
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,050
- What's this water? - Is the food spicy?

2573
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:13,850
(What are the water containers for?)

2574
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,420
There's so much water.

2575
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:13,750
I'll explain the rules before you begin eating.

2576
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,620
For today's lunch, you'll have a tasty braised chicken meal.

2577
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:19,330
(Braised chicken and braised spicy chicken)

2578
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:19,730
Since Jae Seok and Haha model for another brand,

2579
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:20,760
they'll get packed food...

2580
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,100
- and ramyeon. - Okay.

2581
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,900
- Okay. - If you give up,

2582
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,030
- you can lose some penalty balls. - What?

2583
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,200
If you give up...

2584
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,670
(Giving up again?)

2585
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,770
- you can lose some penalty balls. - What?

2586
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:31,740
- What? - Among the chair,

2587
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:33,670
eating utensils, cup,

2588
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:36,080
and coffee or a beverage for dessert,

2589
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,210
give up your choice of items.

2590
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:40,410
Per item, you'll lose...

2591
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,350
- three penalty balls. - Three?

2592
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:43,350
If I give up on a chair,

2593
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,390
- can I eat standing up? - Yes.

2594
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:45,490
- If you give up a chair, - A chair isn't essential.

2595
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,150
- you can eat standing up. - I can give it up.

2596
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:49,960
If you give up coffee or a beverage,

2597
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,460
you can drink water.

2598
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:52,690
How about chopsticks? Do we eat with our hands then?

2599
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:56,630
If you give up eating utensils, you'll get plastic gloves.

2600
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:58,970
You'll get plastic gloves.

2601
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:00,600
Ma'am, we have ramyeon.

2602
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,970
I don't need a dessert.

2603
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:05,270
(Eating ramyeon by hand will be hard even for cavemen.)

2604
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:03,370
- Your hands... Jae Seok, - I mean...

2605
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:04,710
your hands will get burnt.

2606
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:06,970
If you give up a cup, you can use a different method...

2607
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:09,010
- to drink water. - Okay.

2608
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,540
- Okay. - We can drink out of the container.

2609
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,810
We just need chopsticks.

2610
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,680
(The bottle is filled with water.)

2611
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:14,450
Why is it so heavy?

2612
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:15,580
- We need to drink out of this. - Can't we use this as a cup?

2613
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,220
(The cap)

2614
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,490
You can't pour water into the lid and drink out of it.

2615
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:18,920
- We can go without water. - We can't use the lid.

2616
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,120
Really?

2617
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,720
For your information,

2618
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,720
this round is an individual match.

2619
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,390
(A perfect chance to reduce each person's penalty balls)

2620
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,890
- Is it an individual match? - Yes.

2621
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:27,560
Tell us which items you want to give up,

2622
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:29,960
(How far will the members be willing to give up?)

2623
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,200
and we'll remove them.

2624
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:30,970
Who wants to give up the chair?

2625
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:32,030
I want to give up the chair.

2626
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,770
(Candidates to give up chairs)

2627
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:33,200
I can give up the chair.

2628
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,200
- Let's give up the chair. - Let's give up the chair and water.

2629
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,440
- Me. - Chair.

2630
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,370
- Me. - Everyone will give up the chair.

2631
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:39,810
- Yes. Take out the chairs. - Yes.

2632
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,240
Who wants to give up the cup?

2633
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:42,710
(I can give that up.)

2634
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,440
I can just go without drinking water.

2635
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,380
- I'll give up the cup as well. - I don't need it.

2636
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:45,710
(A cup is a luxury if they want a prize.)

2637
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,680
- I need the cup. - I need the cup.

2638
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,550
- I need the cup. - Except for the two guests,

2639
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:50,150
- everyone will give up the cup. - Yes.

2640
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:53,320
- How about coffee or a beverage? - I give up everything.

2641
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,260
- I give it up. - You guys can drink it.

2642
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,460
- We have many penalty balls. - That's right.

2643
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,630
(They're willing to give up for the last prize.)

2644
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,130
- We have many penalty balls. - You guys have much fewer balls.

2645
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,960
I need to drink it.

2646
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,800
- He's cool. - Iced Americano.

2647
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,830
Then...

2648
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:05,100
I'll drink an Americano as well.

2649
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,870
(Seok Sam choose a drink, following Jong Kook.)

2650
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:08,770
Raise your hand to give up the eating utensil set.

2651
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:09,470
(The controversial spoon set)

2652
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:10,170
- I need the eating utensil set. - I'll give it up.

2653
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,770
- How will you eat? - I'll find a way to eat.

2654
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:12,910
- Really? - Yes.

2655
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,610
- I'll give up the chopsticks. - I'll use plastic gloves as well.

2656
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:17,040
(Giving up)

2657
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,380
Three people will give up...

2658
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,850
- the eating utensil set. - You can't eat with plastic gloves.

2659
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,080
I'll use plastic gloves as well.

2660
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:20,450
(Giving up)

2661
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,580
- Jong Kook, you too. - Yes.

2662
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,920
Then I'll use the spoon and chopsticks.

2663
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,690
(He doesn't give up.)

2664
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,420
- That's a nice way to flex. - The spoon and chopsticks.

2665
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,960
- I'll use plastic gloves. - Mister,

2666
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,290
you'll hurt your hands.

2667
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:30,360
- I'll try it. - Jong Kook, you too.

2668
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,230
(Jae Seok makes a daring move to win a prize.)

2669
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:32,730
This is...

2670
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,630
- What's this? - A glove.

2671
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,730
- Thank you. - Why did you give me this glove?

2672
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,870
(Finger glove)

2673
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,040
Come on.

2674
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:43,870
This glove...

2675
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,440
Isn't this too much?

2676
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:51,250
(The thong of the glove world that protects the bare minimum)

2677
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:48,710
Why did you give me a billiard glove?

2678
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:50,310
Is this the glove?

2679
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:52,280
- Is this the glove? - I want an iced Americano.

2680
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,480
- May we eat? - Yes. Go ahead and eat.

2681
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:55,880
(Today's appetizing menu makes them eager.)

2682
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:55,820
- My goodness. - Let's eat.

2683
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:58,320
- I love braised chicken. - Same here.

2684
01:06:56,020 --> 01:07:02,660
(Spicy and sweet braised chicken with pasta)

2685
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,790
- There's spaghetti inside. - This is incredible.

2686
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:02,390
It's so nice.

2687
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:03,890
It looks tasty.

2688
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:09,960
(Braised spicy chicken that's appetizing)

2689
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:04,890
There's a lot.

2690
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:06,260
Gosh, this is amazing.

2691
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,600
It looks delicious.

2692
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,400
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

2693
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,130
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

2694
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,370
- Enjoy it. - Thank you for the food.

2695
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:13,670
- It looks delicious. - Thank you for the food.

2696
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:15,700
I've been hungry.

2697
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:17,640
- Oh, right. - It's good. It isn't hot.

2698
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,310
(Eun Jin takes some braised chicken first.)

2699
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:20,570
It's very tasty.

2700
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:23,280
What's this?

2701
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:25,950
(Taking a bite with chopsticks with class)

2702
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,310
It's spaghetti.

2703
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:28,720
Gen Zers like me would enjoy this taste.

2704
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:29,750
(Ye Eun got the spoon set as well.)

2705
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,920
I love it so much.

2706
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,190
I love cheese.

2707
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:34,520
(The eating show queen adds cheese on top.)

2708
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:32,490
Call me Ye Eun the Gen Zer.

2709
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:33,820
I love rice cake.

2710
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:39,590
(She even shakes her legs.)

2711
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:45,970
(She moves her chopsticks without stopping.)

2712
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,270
It's tasty.

2713
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:47,840
- May we eat it? - No.

2714
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:49,300
Gosh, it's hot.

2715
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:51,470
I want to eat it.

2716
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:53,010
It's so hot.

2717
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:54,340
(The glove user does not dare to grab the food.)

2718
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,510
What is it? Is the finger glove okay?

2719
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,750
- Is it that bad? - I need a plate.

2720
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,710
It's hot.

2721
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,250
(Jong Kook suppresses the pain and tries the dish.)

2722
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,320
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

2723
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,190
- Thank you for the food. - It's tasty.

2724
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,890
I don't like overly spicy dishes.

2725
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:11,590
(He refills protein with the gloves on.)

2726
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:11,560
But this one is spicy in an addictive and tasty way.

2727
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:12,760
- I love that kind of spiciness. - It's good.

2728
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,230
Young people would love it.

2729
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:17,600
(He forgets about how hot it is and puts on a deboning show.)

2730
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:15,630
Gen Zers would love it.

2731
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,700
There's rice cake.

2732
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,870
(It's fun to eat with hands.)

2733
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,200
It's really tasty.

2734
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:23,440
It's incredible.

2735
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,510
What's this?

2736
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:31,250
(Eating with a plastic glove is easy for Bag Man.)

2737
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:29,340
Gloves will be easier for this.

2738
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,980
- It's fine. It isn't hot! - Hey.

2739
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:35,080
(Now, it's fine.)

2740
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:36,720
It's spicy.

2741
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:39,620
(Devouring like a beastly man)

2742
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:38,720
It's spicy in a tasty way.

2743
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,060
It's so addictive.

2744
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:42,560
(Comfortable)

2745
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:42,520
It isn't overly spicy.

2746
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,360
(Using the skills they acquired by eating Mom's food by hand)

2747
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:46,090
- It's spicy and sweet. - Yes.

2748
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:47,330
The cheese is insane.

2749
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,700
It's spicy and sweet.

2750
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,700
It's the taste Gen Zers like. Isn't that right, Ye Eun?

2751
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,440
- Yes. It's the taste Gen Zers like. - How would you know?

2752
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:57,270
- Of course, I know. - How?

2753
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:59,940
(Enjoying the taste that the MZers like)

2754
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:59,440
- I'm a Gen Zer. - Gosh.

2755
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:01,640
He suddenly claimed to be a Gen Zer.

2756
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,340
(At that moment)

2757
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,850
(Screaming)

2758
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:05,680
It's hot!

2759
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:07,380
How will you eat ramyeon?

2760
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:10,080
(Difficult level, high: Just boiled cup noodles)

2761
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,480
I'll find a way.

2762
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,080
How will you eat ramyeon, your favorite food item?

2763
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,690
I'll find a way, okay?

2764
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,550
I'm a ramyeon expert.

2765
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:14,920
I have a way of eating it.

2766
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:17,020
I'll use shrimp as chopsticks.

2767
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,630
- Is it working? - Is it working?

2768
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,500
(Drooping)

2769
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:20,660
It's working.

2770
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:21,730
It isn't working.

2771
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,030
(The fried coating turns soggy, and he fails.)

2772
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:23,560
- It isn't working. - No. It's turning soggy.

2773
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,440
It's hot.

2774
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:30,340
(in the end, he resumes showing his superhuman strength.)

2775
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,310
You look like someone who always eats with his hands.

2776
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:35,380
(The writer)

2777
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:36,940
Jae Seok, you look like a man of nature.

2778
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,280
When I see it right next to him, it's disgusting.

2779
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,020
He's picking up noodles with his hands.

2780
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,520
(His passion for ramyeon doesn't die down.)

2781
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:44,790
I'm thirsty.

2782
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,160
Doesn't this dish make you crave some soda?

2783
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,890
(They crave drinks after eating a bit.)

2784
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,960
Do you want to play rock-paper-scissors?

2785
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:50,520
(Then...)

2786
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:52,560
The loser keeps the penalty balls, and we split the soft drink.

2787
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:54,830
We should play a game instead. Watch.

2788
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:56,860
The one who gets the shorter strand will lose.

2789
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:58,130
- Go ahead. - Spaghetti?

2790
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:01,500
(The master of variety shows even hosts a mini game.)

2791
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:59,670
Yes. Set, go.

2792
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:03,970
This one is mine.

2793
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:06,540
(The strands appear to be similar in length.)

2794
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:07,640
Mine will be longer if I straighten it out.

2795
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,140
- With this... - Succeed in it at once.

2796
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:09,780
(He unfolds the folded part.)

2797
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,180
- See? Mine is longer. - Really?

2798
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:12,450
(Mu Jun's strand is a bit longer.)

2799
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,280
- Yes. - Okay.

2800
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:14,110
Do you want Coca-Cola or an iced Americano?

2801
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:17,020
(Eun Jin takes back 3 penalty balls and receives a beverage.)

2802
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:15,620
- Iced Americano. - Iced Americano?

2803
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,950
(Looking around)

2804
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,090
I can give it to you.

2805
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,220
It's tasty.

2806
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,860
(Heave-ho)

2807
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:24,060
(Trying to drink water from the big bottle)

2808
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:23,660
Se Chan, are you drinking water?

2809
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,070
(He quenched his thirst.)

2810
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,300
Hey, don't drink water.

2811
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:38,710
(But he became moist in unwanted areas.)

2812
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:37,070
You can't drink water.

2813
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:38,240
- What is it? - Then...

2814
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:40,310
You'll get coffee now.

2815
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:44,680
(Right then, coffee for Jong Kook, Seok Sam, and Eun Jin appear.)

2816
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,510
- Okay. - Okay.

2817
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:42,680
Coffee sounds good.

2818
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,510
I absolutely love coffee.

2819
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:49,250
(As promised, she gives him half of her iced Americano.)

2820
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:46,980
It's so tasty.

2821
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,580
There's enough to share.

2822
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:51,790
Thank you.

2823
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,150
There's enough to share.

2824
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:58,630
(Jong Kook closes his eyes and drinks his iced Americano.)

2825
01:10:58,690 --> 01:10:59,860
Please give me a sip.

2826
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,300
Please give me a sip.

2827
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:04,160
I can drink this instead. Who cares about water?

2828
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:07,800
(He becomes absorbed in the taste as he brags about his coffee.)

2829
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:09,300
Gosh, it's so good.

2830
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:13,740
(Ji Hyo suddenly wipes her mouth.)

2831
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:16,080
That's how you do it.

2832
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,950
(Stealing the coffee)

2833
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:20,380
Hey, what are you doing?

2834
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:24,080
(An attack by an unexpected person)

2835
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:22,680
Gosh, it's cold.

2836
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,390
It suits Ji Hyo so well.

2837
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:27,960
Is Seok Jin's coffee for everyone?

2838
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:28,960
No!

2839
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:33,390
(Gosh, it's coffee.)

2840
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:32,060
No!

2841
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:33,260
No!

2842
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:36,460
(A coffee fountain opens.)

2843
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,900
Hey!

2844
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,130
What are you guys doing?

2845
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:40,070
(From Grasshopper to Catfish, they all quench their thirst.)

2846
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:38,770
For goodness' sake.

2847
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:40,270
I feel so refreshed.

2848
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:42,500
No one is going to Jong Kook.

2849
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,170
Jong Kook is enjoying it.

2850
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:47,010
- No one is going to him. - Jong Kook likes his coffee.

2851
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:49,240
(Thanks to Seok Sam, they're done with their desserts too.)

2852
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,610
I haven't seen Jong Kook that happy.

2853
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:53,310
(Current status on Penalty Balls, Team Jae Seok, Team Jong Kook)

2854
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,740
Jong Kook.

2855
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,050
Gosh, it's tasty.

2856
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,210
Gosh, I'm full.

2857
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:54,720
Okay.

2858
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:56,920
(They arrive at the next spot for the next mission.)

2859
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,920
Gosh, this is...

2860
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,480
- What's this? - What?

2861
01:11:57,890 --> 01:12:00,090
I think we'll play the game Eun Jin played in the past.

2862
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:01,820
(Spotting headphones)

2863
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,390
It looks fun.

2864
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:02,890
- Eun Jin. - It's yours.

2865
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,590
- Isn't it what she played? - Eun Jin, isn't it what you played?

2866
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:06,160
(Is it the headphones game that Eun Jin excelled at?)

2867
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:06,960
What am I going to do?

2868
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,560
Eun Jin, isn't it what you played?

2869
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,060
- I hope I'll get visited... - It's that game...

2870
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:11,470
- by the spirit of variety shows. - from "Family Arcade."

2871
01:12:11,470 --> 01:12:14,600
- Okay. - This is the last mission...

2872
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:17,840
(The last mission to reduce the number of their penalty balls)

2873
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,400
- to lose some penalty balls. - Okay.

2874
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,810
- Penalty balls. - We must do well.

2875
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:19,870
- We'll take all the wins today. - I know.

2876
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:21,210
- Hey. - We need to win again.

2877
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:22,340
We can do it. We need to do it this time.

2878
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:23,510
- We can do it. - Yes.

2879
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:24,850
For this mission,

2880
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:27,050
you'll play the game Eun Jin excelled at last time.

2881
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:28,380
Also known as the Ahn Eun Jin Game,

2882
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,450
- it's Cry in Silence. - Okay.

2883
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:31,750
(Cry in Silence)

2884
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:31,820
- She's really good at it. - Cry in Silence.

2885
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:34,250
The one who asks the questions and the one who guesses the answers...

2886
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:38,830
(Answerer, player, penalty zone)

2887
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:35,820
will both wear a headset...

2888
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,660
and play Cry in Silence.

2889
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,590
If you answer or pass a question,

2890
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:40,290
(Pass)

2891
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:41,830
the person who asks the questions will be switched.

2892
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,360
The next one to ask the questions...

2893
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,830
will stand by at the penalty zone.

2894
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:48,140
When a member sits in the penalty zone,

2895
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:49,800
a staff member will hold...

2896
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,770
a water bucket over his or her head.

2897
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,980
- As the mission progresses, - That's intense.

2898
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:58,280
the staff member will empty the bucket...

2899
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,510
when he or she can't support the weight anymore.

2900
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:04,250
(Thus, the water bomb is up to the staff member's stamina.)

2901
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,950
When he or she can't support the weight anymore.

2902
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:04,080
That's too...

2903
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,990
- A staff member? - A staff member?

2904
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:07,050
- That means... - So there isn't a timer.

2905
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:09,160
- they'll empty it when they want. - This is ridiculous.

2906
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:12,460
But when we tried it, the average time was three minutes.

2907
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:13,760
(Strong staff members who can hold out for 3 minutes are on standby.)

2908
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:15,760
The team that gets more questions right will win.

2909
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,830
(The team that answers more questions...)

2910
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:19,270
All members of the winning team will lose ten penalty balls each.

2911
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,770
(before the water falls wins.)

2912
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,200
- Okay. - My fingers are stinging.

2913
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:26,170
(A chance to get rid of most penalty balls at once)

2914
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,240
That's right.

2915
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,870
- I can't do this very well. - I bet there's no sensation.

2916
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:27,340
- There's no sensation. - Right?

2917
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:28,710
- Which team wants to go 1st? - They should go 1st.

2918
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,840
(Deciding which team will go first)

2919
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:29,740
They're winning.

2920
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:31,110
- Go first. - No.

2921
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:32,210
- We're losing. - Come on.

2922
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:34,680
(Pleading)

2923
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:33,280
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Come on.

2924
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,320
- Okay. We'll go first. - Thank you.

2925
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:39,020
(Team Jae Seok that's leading by far will go first.)

2926
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,850
- Okay. - Okay.

2927
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:39,650
I'll guess the answers.

2928
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:42,590
(The first answerer of Team Jae Seok is Jae Seok.)

2929
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:40,690
- Okay. - Will you do that?

2930
01:13:40,690 --> 01:13:42,490
We're moving one seat at a time, okay?

2931
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:43,620
I'll ask the questions then.

2932
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:44,790
- Okay. - I'll sit here.

2933
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:47,490
(Question giver: Seok Sam, Eun Jin at the penalty zone)

2934
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:45,890
- Okay. - That's where you stand by.

2935
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:48,160
We're going in this direction, right?

2936
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,460
Move one seat at a time.

2937
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:52,770
(If they answer or skip it, they'll move a seat.)

2938
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,960
Are you moving one seat at a time?

2939
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,770
We're going in this direction.

2940
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:54,230
I'm so nervous.

2941
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:55,500
Eun Jin, it's best to go first.

2942
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,040
- Your seat is the best. - Really?

2943
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,070
You'll be out of danger in no time.

2944
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:59,140
Okay.

2945
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:00,940
Why is the bucket so big?

2946
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:03,210
Why is the bucket so big?

2947
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:05,250
(The bucket man is on standby too.)

2948
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:04,880
I'm nervous about him dropping the bucket.

2949
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,510
(My goodness)

2950
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:07,410
Hey.

2951
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:11,620
(Who will be the unlucky one to get splashed?)

2952
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:09,380
I'm so scared.

2953
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:11,450
I'm so scared.

2954
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:17,290
(Both sides wear a headset.)

2955
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:16,590
You need to ask the questions.

2956
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:18,390
- All right. Get ready. - Let's see.

2957
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,130
(Team Jae Seok begins.)

2958
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:21,900
(Lifting the bucket)

2959
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,630
- We need to move fast. - Go.

2960
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:28,500
(Keyword: Ohtani Shohei)

2961
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,300
- You know that thing. - Okay.

2962
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,870
Major League in the US.

2963
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:30,370
- What? - Major League.

2964
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:31,440
What?

2965
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:33,110
Major League!

2966
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:34,840
Major League!

2967
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,680
- "Diary of Kim Ku?" - Baseball.

2968
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,280
"Diary of Crime Prevention?"

2969
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:39,410
- What? - Baseball.

2970
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:41,010
(Scared)

2971
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:42,480
- Major League! - I don't know who he is.

2972
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:44,520
(Keyword: Ohtani Shohei)

2973
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,480
What?

2974
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,050
Major League!

2975
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,690
(You don't know who he is?)

2976
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:46,650
Major League!

2977
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,690
- American baseball. - What?

2978
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:50,790
(His blood pressure rises.)

2979
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,360
Major League!

2980
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:53,290
(They struggle from the very first question.)

2981
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:55,330
(Gosh!)

2982
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,570
What? You startled me.

2983
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:58,800
(Scaredy-cat Haha is already scared.)

2984
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:01,470
Major League!

2985
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:04,200
(Keyword: Ohtani Shohei)

2986
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,970
Baseball!

01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:05,340
- Baseball! - Baseball!

2988
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:06,940
- Baseball! - Baseball!

2989
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:09,180
(Jae Seok finally understands one word.)

2990
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,580
- Hitter. Pitcher. - What?

2991
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:10,240
Japanese.

2992
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,210
Japanese.

2993
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,810
- Japanese. - Yes. Baseball.

2994
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,680
Ohtani. Ohtani Shohei.

2995
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,880
- Okay. - Okay.

2996
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,490
Ohtani Shohei.

2997
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,250
(He finally gets the first answer.)

2998
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:19,850
- Okay. - Switch places.

2999
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:22,190
Ohtani. Ohtani Shohei.

3000
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:23,020
(Eun Jin finally escapes the penalty zone.)

3001
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:23,190
- Okay. - Okay.

3002
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:24,930
- All right. - I don't know the full name.

3003
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:25,930
It's easy.

3004
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:27,030
I've heard of Ohtani.

3005
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:28,560
- Would you have guessed it right? - But I can't explain the keyword.

3006
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,500
- Would you have guessed it right? - Of course not.

3007
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:32,870
- Exactly. - Yes.

3008
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,300
- No. Give it to me. - Why? It's the same.

3009
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:38,070
(Team Jae Seok moves one seat to the right.)

3010
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,870
No, give it to him.

3011
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:37,870
No, give it to him.

3012
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:39,310
- Let me pass. - Ohtani Shohei.

3013
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:43,840
(Eun Jin will give the next question.)

3014
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,780
- Samsung Elec... - I...

3015
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:46,680

01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:46,610
I'm your

3018
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,420
(the APEC meeting in Gyeongju and became the talk of the town)

3019
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:51,850
Gyeongju!

3020
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:53,790
Pomegranate?

3021
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:55,020
Gyeongju!

3022
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,420
Cross... Crossbow?

3023
01:15:57,690 --> 01:15:59,190
Gyeongju!

3024
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:01,400
- Oil! - Gyeongju.

3025
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,360
- It's so frustrating. Seriously. - Oil.

3026
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,930
Oil.

3027
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,600
(Laughing and crying)

3028
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:07,670
Oil.

(Eating a drumstick)

3033
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:13,870
- No hands! - No hands!

3034
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,640
- No hands! - No hands!

3035
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:15,940

3036
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:17,480
Saudi Arabia! Oil!

3037
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:18,710
In Gyeongju...

3038
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:22,520
(Seok Jin is obsessed with oil.)

3039
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:20,910
- Oil! - Gyeongju!

3040
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,380
Oil!

3041
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,380
- Oil. - Kkan...

3042
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:26,020
- Oil. - Kkanbu!

3043
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:27,890
Kkanbu!

3044
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,890
(She brings up the viral chicken and beer get-together.)

3045
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,360
Oil.

3046
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:32,660
Kkanbu Chicken!

3047
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:36,000
I only hear "Oil."

3048
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:38,470
I only hear "Oil."

3049
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,670
(How do you still not know what it is?)

3050
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:40,200
Gyeongju! So...

3051
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:42,270
Person. Oil. Person.

3052
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:42,540
(Eyes gleaming)

3053
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:43,400
- Mansur. - N!

3054
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:45,840
- There she goes. Say it. - Mansur.

3055
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:46,170
(It looks like she's made up her mind.)

3056
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:47,410
- N! - N!

3057
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:49,010
- Vi! - Vi.

3058
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:50,910
- Di! - Apple ring?

3059
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:52,950
- Nvidia! - Apple ria?

3060
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:55,620
- Nvidia! - Apple ria?

3061
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,990
(Investor Ahn uses a cheat code in the end.)

3062
01:16:58,190 --> 01:16:59,320
Apple ria?

3063
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:00,890
- Nvidia. - Apple ria?

3064
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,490
The boss of Nvidia!

3065
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,960
- Ambassador! - No.

3066
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:08,960
(He still doesn't get it when she gives a big hint.)

3067
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:07,030
- So... - Ambassador?

3068
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:08,800
What should I do?

3069
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,700
You should wait so that it's more fun.

3070
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,930
Don't do it yet. It isn't time yet.

3071
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:16,070
(The staff member's arms begin to ache.)

3072
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:14,200
- It isn't time yet. - There she goes.

3073
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:15,840
Oil!

3074
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,470
- Gyeongju! - Oil!

3075
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:19,940
(He's still going on about oil.)

3076
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:19,440
- In Gyeongju... - Oil!

3077
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,410
- Pass! Make Seok Jin move! - So...

3078
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,480
- Pass. - Pass.

3079
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,050
- Pass. - Is it impossible? Pass?

3080
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,450
- Pass. Move. - Pass.

3081
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:28,820
(Despite using a cheat code, she ends up passing it.)

3082
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:28,620
- Eun Jin, go. - What?

3083
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,050
Are we passing it?

3084
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:31,750
(Seok Sam is kicked out in the end.)

3085
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:32,020
- Eun Jin, go. - Eun Jin, go that way.

3086
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,690
I don't know.

3087
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:35,120
- I really don't know. - Nvidia.

3088
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,860
I see. But she talked about oil.

3089
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:40,090
(The oil obsessed man finally gets it.)

3090
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,790
- Gyeongju. - Gyeongju.

3091
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,100
- I don't know who he is. - You don't know who he is, right?

3092
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,330
- She doesn't know who he is. - No.

3093
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,930
(The two Empty Heads hear it for the first time.)

3094
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:45,230
- Who is Jensen Huang? - You shouldn't be like that.

3095
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:47,070
- I don't know who he is. - You shouldn't be like that.

3096
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:49,270
(Haha asks the next question.)

3097
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:48,440
- You shouldn't be like that. - But...

3098
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,470
- What's that? - On the head.

3099
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:55,040
(Keyword: Gold crown)

3100
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:52,270
- Head. On the head. - On the head.

3101
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,210
- King. - Huang.

3102
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:56,340
- My keyword? - A king wears it.

3103
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:59,010
- There's wine? - A king wears it on his head.

3104
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,420
- King, you punk! King! - Wine.

3105
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:02,620
- Good. - King.

3106
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,790
- Wine. - A king... On the head...

3107
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:07,150
- On the head! - He wears a golden thing.

3108
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:08,620
- Feeling? - That's right.

3109
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:10,560
Haha doesn't shape his mouth properly.

3110
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,960
I wouldn't understand.

3111
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,290
King.

3112
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:17,300
(Eun Jin's perspective)

3113
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:25,310
(Keyword: Gold crown)

3114
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:18,730
- On the head. - On the head.

3115
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:20,530
- A golden thing. - Foreign...

3116
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:22,670
- Wear it, Eun Jin. - Truly...

3117
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:25,340
- Well... Silla gold crown? - On the head.

3118
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,740
- Correct. - Okay.

3119
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:27,840
- Silla gold crown? - On the head.

3120
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:30,380
(She got this!)

3121
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,180
- Correct. - Okay.

3122
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:30,680
- Move. Correct. - Correct.

3123
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:34,510
(They got 2 questions already thanks to Eun Jin's quick wits.)

3124
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:31,950
- Move. - Is it Silla gold crown?

3125
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:36,820
- It's my turn. - Gold crown.

3126
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,350
- Hey. - It's my turn. Please.

3127
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:42,160
(After a long period of time, Jae Seok enters the penalty zone.)

3128
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:40,550
Hurry up.

3129
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:42,120
It's hard.

3130
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:44,690
(Up next is Daniel.)

3131
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,260
It's hard to hold it.

3132
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,460
Go.

3133
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:52,170

01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,600
- Correct. You did it. - Hurry up and move.

3141
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:56,800
- Oh, no. - I'm in trouble.

3142
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,810
- That was insane. - Hurry up.

3143
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,770
You can do it.

3144
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:01,370
(Shaking)

3145
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,710
You can do it.

3146
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:05,210
(The difficulty level is low.)

3147
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:05,180
Artificial intelligence.

3148
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:07,010

Artificial intelligence.

3152
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,650
- Ito? - Artificial.

3153
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:14,860
(Ominous)

3154
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:13,290
Artificial.

3155
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:14,990
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

(Keyword: AI)

3157
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,820

Carry front and back?

3159
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,830
- Artificial intelligence. - Hey!

3160
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:20,090
(The 4th answer)

3161
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,730
- Iho jiji? - Stop it.

3162
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:23,930
- Gosh. - Artificial intelligence.

3163
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:24,930
Hey!

3164
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,300
(At that moment)

3165
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:26,370
- Iho jiji? - Stop it.

3166
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,570
(The water leaks.)

3167
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:28,670
- Iho jiji? - Stop it.

3168
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:29,970
That little...

3170
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,010
No!

3171
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:35,280
Hey, hurry up!

3172
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,540
(He can't hold out any longer.)

3173
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,780
- Artificial intelligence. - Hey!

3174
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,840
(Falling)

3175
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:43,020
(They're filming a disaster movie in the back.)

3176
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:42,280
- Oh, no! - No! Hey!

3177
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,320

3182
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,460
- Ligence. - Intel.

3183
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:51,390
- Artificial intelligence. - You fool!

3184
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:52,730
Is it there?

3185
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:53,960
Hey!

3186
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,960
Is it there?

3187
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,660
- Hey! - Gosh.

3188
01:19:56,730 --> 01:19:58,970
Oh, no!

3189
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:59,030
(His back is getting wet.)

3190
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:00,530
No! Hey!

3191
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:01,840

3192
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:01,800
Artificial intelligence.

3193
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,540

3195
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,640

- What? - You little...

3206
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:21,220
(Seok Jin gets soaked in the end.)

3207
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:22,060
- Okay. - Intel.

3208
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,690
(Laughing)

3209
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:25,960
You little...

3210
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:28,600
(Daniel can't hear him.)

3211
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:29,800
- I can't hear it. - Hey.

3212
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:32,070
(AI was a rather easy keyword.)

3213
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,970
- I mean... - Artificial intelligence.

3214
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:33,530
Artificial intelligence.

3215
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:37,040
(His ability to explain diminished when it was Seok Jin's turn.)

3216
01:20:34,970 --> 01:20:36,670
I couldn't hear anything.

3217
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:38,470
- Oh, no. - I'm so annoyed.

3218
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:40,140
I'm so annoyed.

3219
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,340
Hey, AI is the easiest keyword.

3220
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:43,710
(His hair melted like cotton candy.)

3221
01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:44,010
- I mean... - Hey, you're the same.

3222
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:45,910
Why did you only say "Artificial intelligence?"

3223
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:48,980
Why did you only say "Artificial intelligence?"

3224
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:50,050
What was I supposed to say?

3225
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,480
What was I supposed to say?

3226
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:53,820
(Pointing it out sharply, which is unlike him)

3227
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,690
- I mean... - They took turns, right?

3228
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:56,890
(Team Jae Seok got 3 questions in total.)

3229
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:56,060
Why didn't you get "Artificial intelligence?"

3230
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,090
- Why did you only say... - We're in trouble.

3231
01:20:58,090 --> 01:20:59,330
She doesn't know who Jensen Huang is.

3232
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:01,190
She has no idea. She didn't know four keywords.

3233
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:03,400
- Right now, the difficulty level... - The difficulty level...

3234
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:04,530
- I'm sorry, but... - AI?

3235
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:06,530
- Hyung In. - Hyung In, I'm sorry, but...

3236
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:08,170
- I mean... - They took turns, right?

3237
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:10,400
But one member...

3238
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,040
- doesn't know any of the keywords. - She doesn't know.

3239

She doesn't know who Jensen Huang is.

3240
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:15,080
I don't know.

3241
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:17,910
- I mean, she doesn't know. - I don't know.

3242
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,780
(Empty Heads)

3243
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:19,180
- Pass. - If I don't know, I'll pass it...

3244
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:20,410
- right away. - Pass.

3245
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:24,180
(They can skip quetions without limits.)

3246
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,750
Pass.

3247
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,020
- Make sure you do that. - And...

3248
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,320
This is dangerous.

3249
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,520
The two of you should go first.

3250
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,090
- Me? - Answer the question first.

3251
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:30,390
(The two go for it first without the three Empty Heads.)

3252
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,760
Me? Okay. Am I guessing...

3253
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,060
- or explaining? - Okay. I'll guess.

3254
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:32,730
I'm good at guessing. I'll read the clues.

3255
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:34,930
We need to answer two questions.

3256
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:36,160
(They need to get more than 3 questions to beat Team Jae Seok.)

3257
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:36,030
Okay.

3258
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:37,730
- Figure out the key points. - The key points.

3259
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:38,970
- The key points. - The key points.

3260
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:41,670
Just say something that represents the keyword.

3261
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:42,470
(They plan to get the answer after hearing the points.)

3262
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:43,140
- Okay. - I'll give it a go.

3263
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:45,970
(Confident Jong Kook and variety show rookie Mu Jun)

3264
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:44,770
- Mu Jun, open your mouth wide. - Good.

3265
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:45,840
Open my mouth wide. Okay.

3266
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:46,970
- Let's begin. - Let's do that.

3267
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:50,440
(Will these two be able to get the answers right?)

3268
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:48,210
- Okay. - Let's go.

3269
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:49,440
- We need to win. - Gosh.

3270
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,440
We need to win.

3271
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,280
- Get ready. - I'm serious.

3272
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:53,650
(Team Jong Kook begins.)

3273
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:53,780
I'm serious.

3274
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:58,620
(Keyword: Faker)

3275
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:55,950
- How do you explain that? - L...

3276
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:57,750
LoL!

- Pass! - Pass!

3462
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:52,010
(Preventing a waste of time)

3463
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:50,440
It won't work.

3464
01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:51,710
What did you do?

3465
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:53,810
They can't get any.

3466
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:55,320
- What are we going to do? - It's difficult.

3467
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:58,720
(Team Jong Kook took a lap just by passing.)

3468
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,080
- They didn't get any right. - This is so funny.

3469
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:59,120
How are you supposed to explain this?

3470
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:04,390
(Keyword: Scaling)

3471
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:01,250
Right.

3472
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:04,290
Teeth.

3473
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:07,160
Teeth.

3474
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:10,100
- Teeth. - Teeth.

3475
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:13,500
(He heard the accurate word this time as well.)

3476
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:11,700
- Teeth? - Say it.

3477
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,370
- Clean. - Italy?

3478
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,700
- Clean! - Italy?

3479
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,270
- Teeth. - Teeth.

3480
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:17,700
Cleaning!

3481
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:19,410
- Jung... - Clean!

3482
01:27:19,410 --> 01:27:21,810
Cleaning! Teeth.

3483
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:23,010
Lee Jeongjo?

3484
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:24,010
- Teeth. - "Jeongjo."

3485
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:25,550
- Lee Jeongjo? Yi Seong Gye? - Cleaning.

3486
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:26,910
- Yi Seong Gye? - Cleaning.

3487
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:27,580
(Getting 3 questions right is basically impossible...)

3488
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:28,880
- Jeongjo? - Teeth.

3489
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:28,820
(for Team Jong Kook.)

3490
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:32,450
(Now it's a game of who's going to get splashed with water.)

3491
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:31,120
- Lee Jeongjo? - Teeth.

3492
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,420
- Lee Jeongjo? - Cleaning.

3493
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:34,520
- Jeongjo? - Teeth.

3494
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:35,990
(Spilling)

3495
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,590
- Cleaning. - Teeth!

3496
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:37,090
- Teeth. - Pass!

3497
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:38,590
- No. - Jeong!

3498
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:39,090
(Next in line)

3499
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:40,290
- Cleaning. - Pass!

3500
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:42,530
(Doing his best)

3501
01:27:40,290 --> 01:27:41,460
- Pass. - Pure.

3502
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:42,600
- This! - Teeth!

3503
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,260
- Lee Jung Jae. - This one.

3504
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:45,730
(The two don't seem to give up.)

3505
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:45,530
Lee!

3506
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:47,100
It's coming.

3507
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:49,070
(Is Yang Se Chan going to be soaked?)

3508
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:48,130
- Pass! - Lee Jeong...

3509
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:50,240
- Teeth. - Pass?

3510
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:51,240
- Pass. - Pass.

3511
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,470
No!

3512
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:55,010
(He passed it.)

3513
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:54,310
- Pass. - No!

3514
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:55,310
Pass.

3515
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:58,280
(Ji Ye Eun goes under the bucket that's spilling.)

3516
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:57,180
What was it? Lee?

3517
01:27:58,340 --> 01:27:59,550
Bye, Ye Eun.

3518
01:27:58,410 --> 01:28:01,610
(But it's not over yet!)

3519
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:02,050
Bye, Ye Eun.

3520
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:08,050
(Keyword: KOSPI)

3521
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,920
- Okay! Stocks! - It was scaling.

3522
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:06,590
- Stocks! Red light! - Bye, Ye Eun.

3523
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:07,590
Soldier!

3524
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:08,590
That one.

3525
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:10,720
(That crazy duck...)

3526
01:28:08,590 --> 01:28:10,690
- Soldier! - That one.

3527
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:11,720
What do you call the entire stock market?

3528
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,160
Salute!

3529
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,090
- KOS... - Goodness.

3530
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:16,760
(He says something totally different.)

3531
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:16,530
It's not KOSDAQ.

3532
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:18,330
It's not KOSDAQ.

3533
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:20,230
I don't think he knows.

3534
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:22,270
(Pouring)

3535
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:21,330
Stocks.

3536
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:24,070
Stocks.

3537
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:25,410
(Screaming)

3538
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:29,080
(Ddochi gets poured with water in the end.)

3539
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,240
This is crazy.

3540
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:32,280
(Team Jong Kook answered 0 questions right.)

3541
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:32,280
This is crazy.

3542
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:33,480
- Okay. - We're good.

3543
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:36,720
Team Jae Seok answered three questions correctly.

3544
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:40,250
(Team Jae Seok that answered 3 questions won.)

3545
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:39,120
- We did it. - We did so well.

3546
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,590
It was really amazing.

3547
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:42,960
Team Jong Kook didn't answer any question right.

3548
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:44,390
(Team Jong Kook is annihilated by passing everything.)

3549
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,290
We couldn't.

3550
01:28:44,290 --> 01:28:47,790
Honestly, it's not easy to do this with Ye Eun, Ji Hyo, and Se Chan.

3551
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:49,630
- Right. We're at a disadvantage. - We...

3552
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:51,060
We wouldn't be able to answer even without the music.

3553
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:53,800
Yes. We wouldn't be able to answer even without the music.

3554
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:55,600
Ten penalty balls will be removed...

3555
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,970
for the members of the team that won.

3556
01:28:56,200 --> 01:29:00,440
(Each member of Team Jae Seok loses 10 penalty balls.)

3557
01:28:57,970 --> 01:28:59,010
- Yes! - Yes!

3558
01:28:59,010 --> 01:29:00,270
That's nice.

3559
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:01,410
What's going on?

3560
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:04,380
The Dynamite Abandonment race...

3561
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,350
- has come to an end. - Yes.

3562
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:07,510
I'll tell you the number...

3563
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:09,650
- of penalty balls you have. - Okay.

3564
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:11,480
- You just have to not get picked. - Right.

3565
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,320
- I don't think I have a chance. - Right.

3566
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,960
First, Jae Seok and Daniel...

3567
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:17,690
- have the fewest number of balls. - Okay.

3568
01:29:17,690 --> 01:29:19,790
- They each have 17 penalty balls. - That's a lot.

3569
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:21,060
- That's a lot. - That's still a lot.

3570
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:22,160
- They could get picked too. - Right.

3571
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:24,060
Next, Haha has 20 penalty balls.

3572
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:27,070
Seok Jin has 23 penalty balls.

3573
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:29,400
Eun Jin has 26 penalty balls.

3574
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:31,470
As for Team Jong Kook,

3575
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:34,540
Ji Hyo and Se Chan have the fewest number of balls.

3576
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:35,710
- Us? - Yes.

3577
01:29:35,710 --> 01:29:37,740
You each have 74 penalty balls.

3578
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,010
We have the lowest number, and that's 74?

3579
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:41,680
(The least number of penalty balls is 74.)

3580
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:40,810
- I have nothing to say. - Then...

3581
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:43,250
Jong Kook and Ye Eun each have 77 penalty balls.

3582
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,520
Mu Jun has 80 penalty balls.

3583
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,890
- Mu Jun! - It's okay.

3584
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:48,620
(Team Jong Kook is way inferior.)

3585
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:48,150
Mu Jun is a hero.

3586
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:49,960
- Visit us again. - But you can't be sure.

3587
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:52,430
(And the worst one is Mu Jun.)

3588
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,860
- I have the most? - Mu Jun, seriously...

3589
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:53,290
Come when we have the Empty Heads Special.

3590
01:29:53,290 --> 01:29:55,700
The number is much higher than we expected,

3591
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:57,030
- so we'll reduce all of them... - Okay.

3592
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:58,630
- by half and put them in. - Reduce everyone's by half.

3593
01:29:58,630 --> 01:29:59,970
We'll put the balls...

3594
01:29:59,330 --> 01:30:03,800
(The penalty receiver of the day will be selected by the machine.)

3595
01:29:59,970 --> 01:30:01,130
- in the machine. - They'll be put in the machine?

3596
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:03,100
Yes. We'll use the machine.

3597
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:06,010
- We'll allow duplicates too. - Duplicates are allowed.

3598
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:09,680
(Including duplicates, 7 penalty balls will be drawn.)

3599
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:07,610
Even if multiple balls of one person come out,

3600
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:10,180
they'll be counted in the seven balls.

3601
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:12,750
Those whose balls aren't chosen...

3602
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:14,080
(However, the one that doesn't get drawn to the end...)

3603
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:15,980
can divide the prizes of their team among themselves.

3604
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:18,480
(gets the team's every prize.)

3605
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:17,320
Okay.

3606
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:18,950
For example, if Jong Kook...

3607
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:21,550
- I should get the pine mushrooms. - was the only one not picked,

3608
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:26,830
(If you get drawn, you get a penalty. If not, you get a prize.)

3609
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:24,960
Jong Kook can take all the prizes.

3610
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,230
That's a good example.

3611
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:27,730
- Yes. - Okay.

3612
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:29,560
Please pick the first penalty receiver.

3613
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:31,200
(The 1st draw)

3614
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,160
You'll pick seven in total.

3615
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,870
Please. It shouldn't come out, right?

3616
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,970
(Final number of penalty balls)

3617
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:34,100
A bit longer.

3618
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,400
(Team Jae Seok, Team Jong Kook)

3619
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:35,800
- Do it slowly. - When it comes out...

3620
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:38,470
(Jae Seok: 9, Daniel: 9, Haha: 10, Seok Jin: 12, Eun Jin: 13)

3621
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,440
- It's the penalty, right? - The penalty.

3622
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,170
Can you see my name? You can't see my name.

3623
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:40,510
(Ji Hyo: 37, Se Chan: 37, Jong Kook: 39, Ye Eun: 39)

3624
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:41,540
(Mu Jun: 40)

3625
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:44,480
(He pressed it!)

3626
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:45,910
- Whose is it? - Is it out?

3627
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:47,550
- It's out. Whose is it? - Is it out?

3628
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:49,480
(Who is the first unlucky penalty receiver?)

3629
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:49,620
- Whose is it? - I got a peek...

3630
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:50,950
- Who is it? - Did you see it? Don't look at it.

3631
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:52,020
Show it to the front.

3632
01:30:52,150 --> 01:30:53,720
- Who is it? - Did you see it? Don't look at it.

3633
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:56,890
(Will it be from Team Jong Kook with way more penalty balls?)

3634
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:54,720
Show it to the front.

3635
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:55,960
- Who is it? - Who is it?

3636
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,590
- It's... - Look forward.

3637
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:58,620
- Choi Daniel. - What?

3638
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,690
Okay!

3639
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:02,330
- Choi Daniel. - What?

3640
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:08,870
(Daniel, who has the fewest penalty balls, is picked first.)

3641
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:03,960
- What is this? - Okay!

3642
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,430
Yes!

3643
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:08,100
He had the fewest penalty balls.

3644
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:10,100
- What is this? - What's going on?

3645
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:12,270
Choi Daniel will receive the penalty.

3646
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:13,510
Does this make sense?

3647
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,010
- This doesn't make sense. - I trust you!

3648
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:16,510
- Does this make sense? - I trust you!

3649
01:31:15,910 --> 01:31:19,250
(Jae Seok's unlucky hands go against the probability.)

3650
01:31:16,510 --> 01:31:17,610
- This doesn't make sense. - Seriously. This...

3651
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:19,080
You never know with this.

3652
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:20,710
- You never know. - What is this?

3653
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:22,880
People got picked before when they only had one ball.

3654
01:31:21,380 --> 01:31:25,480
(What's the result of the draw that no one can be relaxed?)

3655
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:23,880
- With just one ball... - Let's pick the next one.

3656
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,790
Don't look at the ball that comes out.

3657
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,920
(The 2nd draw)

3658
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:29,090
- Look away. - Yes. Don't look at it.

3659
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:31,060
- Did it come out? - Don't look at it.

3660
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:32,630
- I didn't look at it. - Pick it up without looking at it.

3661
01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:34,330
- I didn't look. - Please.

3662
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:36,630
Please.

3663
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,700
- Come on! - It'd be sad if I got caught.

3664
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:39,900
- Seriously. - Kim Mu Jun.

3665
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,100
- Who is it? - Kim Mu Jun.

3666
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:44,370
(Mu Jun will receive the penalty.)

3667
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,470
- Mu Jun will receive the penalty. - I thought it was me.

3668
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:48,170
(Getting penalized after going through everything)

3669
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:45,740
- I thought it was me. - You'll get the penalty.

3670
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:46,810
I thought it was me.

3671
01:31:46,810 --> 01:31:48,240
- Goodness. - Go to the back.

3672
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:52,510
- Now we have five left. - Yes.

3673
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:54,110
- Yes. - Seriously.

3674
01:31:52,810 --> 01:31:55,920
(Drawing the third penalty ball)

3675
01:31:54,110 --> 01:31:56,020
- Really. - One person from that team...

3676
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:57,220
will surely...

3677
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:59,050
- Don't look at it. - It's out.

3678
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:00,790
- Don't look. - Don't look.

3679
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:01,990
- I didn't look. - Let it be a duplicate.

3680
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:03,760
(Will it be from Team Jong Kook again?)

3681
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:03,960
- Don't look. - Let it be Yu Jae Seok.

3682
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:06,290
- Kim Jong Kook. - Kim Jong Kook will...

3683
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:08,390
(Kim Jong Kook is picked.)

3684
01:32:06,290 --> 01:32:07,660
get the penalty.

3685
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:14,170
(With no redundancy, Jong Kook is picked for the penalty.)

3686
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:12,330
You're doing this after a long time.

3687
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:14,170
- That's true. - It's been a long time.

3688
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:15,170
It's been a while.

3689
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:16,870
It's about time to pick the same name.

3690
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:18,240
- Now we have four balls left. - It will overlap.

3691
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,470
- My name is here. - There are four.

3692
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:21,340
- We have four times left. - We all should get picked.

3693
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:23,140
- All of us. - Four times.

3694
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:25,340
- Eun Jin should be picked too. - No.

3695
01:32:24,410 --> 01:32:26,880
(The 4th draw)

3696
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:28,080
No.

3697
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:30,150
(Final penalty balls)

3698
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,680
- And Haha. - Please.

3699
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:31,180
We don't get the same name.

3700
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:33,850
(Daniel: 9, Jong Kook: 39, Mu Jun: 40)

3701
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:33,190
It doesn't overlap.

3702
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:34,320
- It's out. - We didn't see it.

3703
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,320
- Did you see it? - No.

3704
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:36,790
- I think you did. - I saw it.

3705
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:39,460
(Team Jong Kook with many balls...)

3706
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:37,920
- He saw it. - I didn't see it.

3707
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,030
I don't think it's me.

3708
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:40,390
- It doesn't overlap? - It doesn't overlap?

3709
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:43,530
(or a name that's already picked?)

3710
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,230
It doesn't overlap?

3711
01:32:42,230 --> 01:32:43,660
It doesn't overlap?

3712
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:45,430
- Haha. - Me?

3713
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:47,870
(Haha)

3714
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:48,470
Me?

3715
01:32:47,870 --> 01:32:53,410
(Jae Seok keeps picking the members with fewer balls.)

3716
01:32:51,740 --> 01:32:53,770
What did I say when I saw this first?

3717
01:32:53,870 --> 01:32:55,940
- I said I saw my name. - Oh, no.

3718
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:57,110
- Hang on. - I have only 23 balls.

3719
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:58,440
How many balls do I have?

3720
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,910
Daniel has nine balls.

3721
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:02,110
(Drawing Daniel with the least number of balls...)

3722
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:02,420
- I have only 9, but I got picked. - And Haha has 10 balls.

3723
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:04,780
(and Haha with the second least number of balls)

3724
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:04,520
How did you get picked when you had only nine balls?

3725
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:06,220
This is unbelievable.

3726
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,850
(The man with all thumbs didn't draw any duplicates.)

3727
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,490
- All right. - How many draws do we have left?

3728
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:09,460
- He brings bad luck. - We have three draws left.

3729
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:10,590
I didn't mean to pick you.

3730
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:11,690
Move over.

3731
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:15,490
(Mr. Yu is demoted in the end.)

3732
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:14,190
- You shouldn't look. - I won't look.

3733
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:15,730
- Don't look at it. - It has to be Jae Seok.

3734
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:16,730
Yu Jae Seok.

3735
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:18,360
- Press it once. - Don't look.

3736
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,930
- Don't look. - One, two, three.

3737
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:22,670
Don't look.

3738
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:23,970
(Haha presses the 5th ball.)

3739
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:23,700
- It's out. - Please.

3740
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:24,770
- Is it out? - It's out.

3741
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:25,810
Don't look.

3742
01:33:26,210 --> 01:33:27,310
Did you get it?

3743
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:30,340
(Will it be a repeat this time?)

3744
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:29,010
- Does it overlap? - Does it overlap?

3745
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:30,180
- I swear I didn't see it. - Does it overlap?

3746
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:31,580
- Yang Se Chan. - Yang Se Chan.

3747
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:33,250
- Yang Se Chan. - Yang Se Chan.

3748
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:37,380
(Se Chan gets the penalty too.)

3749
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,280
No way.

3750
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:41,190
(Ye Eun and Ji Hyo are still safe.)

3751
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,620
How many draws do we have left?

3752
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:46,090
(Seok Jin, Eun Jin, and Jae Seok are laid-back.)

3753
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:43,220
- Two? - You have two draws left.

3754
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:45,020
- We don't get the same name. - It never overlaps.

3755
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:46,560
Don't look.

3756
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:49,760
(Se Chan presses for the 6th penalty ball.)

3757
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:48,230
Don't look at it.

3758
01:33:48,230 --> 01:33:49,400
Press it briefly.

3759
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:52,160
- Is it out? Don't look. - It's out.

3760
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,900
(The first ball counts between the two.)

3761
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,230
Two balls are out.

3762
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:54,670
We will check the first ball.

3763
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,500
The second one is Kim Mu Jun.

3764
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:59,110
(First of all)

3765
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:57,970
- What a relief. - Okay.

3766
01:33:57,970 --> 01:33:58,970
Kim Mu Jun.

3767
01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:00,940
- What a relief. - The first one.

3768
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:02,170
(Then, what about the first ball?)

3769
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:01,970
The first one.

3770
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:03,140
- The first one. - The first one.

3771
01:34:03,210 --> 01:34:04,210
Yang Se Chan.

3772
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,610
(The first ball is Yang Se Chan's.)

3773
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:09,320
(They got over another crisis.)

3774
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,850
- Let's not overlap. - Now, this is...

3775
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:09,220
- the last draw. - The last one.

3776
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:10,780
- We don't know. I might get picked. - The last one.

3777
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:11,880
You didn't get picked?

3778
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:14,790
(There's only one ball left.)

3779
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:13,720
This is the last person.

3780
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:14,790
Ahn Eun Jin.

3781
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:18,120
(If they don't get picked here, they will win the prizes.)

3782
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:17,360
- Jae Seok. - Please. Let it be Jae Seok.

3783
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:22,130
(The machine runs for the last time at the moment.)

3784
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:22,130
The last one.

3785
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:25,660
(The ball is out.)

3786
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:25,560
All right.

3787
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:26,730
I think it's me.

3788
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:28,830
(They've been working hard to keep their prizes without giving up.)

3789
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:32,670
(It will come to fruition if they get through this crisis.)

3790
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:30,970
Eun Jin or...

3791
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:37,110
(Whose name does the last penalty ball have?)

3792
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:41,310
(Whose name does the last penalty ball have?)

3793
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:42,950
Song Ji Hyo.

3794
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:44,650
Song Ji Hyo.

3795
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,120
(Song Ji Hyo)

3796
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:46,650
I survived!

3797
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,690
(The Unlucky Hand that doesn't allow redundancy until the end)

3798
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:50,820
Ye Eun.

3799
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:55,130
(Now that Ji Hyo is picked, the result for Team Jong Kook is...)

3800
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,700
- I'm the only survivor. - Ye Eun.

3801
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:57,960
- Ye Eun survived. - She's the only survivor.

3802
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,370
- On Team Jong Kook, - How...

3803
01:34:59,370 --> 01:35:00,800
Ye Eun is the only survivor.

3804
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:05,600
(Ye Eun gets all the prizes for Team Jong Kook.)

3805
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,800
Ye Eun gets all the prizes.

3806
01:35:05,670 --> 01:35:08,970
(She unexpectedly won all the best prizes.)

3807
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:08,310
- That's amazing. - I can't believe this.

3808
01:35:08,410 --> 01:35:10,710
- On Team Jae Seok, - My goodness.

3809
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:13,750
the three members will share the prizes.

3810
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:14,580
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, and Eun Jin get Team Jae Seok's prizes.)

3811
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:15,710
I didn't expect our team members to be picked.

3812
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:17,380
(After completing the mission)

3813
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:17,280
- I know. - This is unbelievable.

3814
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,380
We got two members.

3815
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,820
Today, we have...

3816
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:22,690
- six members to get the penalty. - Yes.

3817
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:25,860
(These 6 people became the penalty receivers.)

3818
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:24,360
Today's penalty is...

3819
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:28,160
- You kept giving up things today. - Yes.

3820
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:30,430
- Making kimchi? - To celebrate kimchi-making season,

3821
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:31,300
(The penalty for the kimchi-making season)

3822
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:34,270
you will make kimchi with 30 heads of napa cabbage.

3823
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:35,370
Unbelievable.

3824
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,670
Unbelievable.

3825
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:39,710
(It is a penalty they want to give up.)

3826
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:40,310
- It will be hard. - Before the penalty,

3827
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:41,470
we'd like to hear how our guests liked today's race.

3828
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:42,480
Okay. Stand in the middle.

3829
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,880
- "Dynamite Kiss." - Our guests.

3830
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,510
I had a lot of fun thanks to you.

3831
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:47,780
- Nice. - I'll come again.

3832
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:49,180
- Sure. - Eun Jin.

3833
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:51,120
- Mu Jun. - Good.

3834
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,990
Yes. I also...

3835
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:55,690
had a pleasant experience. Thank you so much.

3836
01:35:55,690 --> 01:35:57,020
Good.

3837
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,390
The crazy duck was funny.

3838
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,130
(The two guests' crazy sense of humor)

3839
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:01,090
- Crazy duck. - It was fun.

3840
01:36:01,090 --> 01:36:03,030
Except for the members to get the penalty,

3841
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:05,030
- you may go home now. - Thank you.

3842
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:08,200
(The members leave with a full load of prizes.)

3843
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:07,600
- Okay. - Thank you.

3844
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:11,740
(The kimchi factory opens outside.)

3845
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:09,770
How do we do this?

3846
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:13,270
- Make sure it is fully stuffed. - Okay.

3847
01:36:13,770 --> 01:36:15,740
- Deep inside the cabbage. - Have you not tried it before?

3848
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:18,440
We should play some songs when we do this.

3849
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,510
Right.

3850
01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:21,610
Who is your favorite artist?

3851
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:22,680
(Mu Jun)

3852
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:23,550
- I like... - Be honest.

3853
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:25,150
- Seriously, I like... - Yes.

3854
01:36:25,150 --> 01:36:26,250
those days.

3855
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:27,590
- When? - What do you mean?

3856
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:28,620
Well...

3857
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:30,420
Turbo and...

3858
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:31,590
- Come on. - Come on.

3859
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:33,290
- Stop it. - Hey!

3860
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:33,730
(He likes it.)

3861
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:35,490
- You were born in 1998. - And...

3862
01:36:33,730 --> 01:36:35,790
(In 1998)

3863
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,360
I often listen to "Busan Vacance."

3864
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,270
- Hey. - I'm serious.

3865
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:41,200
(He has sly social skills.)

3866
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:40,670
- I... - He has a sophisticated taste.

3867
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:41,900
- "Busan Vacance." - Come on.

3868
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:43,340
- I'm from Busan. - You are?

3869
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:44,370
- Yes. - Are you from Busan?

3870
01:36:44,370 --> 01:36:45,370
Hey.

3871
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:47,640
(The fake Lotte fan is worked up.)

3872
01:36:45,370 --> 01:36:47,170
- I'm from Busan. - Why did you not tell me?

3873
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:49,010
I have a question.

3874
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:51,410
Haha isn't from Busan, is he?

3875
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:53,250
No, he isn't. That brat is just a fraud.

3876
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,280
He's a fake.

3877
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,780
- "That brat?" - He says, "That brat."

3878
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:57,520
(The Germany-born fraud)

3879
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:57,080
- But why... - He's not from Busan.

3880
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:58,450
He just performed in Busan a few times.

3881
01:36:58,450 --> 01:36:59,650
He's a fake.

3882
01:36:59,650 --> 01:37:01,090
Keep your mouth shut.

3883
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:02,860
He's just taking advantage of Busan.

3884
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:04,620
You and I are family now.

3885
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:06,360
- Okay. - Aren't you from Banpo?

3886
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:07,490
It's done.

3887
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:08,830
We're done. This is the last one.

3888
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:09,900
This is fun.

3889
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,830
(They successfully made kimchi without giving up.)

3890
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:11,760
The penalty is over.

3891
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,630
- Okay. - Yes.

3892
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,570
(We thank Eun Jin and Mu Jun. Please support "Dynamite Kiss.")

3893
01:37:14,170 --> 01:37:15,400
They look pretty.

3894
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:22,210
(Running Man)
