1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,380
(The new rented member, Choi Daniel)

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,640
(Daniel showed up
with a shocking appearance.)

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,150
(There was a hidden mission
he didn't know about.)

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,350
(They need to bring him faster
to get more money.)

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,960
(The members' special
wash and pick-up service)

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,660
(But Problem Child Daniel
is a loose canon.)

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,460
(The total amount they got
was 150 dollars.)

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,370
(They have to complete
Daniel's course with 150 dollars.)

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,140
(They forgot about the money
and just enjoyed the food.)

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,370
(It's confirmed that
4 members will get the penalty.)

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,110
(The grand finale
of Daniel's course)

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,950
(Driving out to the suburbs)

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,990
(Suburbs?)

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,190
(And Ye Eun is driving?)

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,520
Don't you know how much we're worth?

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,290
(Jae Seok starts teaching her
at the last minute.)

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,760
What is this? The gas pedal?

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,370
(Novice Driver Ji is worse
than he thought.)

19
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,670
(N for driving!)

20
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,740
N is a neutral.
The car just rolls freely.

21
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,540
I can't drive when there are cars.

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,240
(The truth about Dumulmeori
that everyone was curious about)

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,480
(Can she really go
to Dumulmeori like that?)

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,680
(If she makes it at once,
that means she's good at driving.)

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,710
(Stop)

26
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,750
What are you doing?

27
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,920
- Have you ever driven before?
- No.

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,120
(- Have you ever driven before?
- No.)

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,150
So...

30
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,020
- you've never driven on the road.
- No.

31
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,020
- Get out.
- Hang on.

32
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,360
(The driving lesson is stopped.)

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,430
What are you guys doing?

34
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,130
She has never driven on the road.

35
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,230
- Can't she drive at all?
- Not at all.

36
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,930
- Now...
- I think I'll be okay.

37
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,970
Listen.

38
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,870
She put the gear in N to drive.

39
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,440
What do you think you're doing?

40
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,440
She's not just a novice driver.

41
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,140
- She has no experience at all.
- I think I'll be fine.

42
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,540
So you got a driver's license.

43
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,010
- Do you plan on driving or not?
- I do.

44
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,580
If you are, you should learn
to drive on the road.

45
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,580
- Okay?
- Yes.

46
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,780
Get in.

47
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,320
(Jae Seok ends up sitting
behind the wheel.)

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
Am I that bad?

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,820
- Get in.
- Will it work?

50
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,890
No.

51
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,120
- No? I knew it.
- No.

52
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,290
Why not? Ye Eun.

53
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,960
I should teach you how to drive.

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,300
I'll teach you.

55
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,660
I don't think I should do that.

56
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,170
- I'll end up falling out with you.
- No.

57
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,640
Ye Eun, if you drive
for the first time,

58
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,600
you'll probably feel this way.

59
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,940
When I first tried driving,
I found it hard to stay in the lane.

60
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,970
That's right.

61
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,210
- Staying in your lane.
- Staying in the lane.

62
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,410
You will lean to one side.

63
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,350
- That's because you're on the left.
- Right.

64
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,380
But the car should be in the center.

65
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,550
Your right foot
should be in the center.

66
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,420
- Which is your right foot? Right.
- Novice drivers tend...

67
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,780
- to lean to the left.
- So you hold the wheel like this.

68
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,020
Your right foot should be
in the center.

69
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
- Okay?
- Yes.

70
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,820
And you should practice
checking your rearview mirrors.

71
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,760
When cutting in,
there can be a blind spot.

72
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,660
So you can look back
as if you're driving a bike.

73
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,360
- Then you'll be safe.
- First...

74
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,400
I'm an accident-free driver.

75
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,830
You should have quick eyes.

76
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,830
- You should practice a lot.
- The thing is...

77
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,870
- You need a quick wit.
- You should practice a lot.

78
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,300
And you shouldn't hesitate
when you cut in.

79
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,270
- You shouldn't hesitate.
- You should make it clear.

80
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,280
- You should cut in quickly.
- When you're to drive...

81
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,440
I know.

82
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,140
- All seven of them are now...
- When you cut in,

83
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,580
you should push in
from the front of the car.

84
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,950
Once you push in, it's done.

85
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,780
Cut in front of the car
that's in front of you.

86
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,780
- What?
- No.

87
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,250
- If you do that...
- When you cut in...

88
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,820
- When you cut in...
- Then they can't blame you.

89
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,390
- That's not it.
- Then turn on the blinker.

90
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,260
- No.
- In front of the car next to you.

91
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,360
- That's enough.
- That's not it.

92
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,730
- I will...
- I'm telling you.

93
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,630
Why are there so many people
teaching her how to drive?

94
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,300
(But the nightmare
became a reality.)

95
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:21,810
(The nerve-racking driving lesson
for Ye Eun will continue soon.)

96
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,980
Ye Eun is beside herself
with worries.

97
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,010
We are just worried about you.

98
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,610
- I shouldn't be doing this.
- Stay focused.

99
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,810
All seven of them are talking
at once.

100
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,250
Daniel, what do you usually do?

101
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,990
- Me?
- What do you like?

102
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,020
He doesn't even drink.

103
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,390
- You don't drink?
- I can't drink.

104
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,990
- You can't?
- What do you do then?

105
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,520
I just drink coffee.

106
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,960
- Do you like coffee?
- I like having chats at a cafe.

107
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,460
- Going to good restaurants?
- You like to do things like that.

108
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,730
- I don't like going to restaurants.
- You like to relax at home.

109
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,030
- I don't like waiting in line.
- I see.

110
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,130
- You don't like it.
- I hate it too.

111
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,340
- I hate it.
- We're just like you.

112
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,500
- We're the same.
- I'd rather go somewhere else.

113
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,840
- Everything tastes good.
- Right.

114
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,640
I like diners for taxi drivers.

115
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,040
- That's really good.
- That's it.

116
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,180
- I really like it.
- We are so similar.

117
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,410
- It's really good.
- We have similar tastes.

118
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,850
- Now I like you even more.
- I know.

119
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,150
Haha is really funny.

120
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,880
He's quite simple.

121
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,020
When Daniel chose sundaegukbap,

122
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,020
Haha said, "We really hit it off."

123
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,130
- He's really simple.
- He's so simple.

124
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,100
- We all are simple.
- It brought down walls between us.

125
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,200
Seriously.

126
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,600
- Look at that.
- By the way...

127
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,300
- The view is nice.
- This is really nice.

128
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,470
Jae Seok, this is so nice.

129
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,900
Okay. This is Dumulmeori.

130
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,800
And Seok Sam is
out of his mind. Okay.

131
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,900
This is really nice.

132
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,970
- I want to stare at the water here.
- It's beautiful, isn't it?

133
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,840
I just want to sit here
and stare at the water.

134
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,180
The weather is great.

135
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,110
I wish we had a mat.

136
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,350
We should have a corn dog here.

137
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,750
- Nice.
- The corn dog is really big.

138
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,850
(They must eat a chewy
lotus leaf corn dog here.)

139
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,680
- This is really nice.
- Gosh.

140
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,290
The current amount of money
is minus 31.1 dollars.

141
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,260
- You're merciless.
- Up to minus 100 dollars,

142
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,520
- four members will get the penalty.
- I see.

143
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,060
If it exceeds the amount,
five members will get the penalty.

144
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,930
- Okay. Let's not eat too much.
- All right.

145
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,800
- We will have to survive.
- Yes.

146
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,000
We have no choice now.

147
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,570
- Daniel.
- Yes.

148
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,570
- Did you want to do this?
- This is really nice.

149
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,640
I was so excited in the car
on my way here.

150
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,210
- It's really nice.
- It felt like a real picnic.

151
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,810
I'm so happy to go with you guys
in the same car.

152
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,810
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

153
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,110
This is really fun.

154
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,210
The beach
we used to walk along together

155
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,420
(Daniel was excited
about the picnic like a little kid.)

156
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,580
- I feel so energetic.
- Yes.

157
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,090
- Are you feeling good?
- I'm feeling great.

158
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,550
- You were even singing.
- It felt like a school trip.

159
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,690
The weather was really nice...

160
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,760
- on our way here.
- It's nice.

161
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,390
- Hello.
- Hello.

162
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,530
- We should eat corn dogs.
- The corn dogs.

163
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,070
We should eat a corn dog.

164
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,300
The lotus leaf corn dog here...

165
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,500
- is very famous.
- Be careful.

166
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,840
- I see. The lotus leaf corn dog.
- Yes.

167
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,940
(But they just walk past it?)

168
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,410
All right.

169
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,270
- What? We're not eating?
- What?

170
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,440
Why aren't we eating?

171
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,840
- Aren't we eating the corn dogs?
- Why aren't we eating?

172
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,450
Aren't we going to eat that?

173
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,610
- We have no money.
- I see.

174
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,050
Daniel, do you want to eat it?

175
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,750
Today is all about Daniel.

176
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,050
- I've never tried it before.
- It's really good.

177
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,860
- Is it? I'm curious.
- I want to eat ice cream.

178
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,790
They also sell
some take-out corn dogs.

179
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,290
- Really?
- Yes.

180
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,630
- I want to eat it.
- It's really good...

181
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,900
with a lot of sugar.

182
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,400
- I just want a bite.
- It's really good.

183
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,800
They didn't have this
when I came here last time.

184
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,070
- It has been here for a long time.
- Really?

185
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,270
- The line moves quickly though.
- Really?

186
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,480
People just pick up
a corn dog and leave.

187
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,280
- It's thin and chewy.
- It's like an ordinary corn dog.

188
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,950
- It's not an ordinary corn dog.
- It's not?

189
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,950
Let's eat a corn dog.

190
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,280
It's fine as long as it doesn't
exceed minus 100 dollars.

191
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,920
Okay. Let's go and eat.

192
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,150
Okay.

193
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,790
- This is the corn dog place.
- Where is it?

194
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,690
- Is it here?
- We should eat a corn dog.

195
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,230
- How cute.
- This is "Gypsy Woman."

196
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,430
It's "Gypsy Woman."

197
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,200
("Gypsy Woman"
by Lee Chi Hyun and Beotnimdeul)

198
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,900
It's an old song.

199
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,970
- "In my heart."
- Lee Chi Hyun and Beotnimdeul.

200
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,870
- There is love in my heart too
- There is love in my heart too

201
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,470
(They are Jae Seok and Beotnimdeul.)

202
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,710
They are dads.

203
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,680
Father!

204
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:54,550
(The fathers didn't forget
the lyrics from 37 years ago.)

205
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,030
(The lyrics of old memories
filled with their longing for youth)

206
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,560
- Look at their backs.
- Wandering endlessly

207
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,800
- The fathers.
- Following the stars at night

208
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,530
- Following flowers during the day
- Following flowers during the day

209
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,570
Three fathers.

210
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,370
- Lonely Gypsy woman
- Lonely Gypsy woman

211
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,470
("Gypsy Woman"
by Jae Seok and Beotnimdeul)

212
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,470
Look at them.

213
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,470
- It looks like they're drunk.
- They are here for an outing.

214
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,840
They look really happy.

215
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,380
You picked a bothersome one.

216
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,110
I love "Gypsy Woman."

217
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,780
(They said it was bothersome,
but they're having the best time.)

218
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,280
This is really nice.

219
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,350
This is it.

220
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,190
- I just want a bite.
- It's really delicious.

221
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,520
- Really?
- I'll share it with you.

222
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,990
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

223
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,190
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

224
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,590
Hi!

225
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,000
- Hi.
- Seok Jin.

226
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,630
They like you.

227
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,430
- Seok Jin.
- Hello.

228
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,170
- They're excited to see you.
- Hi.

229
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,200
Seok Jin is their star.

230
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,740
- They're fans.
- You're so handsome.

231
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,970
- I'm not...
- You look better than Jae Seok.

232
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,140
(Laughing)

233
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,080
I look better in person, right?
I'm slim.

234
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,650
- You look a lot better in person.
- Good.

235
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,050
- Thank you.
- We shouldn't be on TV.

236
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,420
- Don't worry about it.
- We're here for an outing.

237
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,690
- Can your voices go on air?
- Sure.

238
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,820
- Bye.
- Bye.

239
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,390
That was hilarious.

240
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,490
Who are the three?

241
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,690
- They have spicy and sweet ones.
- Spicy and sweet.

242
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,660
- I'll have the sweet one.
- The spicy one is delicious.

243
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,900
- I want the sweet one too.
- It's not spicy.

244
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,370
- Sweet one.
- But it's not spicy.

245
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,400
- Then...
- I'll...

246
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,970
- I'll have the sweet one.
- have ice cream here.

247
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,870
- I want ice cream.
- I want it too.

248
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,500
- You can't just eat anything.
- But I want ice cream.

249
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,270
- I want ice cream too.
- I want to eat it too.

250
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,340
We can spend another 68.9 dollars.

251
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,540
- Right.
- If it's 68.9 dollars,

252
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,880
- it's enough.
- Right.

253
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,810
- I want it too.
- We're here, so we should eat.

254
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,910
- I'll have a corn dog.
- All right.

255
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,680
- Eat it. Who wants a corn dog?
- Come here.

256
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,750
- I want a corn dog.
- I want ice cream.

257
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,150
- I'll have decaffeinated coffee.
- Okay.

258
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,690
Then I'll have
decaffeinated coffee too.

259
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,160
Only you and I will have a corn dog?

260
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,090
- Let's share it.
- I want a bite.

261
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,430
We will buy two corn dogs then.

262
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,060
- Okay.
- We will buy two.

263
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,800
We will have 1 spicy corn dog
and 1 sweet corn dog.

264
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,930
- Thank you.
- With sugar?

265
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,000
Yes, please.

266
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,900
(2 corn dogs: 8 dollars)

267
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,640
We will have two iced Americanos.

268
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,070
- Decaffeinated?
- Decaffeinated.

269
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,040
Hello. I'd like
to have soft ice cream.

270
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,440
- I should have ice cream too.
- Me too.

271
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,110
- Lotus leaf ice cream.
- Make it five.

272
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,280
(2 coffee: 9 dollars,
5 ice cream: 20 dollars)

273
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,880
When else would I get to eat it?

274
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,680
Is the ice cream served
on a lotus leaf?

275
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,880
- No.
- It has lotus leaves in it.

276
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,980
- It's in the ice cream.
- The lotus leaf powder.

277
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,650
- I'll have soft ice cream.
- Soft ice cream?

278
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,990
- My gosh.
- Why is it green?

279
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,690
- That's amazing.
- My gosh.

280
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,520
- That's a lot.
- It looks great.

281
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,160
Ye Eun, you should eat it first.

282
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,700
- No, elders first.
- Ye Eun first.

283
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,560
- My gosh.
- Elders first.

284
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,530
- It's the perfect mouth...
- Is it delicious?

285
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,170
- for eating ice cream.
- True.

286
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,700
- My gosh.
- It's big.

287
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,810
Your nose is bigger
than the ice cream.

288
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,610
- You slander him with a smile.
- Sorry.

289
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,810
Aren't you going to eat this?

290
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,350
- It looks great.
- The corn dog is here.

291
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,050
- Let me try a bite.
- Try it. It's really good.

292
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,050
- This is the spicy one.
- This is really...

293
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,280
- It's so good.
- Jae Seok.

294
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,620
- Can I try the corn dog?
- Go ahead.

295
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,460
- I really wanted to try it.
- Go ahead and eat it.

296
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,020
- Can I try it first?
- Is it good?

297
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,990
(How does the lotus leaf corn dog
covered with sugar taste?)

298
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,860
- He takes a big bite.
- It looks great.

299
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,500
What do you think?
How does it taste?

300
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,060
- How is it?
- It's good, isn't it?

301
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,530
- He's eating it well.
- It must be really good.

302
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,530
It's really good.

303
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,870
- Your ice cream is here.
- It's so good.

304
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,070
- I'll take this.
- Yes.

305
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,140
(The sweet and salty corn dog
acknowledged by Food Fighter)

306
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,210
- It's good, isn't it?
- This place is really nice.

307
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,240
It's really delicious.

308
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,480
This is what Ye Eun told me.

309
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,210
- It's good with the thin batter.
- I know. It's good, right?

310
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,980
- You like it, right?
- It's really good.

311
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,910
- It's unbelievable.
- I know.

312
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,280
- Look.
- It's so good.

313
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
- The batter is thin.
- Scoop this up.

314
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,250
- You calculated the prices, right?
- Yes.

315
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,520
- Okay.
- It's really good.

316
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,330
The current amount
is minus 68.1 dollars.

317
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,160
- Then...
- You have 31.9 dollars left.

318
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,660
We can spend another 31.9 dollars.

319
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,330
- Let's move.
- It's really good.

320
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,430
It's so delicious.

321
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,170
- The batter is really thin.
- I told you it would be good.

322
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,800
- It's insane.
- This is nice.

323
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,670
This is nice.

324
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,040
Gosh, I really like this.

325
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,340
- Look at the sun glitter.
- How nice.

326
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,680
- Look at the sparkling lights.
- It's beautiful.

327
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,450
- Is that the sun glitter?
- Yes.

328
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,220
- The sun glitter.
- It's so pretty.

329
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,250
- If it weren't for the shoot...
- I wouldn't...

330
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,850
come here by myself.

331
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,890
- If I had a wife,
- Right.

332
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,460
I would come to a place like this.

333
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,230
It would be weird
if you came here alone.

334
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,560
- It'd be weird, right?
- It'd be strange.

335
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,460
- And...
- And if I came with male friends,

336
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,930
- it would be weird.
- Of course.

337
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,130
You wouldn't stay here for long.

338
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,570
I should have a wife and children...

339
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,470
- to be at a place like this.
- You're right.

340
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,540
They are walking really fast.

341
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,740
- Let's take a photo there.
- They're fast.

342
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,110
Let's do that.

343
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,480
The sunshine is nice today,
so the photo will look great.

344
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,710
I'm just glad to be
a part of this group.

345
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,150
You're on the younger side.

346
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,980
I'm still too young
to fall in that group.

347
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,750
You should be
with us Millennials and Gen Zers.

348
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,090
Where should I take
the photo of you, Ji Hyo?

349
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,320
- Over there.
- By that frame.

350
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,690
With Han River in the background.

351
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,830
- This is amazing.
- A photo?

352
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,900
- This is a photo spot.
- Goodness.

353
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,870
Sir, is this the best angle
to take a photo?

354
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,870
Look at that.
(The renowned photographer
at Dumulmeori)

355
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,940
You take photos and frame them.

356
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,840
Here at Dumulmeori.

357
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,570
Should we get a small one
that's 20 dollars?

358
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,680
- The 20-dollar photo.
- Sure.

359
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,080
- We'll get one for Daniel.
- Get one for Daniel.

360
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,450
- As a souvenir.
- Yes, let's get one.

361
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,450
Sure.

362
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,650
Shouldn't we stand behind it?

363
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,320
- No, in front of it.
- In front of it?

364
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,550
Jong Kook, come on.

365
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,090
- How many of you are there?
- Where... There are eight of us.

366
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,160
Are there 8? 4 in the front
and 4 in the back, then.

367
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,290
I see.

368
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,590
- The elderly should sit.
- The older four should sit.

369
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,460
- Am I one of you?
- Sit in the front.

370
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,600
- You should sit.
- The older four.

371
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,760
- That includes you.
- Please say I'm not.

372
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,270
- Haha.
- That includes you.

373
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,370
- You too.
- The older four includes you.

374
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,340
The older four. That includes you.

375
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,440
(He only got 10 minutes
to experience being young.)

376
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,870
Ji Hyo...

377
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,970
- The older four.
- Get over here.

378
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,380
Ji Hyo's younger than you.

379
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,510
- There.
- You're one of us.

380
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,780
- Good.
- Five of you can sit.

381
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,610
Haha, did you end up joining them?

382
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,520
I got excited for nothing.

383
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,120
All right.

384
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,790
(Making a V
regardless of age or gender)

385
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,330
- There's something I have to ask.
- Sure.

386
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,160
- Did you...
- Yes?

387
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,360
bring your pouch?

388
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,400
- Our pouches?
- What pouch?

389
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,630
(What pouch?)

390
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,970
- What pouch?
- What kind of pouch?

391
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,470
One with money in it?

392
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,770
No, laughter.

393
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,910
- Right.
- I see.

394
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,240
No, laughter.

395
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,910
(A pouch
with laughter tucked inside)

396
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,940
Do you have it with you?

397
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,950
- Should we open it?
- Sure.

398
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,780
- We have a lot of them.
- We'll open it.

399
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,650
They're not heavy,
so everyone should carry one around.

400
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,420
- Okay.
- We'll pull out our pouches.

401
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,190
- We'll let our laughter out.
- All right.

402
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,520
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

403
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,860
(Letting their laughter out)

404
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,230
(Opening the pouch
brought out brighter smiles.)

405
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,730
- Miss, lean forward a bit.
- Sure.

406
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,170
I bet you were trying
to make your head appear smaller.

407
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,430
Let out the laughs.

408
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,330
- Let out the laughs.
- Let it out!

409
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,940
(They laugh loudly once again.)

410
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,940
- You're done.
- Okay.

411
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,770
What you spent more
was less than 100 dollars.

412
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,940
We'll head out to see...

413
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,080
which four of you
will receive the penalty.

414
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,280
This was like an actual picnic.

415
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,010
What's this?
Why is the net up so high?

416
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,010
- What's that?
- It's not...

417
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,020
the foot volleyball we know.

418
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,080
- This isn't conventional.
- They did something weird to it.

419
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,120
It's not the foot volleyball
we know.

420
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,150
(We can look forward to a game
of unconventional foot volleyball.)

421
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,590
This isn't
the foot volleyball we know.

422
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,960
First, split into 2 teams of 4.

423
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
The losing team...

424
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,630
- will receive the penalty.
- The losing team?

425
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,760
- Yes.
- The losing team?

426
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,800
- Let's do this!
- This is a game we need to win.

427
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,630
Meanwhile, the winning team
will win a prize.

428
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,870
What? Let's go!

429
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,070
- All right.
- Let's do this!

430
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,440
Two should play
rock-paper-scissors and...

431
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,000
- Here's what we'll do.
- Right.

432
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,570
Daniel and Seok Sam.

433
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,340
- Winners on one side and...
- Ssaebssaeb and Haha.

434
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,410
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- Winners versus losers.

435
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,510
It'll then be Jong Kook and me.

436
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,710
- See who wins.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

437
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,250
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Who won?

438
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,110
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors. Okay!

439
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,550
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

440
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,580
(Win, Lose)

441
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,890
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Did you win?

442
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,390
- I lost.
- Did you lose?

443
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,550
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- I won.

444
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,690
- Did you win?
- Team Winners.

445
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,990
- Team Winners.
- Yes, Team Winners.

446
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,630
- We're already doomed.
- Are you on Team Winners?

447
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,030
- Team Winners!
- The team still has us two.

448
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,530
- But...
- You can play, right?

449
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,230
- He can't play foot volleyball.
- No?

450
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,700
He's terrible at this game.
We're doomed.

451
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,900
(Daniel says he's bad
at foot volleyball.)

452
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,640
- What do we do?
- We're doomed.

453
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,440
I can't believe we have
Daniel and Ye Eun on our team.

454
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,170
Ye Eun, are you good at this?

455
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,310
Of course, I'm terrible at it.

456
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,410
- Right?
- Yes.

457
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,140
- Look at them.
- He has two left feet.

458
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,880
- He's a dummy.
- Trust me.

459
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,650
- A dummy?
- You have to do really well.

460
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,650
- A dummy?
- You have to do really well.

461
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,990
- I'm terrible at this game.
- We're doomed.

462
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,220
I'm bad at any game
that uses a ball.

463
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,120
- We've already won, right?
- There's no way we can lose.

464
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,720
We've already won.

465
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,290
We couldn't possibly lose.

466
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,630
Here are the rules of the game.

467
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,630
The game is
All-time High Volleyball King.

468
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,600
Unlike the usual foot volleyball game,

469
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,000
- Exactly.
- you will play with a net...

470
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,740
- that's jumbo-sized.
- I see.

471
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,510
To attack, kick the ball
through the hole...

472
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,970
or over the net.

473
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,840
- Can we send it over the net?
- Is that allowed?

474
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,610
If the ball bounces off the net,
just continue to play.

475
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,680
I get it.

476
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,850
It'll be 4 versus 4,

477
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,120
and the 1st team
to score 7 points will win.

478
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,320
Daniel, here's a practice round.

479
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,390
(Practicing before the actual game)

480
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,220
- Is this a practice round?
- Yes.

481
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,890
Okay.

482
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,290
(How good is the rented member,
Daniel, at foot volleyball?)

483
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,690
Let's see what you can do.

484
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,430
(He couldn't kick it
through the hole.)

485
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,200
So that's the best you can do.

486
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,800
He has two left feet.

487
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
(Daniel seems to be
as bad at this as he said.)

488
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,830
This isn't easy.
I'm to kick it through that hole?

489
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,870
- Yes, or kick it over the net.
- I see.

490
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,440
- Would that be easier?
- That'd be easier.

491
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
- Okay.
- Really?

492
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,640
- Receive.
- There you go.

493
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,070
- Take your time.
- All right.

494
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,140
- Send it over.
- Kick.

495
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,440
- Send it over. That's it.
- With the head.

496
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,550
With the head.
(Groaning)

497
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,180
(It hit him in his privates
of all places.)

498
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,320
- I can't believe him.
- Why let it hit you there?

499
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,320
Why do I see Kwang Soo in him?

500
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,260
- He's just like Kwang Soo.
- I see Kwang Soo in him.

501
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,960
- You've got to be kidding me.
- I can't be...

502
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,290
- on his team.
- Right.

503
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,390
- I can't be on his team.
- Are you okay?

504
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,300
- This is no joke.
- Sing the national anthem.

505
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,760
(My gosh...)

506
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,630
- All right.
- That must've hurt.

507
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,300
- The ball is quite hard.
- He got hit squarely.

508
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,640
(The practice run ends with them
seeing how Daniel can play.)

509
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,370
- That cap...
- Check out his cap.

510
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,570
makes him look more like Kwang Soo.

511
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,240
Just so you know,
the penalty involves...

512
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,080
doing something
in a different location.

513
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,050
- No way. I can't have that.
- What?

514
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,580
If we lose, we'll receive a penalty.

515
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,580
- We need to win.
- We should win.

516
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,850
Just don't kick
with the tip of your foot.

517
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,420
Let's bring it in, guys.

518
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,790
- Sure.
- Right.

519
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,520
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

520
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,590
- Go, team!
- Go, team!

521
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,620
(Team Jae Seok with two weak players
dreams of a miracle.)

522
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,660
- We have to win.
- We need to win today.

523
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,660
- I don't see us losing.
- Let's just win.

524
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,260
- One, two, three. Go, team.
- One, two, three. Go, team.

525
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,100
- Let's do this.
- This will be 70-percent comedy...

526
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,900
- and 30-percent realism.
- Let's go.

527
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,870
- The game begins.
- Go, team!

528
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,100
- Bring it.
- We...

529
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,500
- Let's win.
- We have to win.

530
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,670
- Let's go.
- The penalty is a nuisance.

531
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,770
(Team Jae Seok is on the offense
with Haha's serve.)

532
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,280
- Okay.
- My ball.

533
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,010
Okay.

534
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,150
(Team Jong Kook
is solid as expected.)

535
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,850
- Here. Let me.
- Take your time.

536
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,680
(Seok Sam gently sends
the ball over.)

537
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,120
Send it over. There you go.

538
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,650
Okay!

539
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,150
- Nice!
- We did it.

540
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,220
(He just moved out of the way.)

541
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,720
(As expected,
Team Jong Kook scores first.)

542
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,730
That's 1 to 0.

543
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,860
- I'm sorry. All right.
- Play with confidence.

544
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,230
I'll be the one to receive it.

545
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,660
- My private part...
- Play with confidence.

546
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,800
I got scared because of how it
hit me in the balls earlier.

547
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,200
- I'll be the one to receive it.
- Okay.

548
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,370
Is it their serve?

549
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,400
I'll be the one to receive it.

550
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,900
Hit the net on purpose and...

551
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,410
- And then send it over.
- Right.

552
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,570
(They'll have it hit the net
and send it over with a header.)

553
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,280
- Here we go.
- It won't be easy.

554
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,380
(It bounced off the net
like they planned!)

555
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,680
Seok Jin's up. A header!

556
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,110
(He couldn't send it over!)

557
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,750
Out of the way!

558
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,890
Twice.

559
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,890
- Go for it.
- Go.

560
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,720
- It bounced twice.
- Three times.

561
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,760
- It bounced twice.
- The ball bounced twice.

562
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,190
I can't believe that didn't work.

563
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,190
- You should serve.
- Take your time.

564
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,290
(Team Jae Seok on the offense.)

565
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,630
- The same person...
- Here we go.

566
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,960
- Go ahead.
- My gosh.

567
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,670
- There you go.
- Watch out for the breeze.

568
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,370
- Just keep playing.
- Seok Jin, go for it.

569
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,600
(Jong Kook tossed the ball
giving Seok Sam a chance to score.)

570
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,940
Seok Jin, go for it.

571
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,970
What's the matter with you?

572
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,840
(What?)

573
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,240
What's the matter with you?

574
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,680
(They lost another point.)

575
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,720
What's your deal?

576
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,190
(Laughing hysterically)

577
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,090
(He laughs at them hysterically
as a means to tease them.)

578
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,220
(Laughing hysterically)

579
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,420
We scored.

580
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,360
What's the matter with you?

581
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,460
(Seok Sam is the reason
they lost consecutive points.)

582
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,960
Come on!

583
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,000
- It's only because...
- That wasn't an easy save.

584
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,400
- You see,
- We scored.

585
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,440
I was aiming for a header,

586
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,870
but then I changed my mind.

587
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,770
- That's when...
- I can't believe you.

588
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,340
Seok Jin, you're the best!

589
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,340
- Seok Jin, we...
- Why are you sending it my way?

590
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,850
- That wasn't us.
- It wasn't intentional.

591
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,850
(Jong Kook passed him the ball.)

592
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,850
The breeze we have sends it his way.

593
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,320
- Even with the wind...
- Hold on.

594
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,950
Mr. Double Denim is good at this.

595
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,050
- I agree.
- Darn it.

596
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,420
(He lets out his frustration
on the ball instead.)

597
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,690
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

598
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,560
- We can do this.
- We can.

599
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
(Team Jae Seok's on the offense.)

600
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,860
- Good.
- Stay calm.

601
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,560
(A good serve from Haha)

602
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,560
What? Okay, good.

603
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,400
- Take your time.
- Take your time!

604
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,430
(Out)

605
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,700
(He avoided the ball
that came his way.)

606
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,900
- Take your time.
- Take your time!

607
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,940
(A home run)

608
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,570
Why didn't you let it bounce?

609
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,240
- Why didn't you let it bounce?
- Seok Jin!

610
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,810
- I thought it'd go out.
- Seok Jin, please.

611
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,650
I'm sorry about that.
But we'll still win. Don't worry.

612
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,720
- We'll still win. Don't worry.
- It's okay.

613
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,080
(Seok Sam's continuous misplays)

614
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,650
Send the ball to Seok Jin.

615
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,950
Send it to Seok Jin, no matter what.

616
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,660
- He's actively playing the game.
- He's the weakest link.

617
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,820
- It's okay.
- There's no way...

618
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,460
- we'll lose to them.
- All right.

619
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,660
Good.

620
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,760
(Haha will serve again.)

621
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,800
Good.

622
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,930
- Okay, we're good.
- Okay.

623
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,830
- Okay, we're good.
- Okay.

624
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,270
- There you go.
- Take your time.

625
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,040
Move!

626
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,700
- What...
- Gosh.

627
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,870
(They lose yet another point.)

628
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,780
(They lose another point
thanks to their crazy teamwork.)

629
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,310
Seok Jin, move out of the way!

630
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,310
(Team Jae Seok 4 : Team Jong Kook 1)

631
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,020
I'm terribly sorry.

632
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,750
- However...
- Seok Jin.

633
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,390
- Why were you like this earlier?
- Seok Jin!

634
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,720
- I...
- This is hilarious.

635
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,890
I'm sorry,

636
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,960
but you're playing dirty
by sending the ball my way.

637
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,130
You can't play fair.

638
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,830
- Don't play fair?
- We can't play fair?

639
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,060
- We can't play fair?
- Play fair.

640
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,370
Over here. Stand where you were.

641
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,870
- Seok Jin, move back a bit more.
- Okay.

642
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,870
- Got it.
- More.

643
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,240
Get to the far back.

644
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,670
(Jong Kook wouldn't mind
putting him in the lake.)

645
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,640
All we have to do is stay calm.

646
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,710
Slow and steady.

647
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,910
Seok Jin, where will you stand?

648
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,240
- He'll join us soon.
- What?

649
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,210
- Send it over.
- Seok Jin's back there.

650
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,550
(Aiming for Seok Sam)

651
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,250
- Okay, will you take it?
- Yes. My ball.

652
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,250
Good. Seok Jin, get back in.

653
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,650
Okay, get back in.

654
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,260
- Send it over.
- Sure thing.

655
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,090
- There we go.
- We've got this.

656
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,530
- You send it over.
- Got it.

657
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,790
- There we go.
- We've got this.

658
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,600
(They happen to aim for the corner.)

659
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,530
- Take your time.
- Nice.

660
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,900
- This is great.
- Take it slow.

661
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,270
- Higher.
- Okay.

662
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,600
- It wasn't sent over.
- Once more.

663
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,100
(The ball bounced off the net,
but they kicked it over!)

664
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,940
- Okay!
- Here we go.

665
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,140
Okay. Take your time.
We have a lot of it.

666
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,170
- Good.
- Once more!

667
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,510
(The ball bounced off the net!)

668
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,780
Kick it again!

669
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,140
- Do it.
- Move!

670
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,950
(They lose 5 points in a row.)

671
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,650
(Team Jae Seok 5 : Team Jong Kook 1)

672
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,250
You could've just told her to move.

673
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,190
(Team Jong Kook is losing 5 to 1
in a race to score 7 points.)

674
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:54,260
(Team Jae Seok only needs
2 more points to win.)

675
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,530
We scored.

676
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,890
There's nothing we need to do.

677
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,960
- Seok Jin does it for us.
- They're digging their own graves.

678
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,870
We can't lose.
No way we'll lose to them.

679
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,870
You know that.

680
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,030
We can't lose.

681
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,270
It doesn't make sense
for us to lose.

682
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,740
Let's score some points first.

683
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,510
- Let's do that.
- We'll take this seriously now.

684
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,640
- Okay. We're doing great.
- We can win.

685
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,010
- Ye Eun, over there.
- Good job, Ye Eun.

686
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,010
- Ye Eun.
- You're amazing at this.

687
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,050
Well done.

688
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,180
- I just stayed still.
- That's nonsensical.

689
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,180
(They praised Ye Eun
for staying still.)

690
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,550
- Let's do this! Speak nicely!
- Okay.

691
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,890
- Let's speak nicely!
- Speak nicely.

692
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,060
- Let's speak nicely.
- Forget about the past.

693
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,420
- Will you serve?
- No.

694
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,030
- Let me.
- Yes, you're better at it.

695
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,260
He can't do it.

696
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,460
What was that?

697
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Out!

698
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,500
What was that?

699
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,230
- Out!
- Out!

700
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,240
He can't kick. Let's try again.

701
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,340
- Try again.
- Try again.

702
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,900
- He's angry, is all.
- Let's start over.

703
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,940
- What's wrong with you?
- He's angry.

704
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,040
- Let me off this time.
- Apologize.

705
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,340
- Apologize.
- I apologize.

706
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,340
- Apologize.
- What's wrong with you?

707
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,340
- Say you're sorry.
- Officially.

708
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,450
Apologize properly.

709
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,280
- I apologize sincerely.
- Seok Jin's angry.

710
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,620
- I...
- Do the Oswa Dance.

711
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,280
(Immediate play)

712
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,820
(Oswa sorry in Yangpyeong.)

713
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,160
I apologize Oswa. I'm sorry Oswa.

714
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,660
(They're satisfied
with the new lyrics.)

715
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,160
- I'm sorry Oswa.
- Okay.

716
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
- Okay.
- That will do.

717
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,830
- I apologize.
- Apology accepted.

718
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,930
Try to play more seriously.

719
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,030
The Double Denim guy is funny.

720
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,900
(Team Jae Seok 5 : Team Jong Kook 1)

721
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,540
- Isn't Ye Eun playing?
- Ye Eun...

722
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,510
- I am playing.
- Just serve.

723
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,640
- It's fine. Play.
- Sent it over.

724
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,040
- There.
- Okay.

725
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,450
- Two, three.
- Get over here!

726
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,680
They're passing it among themselves.

727
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,380
- They're passing it...
- Move!

728
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,750
Move!

729
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,020
(Trusted Ssaebssaeb self-destructs.)

730
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,790
- Hey!
- I'm sorry, Se Chan.

731
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,190
- Se Chan.
- What was that?

732
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,430
Hey, just...

733
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,130
(Team Jae Seok
is 1 point away from victory.)

734
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,070
- Why did you keep passing?
- Yes.

735
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,440
Let's speak nicely. Forget the past!

736
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,940
- Forget the past.
- It's mine.

737
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,940
(Haha's high serve)

738
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,810
- It's yours. Se Chan, it's you.
- Headbutt it.

739
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,140
- That's it.
- What a sweet move.

740
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,610
- Nice. Will you keep it up?
- They're passing the ball again.

741
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,610
(Ssaebssaeb sent it over.)

742
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,910
They're passing the ball again.

743
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,010
- That's it.
- Ye Eun.

744
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,550
- Okay!
- Once more.

745
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,180
(Team Jae Seok
failed again after a while!)

746
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,790
- Ye Eun.
- Once more.

747
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,350
(Her upper and lower halves
aren't in sync.)

748
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,620
- Okay.
- It's okay.

749
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,090
(She lost them a point
with a strange pose.)

750
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,230
- What a shame.
- We should've helped.

751
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,730
- We scored!
- Speak nicely.

752
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,030
- Speak nicely.
- Speak nicely.

753
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,170
Nice words, nice expressions.

754
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,400
- Let's play.
- Be nice.

755
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,140
- Speak nicely.
- Stand to the side.

756
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,700
Stand here for the serve.

757
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,410
- Stay there.
- Okay?

758
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,070
(It's the isolation technique
they used on So Min.)

759
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,280
- Join in after the serve.
- Okay.

760
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,510
Let's receive it first.

761
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,510
(Ye Eun turned into a cicada.)

762
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,510
Stay hiding, Ye Eun.

763
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,520
Let's do this.

764
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,550
- Let's play.
- We can do this.

765
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,090
We can start fighting back.

766
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,050
- Let's end this.
- Aim for Daniel.

767
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,020
- Daniel's clumsy.
- Kick it once more.

768
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,520
- You take over.
- Okay.

769
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,160
- Okay.
- That's it. Go.

770
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,460
- Give it a go, Seok Jin.
- Okay!

771
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,030
- There you go.
- Okay. Should I kick it?

772
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,630
- I'll kick the ball!
- Okay. Well done.

773
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,130
(Seok Sam's spike
reaches the back of the court.)

774
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,670
- That was great!
- A spike.

775
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,140
- Well done.
- Okay.

776
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,840
- I'll kick the ball!
- Okay. Well done.

777
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,070
- That was great!
- Take your time.

778
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,040
- Take your time.
- Yes!

779
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,010
- Okay!
- Take your time.

780
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,750
(It's hard to believe
where the ball goes.)

781
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,050
- You're not kicking a jegi.
- Sorry.

782
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,080
Come on, Daniel!

783
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,890
- He...
- Nice!

784
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,150
- Okay!
- Well done.

785
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,360
- Speak nicely.
- Great!

786
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,360
Speak nicely.

787
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,990
Speak nicely.

788
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,360
Let's speak nicely. Smile.

789
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,360
- Forget about the mistakes.
- Say nice words.

790
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,160
- I'm serious now.
- Okay.

791
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,200
- Come on.
- Let's play.

792
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,770
- We're doing well.
- A bit more.

793
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,240
Me...

794
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,170
- He can't make it.
- Hey!

795
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,810
- What did you do?
- Come on.

796
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,240
(He kicked the ball facing forward,)

797
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,640
(but it went backward!)

798
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,050
(Daniel lost them a point
with an amazing technique.)

799
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,050
(Team Jae Seok 6 : Team Jong Kook 4)

800
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,410
Let's just get it over the net.

801
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,250
- Okay!
- We won.

802
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,350
- Nice words.
- Nice words.

803
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,450
- This is right.
- This is it.

804
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,550
- This is right.
- It's getting worse.

805
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,090
Let's speak nice words too.

806
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,620
- We aren't far apart now.
- Let's do this.

807
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,790
Their serves are hard to handle.

808
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,790
We need to wake up.

809
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,460
We really need to this time.

810
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,600
- Okay!
- Let me.

811
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,730
- You receive it.
- Wait! Time out!

812
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,030
When they serve, you stand here too.

813
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,870
- Stick together.
- Stand here and chat.

814
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,000
- Hold hands and chat, okay?
- Okay.

815
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,870
- Stand there together.
- Seriously.

816
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,610
- Let's win.
- Keep still.

817
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,940
Let's keep things tight.

818
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,180
- We're there. Let's catch up.
- This is right.

819
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,250
Okay, this is good.

820
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,650
He's trying to hit us.

821
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,980
- Okay, nice.
- Well done.

822
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,990
- Careful.
- Get it back over.

823
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,150
- Watch out.
- Watch out.

824
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,450
- It's me!
- It's you.

825
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,060
- That's it.
- That's it.

826
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,920
(They stop joking about
and get serious.)

827
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,260
- It's Jong Kook.
- Let's go.

828
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,530
- It's Jae Seok!
- What now?

829
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,530
Send it over. That's it.

830
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,060
(A long kick over the net...)

831
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,400
(sails straight toward Daniel.)

832
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,000
- Take your time.
- Ye Eun.

833
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,600
- No, it's not that.
- It's Ye Eun.

834
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,240
- Ye Eun. Kick it.
- Okay!

835
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,600
(The cicadas lost another point.)

836
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,170
- She really can't...
- My gosh.

837
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,240
Daniel's physically inept too.

838
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,280
I'm sorry.

839
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,340
(They reduced the difference
down to 1 point.)

840
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,450
Hey. We're two points away.

841
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,520
Stick close to the net! Both of you!

842
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,180
Get over there now.

843
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,090
(Se Chan serves.)

844
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,990
Okay. It's a hard one.

845
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,160
- Send it back over.
- Ji Ye Eun!

846
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,160
(Jae Seok covers!)

847
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,460
(He sent it back over?)

848
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,030
- Send it back over.
- Ji Ye Eun!

849
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,970
- Ji Ye Eun!
- Yes! Great!

850
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:02,970
(It's out.)

851
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,000
- My gosh.
- Great!

852
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
(Team Jae Seok 6 : Team Jong Kook 6)

853
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,140
- Nice.
- We didn't have the angle.

854
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,440
We need it to reach me in the back.

855
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Yes.

856
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,010
- Okay.
- The last point.

857
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,410
- Match point.
- Speak nicely!

858
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,540
- Okay?
- Speak nicely.

859
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,050
- Speak nicely.
- Okay.

860
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,510
- Match point.
- It's looking good.

861
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,650
- Let's be nice.
- Stick close to the net, Niel.

862
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,050
- Let's get through this.
- Okay.

863
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,350
- Let's get through this.
- We can do this.

864
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,020
He's about to serve!

865
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,160
Oh, right.

866
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,920
The serve...

867
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,990
(The isolated players are ready.)

868
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,560
(Se Chan's serve
is the last in the game.)

869
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,730
- Okay.
- Good.

870
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,300
- Okay.
- Good.

871
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,630
- Good.
- Ye Eun, your head!

872
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,900
(Jae Seok covers the ball
that heads to Ye Eun.)

873
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,040
- Ji Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun, your head!

874
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,540
- Okay.
- Gosh.

875
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,270
(Jae Seok gets the ball in the air.)

876
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,610
- Okay.
- Haha!

877
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,880
(Haha's inside kick...)

878
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,280
(doesn't clear the net!)

879
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:51,080
(The ball sails between
the two giants.)

880
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,520
(One more loss,
and they lose the game.)

881
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,720
- Ye Eun!
- Hey!

882
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,920
(What was that?)

883
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,520
Ye Eun!

884
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
Hey!

885
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,890
(The last lost point)

886
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:01,890
Ye Eun!

887
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
(Her hand misses.)

888
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,260
(His foot misses.)

889
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,900
(The useless cicada couple
created a grand finale.)

890
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,500
(Team Jae Seok 6 : Team Jong Kook 7)

891
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,940
How did this happen?

892
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,800
- It's over!
- Okay. We won.

893
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,170
- We won.
- Nice words!

894
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,140
- Nice words.
- Speak nicely!

895
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,940
It was hard to lose.

896
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,440
- We couldn't lose.
- It's impossible.

897
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,150
- That's nonsense.
- We couldn't lose.

898
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,550
Actually...

899
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,050
It's just too hard.

900
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,850
- That was fun.
- The results are in.

901
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,290
- This team won.
- Okay!

902
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,160
You will get a prize.

903
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,590
A prize!

904
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,760
- My gosh.
- We ate all we wanted.

905
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,260
- It was great.
- Yes.

906
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,630
- The penalty for you four...
- Yes.

907
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,830
is to pick...

908
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,600
lots of strawberries at a farm...

909
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,900
- before going home.
- That's so nice!

910
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,770
- That must be nice!
- That's so nice!

911
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,810
- We must pick strawberries.
- I'm jealous.

912
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,810
Look at his face.

913
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,240
Ye Eun, you've been penalized
for weeks in a row.

914
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,340
Let's go.

915
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,380
Jae Seok,
is this a vinyl greenhouse?

916
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,910
- Yes, it's a vinyl greenhouse.
- Hey.

917
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,020
- It smells great in here.
- It smells of strawberries.

918
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,250
It smells amazing.

919
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,150
- It smells great.
- So great.

920
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,190
Strawberries are actually shiny.

921
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,360
I like this. It's more like a prize
than a penalty.

922
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,730
No, it's a penalty.

923
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,160
(He's firm.)

924
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,930
- Ye Eun. Get a grip.
- What?

925
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,300
I'm very alert and fine right now.

926
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,140
- You're burned out.
- You're burned out.

927
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,970
I'm burned out?
I was never burned out.

928
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,540
- That day in the bus...
- What do you mean?

929
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,710
Didn't you say you drank often
because you were burned out?

930
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,750
That was not Ji Ye Eun.

931
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,550
That wasn't Ji Ye Eun?

932
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,350
That's even weirder.

933
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,820
(Miss Burnout gets tormented
for making one comment.)

934
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,350
That wasn't Ji Ye Eun.

935
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,160
Ta-da. I'm done!

936
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,560
- Haha, you can go home.
- Aren't these pretty?

937
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
I think I'm done.
(Jae Seok's box is full too.)

938
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,400
- I think my box is well filled.
- Okay.

939
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,330
- Come here. That's nice.
- Here.

940
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,430
(Everyone is done but Ye Eun.)

941
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,140
- I'm done too.
- Are you? What...

942
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,940
Why are the stems so long?

943
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,670
- She wants to grow them.
- I see.

944
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,140
Ye Eun.

945
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,610
You're a strawberry murderer.

946
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,880
You evil strawberry murderer!

947
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,050
- You should buy these.
- Okay, I will.

948
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,520
We can keep these? For real?

949
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,620
Na Eun loves strawberries.

950
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,660
(One week later,
in an empty lot near Sangam-dong)

951
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,430
(A white vehicle is parked.)

952
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,360
(Ye Eun appears on her own?)

953
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

954
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,130
(The reason Ddochi is here alone
with a car.)

955
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,240
(She sat behind
the driving wheel for once.)

956
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,010
It won't go right now, will it?

957
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,610
Because the gear is in P.

958
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,010
(The gear is in P for parking.)

959
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,740
- I'm a novice.
- Right.

960
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,080
(It looked like
they would get going.)

961
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,180
I can't drive if there's a car.

962
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,550
(The novice driver
failed to leave the parking lot.)

963
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:48,290
Today, our aim
is to turn a serious novice...

964
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,790
into a driving expert.

965
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,500
The Decision to Drive Project...

966
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,230
- is our title.
- That's great.

967
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:59,140
You pre-selected three instructors.

968
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,340
- Yes.
- Who are they?

969
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,940
First, there's Jae Seok.

970
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,210
Perhaps surprisingly,
I chose Jong Kook.

971
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,340
And then Daniel.
They are the three I chose.

972
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,510
In a short while, you'll get...

973
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,610
driving lessons
from those instructors.

974
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,550
You must drive
to complete the missions...

975
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,950
and reach the finish line
without any mishaps.

976
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,720
We'll put a sign on the back
that says you're a novice driver.

977
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,630
- I need one.
- Write "serious" three times...

978
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,160
so at the end of each period,

979
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,700
- you can cross one out.
- "Serious..."

980
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,070
So it should say
"serious, serious, serious noob."

981
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,100
(She can cross out
one "serious" at a time.)

982
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,100
"Serious..."

983
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,770
(Giggling)

984
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,540
"Serious, serious, serious."

985
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,070
"Serious, serious, serious."

986
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,510
I can put them up here.

987
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,910
So that everyone can see
"serious, serious, serious."

988
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,620
It's done.
"Serious, serious, serious."

989
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,050
If you're ready,

990
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:54,090
- let's meet the first instructor.
- Okay.

991
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,630
Can the first instructor come in?

992
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,260
Instructor.

993
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,900
Hello.

994
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,730
- I heard you asked for me.
- Yes, Instructor.

995
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,200
- Yes.
- Instructor Yu.

996
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,470
(Instructor Yu Jae Seok,
34 years experience,)

997
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,070
(Running Man's main driver)

998
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:14,640
(For 16 years since the beginning
of Running Man,)

999
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,480
(the veteran driver Instructor Yu
has guaranteed their safe travel.)

1000
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,750
(Will he be able to pass on
his skills to Ye Eun?)

1001
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,920
- I heard you asked for me.
- Yes, Instructor.

1002
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,320
- Yes.
- Instructor Yu.

1003
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,390
(Polite)

1004
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,360
- When did you get your license?
- About four years ago?

1005
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,730
- Four years ago?
- Yes.

1006
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,730
- Do you have your license here?
- I do.

1007
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,030
Let me see it.

1008
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,140
Before the driving lessons,
I must check your license.

1009
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,770
I must check your license.

1010
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,470
(Awkward laughter)

1011
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,540
Hang on.

1012
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,140
But I have to check it.

1013
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,840
I mean... Ye Eun.

1014
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,310
I have to check it.

1015
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,950
So, you can hide
your personal information. Hang on.

1016
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,650
No.

1017
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,290
Who...

1018
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,160
It's me!

1019
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
- Who is this?
- It's me.

1020
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,760
That looks like a doll.

1021
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,530
- This much is...
- You barely have a nose.

1022
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,530
Back when I was young
and liked using lip tints...

1023
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,730
It was when I liked using lip tints.

1024
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,440
(Ddochi from back in the day
looked like she ate a mouse.)

1025
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,040
This is...

1026
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,840
If you get fake driver's licenses
and stuff...

1027
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,680
- It's me.
- You'll have to go to jail.

1028
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,880
It is me.

1029
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,110
- Yes, it is.
- It is.

1030
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,410
Yes, I understand.

1031
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,180
So, I've checked that you have
a driver's license.

1032
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,350
So, anyway,
should we start driving now?

1033
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,190
Yes, Jae Seok. You are...

1034
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,090
- the first driving instructor.
- Yes.

1035
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:38,590
You can teach her the basics
of driving and driving on course.

1036
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,230
- So, here.
- Oh, okay.

1037
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,600
- Instructor.
- Yes.

1038
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,930
I have experience.

1039
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,130
Really?

1040
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,140
- You can get in.
- All right. Get in the car.

1041
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,500
I'm nervous.

1042
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,910
How do I go out of here?

1043
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,010
Gosh, I'm nervous.

1044
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,910
Hang on. First of all, this road...

1045
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,710
Can you go in there?

1046
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,880
Where?

1047
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,020
- Where?
- Right in front...

1048
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,850
No, get out. I'll drive until there.

1049
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,890
From what I can see,

1050
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,390
you might drive into a post
while going from here to there, so...

1051
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,730
(She gets ousted from her seat
as soon as she got in the car.)

1052
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,460
- All right. Watch carefully.
- Okay.

1053
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,530
You can adjust the driver's seat...

1054
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,330
- to your own needs later.
- Yes.

1055
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,630
Do you know how to check...

1056
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,400
- the rearview and side mirrors?
- Yes, I do.

1057
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,910
And what's the first thing
you need to do before driving?

1058
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,770
- Fastening your seatbelt.
- Yes, buckle up.

1059
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,940
If you don't do that,
you get disqualified.

1060
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,310
You always push down on the brake
with your right foot.

1061
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,680
Always push down on it.

1062
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,410
- Which gear do you put it in?
- In D.

1063
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,520
- Yes, put it in drive.
- Drive.

1064
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,950
Then, move slowly
as you look where to go.

1065
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,650
- Push down and let go of the brake.
- Push down...

1066
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,090
- and let go.
- Don't get too flustered.

1067
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,730
- Then, do I...
- If you push down...

1068
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,390
on the accelerator here too much,
the car will jerk forward.

1069
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,100
- So, don't push on the accelerator?
- Right, you have to be careful.

1070
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,000
Leave your left foot alone.
With your right foot,

1071
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,240
you control the accelerator
and brake as you go.

1072
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,740
I've done the work up to here.

1073
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,910
- This is an S-course now.
- Oh, I can do this.

1074
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,910
- You did it for the driving test?
- Yes, of course.

1075
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,010
What do you have to do to drive
within the line?

1076
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,810
You have to be very careful.

1077
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,810
- If you don't go out far enough,
- Yes?

1078
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,420
- you'll basically be ruined.
- Ruined.

1079
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,150
- Okay? All right.
- Okay, yes.

1080
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,520
I'm nervous.

1081
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,820
(Student Ji gets
into the driver's seat.)

1082
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,830
(Things to check before driving)

1083
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:16,990
There we go.

1084
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,330
(Fasten your seatbelt.)

1085
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,700
Seatbelt.

1086
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,800
- Okay, buckle up.
- I did.

1087
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,730
Foot on the brake.

1088
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,740
- I pushed down on the brake...
- Not yet. I haven't gotten in yet.

1089
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,040
- Ye Eun, I haven't gotten in yet.
- Right.

1090
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,310
- I haven't gotten in yet.
- Okay.

1091
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,940
When people are getting in the car,
always check if they're all in.

1092
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,180
- Check if the door is closed first.
- Yes, I must check.

1093
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,480
- Right. Okay, never.
- You'll get in trouble if you rush.

1094
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,380
- Have you adjusted the seat?
- Oh, right.

1095
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,290
Adjust the driver's seat.

1096
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,220
- Yes, adjust it to fit you.
- Okay.

1097
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,120
I think this is good.

1098
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,960
- Adjust all the settings to you.
- Yes.

1099
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,060
Check if you can see the side mirror
and everything well.

1100
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,330
- Yes.
- I think I can see it.

1101
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,400
- The side and rearview mirrors.
- Oh, right.

1102
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,800
- Can you see them well?
- I can.

1103
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:58,430
- You must check those beforehand.
- Oh, okay.

1104
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,400
- Don't get flustered. All right.
- Don't get flustered.

1105
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,800
Let's go.

1106
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,370
- Here I go.
- Yes, slowly.

1107
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,570
Yes, of course.

1108
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,080
(She puts the gear into D.)

1109
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,240
Slowly.

1110
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,550
Just a bit.

1111
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,810
(She finally sets off
on the S-course.)

1112
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,880
- Slightly.
- All right.

1113
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,420
- Don't step on the line.
- I think I'm doing okay.

1114
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,390
- Not getting flustered is...
- Don't get...

1115
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,360
- Don't get flustered.
- Don't get flustered?

1116
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,960
Why did you suddenly slam
on the brake?

1117
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,430
- Did you get flustered?
- Don't get flustered. No, never.

1118
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,390
- That's the most important thing.
- Calmly.

1119
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,460
Yes.

1120
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,830
Calmly.

1121
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,600
(She sets off again.)

1122
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,700
All right.

1123
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,340
- Ye Eun.
- Yes?

1124
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,870
Can't you see the rear tires
stepping on the lines?

1125
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,140
(Stepping all over them)

1126
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,240
- This is quite narrow.
- Even if that's the case...

1127
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,080
Jae Seok, it's quite narrow here.

1128
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,780
- Oh, what's wrong? Calmly.
- Okay, Ye Eun.

1129
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,520
You should think about...

1130
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,220
- following the lines in general.
- Yes, that's true.

1131
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,890
Just go slowly for now.

1132
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,220
- Nice. I got it.
- Actually,

1133
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,520
- I usually give lots of praise.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

1134
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,230
But there's nothing to praise
right now.

1135
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,690
- Got it? Okay.
- Yes.

1136
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,160
- Oh, nice.
- All right.

1137
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,230
Looking to the left
is important, but...

1138
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,200
- The front wheels.
- Yes, the front wheels.

1139
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,070
Make sure the front wheel goes out
far enough...

1140
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,770
so that the rear wheels
don't go over the lines.

1141
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,870
Because you only checked the left
and tried not to step on the line,

1142
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,910
- the rear wheels went over them.
- That's right.

1143
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,180
- Do you get what I mean?
- Yes.

1144
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:18,280
- Go back to the start once more.
- Okay, I'll go back to the start.

1145
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,850
(They go back to the start
of the course after a quick taste.)

1146
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,390
- Oh, I got it. Turn it around.
- Yes.

1147
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,250
Try going back
to the original spot...

1148
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,790
- where we started. So...
- I can't go back there.

1149
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,830
- Go back to the start.
- I can't do that.

1150
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,290
- Hey, where are you going now?
- Oh, wait.

1151
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,130
Hey, where are you going right now?

1152
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,830
- I'm going here now.
- Where do you think you're going?

1153
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,630
- I'm taking a look around.
- What? Where...

1154
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,000
Take the car back to that spot.

1155
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,200
- I'm getting used to it.
- Okay?

1156
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,640
Instructor, I'm going around...

1157
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,910
- to get the hang of things.
- Let's go. Okay, good.

1158
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,110
- Let's do that, then.
- I think the vibe is important now.

1159
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,980
This should be good enough.

1160
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,750
Then, now...

1161
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,820
Where did you put the car back?
You should be over there.

1162
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,590
- Oh, yes.
- Why is the car facing that way?

1163
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,650
(The front of the car is pointing
in the opposite direction.)

1164
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,790
- Is it here?
- All right.

1165
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,020
To get back to the original spot...
Look here.

1166
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,930
- Go to the left.
- Yes.

1167
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,460
- Then, you back up to turn the car.
- Turn it.

1168
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,030
- Ye Eun, do you get it?
- Oh, yes.

1169
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,630
Where am I? Right.

1170
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,630
What do you mean, "Where am I?"

1171
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,800
Turn. Why aren't you turning?

1172
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,840
- All right.
- Turn.

1173
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,840
- Turn.
- When you turn,

1174
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,870
you might run into this part here,

1175
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,840
- so be careful. Yes, watch out.
- Careful.

1176
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,940
- I might run into it. Careful.
- Yes, watch out.

1177
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,250
That's it. Good.

1178
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,210
- Stop. All right. Nice.
- Stop.

1179
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,520
- Slowly. Oh, smooth.
- Okay, stop.

1180
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,180
- Smarts. Smooth.
- Smooth.

1181
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,550
Not "Smarts." Smooth.

1182
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,460
I think I have the right vibe.

1183
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,960
- What?
- I have the right vibe.

1184
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,090
So, the handle is turned
to that side a lot,

1185
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,130
- It's this way now, right?
- That's it. The opposite way.

1186
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,230
Turn it all the way? All the way.

1187
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,300
- Backing up. Careful.
- Yes, careful.

1188
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,600
Careful.

1189
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,640
- Careful.
- Yes, be careful.

1190
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,900
Why isn't it moving?

1191
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,310
- Why isn't it moving?
- Push on the accelerator.

1192
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,240
(When you teach her one thing,
she only learns that one thing.)

1193
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,540
- All right, slowly. There you go.
- Slowly.

1194
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,610
- Good. Yes.
- Slowly. Okay.

1195
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,450
The positive thing is that
you know the basics quite a bit.

1196
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,050
- Oh, that's right. Really.
- Yes.

1197
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,550
- Watch out for the gate.
- Watch out.

1198
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,160
- There's a puppy.
- Good.

1199
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,130
Don't talk about useless stuff
like that. All right.

1200
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,190
Ye Eun, don't talk about
useless stuff like that.

1201
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,100
- There's a puppy behind me.
- Right now, the puppy...

1202
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,230
(Done babying her)

1203
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,970
The puppy is... You know?

1204
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,700
No matter where it goes,
you should just care about this car.

1205
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,040
- The puppy is... Okay.
- Got it.

1206
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,740
- Okay?
- Okay. That's right.

1207
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,910
- Got it?
- Yes.

1208
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,510
- You're back in the original spot.
- I am. I did it.

1209
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,110
- Then, step on the brake.
- Step on it.

1210
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,810
- Turn the handle.
- Turn the handle.

1211
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,350
- And put it in D.
- Again, slowly. To D...

1212
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,280
Shift the gear to D. Okay.

1213
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,620
Okay, to D.

1214
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,880
- I'll go now.
- Okay.

1215
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,420
All right. Good. That's it.

1216
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,990
Hey! Watch out.

1217
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,220
That's it. Hey! Watch out.

1218
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,060
- You have to be careful.
- Okay.

1219
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,890
You're stepping all over the lines.

1220
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,060
- Watch out. You can't rush.
- Okay.

1221
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,300
- I have a short temper.
- Even now,

1222
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,570
- you stepped on the accelerator...
- The accelerator?

1223
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,870
- too quickly.
- Oh, okay.

1224
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,600
I nearly threw a punch just now.

1225
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,000
(I nearly threw a punch just now.)

1226
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,140
I couldn't help it.
It was just a reflex.

1227
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,240
- You know?
- Oh, yes.

1228
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,270
- Yes.
- Oh, yes.

1229
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,740
And what's important
from here on out?

1230
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,240
- Look. Stop.
- Stop.

1231
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,410
- Stop.
- Put the gear in P.

1232
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,610
Go outside and take a look.

1233
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,190
(Noticing)

1234
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,250
Look at how you ended up.

1235
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,160
Ye Eun.

1236
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,990
(Ddochi's car is
walking a tightrope.)

1237
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,930
- You're right.
- If you were on the road now,

1238
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,330
- you would be over the midline.
- Right.

1239
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,800
If you were in a parking lot
at the supermarket,

1240
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,030
this would all be destroyed.

1241
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,100
- You would've heard a crunch!
- Right.

1242
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,840
You'd have to get a new wheel.
It'd cost you over 1,000 dollars.

1243
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,510
Then, your insurance would go up
so much.

1244
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,370
(His realistic advice gets her
back to her senses.)

1245
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,640
- Consider yourself the car. Ye Eun.
- Okay.

1246
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,880
- Look here.
- Okay.

1247
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,480
- We're the car.
- Yes.

1248
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,650
All right, Ye Eun.

1249
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,020
- You should've gone like this.
- Like this.

1250
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,320
- I should've gone like this.
- You should've gone like this.

1251
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,590
Yes, you're right.

1252
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:45,250
All right, like this.
You must turn wide like this...

1253
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,190
so that your wheels don't touch
on the left side.

1254
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,490
- You're right.
- All right.

1255
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,390
- Hang on. Ye Eun.
- Yes?

1256
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,200
- Let me show you once. How to...
- Yes, show me.

1257
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,500
Then, I think I'll get it.

1258
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,500
(Instructor Yu's S-course
demonstration)

1259
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,830
So, this...

1260
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,470
(Instructor Yu's
S-course demonstration)

1261
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,510
- I'll show you how to do this.
- Okay.

1262
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,210
- So, here... Okay.
- Yes?

1263
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,480
Go far out enough.

1264
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,610
- I thought I might run into that.
- Like this.

1265
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,150
- Then, you don't touch.
- Oh, my.

1266
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,750
- I thought I might run into that.
- Like this.

1267
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,320
- Like this. Then, you don't touch.
- Oh, my.

1268
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,650
- Oh, you're right.
- You don't touch the line this way.

1269
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,490
- You get what I mean, right?
- Yes.

1270
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,050
You don't touch the line
if you go far out enough.

1271
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,620
I thought it might touch.

1272
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,690
It doesn't.

1273
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,930
You're such a good driver.

1274
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,160
(Impressed)

1275
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,700
You're such a skilled driver.

1276
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,500
All right. Look here.

1277
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,740
(Her trust in the instructor goes up
after his demonstration.)

1278
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,010
- This is actually kind of hard,
- Yes.

1279
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,610
but if you don't want to
step on the inside here,

1280
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,540
- Yes.
- you have to go far enough out.

1281
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,810
- Go far enough out?
- Yes, like this.

1282
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:48,050
(Go as close to the outer line
as possible.)

1283
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,190
- Watch, okay?
- Okay.

1284
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,720
You need to go far enough out
so that you don't touch the inside.

1285
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,520
- I didn't touch the line, right?
- No, you didn't.

1286
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,260
- I didn't touch it. Like this.
- You didn't.

1287
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,560
Go far enough out...

1288
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,400
and turn so that you don't
touch the line. Like this.

1289
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,630
(He turns wide and drives perfectly
until the very last corner.)

1290
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,000
Applause!

1291
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,800
(Applauding)

1292
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,540
- Ye Eun, let's try this again.
- Okay.

1293
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,270
- This time, Ye Eun...
- Yes?

1294
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,910
This time around,

1295
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,540
- boxes were placed.
- Sure.

1296
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,380
- Keep that in mind as you drive.
- Got it.

1297
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,150
- Could I manage this?
- Sure.

1298
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,050
Boxes may have been placed,
but everything else is the same.

1299
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,350
- It's the same?
- Nothing has changed.

1300
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,520
- Right.
- You need to get used to this.

1301
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,560
- Sure.
- Let's go!

1302
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,860
Let's go.

1303
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,430
Here I go.

1304
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,490
Sure.

1305
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,730
Calm down, Ye Eun.

1306
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,360
- Calm down.
- Stay steady.

1307
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,600
(Entering the first corner)

1308
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,970
- Think before you drive forward.
- Think.

1309
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,840
- That's it.
- Keep thinking.

1310
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,500
- You bumped into one.
- Slowly... Did I?

1311
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,880
(It grazed the rear wheel.)

1312
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,110
You ruined the rear fender.

1313
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,580
- Did I bump into it?
- Yes.

1314
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,450
(Entering the second corner)

1315
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:56,390
Look to the left
and make a wide turn.

1316
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,220
- A wide turn.
- Make a wide turn.

1317
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,290
(She only needs
to make a wide turn.)

1318
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,160
Make a wide turn to keep
the rear wheels from hitting things.

1319
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,690
There you go. That's it.

1320
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,300
Turn the wheel
and then turn it the other way.

1321
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,200
- That's it.
- A wide turn.

1322
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,670
Looking good.

1323
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,130
- Nice.
- Nicely done.

1324
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,640
(She turned the corner
without any mishaps!)

1325
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,570
- I did a good job.
- Nice.

1326
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,110
(What happened...)

1327
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,380
(after she turned the corner
with such confidence?)

1328
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,110
Wait, that was too wide.

1329
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,380
There you go ruining the car.

1330
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,880
That was too wide.

1331
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,480
(Running over the traffic cone)

1332
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,390
- There you go ruining the car.
- My gosh.

1333
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,090
- Return.
- Here's the situation you're in.

1334
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,820
You just mangled
your bumper and everything.

1335
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,960
I'm sorry.

1336
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,830
The damages...

1337
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,400
Wouldn't it be 1,000 dollars?

1338
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,700
- It'll cost way more.
- Really?

1339
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,300
You'll need a new bumper.

1340
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,400
- A new bumper.
- Right.

1341
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,440
You need to be most careful...

1342
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,040
- when confidence kicks in.
- You're right about that.

1343
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,010
- That's most dangerous.
- Yes, at that moment.

1344
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,640
- Again.
- Do I go again?

1345
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,010
Again.

1346
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,040
(Going back in reverse again)

1347
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,650
- My class ends at 11 a.m.
- Right.

1348
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,810
- At 11 a.m...
- Your next instructor awaits you.

1349
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,680
- My 11 a.m. class?
- I'm a busy man.

1350
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,620
Here's what I think though.

1351
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,420
For someone without...

1352
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,960
- any driving experience,
- Yes?

1353
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,720
- Really?
- you're not doing too badly.

1354
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,990
- Calm down and retry.
- Get the car...

1355
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:12,130
- into the same position as before.
- Like this.

1356
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,300
(The serious, serious, serious noob
is doing better than expected.)

1357
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,030
Make a wide turn.

1358
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,830
It's all right. Make a wide turn.

1359
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,600
- Make a wider turn.
- A wide turn.

1360
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,340
- A wider turn.
- Yes, make a wider turn.

1361
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,540
- I can go wider.
- You can go up to about here.

1362
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,170
- This is the way.
- Exactly.

1363
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,140
- You didn't hit anything.
- You're right.

1364
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,880
- Make wider turns.
- Wider turns.

1365
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,880
Make wide turns like that one.

1366
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,910
- You're right.
- And now you're here.

1367
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:31,950
- Okay.
- I had to make a wider turn.

1368
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,220
- Go in a straight line.
- In a straight line.

1369
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,850
- Keep going and make a wide turn.
- Keep going.

1370
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:38,020
- Make a wide turn.
- That's it.

1371
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,920
(Extremely focused)

1372
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,320
That's how it should be.

1373
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,860
- You're right. Make a wide turn.
- Make a wide turn.

1374
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,260
- Make a wide turn to the right.
- Check the side-view mirror.

1375
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,030
- You can make a wider turn.
- Keep going.

1376
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,270
- Make a wider turn.
- Go!

1377
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,870
(She passed the second corner
and moved into the third.)

1378
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,940
- Make a wider turn.
- Wider.

1379
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,240
- Wider.
- Keep going?

1380
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,110
- As if you're about to touch it.
- Get closer.

1381
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,480
(She gets close but...)

1382
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,740
- You did hit it. Make a wide turn.
- I didn't.

1383
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,910
- Make a wide turn.
- I did great.

1384
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,150
- Make a wide turn.
- Make a wide turn.

1385
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,150
There's no need
to abruptly alter directions.

1386
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,520
- You're right.
- Make a wide turn.

1387
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,820
(Did she make it
without bumping into anything?)

1388
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,650
- Keep going.
- I did it.

1389
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,660
- Keep going.
- My gosh.

1390
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,960
- There you go.
- Yes!

1391
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,330
(Noob Ji cleared the S-course.)

1392
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:19,400
How was that?

1393
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,960
- Look.
- I'm great at this!

1394
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,070
- How was it?
- I loved it!

1395
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,100
You're my star instructor.

1396
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,270
Am I or am I not a star instructor?

1397
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:27,900
- You are a star instructor.
- Now align the car.

1398
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,670
- You spoke my language.
- I know.

1399
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,540
- I told you to make wide turns.
- Wide turns.

1400
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,610
- Back to starting position.
- Starting position.

1401
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,440
Try again
and drive through the course.

1402
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,110
Again.

1403
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,410
(She practices the S-course until
it becomes second nature to her.)

1404
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,550
Start at the entrance of the course.

1405
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,220
I've gotten the hang of it.

1406
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:45,250
- Next, you'll try parking the car.
- Sure.

1407
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,760
Parking can be a challenge,

1408
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,660
- and you won't get it overnight.
- I know.

1409
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,990
(Will Ddochi succeed in parking
with her newfound confidence?)

1410
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:51,060
I did it.

1411
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:52,960
Was it parked correctly?

1412
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,230
The front of the car...

1413
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,900
is in the lane where cars drive by.

1414
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:58,970
You'll crush your engine
at this rate.

1415
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:01,670
This will cost you
over 10,000 dollars to fix!

1416
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,840
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

1417
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:04,970
Sure.

1418
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,010
- Park the car again.
- Sure.

1419
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,510
There.

1420
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,350
- If you park the car like this,
- Yes?

1421
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,150
someone will post a photo of it
on social media.

1422
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,750
"Car parked by airhead driver."

1423
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,550
"What should I do about it?"

1424
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,490
If they find out it's you,

1425
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:20,120
we might not get to see you again.

1426
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,190
(Han Moon Chul may be summoned.)

1427
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,290
It's like I said.

1428
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:23,390
- Watch.
- Sure.

1429
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,960
- Drive past it.
- Right.

1430
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,930
- Give yourself enough room...
- Sure.

1431
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,770
- and check the space behind you.
- Give myself enough room.

1432
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,230
Move back and forth a few times...

1433
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,370
and reverse the car one last time
once everything's aligned.

1434
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,640
Again.

1435
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,270
- Align the car.
- Align the car.

1436
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,270
(The parking nightmare begins.)

1437
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,610
All right. Again.

1438
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,740
Align the steering wheel.

1439
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,280
- Slow and steady.
- Slowly.

1440
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,980
There you go. Good.

1441
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,720
I think I'm good.

1442
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,320
I think I'm good.

1443
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,690
- I think I'm good.
- That's at least how it should be.

1444
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,560
- Nice!
- Look at it.

1445
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,620
- This is it. I did it.
- What?

1446
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,330
- This is it.
- This is it.

1447
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,390
- That's how you park the car.
- I did a great job.

1448
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,200
- Ye Eun.
- Yes?

1449
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,130
I'm only your instructor until 11 a.m.,

1450
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,240
- so that's the end of my class.
- Thank you, Mr. Yu.

1451
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,070
She at least has the basics down.

1452
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,670
- Thank you.
- You may remove one "serious."

1453
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,580
(From Serious, serious, serious noob
to Serious, serious noob)

1454
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,450
(Serious, serious noob)

1455
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,620
Jong Kook will now take over.

1456
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,890
(2nd Period: On-road Driving Basics,
Instructor: Kim Jong Kook)

1457
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,760
All right.

1458
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,230
(The next instructor approaches
with anger in his steps.)

1459
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:31,630
Unbelievable.

1460
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,930
It's been a while
since I risked my life on TV.

1461
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,160
(Instructor Kook, The scolder,
Class one general license)

1462
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,330
(You keep pulling it forward.)

1463
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,330
(You brat!)

1464
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,970
(Trainer Kook teaches
by scolding rather than with love.)

1465
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:44,910
(She cried her eyes out during
their one-time training session.)

1466
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:48,810
(How will the driver's education go
with the scary Mr. Kook?)

1467
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,310
(She's been traumatized.)

1468
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:51,980
How can I put it?

1469
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,320
He's angry all the time.

1470
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,050
I can sense that.

1471
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,020
I can't have
an instructor who's angry.

1472
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,990
(She's already worried
about being scolded.)

1473
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,430
- Goodness. Hello.
- Unbelievable.

1474
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:06,700
It's been a while
since I risked my life on TV.

1475
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,170
I'm not that bad.

1476
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,170
My gosh.

1477
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,670
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

1478
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,240
- I taught her the basics.
- I see.

1479
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,640
- But since she's a novice driver,
- Right.

1480
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,340
tell her about things
she should keep in mind.

1481
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,310
Sure thing.
First, allow me to introduce myself.

1482
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,480
I believe I'm the only one...

1483
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,120
to have passed
the driving test in Korea...

1484
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:32,590
- Yes?
- and also in the US.

1485
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
- Unbelievable.
- I took two driving tests...

1486
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,430
in two separate countries.

1487
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,360
That includes the written exam.

1488
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,470
- Hold on.
- What is it?

1489
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,800
I don't see
why you had to mention...

1490
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,040
that you passed
a driving test abroad.

1491
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,600
Hear me out. That's how good I am.

1492
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,040
When I passed
the driving test in the US,

1493
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,740
a total of 15 people took the test.

1494
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,810
- Only two passed.
- It must not be easy.

1495
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,480
- I was one of the two.
- It must be challenging.

1496
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,250
(A pass rate of 13 percent)

1497
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,320
(He gains her trust
with his impressive credentials.)

1498
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,290
Passing a driving test in the US
is an incredible challenge.

1499
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,590
- Mister.
- Yes, mister?

1500
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,360
- I'm sorry to interrupt you,
- Yes?

1501
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:10,030
but why did you mention that
15 people took the test that day?

1502
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,000
- I'm just saying that I passed...
- Why?

1503
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,600
a challenging test.

1504
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,530
There's a reason
why I brought this cup of coffee.

1505
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:19,400
It's to check how the car rocks
when she steps on the brakes.

1506
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,900
That's what
this cup of coffee is for.

1507
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,440
Sounds good. I see
you're proud of your driving skills.

1508
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,340
- Then, Mr. Kim...
- Yes?

1509
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,840
- You'll head to the next course.
- Sure.

1510
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,410
- What's the next course?
- I'm sorry to ask,

1511
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:32,010
but can she drive out on the street?

1512
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,450
- I can't say that for sure.
- Mr. Yu.

1513
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,960
She knows how to turn
on the turn signals.

1514
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,290
- She knows that much.
- Does she?

1515
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:44,460
Just so you know,
Mr. Yu will be riding...

1516
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,860
- in the back seat with you.
- Why?

1517
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,760
- Go on. Okay.
- Wait!

1518
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,770
Why would I get in the car
when my class is over?

1519
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,370
Mr. Yu, of course,
you should get in the car.

1520
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:55,870
- But my class is over.
- Where were you going to go?

1521
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,110
- I need you there.
- Of course.

1522
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,210
Of course, you should ride with us.

1523
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:02,140
Jae Seok taught you the basics,

1524
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,810
so it's now time
to drive on the road.

1525
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:05,980
- Of course.
- On the road?

1526
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,520
Yes. Jong Kook will guide her...

1527
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,120
around Sangam-dong...

1528
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,320
and back to this parking lot.

1529
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,990
I took my driving test
in Sangam-dong.

1530
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:15,020
- Did you?
- Yes.

1531
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,930
The time of the day matters.

1532
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:18,730
Right now... What time is it?

1533
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,230
- It's 11 a.m.
- There will be fewer cars.

1534
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,230
- There won't be as many cars.
- Not around this time of day.

1535
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,630
Do I drive behind the van?

1536
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,730
- This is manageable.
- Right.

1537
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:25,830
Let's go.

1538
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,240
I'm nervous.

1539
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,000
It's just a quick drive
around this area.

1540
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,510
I'm sure you'll do a good job.

1541
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,570
- Right.
- Take any road you want.

1542
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:33,780
All right.

1543
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,110
We have our whole lives ahead of us.

1544
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,080
- Of course. You're right.
- I need to get married.

1545
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,620
- Sure.
- Yes, he...

1546
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,750
- Are you interested in marriage?
- The guy behind me...

1547
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,420
has a kid...

1548
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,690
- and has built a life.
- Sure.

1549
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,690
- I'm still unmarried though.
- Right.

1550
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,790
(Mr. Kook still has
tasks in life to accomplish.)

1551
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:52,660
Please drive safely.

1552
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,760
- Don't be nervous.
- Got it.

1553
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:56,570
- I'm nervous.
- When can she drive out?

1554
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,670
I might raise my voice occasionally,

1555
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:01,340
- but know that I'm not angry.
- Right.

1556
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,740
We could be facing danger.

1557
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,270
- I won't do well...
- That's not it.

1558
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:05,940
- if you raise your voice.
- I see.

1559
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,910
- That's true, but...
- It's not good for the driver.

1560
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:10,080
It could be the sound of surprise.

1561
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,080
If you're surprised,

1562
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,650
- you scare me even more.
- Oh, I see.

1563
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,420
That's true, though.
"If you're surprised,"

1564
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,220
- "you scare me even more."
- Yes, that's true.

1565
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,420
I might shout
in a precarious moment,

1566
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,590
- perhaps. Yes.
- A shout.

1567
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,320
- Don't be nervous, Ye Eun.
- Okay.

1568
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,420
- I should start with a prayer.
- Instructor Kim will now...

1569
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,430
- He will take the lead now.
- Yes, let's get ready.

1570
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:26,530
Here I go.

1571
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,330
- All right. Engine on.
- The engine is on.

1572
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:29,800
- Step on the brake.
- I'm stepping on the brake.

1573
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,870
All right. I'm going to start now.

1574
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:32,870
Let's go.

1575
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,300
(She's ready to get going.)

1576
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:39,010
(Lurching)

1577
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,110
- Hey, wait. Listen to me.
- Oh, dear.

1578
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,110
- Don't be surprised, Instructors.
- When you drive,

1579
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,550
instead of stepping on
the accelerator...

1580
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,020
- right from the start,
- No, of course not.

1581
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,280
feel the car move on its own...

1582
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,120
- for a little bit...
- It's so hot.

1583
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,290
- Gosh, it's hot.
- So, when you feel the car move,

1584
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:56,690
you use that momentum
to move smoothly.

1585
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,030
- Gosh, it's hot.
- Do you understand?

1586
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:00,500
- Yes, let's go. Let's try again.
- Right.

1587
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,830
- Smoothly.
- Take your foot off the pedal.

1588
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:05,300
- Yes, then the car gets...
- Smooth.

1589
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,900
- There you go. Oh, nice.
- Smooth.

1590
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,370
- Then the car gets...
- Smooth.

1591
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:10,210
(The nagging is very effective.)

1592
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:12,210
- This is kind of important too.
- I know.

1593
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:15,040
- Break it up. Tap on the pedal.
- I know. I know how to tap.

1594
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,310
(Sighing)

1595
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:18,480
- Tap.
- Tap.

1596
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,150
- Tap. No.
- Mr. Kim, you interfere a lot.

1597
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,420
- He interferes so much.
- All right. From here,

1598
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,320
- let's practice. Right turn signal.
- Turn on your blinker.

1599
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,490
- Right turn signal.
- Practice the turn signal.

1600
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:26,620
- Right turn signal.
- There you go.

1601
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,720
- It's on. Here I go.
- Then, go. With the blinkers on,

1602
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,230
- you go out just like that. Yes.
- My blinkers are on.

1603
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:32,330
(She has to make a right turn
to get onto the road.)

1604
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,160
- Why isn't this moving?
- There you go.

1605
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:36,200
- Why isn't it moving?
- The car... Wait, turn right...

1606
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,400
(Ye Eun starts turning the wheel
quite a lot right then.)

1607
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,570
- The car... Wait, turn right...
- You have to watch out.

1608
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,600
when the passenger seat
goes past the post. Wait.

1609
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,310
(In a rush)

1610
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:49,040
(The student can't hear anything.)

1611
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,110
- If you turn it too suddenly...
- Right.

1612
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,980
I should be quiet, at least.

1613
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,020
You get out and the passenger seat
passes the gate...

1614
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,950
- When you feel like you're past it,
- When I pass it?

1615
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,690
you should turn the handle...
Oh, even now, you're quite...

1616
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:00,760
(Mr. Kook gets talkative
with worry of scratching the car.)

1617
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,630
- Yes. Watch out for the bike.
- That's right. Go wide like that.

1618
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,030
Oh, even now, you're quite...

1619
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,330
(She barely makes it out.)

1620
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:07,930
- That's right. Go wide like that.
- And where do you go from here?

1621
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,270
- From here...
- I got it now.

1622
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,370
Just wait here for a minute.

1623
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,370
Excuse me.
Can I ride in a different car?

1624
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,370
- No. Line the car up.
- Okay.

1625
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:17,240
- Always use blinkers. Right.
- Watch out.

1626
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,740
- And stop. Wide turn.
- Right turn.

1627
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:20,780
(If she makes a right here,
she'll be on the road.)

1628
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,310
(She gets nervous
as she nears the road.)

1629
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:24,610
Oh, left turn.

1630
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:26,520
(She rushes
to turn the handle again.)

1631
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,820
- You'll learn that later.
- Okay.

1632
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,120
Oh, the rear wheel hit the curb.

1633
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,220
(The rear wheel went slightly
onto the sidewalk in the end.)

1634
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,920
- Good. Oh, nice.
- Oh, the rear wheel hit the curb.

1635
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,320
- That wasn't good just now.
- It wasn't good.

1636
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,230
You have to go out farther
before you turn.

1637
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,690
- You talk too much.
- I told you to turn wide.

1638
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,830
Don't turn the handle too much.

1639
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:43,400
Just move it slowly and smoothly.

1640
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,300
(She faces a red light
for the first time.)

1641
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,470
You don't have to hit the brake
so little by little.

1642
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:48,500
(She can't hear him.)

1643
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:51,040
- Hey, Mr. Kim. This is...
- Yes?

1644
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,110
- What?
- You can't say every little thing.

1645
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:55,310
Well,
I'm just giving constant feedback...

1646
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,750
- You don't have to do that.
- Okay.

1647
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,010
- There you go.
- Yes.

1648
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,650
- Smoothly step on the brake.
- Like this.

1649
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,220
Oh, you stopped well.

1650
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,020
- Did I stop well?
- Oh, you stopped well.

1651
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,020
(She got positive feedback
for the first time.)

1652
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,020
All right. Yes.

1653
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,890
It's fine.

1654
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:11,530
- It's fine
- Yes.

1655
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:14,130
Yes, you have experts by your side.

1656
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,800
(Glancing)

1657
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,570
The passenger seat...

1658
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,400
- has an airbag, right?
- My gosh.

1659
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,670
- Come on, man.
- Well, this is...

1660
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:25,740
- There's something here in front.
- My goodness.

1661
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,410
There's something here.

1662
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,950
- Here I go.
- Okay.

1663
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:31,680
- Don't turn the handle too much.
- Okay.

1664
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,820
You can turn it less
than what you'd expect.

1665
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:37,520
Let's keep going.
Step on it smoothly.

1666
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,720
You know to keep your distance,
right?

1667
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,890
- I know.
- Keep your distance.

1668
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,490
- Keep a safe distance.
- Yes.

1669
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:42,560
Keep going.

1670
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,130
Driving is so easy.

1671
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,560
You go by stepping on
the accelerator,

1672
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,630
and you stop by stepping
on the brake.

1673
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:48,630
Okay.

1674
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,670
- You're doing all right, though.
- Things are fine so far.

1675
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:53,870
- I'm fine so far?
- Keep going straight.

1676
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,100
And you have to slow down from here.

1677
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,510
There's a red light up ahead,
but you're still on the accelerator.

1678
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:59,110
- I know that too.
- That's weird.

1679
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,380
- Is that so? Yes.
- You get what I mean?

1680
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,840
You can see the red light
from all the way here.

1681
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,680
- Why step on the accelerator?
- Right. I know.

1682
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,310
- You should've slowed down already.
- Even more?

1683
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,420
- No, already. Long before,
- Oh, okay.

1684
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,890
your foot should've been
slightly on the brake already.

1685
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:13,690
I think she's getting stressed out.

1686
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,760
- Slightly.
- She looks stressed out.

1687
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,760
(The student seems
totally run down already.)

1688
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,530
So, the speed... Well...

1689
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,900
You should slow down back there
to a certain degree,

1690
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,130
and you should just roll in
with the momentum.

1691
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,640
And don't look too straightforward.

1692
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,600
- Both sides? Left, right?
- Left, right, straight ahead.

1693
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,010
- Keep looking all around you.
- Okay.

1694
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:34,410
Bam. Keep looking around
at your surroundings.

1695
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:37,280
When are the cars...
How many cars are around me?

1696
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,650
How much traffic is behind me?
You should be aware of that too.

1697
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:43,280
Overall, the road conditions
are like this.

1698
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,420
- Habitually. Bam.
- Okay.

1699
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,490
I'm sorry,
but where did you learn to drive?

1700
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,890
- Why?
- Where did you learn...

1701
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:52,130
- to drive?
- Oh, I told you.

1702
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,900
Overall, this is what the road
condition is like. Stuff like that.

1703
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,300
- The light changed.
- Ye Eun,

1704
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,130
- you can let me off there.
- Come on. No.

1705
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,540
- Keep going straight.
- All right.

1706
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,140
Keep going. Step on the accelerator.

1707
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,310
- Lightly step on it and keep going.
- Step on it.

1708
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:07,780
- There you go. Keep going.
- I guess you have been...

1709
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,110
on the road before.

1710
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:11,710
You're going smoothly.
Oh, you're doing all right.

1711
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,210
You're doing well.

1712
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,150
- You're better than I thought.
- Okay.

1713
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:18,890
- Don't turn the handle suddenly.
- Okay.

1714
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:19,890
(She gets another tip
as soon as she gets some praise.)

1715
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:20,990
Just stay calm.

1716
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,120
I'm worried someone might
cut in front of me.

1717
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,760
Oh, don't worry. No one will cut in
with this much distance.

1718
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,830
Yes, you turned on the left blinker.
From here, go like...

1719
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,630
(Jerking)

1720
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:33,300
Approach the car in front of you.
Oh, what did you just do?

1721
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,800
(Laughing)

1722
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,310
(Snorting)

1723
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:38,710
- Instructor, then I have to go...
- No, go farther in.

1724
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,780
- Is that right?
- Yes, move to the left more.

1725
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,040
- Okay.
- Go in even more, Miss.

1726
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,140
(Ddochi's car is veering
to the right quite a bit.)

1727
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,310
- Like this?
- Yes, that's good.

1728
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:47,020
You don't seem to be used to
the width...

1729
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,320
- of the car yet.
- Oh, I guess I'm not.

1730
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,390
You're veering to the right a lot.
No, it's fine. Right now isn't bad.

1731
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,390
Nice.

1732
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,920
Now, smoothly.
Keep going just like that.

1733
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,660
- Keep going.
- As you go, follow the line.

1734
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,960
- Just go with that. See the line?
- Follow the line.

1735
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,260
(Following the left turn line is
pretty hard for a novice driver.)

1736
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,030
- Follow the line. Remember, left.
- Follow the line.

1737
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,700
- Follow the line.
- Keep going.

1738
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,400
- Look far ahead.
- Look far ahead.

1739
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,840
- Look far ahead.
- Just follow that car.

1740
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,600
- Look far ahead for corners.
- Look far ahead.

1741
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,940
There you go. Good.

1742
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,810
- Here, turn on the right blinker.
- The right blinker.

1743
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,210
(She has to make a lane change
to go toward Sangam.)

1744
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,880
Don't go too fast.

1745
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,480
(Ddochi is already scared.)

1746
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,150
- Slow down.
- What's with that person?

1747
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,150
(A car ahead is coming from
the direction Ye Eun is headed.)

1748
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:23,120
(That person)

1749
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,120
- You can go after it passes.
- The car behind?

1750
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,220
- Watch the car behind.
- Look to the right.

1751
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:30,260
There you go. Nice.
That was good. You're doing well.

1752
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:31,430
Keep going.

1753
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,960
- And the most important part.
- This is driving me crazy.

1754
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,260
When you turn right,
the staff car will leave.

1755
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,770
- Oh, okay. Got it.
- You can take her where you want.

1756
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,370
- Let's turn right here.
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1757
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,300
You should already have your blinker
on for the right turn. Do it now.

1758
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,440
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1759
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,670
- Don't be flustered.
- Slowly.

1760
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,470
- Yes, do it early on.
- Early on.

1761
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,940
- If there's a car ahead, slow down.
- There's a car coming. Careful.

1762
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,050
- Just go slowly.
- Go slowly.

1763
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,680
There you go. Slowly.

1764
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,920
(She slowly heads into the turn.)

1765
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,650
All right. You can go smoothly now.

1766
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,760
- Go smoothly.
- Go smoothly.

1767
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,730
- Go smoothly. Follow the line.
- Just follow the line.

1768
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:05,790
- Don't follow that car now.
- Oh, don't follow that car?

1769
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,530
- Yes, stay on the road.
- Follow the line.

1770
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:08,800
- Keep going.
- Keep going.

1771
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,270
Oh, that's comfortable.
It's nice and wide.

1772
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:11,630
(Swerving)

1773
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,400
Oh, that's comfortable.
It's nice and wide.

1774
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,400
- Oh, my.
- What's wrong?

1775
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,440
- It's okay.
- Ji Ye Eun.

1776
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,670
- Be careful. Don't be surprised.
- Don't be surprised.

1777
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:19,470
- I can't be surprised.
- All right, 50.

1778
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,040
- Keep going.
- Don't get flustered.

1779
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,610
- Let's keep going.
- Can I go straight?

1780
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,610
Yes, of course.

1781
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,210
First of all, the sign on the ground
says you can go straight and right.

1782
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:27,650
- You keep veering to the right.
- I can go straight... Oh, really?

1783
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:28,920
A little to the left. There you go.

1784
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,220
(Ye Eun instinctively sticks
to the right side.)

1785
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,790
A little to the left. There you go.

1786
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:34,820
- Stay where you can see the light.
- Where I can see the light.

1787
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,430
Keep going as you look to
the right and left all the time.

1788
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:39,830
Keep looking around
at your surrounding situation.

1789
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,960
- Just stay in your own lane.
- Just my lane.

1790
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,000
- Yes, right.
- Whether someone comes in or not.

1791
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,030
What do you do if someone cuts in?
You can step on the brake.

1792
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,070
- But don't turn the handle.
- Okay.

1793
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:48,100
- If you suddenly turn the handle...
- What's this?

1794
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,200
because someone cuts in suddenly...

1795
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,010
- You're going right a lot, Ye Eun.
- What's this car doing?

1796
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:54,010
- What's this car doing?
- Ye Eun.

1797
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,680
You were the one
who went toward that car.

1798
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,880
- Ye Eun, it was you.
- Oh, right.

1799
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,210
- You went toward that car. Right.
- Okay.

1800
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:00,850
- Stay to the left of the lane.
- To the left?

1801
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:02,420
- I told you to look earlier, right?
- The left.

1802
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,750
- You see the lines ahead, right?
- Is this right?

1803
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:08,190
You have to decide within your view.

1804
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,920
- Right. To the left a bit. Stop.
- I still don't get it.

1805
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,160
- Stop here. Look from here.
- Okay, stop.

1806
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,900
- You're okay for the most part.
- Yes.

1807
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,600
Within your own point-of-view
right now, look around.

1808
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,100
Where are the lines
in comparison to the car?

1809
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,470
- The front of the car.
- Yes, here.

1810
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:23,140
Where are the lines in comparison?

1811
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,910
I think it's toward the "Yul."

1812
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,740
I think it's toward the "Yul."

1813
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,780
(Paused)

1814
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,580
- That letter won't be there always
- No.

1815
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,680
(Shutting his eyes)

1816
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,750
Look where the lines are...

1817
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,750
- on the car right now.
- Okay.

1818
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,850
So, when you drive, think about
lining the car up just like that.

1819
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,890
- Gosh, this is hard.
- You're okay for now.

1820
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:43,890
- It's that line now. Don't forget.
- Yes, that line.

1821
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,060
- That line.
- All right.

1822
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,490
- Keep going smoothly. Go ahead.
- Keep going.

1823
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:47,960
I'll go smoothly.

1824
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,960
Go ahead...
You're veering to the right a lot.

1825
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,100
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1826
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,830
- Mr. Kim.
- Keep going. Yes?

1827
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:53,840
Do you care about the right side...

1828
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,300
- in case you get hurt?
- No.

1829
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,010
- No, it's not that.
- You seem really scared.

1830
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,110
- Right now...
- You're getting really scared.

1831
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:00,580
- We were veering right quite a lot.
- I can't...

1832
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,810
- Yes.
- You're going to the right now too.

1833
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:03,810
- You're right.
- Yes.

1834
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,580
You're still veering to the right.

1835
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,680
- Gosh, this is...
- I told you to stay in the line.

1836
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,950
Look at this.
You're on the right side.

1837
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:10,220
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1838
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,420
Oh, you're stepping
on the yellow line.

1839
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,320
- Is that right?
- You're good now.

1840
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,320
- I mean...
- You're doing well now.

1841
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,060
- I'm sorry.
- Keep going... No, just go.

1842
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,630
- Go. What's wrong? Keep going.
- It's fine. Don't be flustered.

1843
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:19,730
- It's fine.
- If you keep going this way,

1844
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,400
- we'll end up in the north.
- Okay.

1845
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,500
- There you go. Keep going smoothly.
- Keep going.

1846
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,200
- Step on it.
- Go. Step on it.

1847
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,640
- That's it.
- I'm stepping on it.

1848
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,300
(Ye Eun slowly gets the hang of it.)

1849
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,040
- Good. That wasn't bad just now.
- Just now...

1850
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,010
- Good.
- Am I veering? This much...

1851
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,880
- That's it. You're finding it now.
- Nice.

1852
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,050
- You can find it on your own now.
- I can find it.

1853
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:39,280
- I've got the hang of it.
- You're slightly veering right.

1854
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,320
You can just keep going now.
You're doing well.

1855
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,890
This is it. You get it now, right?
It's that vibe right now.

1856
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:46,320
You're doing so well now.
Much better than I thought.

1857
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,860
- She's pretty good.
- Nice. You're doing well.

1858
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,960
- This is it. We're here.
- Just like that.

1859
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,530
- We're here. You did well.
- Is this it?

1860
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:54,060
- You made it here really well.
- My gosh.

1861
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,100
- I know, right?
- You got back precisely.

1862
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,130
- You did so well.
- All right. Good.

1863
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:59,170
- Keep going. Drive through.
- Keep going?

1864
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:00,840
- Yes, great job.
- My goodness.

1865
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,470
My gosh. Great job.

1866
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:03,870
Gosh, we're alive.

1867
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:05,540
Yes! You worked so hard.

1868
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:06,840
All right.

1869
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:09,010
(Sighing)

1870
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:11,480
It needs to go past
the driver's seat.

1871
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,080
When you feel like
it went past half of the car,

1872
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,680
make a turn.
You need to wait until then.

1873
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,450
(Bleeding from the ears)

1874
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:19,520
What do you think?
I'm a good instructor, right?

1875
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,620
- Yes.
- It was nice, right?

1876
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,920
- It was nice.
- Okay.

1877
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,190
I need to escape.

1878
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,390
I couldn't open the door.

1879
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:27,060
What... What was that?

1880
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,230
I couldn't open the door.
I was so surprised.

1881
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:31,430
- I expected worse, but...
- That's right.

1882
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:32,500
It was better than I expected.

1883
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,900
I expected a hopeless situation.

1884
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,510
- Thank goodness.
- The roads were pretty empty.

1885
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:38,910
- Thank goodness.
- Yes.

1886
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,980
The last instructor,

1887
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,510
Daniel, please come on in.

1888
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,710
- Daniel?
- Daniel.

1889
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,650
- Daniel.
- Hello.

1890
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,620
- Hello.
- Daniel.

1891
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,320
(He has a class 1 driver's license.
His driving skills are unknown.)

1892
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,090
- All right.
- Daniel, do you drive a lot?

1893
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:52,450
- Yes. I'm a good driver.
- Are you a good driver?

1894
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:54,060
- Really?
- I don't know.

1895
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,320
We're very talented instructors.

1896
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,060
- We're star instructors.
- I'm worried.

1897
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,160
- Why? Are we driving today?
- They're very talented instructors.

1898
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,700
You know how to drive
a stick shift car, right?

1899
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:02,730
Of course. I have
a class one general license.

1900
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,770
- A class one general license.
- A class one general license.

1901
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:06,030
- Of course.
- He's proud of his driving skills.

1902
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,440
- When did you get a license?
- When did you get a license?

1903
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,140
I got mine in 2004.

1904
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,440
- It was past 2000.
- In 2004.

1905
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,840
Daniel, teach her
a necessary part of driving...

1906
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,840
which is self-fueling.

1907
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,580
- Self-fueling.
- Yes.

1908
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,450
That's right. You need to know
how to pump your own gas.

1909
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:21,020
You need to know how to do it.

1910
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:22,750
The previous instructors,

1911
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:25,090
- Jae Seok and Jong Kook...
- Why don't we take...

1912
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,750
- will sit in the back.
- The back? Okay.

1913
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,090
Why don't we take a short break?

1914
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:29,690
- Did you give her a driving lesson?
- Yes.

1915
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:32,360
- We've been busy since morning.
- Really?

1916
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:33,900
- Our blood is drying out.
- Right now...

1917
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,400
- Seriously.
- How is she? Is she good?

1918
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,700
- She's okay.
- She isn't bad at it.

1919
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,730
Gosh, Ye Eun's back
became even more hunched.

1920
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,100
- Stretch your back.
- My goodness.

1921
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,870
- You're tall.
- Driving worsened...

1922
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,870
- her forward head posture.
- My goodness.

1923
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:47,440
- You keep saying, "You're tall."
- Yes.

1924
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,980
- You say it every week.
- Straighten your back.

1925
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:51,680
She's tall, but her back is hunched.

1926
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,150
You can go and fuel the car.

1927
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:55,180
- It'll be diesel.
- Go ahead.

1928
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,180
- I...
- DIesel.

1929
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,350
I...

1930
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:59,190
- Make sure it's diesel. Never...
- Diesel.

1931
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,390
- What's diesel?
- You need to know your car.

1932
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:02,490
Listen.

1933
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:04,290
There are two types. One is gasoline
and the other one is diesel.

1934
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:05,290
- That's right.
- Okay.

1935
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:07,030
When you listen to that car,
it makes rattling sounds.

1936
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,530
- Yes. A diesel car.
- It's a diesel car.

1937
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:09,600
- Yes. It makes rattling sounds.
- Right.

1938
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,170
You can't put diesel
in a gasoline car.

1939
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,500
You can't put gasoline
in a diesel car.

1940
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,670
(Nodding for now)

1941
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,040
- All right. For now...
- Why is it...

1942
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,610
that you don't believe her?

1943
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:18,640
Just what happened?

1944
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,440
In that situation,

1945
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,110
you need to empty out
the fuel tank...

1946
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,910
- and start over.
- It'll be...

1947
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:24,950
- a big deal.
- It'll be bad.

1948
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,080
- It'll be a big deal.
- It nearly ruins the car.

1949
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,180
That's right.

1950
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,280
- One time...
- You'll now move with Daniel.

1951
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,650
- That's right.
- Let's hit the road. Let's go.

1952
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:32,620
- I can't check out the directions.
- That's why I'm an instructor.

1953
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,420
- Good.
- That's why I'm an instructor.

1954
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,560
That makes sense.
Everyone is an instructor.

1955
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,060
- Okay.
- Do I guide her...

1956
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:39,330
- from the passenger seat?
- That's right.

1957
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,360
- Check out the directions as well.
- Okay.

1958
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,330
She took the passenger seat.

1959
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:46,570
She took the passenger seat.

1960
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:48,840
- Please hold on.
- Okay.

1961
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,470
Hey.

1962
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:51,640
(Jae Seok opens the door again
since he's frustrated.)

1963
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,210
- I mean...
- She's a staff member.

1964
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,140
I didn't know.

1965
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,740
- "She took the passenger seat?"
- I'm sorry.

1966
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:57,880
I didn't know.

1967
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,280
I see. You're setting up
the destination.

1968
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,620
My goodness.

1969
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:04,520
- All right.
- All right.

1970
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,890
I'll teach her this time. Yes.

1971
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:09,020
I'll give her a lesson.

1972
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,160
- Let's go.
- I can't look at the navigation,

1973
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,590
- so please do that for me.
- Okay.

1974
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:13,960
I'm bad with the navigation too.

1975
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:14,960
Ye Eun, make a turn to go out.
- Shall I do that?
- Okay.

1976
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,670
- Shall I do that?
- Go ahead.

1977
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:19,600
- Think of it as practice.
- That's right.

1978
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,940
- It's good to get practice.
- For your information...

1979
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,640
- It's good to get practice.
- For your information,

1980
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,910
- I went to Yangyang once...
- Okay.

1981
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:26,010
- with my friends.
- Turn.

1982
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,110
- It took me 11 hours...
- Go.

1983
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:29,110
- to come back to Seoul.
- Excuse me?

1984
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:30,280
It took me 11 hours.

1985
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,410
- My goodness. Why?
- Why?

1986
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:34,650
Back then, cell phones didn't come
with a navigation function.

1987
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:36,350
- I just had a device for the car.
- I see.

1988
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:40,320
I felt like it'd be faster
to take a different route.

1989
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:42,360
- It told me to turn right,
- I know what it's like.

1990
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,160
but I turned left.

1991
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,230
I went between the Gyeongbu
and Jungbu Expressways.

1992
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,530
So, it took me 11 hours.

1993
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:51,600
(While Daniel tells his story,
Driver Ji gets out.)

1994
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,330
I left in the morning
and arrived at night.

1995
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,370
You're unbelievable.

1996
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,470
- You know,
- Yes?

1997
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:57,670
you should teach her what to do.

1998
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:02,510
- Turn right.
- You don't have time for chit-chat.

1999
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:06,210
(Ye Eun came close
to hitting the exit earlier.)

2000
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:07,880
Why isn't that car going?

2001
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,420
- I think I'll hit it.
- Go.

2002
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,620
- Go smoothly.
- Go smoothly.

2003
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:12,690
- This is driving me crazy.
- It's okay.

2004
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:14,620
- Go smoothly.
- This is driving me crazy.

2005
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:16,960
(The gap is much wider than before.)

2006
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,630
- All right.
- Is it a staff member's car?

2007
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:19,890
- Watch out for that Mercedes-Benz.
- Mercedes-Benz.

2008
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,160
- It'll be bad if you hit it.
- If I do that...

2009
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,660
- Yes.
- Go.

2010
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,230
From here...

2011
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,600
- What?
- Turn right.

2012
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,700
- Turn right?
- Do you turn right?

2013
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,800
- Turn right.
- Turn right.

2014
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,100
From here...

2015
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,470
(You obviously need to turn right.)

2016
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:31,570
- Turn right?
- Do you turn right?

2017
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:32,810
- Turn right.
- Turn right.

2018
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:34,240
- You know, Daniel...
- Be careful.

2019
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,210
- The rear wheel went over.
- Good.

2020
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:37,910
Be careful.

2021
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,080
- You can turn right.
- Make a turn signal...

2022
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,180
- for the right turn.
- A turn signal.

2023
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,420
- Make a turn signal.
- No.

2024
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,120
- Go. Turn right. Go.
- Okay.

2025
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:45,450
- She needs to drive more carefully.
- It's past the driver's seat.

2026
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:47,460
- Don't just say, "Go."
- It's past the driver's seat.

2027
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:49,290
- She needs to drive more carefully.
- It's past the driver's seat.

2028
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:50,990
- Don't just say, "Go."
- It's past the driver's seat.

2029
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:52,460
- That's it. That was a nice turn.
- Okay.

2030
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,400
- Ye Eun, that was a nice turn.
- Nice.

2031
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,530
- It was nice.
- Earlier,

2032
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,760
a rear wheel went up
on the sidewalk.

2033
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,470
It was nice.

2034
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:00,300
- That was a nice turn.
- It was nice.

2035
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,870
- It was a big turn.
- She's a quick learner.

2036
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:05,210
If people give too many instructions
when you're driving,

2037
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:06,910
you can get flustered.

2038
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:08,510
- So, I'll keep it quiet...
- Which way am I going?

2039
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,510
- and slow.
- Follow that car and turn right.

2040
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:12,010
- I'll only say what's essential.
- Which car?

2041
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:13,850
- I'll keep it simple.
- Which car?

2042
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:16,420
(Instructor Choi and Ddochi
can't communicate at all.)

2043
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:17,690
- Here. Make a turn.
- Go straight.

2044
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:18,920
You took this route earlier.

2045
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,050
- Don't go straight.
- Watch out...

2046
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,360
- for the sidewalk.
- Here.

2047
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,060
- No. Turn right.
- Turn right.

2048
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,190
Do I turn right?

2049
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:25,460
- By the way,
- What is it?

2050
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:26,660
- Daniel...
- Yes?

2051
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,230
- You can't read the directions.
- The navigation device...

2052
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:30,800
- Go further and turn right.
- Okay.

2053
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:32,670
The navigation device
isn't what I'm used to.

2054
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:34,970
Pull up to the crosswalk and stop.

2055
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:37,070
- Stop here.
- There you go.

2056
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:39,810
- Wait for the pedestrians to pass.
- Yes.

2057
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,240
- Go now.
- Go now. Yes.

2058
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:43,580
Go now. Go slowly.

2059
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,910
- Go slowly at first.
- Slowly.

2060
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:47,450
You said that you'd talk less.

2061
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,550
- What? Did someone honk at me?
- Someone honked. Yes.

2062
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,150
- No. It wasn't directed at you.
- No. A car in the back.

2063
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,220
- A car in the back.
- This is your lane.

2064
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,520
(Novice drivers think
all the honks are directed at them.)

2065
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,660
(Because she's scared,)

2066
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,930
(the car sticks to the right.)

2067
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:01,360
Right now,
you're sticking to the right.

2068
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,700
- Daniel, tell her.
- Where am I going?

2069
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,170
- What? The right...
- She's sticking to the right.

2070
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:07,100
- Jong Kook, this is Daniel's time.
- I mean...

2071
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,400
I'm sorry.

2072
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,940
- Isn't she sticking to the right?
- Okay.

2073
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:11,210
- Ye Eun,
- Yes?

2074
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:13,310
- turn off the blinkers.
- Shall I do that?

2075
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,610
- Go straight.
- I've never seen her so serious.

2076
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:16,780
(Relax.)

2077
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:18,180
- Let's keep going.
- All right.

2078
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:19,710
Daniel, look to the front.

2079
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:21,180
- Okay.
- Don't look at Ye Eun.

2080
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,650
- Go.
- All right.

2081
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:24,920
- She... Be careful.
- Be careful. Listen.

2082
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,050
- She... Be careful.
- Be careful. Listen.

2083
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:28,590
- Be careful.
- Daniel!

2084
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:30,420
- Sit still.
- For goodness' sake.

2085
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,760
- Sit still.
- He doesn't...

2086
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,830
- He doesn't tell her what to do.
- She'll become flustered.

2087
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:39,230
- Sit still.
- The wheels are on the right lines!

2088
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:41,600
- The car is a bit to the right.
- Be careful.

2089
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,710
Now, you're driving well
in the middle of the lane.

2090
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:47,810
- This is good. Remember this.
- Ye Eun, remember what I said.

2091
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:52,210
(She cancels out the noises.)

2092
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:53,850
- Sit still.
- Keep going like this.

2093
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:55,420
- Ye Eun, don't do that.
- Sit still.

2094
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,250
Ye Eun, don't become flustered.

2095
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,390
(She cancels out the noises
and focuses on the road.)

2096
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:00,650
- Good.
- Ye Eun can drive well.

2097
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:02,360
- She can drive well.
- Right now,

2098
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,430
she's on the easiest road.

2099
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:05,930
For goodness' sake.

2100
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:07,830
- Come on.
- On the left...

2101
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:09,500
- Don't rain on her parade.
- We were giving her courage.

2102
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,970
- Don't be like that.
- I didn't rain on her parade.

2103
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:12,400
Don't rain on her parade.

2104
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,740
On the left is the Sangam Stadium.

2105
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,170
The grass is a mess.

2106
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:17,200
(The grass is a mess.)

2107
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,240
Why are you talking about soccer?

2108
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,310
What?

2109
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:21,710
- Why are you talking about soccer?
- I mean...

2110
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:23,680
- It just came up.
- It has nothing to do with driving.

2111
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,150
You have small talk while driving.

2112
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:27,210
For goodness' sake.

2113
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,350
- She became much better.
- Jong Kook, are you good at soccer?

2114
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:29,520
Of course.

2115
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,890
- I heard that you were bad at it.
- Listen.

2116
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,460
Compared to his love
for the sport...

2117
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:37,490
- Is that so?
- Daniel.

2118
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:39,260
Focus on her driving.

2119
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,060
- You need to focus on it.
- You're here as an instructor.

2120
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,130
- Instructor.
- Gosh,

2121
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:43,430
- he's quite...
- This instructor...

2122
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,330
- How's this instructor?
- This instructor...

2123
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:47,200
- only chats.
- Yes.

2124
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,770
- He's bad, right?
- Yes.

2125
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:50,170
- I mean...
- I can explain.

2126
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:52,410
(He began with small talk.)

2127
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:55,140
(He was bad with directions.)

2128
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:59,050
(He was just a chatterbox
in the passenger seat.)

2129
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:02,280
I can explain.
That's how stable her driving is.

2130
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,050
- Not bad.
- It's very nice.

2131
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:06,120
- There's a gas station.
- Is that it?

2132
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,420
You need to enter.

2133
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,460
Don't make a sharp turn.

2134
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,490
- Keep it wide.
- Ye Eun.

2135
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:12,230
- Enter through this opening.
- I know that.

2136
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:13,930
(Finally, Instructor Choi
teaches her something!)

2137
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:15,430
Enter through this opening.

2138
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,800
- Enter through this opening.
- I know that.

2139
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,830
How do you make a right turn?
Make it go past the driver's seat.

2140
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:21,240
- Ye Eun.
- Make it go past the driver's seat.

2141
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,470
- Then you make a turn.
- Look at the fuel cap.

2142
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,770
- Then you make a turn.
- Look at the fuel cap.

2143
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:27,440
- A motorcycle might pass by,
- Ye Eun, the fuel cap.

2144
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,010
- so check the sides.
- Where's the fuel cap?

2145
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,410
- Where's the fuel cap?
- Gosh.

2146
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:32,080
- Go. Where's the fuel cap?
- Where am I going?

2147
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,480
- Where's the fuel cap?
- I don't know.

2148
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,650
- Seriously.
- Hold on. This car...

2149
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:35,950
- Go. Where's the fuel cap?
- Where am I going?

2150
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:36,980
- Left, right.
- Where's the fuel cap?

2151
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,050
- I don't know.
- Come on.

2152
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:40,020
- Hold on. This car...
- Stop.

2153
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:41,190
(She stops for now.)

2154
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:43,060
- Hold on. This car...
- Stop.

2155
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:44,260
- Where's the fuel cap?
- What now?

2156
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:45,760
See if the fuel cap is
on the right side or the left side.

2157
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,030
Look at the fuel icon.

2158
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:48,030
- Ye Eun, look.
- Where is it?

2159
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:49,160
- Where is it?
- There's an arrow.

2160
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,760
- There's an arrow.
- Where is the fuel icon?

2161
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,430
- It's at the bottom right.
- Where is it?

2162
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,700
- I don't know this either.
- It's here.

2163
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,400
- It's at the bottom right.
- Where is it?

2164
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,540
- I don't know this either.
- It's here.

2165
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:58,670
(The dashboard shows
the direction of the fuel cap.)

2166
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:00,570
- There's the fuel icon.
- Here.

2167
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:02,280
- Right, left.
- That's right.

2168
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:04,380
- What does that mean?
- It's on this side.

2169
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:05,910
- The fuel cap is on the left.
- I didn't know.

2170
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:08,250
- I didn't know.
- Didn't you know?

2171
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:09,450
- He didn't know.
- I didn't know.

2172
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:11,620
- Then I should go this way.
- I didn't know.

2173
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,120
- Wait behind that car.
- Go to the right.

2174
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,520
- Go to the right.
- Ye Eun.

2175
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,720
Go gently.

2176
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,830
- Just take off your foot gently.
- Shall I go?

2177
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:20,590
It just needs to be
near that engine thingy.

2178
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:22,500
- "That engine thingy?"
- I mean...

2179
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,300
- I can't believe Daniel.
- Make a big turn.

2180
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,530
- Okay.
- Turn now.

2181
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:27,700
- Turn now.
- There you go.

2182
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,900
- Unwind the wheel.
- Go to the end.

2183
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:32,310
- Take your hands off the wheel.
- Go to the end. That's it.

2184
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:34,110
- Keep going.
- A bit more.

2185
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:36,280
- Stop.
- Stop.

2186
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,180
- Okay.
- P.

2187
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,280
Before pumping gas,

2188
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,780
- turn off the car.
- Turn off the engine.

2189
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:42,180
- Turn off the engine.
- There you go.

2190
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,650
- Okay.
- Daniel, go and teach her.

2191
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:45,250
Okay. I'll teach her.

2192
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,890
(In any case,
they arrived in a living state.)

2193
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,290
(Her body is shaking.)

2194
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:55,600
You're good.

2195
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,730
- All right. Now...
- Okay.

2196
01:09:57,730 --> 01:10:00,170
How do you know if this is...

2197
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,800
- It's a diesel car.
- a diesel car?

2198
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,000
- They told me so.
- How do you know that?

2199
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,910
To check if it's a diesel car,
open the fuel cap.

2200
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:07,070
- Here.
- It isn't opening.

2201
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:08,380
How do you open it?

2202
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,910
How do you open the fuel cap?

2203
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:12,310
- For goodness' sake.
- Unbelievable.

2204
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:15,050
(Unable to start the lesson,
he asks for help.)

2205
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:16,220
There's a fuel cap button.

2206
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,020
- Ye Eun, look.
- You need to open it.

2207
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:19,520
Look at the fuel cap button.

2208
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,520
- It's the fuel cap button.
- Here.

2209
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,890
- Press it.
- I can't believe them.

2210
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:24,120
Is that how you open it?

2211
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,360
(Instructor Choi's driving tip:)

2212
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,590
(Press the fuel cap button
to open the fuel cap.)

2213
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:28,430
Mine is done manually.

2214
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:29,530
(Instructor Choi grows
throughout the lesson.)

2215
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:30,630
I had no idea.

2216
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:32,330
It's different for each car!

2217
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:34,600
Jae Seok.

2218
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,440
- Yes?
- Don't be like that.

2219
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:39,540
- I just wanted to let him know.
- This isn't an emergency.

2220
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:41,810
- Cars are nice these days.
- It says, "Diesel."

2221
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:43,380
- It says, "Diesel."
- Yes.

2222
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,850
(The type of fuel the car needs
is written inside.)

2223
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,720
Now, press, "Start."

2224
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:48,980
- Start.
- Start.

2225
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,180
Before fueling the car...

2226
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,520
- Touch the anti-static pad.
- What's wrong?

2227
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,320
When there's static electricity,

2228
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,760
fuel can catch on fire...

2229
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,660
- and burn your hand.
- I see.

2230
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:59,690
I mean, the fuel on the hand
can catch on fire.

2231
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,000
- She just needs to put on a glove.
- I know. She isn't doing that.

2232
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:05,470
- The glove.
- All right.

2233
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:06,670
(Knocking)

2234
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,270
- Put on a glove.
- A glove.

2235
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:09,340
Fill up the tank.

2236
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,070
- Put on a glove.
- A glove.

2237
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:13,870
- "Put on a glove?"
- A glove.

2238
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:14,880
- They heard us.
- "Put on a glove."

2239
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,040
- That's right.
- They heard us.

2240
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,210
- It can make your hands dirty.
- Okay.

2241
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,410
- Your hands need to be clean.
- Yes.

2242
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:19,480
(She finally puts on a glove.)

2243
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:21,480
- Next...
- Will you fill up the tank?

2244
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,480
- Fifty dollars?
- Fifty dollars?
How much fuel should we put in?

2245
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:24,750
- Fifty dollars?
- How much fuel? Fifty dollars?

2246
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,250
We don't know
how much fuel is in the tank.

2247
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:29,060
Make it 50 dollars.
If the tank becomes full,

2248
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:30,720
the money will be refunded.

2249
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,090
If the tank becomes full...

2250
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:34,030
(Excuse me?)

2251
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:37,700
Why can't I open the door?

2252
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:39,330
- Okay.
- How do I open the door?

2253
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:40,570
Jae Seok, how do I open the door?

2254
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:41,740
- Hold on.
- I mean...

2255
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:43,140
I don't know how to open this door.

2256
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:45,370
- Here.
- Okay.

2257
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:47,980
- Insert the nozzle and add fuel.
- Okay.

2258
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,180
- It'll stop once it's full.
- I see.

2259
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,350
So we should select
the "Full tank" option, right?

2260
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,880
- We need to select an option.
- That's right.

2261
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,380
- Full tank?
- Select the "Full tank" option.

2262
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:56,920
- That's too much.
- What does it say?

2263
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,590
- Right now...
- That's too much.

2264
01:11:58,590 --> 01:11:59,590
Here.

2265
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:00,750
(Jong Kook yells at them
to save money.)

2266
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:03,990
- You haven't done it, right?
- Jong Kook can't get out.

2267
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,660
(Touching)

2268
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:07,700
The door...

2269
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,460
(Rattling)

2270
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:11,500
(Pressing)

2271
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:14,300
How do I open the door?

2272
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:17,000
- What are you doing?
- I can't open the door.

2273
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,910
- Why...
- I wanted to go out,

2274
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:20,310
but I couldn't.

2275
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:22,840
- I can't even open the window.
- What are you doing?

2276
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,550
Seeing a big man like you in here...

2277
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:27,380
Open the fuel cap first.

2278
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:28,550
(It's time to insert the nozzle.)

2279
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:30,350
Turn it to the left.

2280
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:32,320
- I can't... I got it.
- Turn it to the left.

2281
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,490
It's a bit stiff.

2282
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,860
Now, insert the nozzle. Push it in.

2283
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:37,060
- Is this good enough?
- Yes.

2284
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:40,260
- Next, pull the trigger.
- Shall I pull this?

2285
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:42,100
- Push it in.
- Okay.

2286
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,860
(Secure the nozzle
on a locking device.)

2287
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,330
Afterward, put your hand
on the nozzle again.

2288
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:47,770
- Don't pull the trigger.
- Shall I take it out?

2289
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,900
Take it out and shake it a bit.

2290
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,810
We don't live
in an oil-producing country.

2291
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,510
Take the cap again.

2292
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:56,440
- If I don't close it properly,
- Close it.

2293
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,210
- will the fuel leak?
- Turn it to the right. Of course.

2294
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,550
Once it's secure,
you'll hear a click.

2295
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,880
Turn it all the way.

2296
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:03,980
- There you go.
- Like this.

2297
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,820
- You need to hear a click.
- Okay.

2298
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:06,950
- Close it now.
- Okay.

2299
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,990
Well done. You're smiling now.

2300
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:13,290
You didn't smile while driving,
so I was very surprised.

2301
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:15,430
I thought you had heard
bad news at home.

2302
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:17,900
By the way, Daniel isn't used...

2303
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:20,200
to the gas station.

2304
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:22,670
I'll cross out the last "Serious."

2305
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,540
(After Instructor Choi's lesson,
she crosses out the last "Serious.")

2306
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:25,740
All done.

2307
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:27,110
(Driver Ji evolved into a noob.)

2308
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:28,880
She's a good driver.

2309
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,680
- She's better than I expected.
- Yes.

2310
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,150
- That's right.
- She's better than I expected.

2311
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:34,250
- She's good.
- She's better than I expected.

2312
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:35,480
- She drives in a stable way.
- Ye Eun.

2313
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,920
- Yes?
- You're better than I thought.

2314
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:39,920
- You're a good driver.
- Let's go.

2315
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:40,920
You're a very good driver.

2316
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,860
The remaining members...

2317
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:45,090
are waiting for Ye Eun
to pick them out.

2318
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:46,290
Pick up the members...

2319
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:48,600
who are scattered
throughout Sangam-dong,

2320
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:51,830
order snacks and drinks
at a drive-thru,

2321
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:53,970
and arrive at the ending location.

2322
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,840
- Come on.
- Then you can get off work.

2323
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,000
A drive-thru?

2324
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,440
- A drive-thru will be hard.
- A drive-thru will be hard.

2325
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,910
- She won't be able to enter.
- Please hit the road now.

2326
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:03,110
- A drive-thru will be hard.
- The entrance is very narrow.

2327
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:05,010
It's narrow. And a drive-thru...

2328
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:07,650
- has a curved path.
- It'll be hard.

2329
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:08,980
Gosh, a drive-thru...

2330
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,420
- will be hard.
- It'll be hard.

2331
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:12,120
(Worried)

2332
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,890
- It's okay.
- Ye Eun will become...

2333
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:15,220
a driving expert.

2334
01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:18,590
(The members are waiting
at their positions.)

2335
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:21,530
Is such a project possible?

2336
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:24,060
I've watched her drive.
It was no joke.

2337
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:25,270
Let's wait.

2338
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:27,900
I bet the older members
taught her well.

2339
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,100
I bet she improved.

2340
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,670
Did it turn into a bumper car?

2341
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:36,040
I think it's the worst penalty
since the Nevis Swing.

2342
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,180
I can't get in that car.

2343
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:39,750
- Why not?
- I have three children.

2344
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:41,920
Are there four pickup locations?

2345
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,250
- It'll be hard.
- It's hard to drive in Seoul.

2346
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,620
- Ye Eun.
- Yes?

2347
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:47,120
You've done well so far.

2348
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,220
- Okay.
- You're good.

2349
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,490
- Let's go to the drive-thru today.
- Okay.

2350
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:53,160
Jae Seok, there are more cars now.

2351
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,930
- I know.
- Now, the difficulty level is high.

2352
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:56,360
There's heavier traffic.

2353
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,700
- Let's hit the road.
- Go. Let's go.

2354
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,300
- Hit the brakes when you need to.
- I'll open the windows.

2355
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:01,640
"I'll open the windows?"

2356
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,970
- You closed them.
- You said you'd open them.

2357
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:05,010
(Driver Ji is confused.)

2358
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:06,440
- Ye Eun, you said you'd open them.
- Yes?

2359
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,770
- Did you fasten your seatbelt?
- Yes.

2360
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,540
- All right.
- All right.

2361
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,580
- Good. Check the sides.
- She's good.

2362
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,750
- See if a car is coming.
- That's right.

2363
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:15,050
- Ye Eun, go slowly.
- Where will you go?

2364
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:17,020
There's an OP.

2365
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:18,950
- Don't take it. Go to the right.
- Go to the side.

2366
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,990
Ye Eun, do you know what an OP is?

2367
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:22,060
No, I don't.

2368
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,390
I know what an overpass is.

2369
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:24,420
- An OP.
- It's an overpass.

2370
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,930
We used a short form.

2371
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,360
- She'll learn these things.
- Okay.

2372
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,400
- Go, Ye Eun.
- Okay.

2373
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,630
- Not an operation.
- I'll keep going.

2374
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:34,200
- Go straight.
- Go straight.

2375
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,970
You'll make a U-turn over there.

2376
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:37,910
- Should I follow the taxi?
- That's right.

2377
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:39,810
Focus on your path.

2378
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:41,170
- You're sticking to the right.
- Oh, my.

2379
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,540
- A bit to the left.
- You're sticking to the right.

2380
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:44,880
- You see a truck over there.
- Yes.

2381
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,980
- Make a U-turn like the truck.
- Make a U-turn.

2382
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:48,180
- Make a U-turn.
- What did I tell you about...

2383
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:50,180
- the curved road?
- Make a wide turn.

2384
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,520
- That's right.
- Make a wide turn.

2385
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,890
- Slowly. Lower the speed. Yes.
- Yes. Lower the speed.

2386
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:55,720
- Make it go past the driver's seat.
- Okay.

2387
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,590
- Make a turn right afterward.
- Make a wide turn.

2388
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:58,690
- Make it go past the driver's seat.
- Stop.

2389
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:00,830
- Stop.
- Good.

2390
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:02,730
- Okay.
- I know what to do.

2391
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,360
- She's good.
- Make a turn right afterward.

2392
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,070
- All right.
- Don't make a sharp turn.

2393
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:07,700
- Slowly.
- Turn the wheel slowly.

2394
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,270
- It's okay. Keep going.
- Turn the wheel slowly.

2395
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:10,740
- Instructors.
- Yes?

2396
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,810
- All of us will confuse her.
- Yes.

2397
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:14,110
- Turn.
- If three people talk,

2398
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:15,110
- it'll be confusing.
- Turn the wheel.

2399
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:17,440
- Turn the wheel.
- Turn it!

2400
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,480
- Turn it.
- If you do that...

2401
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,210
- Thank you.
- All right.

2402
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:21,320
Okay.

2403
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:24,280
The road is wide, so it's good.

2404
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:27,920
- It's wide enough for a tank.
- Keep going.

2405
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,160
- For goodness' sake.
- It was a technical term.

2406
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,260
- It was a technical term.
- Instructor Kim.

2407
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:34,360
- It was an old expression.
- What?

2408
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,160
- "It's wide enough for a tank?"
- It's an expression...

2409
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,930
- everyone uses.
- Besides,

2410
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:39,700
- you sneered at the driver.
- Seriously.

2411
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,070
- When did I do that?
- Do you look down on her?

2412
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:43,000
- No.
- Don't sneer at me.

2413
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,540
Let's go over it.

2414
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:45,810
Step on the brakes...

2415
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,110
- to put on a distance.
- Okay.

2416
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:49,010
- Step on the brakes.
- I did that.

2417
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:51,010
- Be careful.
- I stepped on the brakes.

2418
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,810
She's sliding down.

2419
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:56,250
It's nice. You're doing well.

2420
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,790
Didn't you say
that she was sliding down?

2421
01:16:58,790 --> 01:16:59,820
No.

2422
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,020
Didn't you say
that she was sliding down?

2423
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:03,020
No.

2424
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:04,260
All right.

2425
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,560
- Don't be annoyed.
- I just made it...

2426
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,890
easier to understand.

2427
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,800
- Ye Eun, you must be feeling hot.
- She's feeling hot.

2428
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,300
- Turn on the air conditioner.
- I turned it on.

2429
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:12,830
(A bus is in front of Ye Eun's car.)

2430
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:14,030
Just follow the lane.

2431
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:15,370
- Don't be startled.
- I'll go on my way.

2432
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:16,770
Just follow the lane.

2433
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:18,970
Look to the left.

2434
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:20,740
If you can cut in, go ahead.
Otherwise, keep going.

2435
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:21,940
- Okay.
- The bus will stop anyway.

2436
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,940
- You should cut in, but...
- I can't cut in, okay?

2437
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,410
- Did you use a casual tone?
- It's okay.

2438
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:27,810
- "I can't cut in, okay?"
- It's okay to use a casual tone.

2439
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,480
- "I can't cut in, okay?"
- "I can't cut in, okay?"

2440
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,350
- Good.
- "I can't cut in, okay?"

2441
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:32,650
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

2442
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:33,820
- I'm flustered.
- Good.

2443
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,790
- All of us are friends.
- It's okay.

2444
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,620
- All the drivers are friends.
- Good.

2445
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:39,360
- Keep going up.
- All of us are friends.

2446
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,490
Follow the road.

2447
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:42,130
- Keep going up.
- Right.

2448
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:43,900
The first member...

2449
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,200
- is 700m ahead.
- The 1st member?

2450
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,230
- Really?
- We're nearly there.

2451
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:47,270
- Who could it be?
- We're nearly there.

2452
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:48,740
I should stick to the left, right?

2453
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:50,740
Is she coming this way or that way?

2454
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:52,210
- This way.
- This way?

2455
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,810
Listen. I'll explain it
ahead of time.

2456
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,610
How will she stop the car here?

2457
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:58,110
If she's smart about it,

2458
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:00,850
she'll go in that way...

2459
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:03,320
and make a turn
to come out this way.

2460
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,390
And there's another thing.
A car was waiting here earlier.

2461
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,890
If she's going to stop the car,
will she do it here...

2462
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:10,190
and pick me up quickly?

2463
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:12,390
She needs quick judgments.
She needs to be smart.

2464
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:14,560
But if she lacks that intelligence,

2465
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:16,300
she'll come this way...

2466
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,570
and put the wheels here.

2467
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:21,500
She'll do something strange.

2468
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,840
(How will Driver Ji's judgment be?)

2469
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,340
- Ye Eun.
- You're nearly there.

2470
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,540
- We're here.
- Seriously.

2471
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:27,910
- You're nearly there.
- Someone is there.

2472
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:29,310
- I see people.
- I think she's here.

2473
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:31,010
Isn't it the white car?

2474
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,080
- In this situation,
- It's Se Chan.

2475
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,280
- turn on the hazard lights.
- Turn on the hazard lights.

2476
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:37,480
- Slow down.
- Drive slowly.

2477
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,550
What will you do?

2478
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:39,920
Let's see.

2479
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:41,920
She'll stop here or go in that way.

2480
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:46,890
(Will Ye Eun be smart
and make a right turn?)

2481
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,360
What will she do?

2482
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,370
No! See?

2483
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:53,530
(She just approaches him.)

2484
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:54,670
Ye Eun.

2485
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:55,940
- Go.
- This is driving me crazy.

2486
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,400
- Which way?
- To the side.

2487
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,510
Come this way. Look at this.

2488
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:01,070
Hey!

2489
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,080
She put the tire here.

2490
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,980
- There's a car behind.
- You should make way.

2491
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,350
- You should have stopped there.
- You should have stopped there.

2492
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:09,120
- Hold on.
- The lock button.

2493
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,150
- Where is the lock?
- How will he open the door?

2494
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:11,180
Unlock the door.

2495
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,490
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

2496
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:13,550
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go quickly.

2497
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:14,750
Are you all right?

2498
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,290
- How are we doing?
- I'm sorry.

2499
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,490
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go quickly.

2500
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:20,890
(Ye Eun's tip as a noob driver:
It's best to apologize pitifully.)

2501
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:22,200
Let's see, Ye Eun.

2502
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,630
- This is crazy.
- Don't get anxious.

2503
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:25,370
- Turn the wheel.
- You shouldn't get anxious.

2504
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:27,070
- You can go.
- Check the pedestrian road.

2505
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:28,540
- Right. Good.
- Stop.

2506
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:30,500
Okay. Good.

2507
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,510
Now. Good.

2508
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:34,110
- She's doing okay.
- Well done.

2509
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:35,640
- It's okay, right?
- Good going.

2510
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,110
- She's good. Next.
- She's good.

2511
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:38,310
- Yes.
- Next.

2512
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:39,380
The second one.

2513
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,350
- The one in front is also a noob.
- The one in front is also a noob.

2514
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:42,720
There are noobs everywhere today.

2515
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,820
- It's the day for noobs.
- All the noobs...

2516
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,650
- of this neighborhood are out.
- Nice. This place is nice.

2517
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,220
- Good job.
- Did you teach her well?

2518
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:49,220
How was she?

2519
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:50,290
- Pick up?
- Pick up.

2520
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:51,990
- She's good.
- She's good.

2521
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:54,030
- She's good.
- She's okay. Ye Eun...

2522
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:56,660
was taught in the Spartan way by us.

2523
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:59,070
- Yes.
- But it gets a little sweaty.

2524
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,300
I do.

2525
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:03,240
- When I sat next to her.
- It's a general thing.

2526
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,070
- We turned on the air conditioner.
- The air conditioner is on.

2527
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:06,110
(Noob Driver)

2528
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:08,210
(Ye Eun was still in an emergency.)

2529
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:09,240
- We turned on the air conditioner.
- Let's turn this off now.

2530
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,280
(Emergency lights)

2531
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,510
I shouldn't do that.

2532
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:14,350
You have to go straight.

2533
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:16,520
- You're doing well.
- Could you turn it up a level?

2534
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:19,620
Seriously. Are they even coming?

2535
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:20,920
(He gets impatient
and tries to call Daniel.)

2536
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,090
Goodness.

2537
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:25,060
- You have to focus on the road.
- Four people...

2538
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:26,630
- Daniel.
- Yes, Seok Jin.

2539
01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:28,760
Hurry up.

2540
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:30,830
We'll go there on a roller coaster.
Please wait.

2541
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:32,400
I guess you're doing fine, though.

2542
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,800
It's like a safe roller coaster.

2543
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:34,800
- Really?
- That's how it feels.

2544
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,700
Yes.

2545
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:39,240
- Hey.
- Watch out!

2546
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,940
- You have to turn on the indicator.
- Yes.

2547
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:42,910
(There's enough space.)

2548
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:45,110
- It's okay. Go.
- Be careful.

2549
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:47,880
(The passengers are making a fuss.)

2550
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:50,750
(He's the only one
who remains calm.)

2551
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:52,150
- Be careful.
- Don't do that.

2552
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:53,520
- Okay. It's okay.
- Hold on.

2553
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,120
- Hold on.
- You should tell her.

2554
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,260
- You should tell her.
- Instructor!

2555
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:00,690
- Go. Okay, don't worry.
- Don't do that.

2556
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:02,100
- Go. It's okay.
- Instructor!

2557
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,760
- Instructor!
- It's really okay.

2558
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,640
(Mr. Yu ignores the complaints
from the back seats...)

2559
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,270
(and comforts Ye Eun.)

2560
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:11,440
- You did well.
- Step on the brakes.

2561
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,110
- Do you see us?
- Where are you?

2562
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:14,440
- He's here.
- Yes.

2563
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,840
- Just get in quickly.
- Okay.

2564
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,010
Get in quickly.

2565
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:18,210
- You can park on the side...
- End the call.

2566
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:19,380
- like you did earlier.
- It's okay.

2567
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:20,610
You can't go over it.

2568
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,420
Here!

2569
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:25,350
Here!

2570
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,190
- You can keep going forward.
- Keep going.

2571
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:28,460
- Turn on the emergency lights.
- Don't stop all at once.

2572
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:30,490
- Don't stick to the side too much.
- Keep going.

2573
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:32,330
- Keep going.
- Go to the other side.

2574
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:33,360
- Keep going.
- Go.

2575
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,260
- There you go.
- You got too close.

2576
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,500
- Go a bit more.
- Right.

2577
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:37,730
- Go further. Cars could be turning.
- Stop!

2578
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:39,130
- That's enough.
- Stop moving!

2579
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:40,500
- That's enough.
- Put it on P.

2580
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,700
- Goodness.
- Unlock the door.

2581
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,970
You should lock it to open.
Unlock it. That's right.

2582
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,270
Ye Eun.

2583
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:47,810
- Calm down.
- Well done.

2584
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:49,910
- Ye Eun!
- Be quiet.

2585
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:52,110
- Why?
- She heard many things from us.

2586
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:54,110
- We have to close the door.
- You two were in Mapo-gu.

2587
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,220
- Right.
- You should close the door, Ye Eun.

2588
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:56,320
Yes. The door should be closed.

2589
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,020
- Please close the door.
- You should close it.

2590
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:59,420
- Okay.
- You can close it.

2591
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:00,720
- Why...
- Then...

2592
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,020
- Why are you asking her to do it?
- Why did you do that?

2593
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,260
- I mean...
- What are you doing?

2594
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:06,090
He's a really weird guy.

2595
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:08,330
- I mean...
- You should close the door.

2596
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:09,760
You have to teach her harshly.

2597
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,200
- No.
- Should I go now?

2598
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,500
- Seok Jin.
- You're too soft.

2599
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:13,500
- You shouldn't do it like that.
- Check the left.
- Really?
- It's dangerous.

2600
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,740
- I'm going now.
- You're too soft.

2601
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:16,840
Check the left
and turn on the indicator.

2602
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,900
- Really?
- The left...

2603
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:20,340
(Driving)

2604
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:22,210
(Exclaiming)

2605
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:23,340
- Don't do that!
- Go slowly.

2606
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:24,480
Don't do that!

2607
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:25,980
- Go slowly.
- Slowly.

2608
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,110
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

2609
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:28,420
- You're doing well.
- These guys.

2610
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:29,620
- She's doing well.
- Go slowly.

2611
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:30,820
- I told you not to do that.
- Keep going.

2612
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,090
- It's okay.
- That was correct.

2613
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:33,120
- Yes.
- Well done.

2614
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,290
- You're doing well now.
- Nice.

2615
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:36,090
- Good job. You're too far right.
- Ye Eun, you...

2616
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:37,960
- Good.
- You're too close.

2617
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:40,490
- Instructor Kim!
- It's good now.

2618
01:22:40,490 --> 01:22:42,960
- Yes.
- Good. You're doing well.

2619
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:45,030
- We have to turn here.
- We will turn right.

2620
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:47,470
- Turn right again?
- We'll go where that car is going.

2621
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:48,800
- Are we going in?
- We're almost there.

2622
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,900
- Turn right here.
- Careful, it's a police station.

2623
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,000
- A police station?
- You should be careful.

2624
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,670
- A police station?
- Make a large turn.

2625
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:53,670
- Go in here.
- Okay.
Have you ever driven in an alley?

2626
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:55,710
- No. It's my first time.
- She hasn't.

2627
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:56,710
Then why are you going in?

2628
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:57,910
- Where are we?
- We have to go this way.

2629
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:59,110
-Tell her not to go in...
- What is this?

2630
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:00,610
- if possible.
- Is this the right place?

2631
01:23:00,610 --> 01:23:02,280
It would be troublesome
if she went the wrong way.

2632
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:03,820
- If you drive here...
- The directions are weird.

2633
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:05,490
- Guys!
- Yes?

2634
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:06,820
- Please be quiet!
- It's weird.

2635
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,490
It will get difficult
if she enters the alley.

2636
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:09,890
- Where are we?
- Please be quiet!

2637
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:11,290
- It's weird.
- Is this Mapo-gu?

2638
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:12,890
- Go to the right.
- You should drive on the right.

2639
01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:14,660
- Go to the right.
- This is driving me crazy.

2640
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:15,830
- To the right, Ye Eun.
- When you're driving,

2641
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:17,000
- Be careful.
- watch out for people. Go right.

2642
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,100
- That's right.
- The lady.

2643
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,100
- Stick to the right.
- That's right.

2644
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,000
- It's fine now.
- Please shut your mouth!

2645
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,870
- Okay. We'll be quiet.
- Please shut your mouth!

2646
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:25,440
(I'm sorry.)

2647
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,470
- Be quiet.
- Thirty years of experience.

2648
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:29,110
- Is it this one?
- He's here.

2649
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:30,380
- Haha is here.
- He's here.

2650
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:32,250
- Where is Ji Hyo?
- Here it is.

2651
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:33,750
- Right.
- Come to the back, Seok Jin.

2652
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:35,350
- I'll go to the back.
- How will we all sit in here?

2653
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:37,080
- I'll go behind.
- Seok Jin should come behind too.

2654
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,120
- I'll go to the back.
- I just need to get one more.

2655
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,290
- Focus.
- Come to the back.

2656
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:40,620
- Ye Eun!
- Yes?

2657
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:41,790
Did you come from Busan?

2658
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:43,720
- Ye Eun is doing well.
- Hey.

2659
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,090
Ye Eun.

2660
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:47,190
- Ye Eun is doing well.
- She's not that bad.

2661
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:49,530
- We have one person left.
- Is it the last one?

2662
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:50,900
Yes. The last one.

2663
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,130
- Ji Hyo.
- She was at the SBS building.

2664
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:54,470
- Where?
- She is in the basement.

2665
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:56,900
- SBS?
- The basement of SBS?

2666
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,870
- It's hard to drive down there.
- Even good drivers struggle.

2667
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:01,240
- The passage is narrow.
- Even managers hit the walls there.

2668
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,380
Even managers hit the walls there.
You must know about it.

2669
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:04,740
It's too difficult there.

2670
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,910
- You can't go down there.
- You can't go down there.

2671
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:08,010
(Will Ye Eun be able to go there
and pick up Ji Hyo?)

2672
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:10,350
Many people use this road, Ye Eun.

2673
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:11,680
So be more careful.

2674
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:14,190
You've gotten a bit used to this.
So just trust yourself and go.

2675
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:16,560
- You're good, Ye Eun.
- She's good. Ye Eun drives well.

2676
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,360
- She improved on the way, right?
- She did.

2677
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:19,930
- She's good.
- She's good.

2678
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,490
She got much better.

2679
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:22,930
- Where is it?
- It's here.

2680
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:24,400
- It's this one.
- I'll go.

2681
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,600
- Go to that P sign.
- I'll go.

2682
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,000
- Go.
- Not here. Over there.

2683
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,170
- We're going to the basement.
- I'll go.

2684
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:29,240
- Right.
- The black P sign.

2685
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:30,270
- Okay.
- You should start...

2686
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:31,640
- The people should cross.
- turning right.

2687
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,870
- The people should cross.
- Let the pedestrians pass.

2688
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:34,940
- Enter.
- Let them go.

2689
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,510
That's right.

2690
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:38,450
Well done.

2691
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:40,750
- Well done.
- Let's go.

2692
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:42,650
Is it your first time entering it?

2693
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:43,820
- It's okay. Go straight.
- Yes, of course.

2694
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:44,980
- Okay.
- It's my first time driving.

2695
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:45,990
- Okay.
- It's her first time driving.

2696
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:47,290
- Be confident.
- Okay.

2697
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:48,460
You don't need to step
on the gas pedal.

2698
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:49,490
- Yes.
- Just step on the brake pedal.

2699
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:51,620
- Step only on the brake pedal.
- Only the brake pedal.

2700
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:52,790
- You're doing well.
- That's right.

2701
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:54,430
- Right. Good.
- Good girl.

2702
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:55,730
- Did you step on the brakes?
- Well done.

2703
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:58,430
- That's right.
- Good job. She's pretty and good.

2704
01:24:58,430 --> 01:24:59,970
- How is she so good?
- That's right.

2705
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,970
(Exclaiming)

2706
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,070
It's like riding
The Adventures of Sinbad.

2707
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:06,710
- That's right.
- Goodness.

2708
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:08,610
- You can go a bit further.
- Wait.

2709
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:09,610
- That's right.
- Goodness.

2710
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:11,280
- You don't need to step on it.
- Okay.

2711
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,750
- That's right.
- Check to your left.

2712
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,180
Turn on the lights when it's dark.

2713
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:15,680
- Wait, did you turn on the lights?
- Where are the lights?

2714
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,750
Where are the lights?

2715
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,550
- Did you turn on the lights?
- Isn't it automatic?

2716
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:19,790
- You have to turn on the lights.
- The lights.

2717
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:21,290
- No.
- You have to turn on the lights.

2718
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:23,320
(She turned on
the windshield wiper.)

2719
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,890
- Not the windshield wiper.
- That's a windshield wiper.

2720
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:26,490
- The lights are not on.
- The wiper...

2721
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:27,490
- The wiper is getting faster.
- Please turn it off.

2722
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:28,500
- Not the windshield wiper.
- Please turn the wipers off.

2723
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,100
- It's not in automatic mode.
- Where am I?

2724
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,760
- Just step on the brake pedal.
- Keep going.

2725
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,500
I think I stepped
on the orange line.

2726
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,100
- It's okay.
- It's okay. That much is fine.

2727
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,640
- The car in front is waiting.
- There's a car coming out.

2728
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,000
- What is it doing?
- A car is coming out.

2729
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,610
- Don't get scared.
- You can just go.

2730
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:40,670
- Let's go.
- We have to go first.

2731
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:41,740
- We go first.
- Right. It's...

2732
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:44,280
- just the same as on the roads.
- Okay.

2733
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:45,580
Your right foot has to be
in the middle.

2734
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:46,610
I don't think she can enter here.

2735
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:47,610
Of course.

2736
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:49,020
- Stick to the right.
- This is really tough.

2737
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:50,180
She can do this.

2738
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:52,550
- I'll stop here.
- Yes. Stop.

2739
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:54,390
- She can't go here.
- I can't go here.

2740
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:55,920
- I have to get the car out.
- I parked it.

2741
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,290
Get it out, Jae Seok.

2742
01:25:57,290 --> 01:25:58,760
- Well done, Ye Eun.
- Goodness.

2743
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,290
- Well done.
- Well done.

2744
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:02,300
- You did well.
- Well done.

2745
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:04,560
Observe how others drive now.

2746
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,700
Are you going to go down?

2747
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:09,340
You have to drive
while looking at the right tip.

2748
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:11,800
- It's really tough.
- It just goes to the left.

2749
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,910
- It's really tough here.
- They built it wrong.

2750
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:16,110
- It was wrongly built.
- It was really built wrong.

2751
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:17,880
Tell Ji Hyo to come
to basement level two.

2752
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,210
- Okay.
- Do that.

2753
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:21,610
Come to basement level two.

2754
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:23,520
- Going out could be easier.
- Come to basement level two.

2755
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,950
- Will I be driving out?
- Now...

2756
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:26,920
- You could try going out.
- Yes. Ye Eun...

2757
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,120
Try going out. You can do that.

2758
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,820
Try it.

2759
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:32,230
- Well done.
- Okay.

2760
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:34,890
Does anyone want to go
to the bathroom?

2761
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:36,200
- The bathroom?
- The bathroom.

2762
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:37,830
- I'll go as well.
- I guess you all wet your pants.

2763
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:39,730
- I should go.
- I should go.

2764
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:42,170
- I should go out.
- Are you going as well?

2765
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:43,540
I should go.

2766
01:26:44,370 --> 01:26:45,910
(Exclaiming)

2767
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:47,710
Hold on.

2768
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:50,610
(Exclaiming)

2769
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,510
(He gets out of the car strangely
with his limbs that were folded.)

2770
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,450
(He goes past the bathroom.)

2771
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:02,390
Where is it? Where did they go?

2772
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,690
Where is the bathroom?

2773
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:08,190
Where is the bathroom?

2774
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:10,030
(He circles around the bathroom
that's right in front of him.)

2775
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,770
Where is the bathroom?

2776
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:14,630
- It's here. Where are you going?
- It's here?

2777
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:16,870
- Where did you go?
- I circled around.

2778
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:19,170
- Seriously.
- It's here.

2779
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:20,210
Are you all right, Daniel?

2780
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:21,540
You're here.

2781
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,410
- Ji Hyo.
- Did you not cry?

2782
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:24,540
- Ji Hyo!
- Did you not cry?

2783
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:25,680
- I didn't cry.
- Are you all right?

2784
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:27,180
Her hands are cold.

2785
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:29,120
This is the last part.

2786
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,480
- Is it the last one?
- Drive-throughs are hard.

2787
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,120
- It's not hard.
- Drive-throughs are hard.

2788
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,420
Which drive-through are we going to?

2789
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:36,620
- There are places.
- Starbucks?

2790
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:38,290
- It's there.
- There was one.

2791
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:39,830
- Okay.
- Now...

2792
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:40,830
The lights are on, right?

2793
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:43,830
- The lights.
- It takes 18 minutes.

2794
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:45,630
- I thought she was swearing.
- Me too.

2795
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:48,500
I thought you were swearing.

2796
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,740
- Hey.
- What's wrong with you?

2797
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,270
- I thought you were swearing.
- Ye Eun.

2798
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:53,910
- I was shocked.
- No.

2799
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:55,210
- Seriously.
- It said it took 18 minutes.

2800
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:56,540
I was really shocked.

2801
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:58,480
- I was shocked.
- You shocked us.

2802
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,210
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

2803
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:01,810
- But...
- It's a really difficult course.

2804
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:03,720
- Can you go out?
- You have to be careful.

2805
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,120
Going out isn't easy.

2806
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,520
- It's not easy.
- Just do it comfortably.

2807
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,520
- Right.
- Where is it?

2808
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,460
- To the right.
- To the right.

2809
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:12,330
- Make a big turn.
- No!

2810
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:13,830
- Make a big turn.
- Go to the left.

2811
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:15,760
- You'll scratch it.
- A big turn.

2812
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,230
- We have to watch carefully.
- Go back and do what I told you.

2813
01:28:17,230 --> 01:28:18,630
- It's difficult here.
- Reverse.

2814
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:19,970
- You have to fold it.
- Go back and forth.

2815
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:21,870
- Turn the wheel.
- Go back and forth.

2816
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:23,340
- Turn it to the maximum.
- Turn it to the maximum.

2817
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,000
- Like this...
- Enough. Now,

2818
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,140
- Make a big turn.
- go straight. Don't turn it!

2819
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:27,170
- Don't turn it.
- Don't turn it.

2820
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:28,240
- It will get scratched.
- You shouldn't turn it.

2821
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:29,710
- Keep going straight.
- Go.

2822
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:31,540
- Go straight.
- Go straight.

2823
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:32,980
- Enough.
- You should go further.

2824
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:34,080
It's okay. You can go.

2825
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,350
- Really?
- That's why...

2826
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,920
- Wait.
- It's not okay!

2827
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:40,390
Jae Seok, it's not okay!

2828
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:42,290
- Why are you saying it's okay?
- Jae Seok, it's really not okay.

2829
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:44,320
- We're the ones back here.
- Hey, look.

2830
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,630
Hey, look.

2831
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:47,430
- There's plenty of space here. See?
- No, there isn't!

2832
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:49,060
- There's plenty of space.
- No.

2833
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:51,000
- There's plenty of space.
- Look. Plenty of space.

2834
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,470
- There's plenty of space.
- It's just fine.

2835
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:54,470
- There's plenty of space.
- Look. Plenty of space.

2836
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:56,640
- Then, what was that sound earlier?
- It's plenty of space.

2837
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:57,970
- What are you saying?
- Look at this.

2838
01:28:57,970 --> 01:28:59,440
- There's plenty of space here!
- There is!

2839
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:00,940
- It's plenty of space!
- What was that sound, then?

2840
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:02,410
- Okay. I just heard a sound.
- What's wrong with you?

2841
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:03,910
- Calm down.
- No.

2842
01:29:03,910 --> 01:29:06,250
- We heard a sound.
- You should later.

2843
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:08,080
But it felt a little different
in the back seat.

2844
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,450
- Yes, it was kind of scary here.
- Right.

2845
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,950
- You're doing well.
- This side.

2846
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:14,550
But Ye Eun knows
how to turn nice and wide.

2847
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:16,020
- Gosh, of course.
- She's doing well.

2848
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:17,590
- Ye Eun, you're so...
- You're doing great!

2849
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:18,960
- Yes, you're doing well now.
- Good job.

2850
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,030
You have talent.

2851
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,460
- Not bad.
- You're like a car racer.

2852
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:24,000
- Gosh, this feels like a Bentley.
- Hey, I'm going to take a nap.

2853
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,470
The ride feels as smooth
as a Bentley.

2854
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:27,830
Hey, anyone with insomnia
would sleep in this car.

2855
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:29,400
Hey, we have to cross the bridge.

2856
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,140
- We have to cross the bridge.
- Yes, we do.

2857
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,170
- And...
- It's fine. Ye Eun is good.

2858
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:35,270
- when you cross the bridge,
- Yes?

2859
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:36,880
if you get flustered
and turn the handle abruptly,

2860
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,710
we'll fall off the bridge, so...

2861
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:41,280
- Gosh, Daniel.
- Daniel.

2862
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,050
- Hey, you're really going that far?
- Come on. She's not that bad.

2863
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:44,450
- She wouldn't do that.
- Gosh, seriously.

2864
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:45,690
You see it on the news.

2865
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:46,820
- You know, like going...
- I'm not that bad.

2866
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:48,420
My driving skills aren't that bad.

2867
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:49,660
- But today,
- She'll be fine.

2868
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:51,820
your driving skills
will improve a lot.

2869
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:53,390
- You'll get so much better.
- You'll be so good by today.

2870
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:55,730
- A lot better.
- Ye Eun, we're on a bridge now.

2871
01:29:55,730 --> 01:29:57,130
- It's your first bridge.
- Oh, nice.

2872
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:58,200
- Your first bridge.
- This is...

2873
01:29:58,300 --> 01:29:59,770
- Ye Eun's first bridge.
- My gosh.

2874
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,170
- Gayang Bridge.
- Gayang Bridge.

2875
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:03,970
- Look out for her.
- Oh, she's doing well.

2876
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:05,610
- That was a good lane change.
- That was so smooth.

2877
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:07,710
- That was great just now.
- Ye Eun, that's how you do it.

2878
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:09,140
- Good job.
- That was really smooth.

2879
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,010
- Hey, I'm going to take a nap.
- Enjoy it.

2880
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:12,750
- Enjoy the ride.
- Okay.

2881
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:15,520
- We're almost there.
- Almost there.

2882
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:17,020
Hey, it's that red building there.

2883
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:19,120
- Yes, it's here.
- This is it. Okay.

2884
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,290
- That won't work.
- No.

2885
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,020
- No.
- Wait.

2886
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,660
- I'm watching.
- Unwind the wheel.

2887
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:24,860
- Unwind the handle a bit.
- Okay, go.

2888
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:26,030
- You're almost there.
- Go in.

2889
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:27,430
- Unwind and go.
- There you go.

2890
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:28,830
(She made the turn in one go!)

2891
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:29,860
(That was awesome!)

2892
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:31,200
There. She's all set.

2893
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,600
- Okay!
- She did it.

2894
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,430
(Crying)

2895
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:36,140
- Ji Ye Eun!
- Little Ji!

2896
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:37,840
- Ji Ye Eun!
- Let's order.

2897
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,170
- Go to the left a bit.
- Ji Ye Eun!

2898
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:40,570
- Open the window.
- That's it!

2899
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:42,780
- That's it.
- Let's order.

2900
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:45,080
- Keep your foot on the brake.
- Okay.

2901
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:46,680
- Hello!
- Hello.

2902
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:48,610
- Hello.
- What do you guys want?

2903
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:49,950
I want salty bread.

2904
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:51,980
- I want bread too.
- I want a sandwich!

2905
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:54,150
What is that?
There's a lot of stuff.

2906
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:55,390
Hey, let's eat a bunch of stuff.

2907
01:30:55,390 --> 01:30:57,420
I'd like a choux cream latte
with lots of whipped cream.

2908
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,930
- Oh, what's that sandwich?
- Yes.

2909
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:01,290
Hey, the omelet sandwich.

2910
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:02,830
Chicken sandwich!

2911
01:31:02,830 --> 01:31:04,100
Two chickens and two omelets.

2912
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:05,400
Ham arugula pesto.

2913
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:06,600
Kabocha squash and egg salad.

2914
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,870
Get eight of them.

2915
01:31:07,870 --> 01:31:09,500
Two melting cheese bacon toasts.

2916
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,000
- A total of eight.
- One moment.

2917
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,310
Two kabocha squash
and egg salad sandwiches.

2918
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:15,440
Two chicken sandwiches.

2919
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,210
Two chicken omelet sandwiches.

2920
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:19,110
Two melting cheese bacon toasts.

2921
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:20,750
Two ham arugula pesto.

2922
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:22,720
- Why are you getting so many?
- Get a lot.

2923
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:23,850
Get a lot. It's fine.

2924
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:25,120
- And I had...
- And now, the coffees.

2925
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,220
- the choux cream latte...
- Iced Americano.

2926
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:27,320
with lots of whipped cream.

2927
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:29,160
- Coffee.
- Yes.

2928
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,320
- Coffee.
- Who wants an iced Americano?

2929
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,660
- Me!
- Me.

2930
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:33,860
- That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?
- Just get 1 for everyone.

2931
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:36,300
- Ye Eun, you seem relaxed.
- Two of them are decaf.

2932
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,200
Two decaf iced Americanos.

2933
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,800
- One iced latte.
- One iced latte.

2934
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,940
- And iced Americanos.
- You're doing so well.

2935
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:44,340
- Five of those.
- You're so good at ordering.

2936
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,470
- She's so good at this.
- I told you.

2937
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:49,010
She's so smart
when it comes to food.

2938
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:51,880
- She's amazing with food.
- Gosh, she's so cool.

2939
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,010
- How can her voice get so loud?
- Gosh, her ordering...

2940
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:54,680
- Mango banana blended.
- She's so impressive.

2941
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:56,650
One mango banana blended.

2942
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,190
I think that should be good.

2943
01:31:59,190 --> 01:32:01,220
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

2944
01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:03,260
- But can you go from here?
- Go forward and pay.

2945
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:04,760
- All right. Now, this... Turn wide.
- Turn wide.

2946
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:05,930
This was what we did
at the beginning.

2947
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:07,090
- Keep going.
- There you go.

2948
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:08,530
- Yes, now.
- Good.

2949
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:10,060
- Good job.
- Turn smoothly.

2950
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:11,200
- Oh, you're doing well.
- Don't turn the handle more.

2951
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,530
- Slowly.
- That's good.

2952
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:13,970
- Oh, nice.
- That's good.

2953
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:15,970
- You're doing so well.
- That's great.

2954
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:17,170
- This is it.
- And this is hard too.

2955
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:19,440
- Oh, nice!
- Unwind a bit.

2956
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,970
- That was so good!
- You're really good.

2957
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:23,280
We did this earlier in the morning.

2958
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,780
- Gosh, you're so good!
- We did this in the morning.

2959
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:26,450
- Jimacher!
- A bit to the right.

2960
01:32:26,450 --> 01:32:28,010
- You're totally Jimacher.
- That's it.

2961
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:31,380
- You got too close!
- Don't go too close!

2962
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:33,790
- Don't get too close.
- A bit to the right.

2963
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:35,890
- Oh, my. Why did I do that?
- Okay. You're good.

2964
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:37,090
- Hello.
- Hello.

2965
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:38,160
- Hello.
- Oh, I should pay.

2966
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,260
- I'll pay with this card.
- She's got too close at the end.

2967
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:40,660
- Please give me the receipt.
- We taught her everything.

2968
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:43,060
And Ye Eun, the proof
that you're not nervous is...

2969
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:44,260
What did you order for yourself?

2970
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:45,360
- A choux cream latte.
- That's it.

2971
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,470
- With lots of whipped cream.
- You know that right away.

2972
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:49,500
- You added lots of whipped cream?
- Yes.

2973
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:51,670
You can't do that
if you're too nervous.

2974
01:32:51,770 --> 01:32:53,470
But she must be craving sugar.

2975
01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:54,540
- No, but really...
- My blood sugar level is low.

2976
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:56,140
- She sure is Food Fighter.
- "Two egg sandwiches."

2977
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:57,340
"With lots of whipped cream."

2978
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:59,410
"Two decafs."

2979
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,620
- I'll give you lots of cream.
- Yes, please.

2980
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,020
Yes, please.

2981
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:05,450
Lots of whipped cream.

2982
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:07,420
- I thought you were on a diet.
- Lots of whipped cream...

2983
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:08,590
- My gosh.
- The mango banana...

2984
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:10,220
- Gosh, thank you.
- Okay.

2985
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:11,860
Who ordered the mango banana
and latte?

2986
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:13,560
- I had the iced latte.
- Gosh, look at that.

2987
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:14,630
- I had an iced Americano.
- Here's the iced Americano.

2988
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:15,900
- I had the decaf.
- Iced Americano.

2989
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:17,360
- Which one is the decaf?
- He had a decaf.

2990
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,870
- Decaf.
- Give the two decafs to the back.

2991
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:21,200
- Here comes another latte.
- Latte!

2992
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:22,370
- Latte.
- Latte.

2993
01:33:22,370 --> 01:33:23,740
- Who had this coffee?
- Oh, the choux cream...

2994
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:25,640
- My choux cream latte!
- We have so many left.

2995
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:28,040
- It's like we're going on holiday.
- We're all set.

2996
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:30,610
- There's one more over here.
- Is there another?

2997
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:32,680
- Oh, this is nice.
- We have three in total.

2998
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,480
- I was nervous at first, but now...
- Decaf.

2999
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,950
- We have three extras.
- Ye Eun.

3000
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:37,420
- Gosh, thank you.
- This is so good.

3001
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:39,150
- Thank you.
- Ye Eun.

3002
01:33:39,390 --> 01:33:41,120
- Hey, take this.
- Gosh, that's nice.

3003
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,620
(Ddochi is done refueling.)

3004
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:43,990
My blood sugar levels will refill.

3005
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:46,030
- Give me a piece of bread.
- Okay!

3006
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:47,190
Gosh, why does it smell so good?

3007
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:50,000
- Thank you! Have a good day!
- Good day!

3008
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:52,430
- Are we eating the sandwiches now?
- Yes, let's eat.

3009
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:53,870
- I'm eating now. Give me.
- Go ahead if you want to eat.

3010
01:33:53,870 --> 01:33:55,070
- All right. Here.
- It smells so good.

3011
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:56,870
- You can eat...
- Give me.

3012
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:58,940
- It's safe to eat. It's fine.
- It is.

3013
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:01,210
Ye Eun, I wouldn't be able to eat
if I were nervous.

3014
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:02,980
- But I can eat now.
- I can too.

3015
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:05,010
Our Hotteok... Why did I call you that?
I meant Ye Eun.

3016
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:06,450
This is so delicious.

3017
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:08,150
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- Did you just call her Hotteok?

3018
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:09,680
- Hey, why did you...
- This is good.

3019
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:11,080
Her dog's name is Hotteok.

3020
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,890
This is Food Fighter's
greatest challenge.

3021
01:34:12,890 --> 01:34:14,520
Driving while smelling food.

3022
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,260
I know. It smells so good.

3023
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:17,990
- Ye Eun, do you want a bite?
- I'm fine.

3024
01:34:17,990 --> 01:34:19,360
- Give me one of those.
- Okay.

3025
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,590
- This is...
- When you stop at a light,

3026
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:23,130
- you can eat.
- Jae Seok, just feed her.

3027
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:25,930
- Right.
- I think Ye Eun is really hungry.

3028
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:28,270
- No...
- Feed her bite by bite.

3029
01:34:28,270 --> 01:34:29,670
- I'll feed you.
- Of course, she must be hungry.

3030
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:32,370
- I like that one. With arugula.
- You do? I'm having this one too.

3031
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:33,910
- I like the arugula sandwich.
- Yes.

3032
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,110
(Taking a big bite)

3033
01:34:36,110 --> 01:34:37,210
Food Fighter.

3034
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:40,450
(Hunting for that sandwich)

3035
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:42,050
- Nice, Food Fighter.
- Hey, that was...

3036
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:44,520
I thought she was a predator
charging at me.

3037
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:47,190
- Hey, she almost bit your hand.
- I know.

3038
01:34:47,690 --> 01:34:49,260
- She is Hotteok.
- That was funny.

3039
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:50,490
(A wild Hotteok on the hunt
is a rare sight to see!)

3040
01:34:50,490 --> 01:34:51,520
(Yummy)

3041
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,530
- This is Ye Eun's. This is mine.
- Hey, from the back...

3042
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,000
Ye Eun, slow down for the left turn.

3043
01:34:56,030 --> 01:34:57,730
- She's doing well now.
- Now, she's pretty much...

3044
01:34:57,730 --> 01:35:00,070
- She can do turns just fine now.
- We don't even have to help.

3045
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:01,270
- It's comfortable now.
- She's an expert.

3046
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:02,800
- Gosh, that's nice.
- Good.

3047
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:03,840
(She can even make left turns
while chewing on bread now.)

3048
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,600
- That was good. Nice.
- You're doing so well.

3049
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:06,840
She's better than me.

3050
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:08,240
- That was so good.
- Keep going straight.

3051
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:10,910
Hey, you can take another bite here.
It's the perfect timing.

3052
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:12,450
- Ye Eun.
- Give her more.

3053
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:13,780
- A sip of my drink.
- Ye Eun.

3054
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:17,280
Jae Seok, give Ye Eun a bite
as she takes a break.

3055
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,720
Gosh, I have so much to do today.

3056
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,150
- Look at the predator hunt.
- Give me. Yes.

3057
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:22,020
(Roaring)

3058
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:27,930
- I've seen this at the safari.
- Ye Eun, you eat so well.

3059
01:35:28,530 --> 01:35:30,260
I saw this on "Animal Kingdom."

3060
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:32,400
- Ye Eun, you eat so well.
- That's so impressive.

3061
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:36,070
(Watching carefully)

3062
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:39,140
Gosh,
Ye Eun doesn't even touch her food.

3063
01:35:39,370 --> 01:35:41,040
- She just pulls it in.
- Look at that.

3064
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,610
- Like a cow chewing on fodder.
- Right.

3065
01:35:42,610 --> 01:35:44,480
- She's the food fighter, indeed.
- Like a cow eating fodder,

3066
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:46,410
she's churning her mouth.

3067
01:35:46,410 --> 01:35:47,680
(Laughing)

3068
01:35:48,010 --> 01:35:52,520
(Her lower jaw is churning
and chewing.)

3069
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:53,950
- Hey, that's amazing.
- Seriously.

3070
01:35:53,950 --> 01:35:56,160
- That's a rare talent.
- My gosh.

3071
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,790
Focus. That's incredible.

3072
01:35:57,790 --> 01:35:59,330
- The skill of the food fighter.
- That's impressive.

3073
01:35:59,330 --> 01:36:00,390
She doesn't use her hand once.

3074
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:02,090
Like a cow eating fodder.

3075
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:03,600
She's putting on a fodder show.

3076
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,430
- She still has food in her mouth.
- She does.

3077
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:06,500
Watch the fodder show.

3078
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,230
- Fodder show. That's great.
- Look at that.

3079
01:36:08,230 --> 01:36:09,900
- Fodder show.
- How do you do that?

3080
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,770
- Hey, Ji Fodder.
- Look. It's the fodder show.

3081
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:13,910
Not anyone can do that.

3082
01:36:13,910 --> 01:36:16,040
- Gosh, that's amazing.
- Look at that.

3083
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,280
- Food Fighter!
- My gosh!

3084
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,210
- You're doing great!
- Fodder show!

3085
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:22,180
- Gosh, Ye Eun.
- She ate it all at once!

3086
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:23,880
- She ate it all up.
- She gobbled it up.

3087
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,280
(She's done ruminating.)

3088
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,290
- That was like magic.
- Gosh, the fodder show.

3089
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:29,790
- Our food fighter is so amazing.
- How do you do that?

3090
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:32,290
- We're here!
- We've arrived at our destination!

3091
01:36:32,530 --> 01:36:33,690
- She did so well today.
- Okay!

3092
01:36:33,690 --> 01:36:34,730
We survived too!

3093
01:36:34,730 --> 01:36:36,860
- We survived!
- We survived!

3094
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,830
Wake me up when we get there.

3095
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:40,300
Haha, you should wake up now.

3096
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,170
- Okay!
- We survived!

3097
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,500
- Park the car.
- Park.

3098
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:46,040
- You practically already parked.
- Don't get flustered.

3099
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,340
- We survived.
- The parking brake.

3100
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:48,710
- Okay!
- Yes.

3101
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:50,780
- That was great!
- You did it!

3102
01:36:50,910 --> 01:36:53,680
- That was awesome.
- She got here so well.

3103
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,280
- Daniel, we survived!
- My gosh.

3104
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:56,550
We survived, Haha!

3105
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:58,180
- We got here safely.
- For real.

3106
01:36:58,180 --> 01:36:59,820
Gosh, my bottom is so sweaty.

3107
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:01,220
(All 8 members
successfully survived.)

3108
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:02,590
Gosh, Ji Ye Eun...

3109
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:04,790
- Congratulations!
- We hung a banner...

3110
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:06,390
to celebrate your graduation
from being a newbie driver.

3111
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,030
(Ji Ye Eun successfully breaks free
from being a novice driver.)

3112
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:09,260
Good job!

3113
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,860
- Great job!
- You worked hard, Ye Eun!

3114
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,930
- You worked hard, Ye Eun!
- Let's take a picture.

3115
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:15,730
- Let's take a picture.
- Good job!

3116
01:37:15,730 --> 01:37:16,870
- Take a picture, Food Fighter.
- Congratulations!

3117
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:18,640
- Ye Eun, I'll go home in your car.
- Food Fighter!

3118
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,470
(Running Merchant Association is
finally here!)

3119
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:21,870
(Owners of a vintage clothing store)

3120
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:23,540
(The cool girl and guy
from Dongdaemun in the 2000s)

3121
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:26,110
(And the trio who really look like
a merchant association)

3122
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:27,780
(They must find products
that will satisfy their client.)

3123
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:29,350
Who would buy this kind of stuff?

3124
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:30,650
Peculiar people wear these.

3125
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:32,920
Mr. Ji Seong Hwan.

3126
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:36,520
(The Dongdaemun Gang is
full of laughter.)

3127
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,490
- I'm the worst-dressed in Seongsu.
- Hey, mister.

3128
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:42,360
(He takes over Seongsu-dong
with an embarrassing look.)

3129
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:44,460
(They'll have an auction
with the staff for the products they got?)

3130
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:47,800
(They pretty much cry to sell
their products for more money.)

3131
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,130
You look like an old lady.

3132
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:50,770
- How much?
- I bid 2.8 dollars.

3133
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:51,900
