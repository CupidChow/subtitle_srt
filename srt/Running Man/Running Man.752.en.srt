1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,270
The investment king of Pocheon,
famous for his unique investment,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,040
announced
a large-scale investment plan,

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,810
which made startup CEOs
from all over the country...

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,410
gather in Pocheon.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,720
(That's how the startup CEOs
gathered in Pocheon.)

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,650
- Let's go.
- Nice!

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,120
- Let's do this!
- Let's go!

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,120
I'm excited.

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,920
We're good
at attracting investments.

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,860
- Let's go.
- Okay.

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,990
Okay!

12
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,000
You came up quickly alone.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,200
Yes. When I go up a hill,

14
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,100
- Hello.
- I move quickly.

15
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,670
Okay!

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,770
Okay.

17
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,000
(The men in shirts
whom you can easily find in Pangyo)

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,470
I think something is wrong...

19
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,670
- with Seok Jin and me.
- Me? Excuse me.

20
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,210
- I mean...
- What did they tell you?

21
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,110
- I thought he was making a debut.
- The thing is...

22
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,610
- This is...
- Did you tell him...

23
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,720
Are we having
the top four trot singers here today?

24
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,050
- No. Excuse me.
- Are we doing something like that?

25
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,120
- What did you tell my stylist?
- Why...

26
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,650
- What did you say?
- Who called?

27
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,660
- The message...
- Is this a lampshade or what?

28
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,020
- What's that?
- Why are you dressed like that?

29
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,560
- What did you say?
- What?

30
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,830
I thought Michael Jackson was here.

31
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,890
But he's...

32
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,900
- What's this?
- Se Chan and I...

33
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,630
What's this, Seok Jin?
Is this a lampshade?

34
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,700
- What's that?
- It's not a lampshade.

35
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,800
- I'm a startup CEO...
- What's that?

36
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,900
who made a lot of money.

37
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,300
- Really?
- What's that outfit?

38
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,410
These are all jewels.

39
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,910
What does this have to do
with a startup?

40
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,210
- This is about a startup.
- What's that hat?

41
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,610
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

42
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,810
Is this the trot festival?

43
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,880
- No.
- What is the hat for?

44
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,650
- That's not it.
- Are you here for a gig?

45
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,950
- No.
- Is this "The Arabian Nights?"

46
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,550
- We're here for...
- What kind of startup is this?

47
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,620
- It's not like that.
- Why is the back of it open?

48
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,590
- This is actually...
- Why is it open?

49
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,590
- What kind of style is this?
- What is this?

50
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,730
- The designer intended it.
- This is hilarious.

51
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,260
What are you supposed to be, Ye Eun?
What's with your shoulders?

52
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,860
- Why are your shoulders so wide?
- This is fashion.

53
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,100
- It's a fashion choice.
- What is this for?

54
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,400
- This is...
- Ji Hyo and I are on the same team.

55
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,800
She's on a business trip now.

56
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,300
- Ji Hyo is...
- Is she on a business trip?

57
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,770
She is on the wrong way now.

58
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,110
- Really?
- I see.

59
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,780
She's driving around the area now.

60
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,680
- I see.
- I think it's around here.

61
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,110
Ji Hyo didn't come with her manager.

62
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,580
- She insisted on driving.
- She drove herself.

63
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,650
She'll be here soon.

64
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,250
- Ji Hyo is...
- She's finding her way here.

65
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,820
- She's finding her way here.
- Yes.

66
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,850
Do you make something?

67
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,190
I'm in the AI field.

68
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,790
- AI?
- Yes.

69
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,190
AI? What do you do in the AI field?

70
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,630
- What?
- So you mean avian influenza?

71
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,760
What did you say?

72
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,930
So you mean avian influenza?

73
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,960
What did you say?

74
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,270
Do you study avian influenza?

75
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,870
- What is he saying?
- That's what it is, right?

76
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,300
- You look like one.
- What avian influenza?

77
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,600
- You look like it.
- What are you saying?

78
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,810
It must be avian influenza.

79
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,810
- Right.
- Seriously...

80
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,370
So what is it exactly?

81
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,910
There are various businesses
in the AI field.

82
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,410
I make an AI robot
that works as a personal trainer.

83
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,050
- It's a robot.
- I see. A robot?

84
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,880
- Robot.
- So does the robot help you...

85
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,390
- maintain a correct posture?
- No. It just stands there...

86
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,620
- watching you.
- Without touching you?

87
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,360
It criticizes you
if you do it wrong.

88
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,860
(An AI robot that criticizes you)

89
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,190
- The robot does?
- Yes.

90
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,690
- A robot that criticizes you?
- If you don't work out enough,

91
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,700
- it swears at you.
- It has a swearing function.

92
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,230
- Yes. And it mocks you.
- It even mocks you?

93
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,230
- Yes.
- That's interesting.

94
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,570
I work on an AI program...

95
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,270
- that helps entertainers.
- What is it?

96
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,400
It's for variety shows.

97
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,210
- An AI program for variety shows.
- For variety shows?

98
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,870
- It provides funny jokes?
- It does.

99
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,040
- It has an ad-lib AI program.
- It's programmed that way?

100
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,710
- Once you stick it in...
- You can stick it...

101
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,280
in someone boring,
and the person will be funny.

102
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,380
- You're charged with jokes.
- I see.

103
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,880
- You're charged with jokes?
- Seok Jin would need it.

104
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
He would need it.

105
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,980
- It comes up with new ideas?
- It does.

106
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,090
- That's nice.
- If you wear glasses like that,

107
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,720
- it is displayed in the glasses.
- Right away.

108
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,860
While you talk.

109
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,930
- Jokes are put up on the screen?
- That's nice.

110
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,890
While you talk, it shows
the jokes you can tell right away.

111
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,300
- That sounds great.
- Jae Seok, I love the idea.

112
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,800
- It's nice, isn't it?
- It's perfect.

113
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,570
- So I can become like Yu Jae Seok.
- Exactly.

114
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,100
(With Ttuk GPT,)

115
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,210
(I can become like Yu Jae Seok?)

116
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,280
- You can host a TV show.
- No, you can't. It's programmed...

117
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,340
- not to exceed me.
- Really?

118
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,910
- Is that it?
- My gosh.

119
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,310
- Why?
- Not to exceed you?

120
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,420
No. No one can exceed me.

121
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,720
I see. He sounds
a little condescending.

122
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
I know.

123
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,690
What kind of startup company
do you run?

124
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,860
My company is called Exciting Math.

125
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,090
- Exciting?
- Yes.

126
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,930
Why is it called Exciting Math
when it's not exciting at all?

127
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,490
- He's the one who's excited now.
- Hey.

128
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,500
What's so exciting
when you're wearing a black suit?

129
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,400
Young people these days
dress comfortably like this.

130
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,500
- But you're not young.
- You're not a young person.

131
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,870
We all went to the same university.

132
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,300
- What?
- We went to the same university.

133
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,840
What college did you go to?

134
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,740
I went to Seoul National University.

135
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,980
What?

136
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,840
Seoul National University?

137
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,680
- Seoul National University.
- He says he went to SNU.

138
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,910
- He went to SNU.
- Hey, you...

139
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,750
- Tell them you went to SNU.
- We really went to SNU.

140
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,280
- Hey.
- That's really...

141
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,790
- My goodness.
- Seriously,

142
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,190
that is the most shocking joke...

143
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,360
- I've heard this year.
- I know.

144
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,460
He says he went to SNU.

145
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,190
You've become really funny.

146
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,990
I studied in
the Department of Natural Sciences at SNU.

147
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,300
That's not it.

148
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,900
He said he studied in
the Department of Natural Sciences at SNU.

149
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,370
I can do everything.

150
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,270
- Department of Natural Sciences.
- I was...

151
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,670
- in Department One.
- You brat, natural science is...

152
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,800
- I was in Department 1.
- Who was in Department 3?

153
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Department Three?

154
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,210
- He's really smart.
- Now...

155
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,640
Daniel, what kind of startup company
do you run?

156
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,080
- As I told you earlier,
- Exciting Math?

157
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,280
- I run Exciting...
- Exciting Math?

158
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,580
- Why is it exciting?
- It's called Exciting Math.

159
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,120
- Math?
- I teach math.

160
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,150
Math?

161
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,820
(Daniel's math score
on the CSAT is famous.)

162
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,020
(He got 5 points
after solving all the problems.)

163
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,790
- Exciting Math.
- Math?

164
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,860
I teach math.

165
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,990
Math?

166
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,930
I run an academy
for mathematically gifted students.

167
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,500
- He was really smart in school.
- Yes.

168
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,030
- Really?
- Yes.

169
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,500
An academy
for mathematically gifted students?

170
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,940
Yes. I'm the director of an academy
for mathematically gifted students.

171
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,940
- Kim Tae Hee is our alumna.
- Right.

172
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,110
That's not a startup company.
It should be something creative.

173
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,380
- It's a little...
- We teach math...

174
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,010
- in a creative way.
- So it's an education business.

175
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,650
- That's right.
- An education business.

176
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,150
- Education.
- Okay.

177
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,880
- He's really smart.
- We can do everything.

178
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,120
- What about you, Ye Eun?
- Yes.

179
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,790
Well... Shoulder pads.

180
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,120
- Shoulder pads.
- You deal with shoulder pads.

181
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,990
- A shoulder-pad business.
- I see.

182
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,020
She's wearing a jacket
with wide shoulders...

183
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,390
to make her face look smaller.

184
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,130
- No.
- Forget about everything.

185
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,200
I think our company is the only one
worth investing in.

186
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,600
- We're...
- Are you here to buy land?

187
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,200
- No.
- No. This place is...

188
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,730
- Is it a real estate startup?
- Where are we now?

189
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,240
- We're in Pocheon now.
- This is Pocheon.

190
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,940
Pocheon is famous
for Idong galbi, right?

191
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,570
We supply meat.

192
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,040
(A startup that supplies meat?)

193
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,740
- And this is...
- What's that?

194
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,110
- We are...
- What's that?

195
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,880
I'm sorry, but do you not know
what a startup company is?

196
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,750
We supply meat.

197
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,280
- That's not it.
- Are you in the meat business?

198
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,020
We supplied meat until last year.

199
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,490
- Things changed this year.
- So what do you do?

200
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,290
We are developing
an automatic rib deboning machine.

201
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,890
(An automatic...)

202
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,530
(rib deboning machine)

203
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,430
An automatic rib deboning machine?

204
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,870
(That's groundbreaking.)

205
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,300
- I see. That's nice.
- It rolls up a piece of meat...

206
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,800
- and debones it right away.
- I like that.

207
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,270
- We supply all the meat.
- Really?

208
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,770
It's for those with bad teeth.

209
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,140
- It's a deboning machine.
- That sounds amazing.

210
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,810
- Idong galbi.
- It works smoothly.

211
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,250
A rib deboning machine
for Idong galbi.

212
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,410
It suits you. I like the idea
of a deboning machine.

213
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,220
A rib deboning machine
for Idong galbi is...

214
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,850
- Hey.
- A rib deboning machine.

215
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,150
I sell Pocheon makgeolli.

216
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,250
- Makgeolli?
- Yes.

217
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,420
- We should work in collaboration.
- We'd need M and A.

218
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,420
I'd love that.

219
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,660
- What collaboration?
- Collaboration.

220
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,920
- Do you know what M and A is?
- Hey.

221
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,430
- MOU.
- MOU.

222
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,730
We should sign an MOU.

223
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,360
- Collaboration is...
- Collaboration.

224
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,630
MOU stands for
Memorandum of Understanding.

225
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,770
I know.
We'd need some understanding.

226
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,870
- After understanding...
- We need his understanding.

227
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,400
- Understand what?
- Ask for my understanding.

228
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,840
- Thank you for your understanding.
- All right.

229
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,470
- We ask for your understanding.
- I sell Pocheon makgeolli.

230
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,910
- Let's work in collaboration.
- Okay.

231
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,150
You should invest some money.
We're developing the machine.

232
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,150
- We all are businessmen.
- We're developing...

233
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,920
Today, we are...

234
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,150
visiting Pocheon, which has...

235
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,920
various national heritages
including...

236
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,850
- the Prehistoric Landscape Route.
- I see.

237
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,990
I like Pocheon.

238
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,460
There is the Visit Korean
Heritage Campaigngoing on...

239
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,490
where you can get stamps
on your visitor passport...

240
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,130
when you visit
the national heritages...

241
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,800
- that represent our country.
- I see. That's amazing.

242
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,000
It's called
the Visit Korean Heritage Campaign.

243
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,430
- Really?
- That sounds nice.

244
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,170
- This is how the passport looks.
- My gosh.

245
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,870
- It's pretty.
- It looks like a real passport.

246
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,910
- It's like a real passport.
- It's cute.

247
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,910
This is a passport.

248
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,040
- Is this for us?
- It's cute.

249
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,710
Each team can take one.

250
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,650
- One for each team?
- One for each team.

251
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,380
- Now...
- This is nice.

252
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,880
- It looks like a real passport.
- Right.

253
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,480
So the race for today is...

254
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,590
the More You Stamp,
the More Successful You Become.

255
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,890
- Stamp.
- You guys are startup CEOs...

256
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,620
who have gathered
to receive investments...

257
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,090
from the big investor in Pocheon.

258
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,460
You have to collect stamps today...

259
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,800
to increase your chances
of attracting investment.

260
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,470
The two teams that succeed
in attracting investment...

261
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,730
- can happily go home right away.
- Really?

262
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,570
The two teams that fail...

263
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,670
will stay behind
and receive a penalty...

264
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,470
- that requires sweaty efforts.
- I see.

265
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,580
It's hot today.

266
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,280
So we gave each team
a passport today.

267
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,010
Do you see the Y-shaped
suspension bridge behind you?

268
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,180
- Yes.
- That looks scary.

269
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,980
Do you see the Y-shaped
suspension bridge behind you?

270
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,290
(The longest Y-shaped
suspension bridge in Korea)

271
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,590
I really hate that.

272
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,390
I'm scared of this.

273
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,090
I have acrophobia.

274
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,360
On one side
of the suspension bridge...

275
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,960
is Bidulginang Falls.

276
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,500
And on the other side
is the observation deck.

277
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,100
(Each team will choose
between the two places.)

278
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,570
The first National Heritage Stamp
is at one of the two places.

279
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,810
- Really?
- At one of the two places.

280
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,310
Only the team that arrives
at the place...

281
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,510
with the National Heritage Stamp,
not the dud stamp...

282
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,140
will get an additional stamp.

283
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,480
- There's a dud.
- It must be the higher place.

284
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,820
Once you cross the bridge,

285
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,180
- it's over.
- This is a race.

286
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,920
- Once we choose one, it's over?
- Yes.

287
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
It's not like arriving first
gives you an advantage.

288
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,260
- You just have to choose well.
- Let's choose one.

289
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,720
This is all about luck. It's random.

290
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,160
(Putting it back on)

291
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,260
(Taking it off)

292
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,560
Sir, your hair...

293
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,430
It's heavy. The hat is heavy.

294
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,630
- Are you tired?
- Yes. It's heavy.

295
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,270
- Why aren't you wearing it?
- What?

296
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,140
- The one we gave you.
- The wig?

297
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,600
- Yes.
- I'm letting my hair grow...

298
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,670
to have the hairstyle.

299
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,310
You look like Jo Woo Jong
with the wig on.

300
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,310
- Right.
- I know.

301
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,340
You look like Woo Jong.

302
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,410
(Mr. Jee has fallen
for the thick hair of the wig.)

303
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,410
It's okay.

304
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,710
I'll make my hair look like that.

305
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,810
It seems like
the hat is uncomfortable.

306
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,850
Do you want to try this on?

307
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,950
- It's too heavy.
- It's really heavy.

308
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,980
(Groaning)

309
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,620
- It's too heavy.
- I know.

310
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,790
It's really heavy.

311
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,590
There won't be team uniforms today.

312
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,590
- You won't get changed.
- No uniforms?

313
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,990
- Good.
- I like that.

314
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,660
- You can change your hat.
- Change your hat.

315
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,060
- He can't change the hat, right?
- Only the hat.

316
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,200
- He should keep it on.
- No.

317
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,230
I'll change my hat.

318
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,600
- Okay.
- The hat is too noisy.

319
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,770
(The audio engineers
asked him to change the hat.)

320
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,040
That's true. It jingles.

321
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,070
And the cameramen are
reflected on your glasses.

322
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,110
- Okay. I'll change them too.
- His glasses.

323
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,740
- My glasses?
- You don't like them.

324
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,210
I'll change my glasses.

325
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,480
I have them here.

326
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,020
Why don't we change the person?

327
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,420
We can't do that.

328
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,020
- To Woo Jong.
- Okay. Woo Jong sounds nice.

329
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,550
Right. We won't tell the difference.

330
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,060
(Jee-rasoni fights against everyone
today as always.)

331
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,190
I'm sorry.

332
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,690
- I'm sorry.
- You're here, Ji Hyo.

333
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,190
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- It's okay.

334
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,290
All right.

335
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,930
- Why is it so hard to come up here?
- What?

336
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,200
- Seriously...
- That's because...

337
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,370
- you felt nervous on your way here.
- Right.

338
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,870
I was late
because I had to sell some clothes.

339
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,500
You two are wearing the same outfit.

340
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,810
- We're dressed the same.
- The same outfit.

341
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,440
- You two?
- We're wearing matching outfits.

342
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,770
- The same suit.
- Wait.

343
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,980
- Do you sell chanseliers?
- No.

344
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,050
(Chanseliers?)

345
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,180
Ji Hyo.

346
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,080
- Chanseliers?
- Chandeliers?

347
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,650
Jae Seok,
she didn't say chandeliers.

348
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,090
- She said chanseliers.
- Chanseliers.

349
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,590
This is a chanselier.

350
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,990
- I'm out of breath now.
- I understand.

351
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,660
- Why is everyone so...
- Catch your breath.

352
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,890
The opening is over.

353
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,290
- Let's move.
- Let's go. It's hot.

354
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,500
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go.

355
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,700
Wait. Should I bring some water?

356
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,130
I need to drink some water.

357
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,900
Gosh, this is...

358
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,240
- Is this the first one?
- I'm really scared.

359
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,310
Gosh, what's this?
The floor of the bridge has holes.

360
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,110
Ji Hyo, don't look down.

361
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,440
I'm in trouble now.

362
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,250
This is really terrifying.

363
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,780
Stop walking.

364
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,980
I'm feeling it now. The fear.

365
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,150
It's shaking.

366
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,790
I didn't have fear before.

367
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,220
- This is okay.
- My gosh. I'm...

368
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,590
I'm scared of decks with holes.

369
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,720
Gosh, what's this? It has holes.

370
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,290
- This is so scary.
- My goodness.

371
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,860
- What is this?
- Come on.

372
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,900
- Don't move.
- I can see through it.

373
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,900
- Don't jump.
- It has holes.

374
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,200
- I looked down already.
- It's shaking.

375
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,870
- It shook earlier.
- The deck has holes.

376
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,870
- It should shake.
- What?

377
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,070
You should hold on to the rail.

378
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,070
- Don't look down.
- Hold on to the rail.

379
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,170
- Hang on.
- Ji Hyo, don't look down.

380
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,340
- Just go.
- It has holes.

381
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,770
- You shouldn't look down.
- Don't look down.

382
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,870
- I can't go like this.
- It's shaking.

383
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,240
- It's shaking. I'm serious.
- I know.

384
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,840
- It's shaking a lot.
- Oh, no.

385
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,010
- Hang on.
- Hang on.

386
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,580
(They are making a fuss
from the beginning.)

387
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,880
- Gosh, this is no joke.
- I'm so scared.

388
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,680
The bridge is shaking.

389
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,850
This is what's important.

390
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,390
You'll die if you're meant to die
even if you're scared.

391
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,750
And you'll still die
even if you're not scared.

392
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,420
Just stay quiet.

393
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,060
(He hates to hear that.)

394
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,390
This is so scary.

395
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,300
- This is nice.
- What's nice about this?

396
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,500
This is interesting.

397
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,000
Gosh, this feels so strange.

398
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,130
- Why?
- Stop moving.

399
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,600
Keep going straight from here...

400
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,340
and choose
whether to go right or left.

401
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,770
- What do we do?
- On the left side...

402
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,540
- We should go together.
- is Bidulginang Falls.

403
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,840
- I see.
- There's Bidulginang Falls.

404
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,610
- The other is the observation deck.
- The observation deck.

405
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,610
The observation deck.

406
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,850
It's shaking a lot.

407
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,050
- Gosh, look at that.
- What?

408
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,350
It's shaking so hard.

409
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,550
It's shaking too much.

410
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,750
This is shaking a lot.

411
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,350
(The production crew who arrived
at the fork first is surprised too.)

412
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,860
I can't do this.

413
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,090
Between the waterfall
or Iguazu Falls? Say it again.

414
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,190
- The observation deck.
- The observation deck?

415
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,390
- What did you say?
- Iguazu?

416
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,900
- The observation deck.
- He studied natural science.

417
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,960
- I studied natural science.
- That's why.

418
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,030
- We studied natural science.
- We did.

419
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,870
Do you even know
where Iguazu Falls is?

420
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,370
- Exciting Math.
- What?

421
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,440
- Exciting Math.
- Do you know...

422
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,170
where Iguazu Falls is?

423
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,870
- Iguazu Falls.
- You know it's a waterfall, right?

424
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,910
Did you not know?

425
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,940
- Isn't it in Cheonan?
- You know it's a waterfall, right?

426
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,610
(If you stay quiet, no one
will notice that you don't know.)

427
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,250
- Isn't it in Cheonan?
- Uruguay?

428
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,280
(Like her.)

429
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,510
I'm really surprised.

430
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,820
Why can't you smile broadly?

431
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,450
That's because...

432
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,120
- Hey, Ye Eun.
- She has no energy.

433
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,620
- We should let her eat.
- No. I'm...

434
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,990
- She looks so weak.
- You should eat today.

435
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,890
- I'd love to.
- She should eat.

436
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,930
Idong galbi.

437
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,430
You should eat Pocheon Idong galbi.

438
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,500
- You should eat today.
- Idong galbi.

439
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,560
We will debone the meat.

440
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,630
Are you going to perform
at the top of the hill?

441
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,170
How many times
do you have to say that?

442
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,300
- We debone meat.
- Okay.

443
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,400
What?

444
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,440
Let's go up, Seok Jin.

445
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,740
- You must be his manager.
- Yes. No.

446
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,380
- He was his manager.
- No.

447
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,040
- I run a startup.
- I see.

448
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,550
- So he's the manager.
- No, we run a startup.

449
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,480
It's Delicious Rib Deboning Machine.

450
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,550
- It's a startup.
- It's a management agency.

451
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,490
We should go first.

452
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,090
- Where do we go?
- The falls or the observation deck?

453
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,720
- Anyway...
- The falls or...

454
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,790
We should go
to the observation deck.

455
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,990
I bet it's at the observation deck.

456
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,130
- I think so.
- It must be the observation deck.

457
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,660
There's no coffee shop
in front of the falls.

458
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,400
- The falls or the observation deck?
- Well...

459
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,430
Where do we go?

460
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,730
The falls or the observation deck?

461
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,700
- What do we do?
- Where should we go?

462
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,040
Let's go.

463
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,270
- My gosh.
- Seok Jin, the observation deck.

464
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,410
(Team Deboning sets off first
with enthusiasm.)

465
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,380
- What's better? The deck?
- The observation deck.

466
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,810
Should I believe your hunch?

467
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,110
Yes. We should have some coffee
at the observation deck.

468
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,250
Do they have coffee
at the observation deck?

469
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,710
- Of course.
- I see.

470
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,050
The observation deck must have one.

471
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,520
- We should go too.
- Let's go.

472
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,920
- Where do we go?
- Where do we go?

473
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,090
(They all head toward the fork
of the bridge.)

474
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,920
Gosh, the scenery is amazing.

475
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,360
The scenery is beautiful.

476
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,490
- Gosh, it's beautiful. Look.
- Awesome.

477
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,530
This is the Hantan River.

478
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,830
That's right.

479
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,730
This is amazing.

480
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,070
It's beautiful.

481
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,500
Gosh, look at that.

482
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,600
(The beautiful scenery makes them
forget their fear for a moment.)

483
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,770
It's magnificent.

484
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,610
The scenery is beautiful.

485
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,580
- Gosh, it's beautiful. Look.
- Awesome.

486
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,440
This is the Hantan River.

487
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,910
That's right.

488
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,450
- It's shaking. What's going on?
- Don't shake it.

489
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,450
I can't go.

490
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,850
- Don't do it.
- Seriously, don't shake it.

491
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,020
- It might collapse.
- Hey.

492
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,150
- I'm serious.
- Don't do it!

493
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,220
(Why is the bridge shaking
when there's no wind?)

494
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,490
(Kim Jong Kook is working out.)

495
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,690
Gosh, it's shaking.

496
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,990
Kim Jong Kook!

497
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,430
Hey! Stop it!

498
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,330
Jong Kook! Please!

499
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,700
(Jong Kook found a fun way
to work out his lower body.)

500
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,070
- Stop it.
- Hey.

501
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,200
- Don't shake it!
- Stop it.

502
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,600
- Seriously, it will collapse.
- Hey.

503
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,940
- Jong Kook.
- Stop it.

504
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,470
- Don't shake it.
- That's enough.

505
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,140
- I'm getting motion sickness.
- It will collapse.

506
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,340
- I'm serious.
- Hey.

507
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,180
(Singing)

508
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,010
- Don't do that.
- Stop it!

509
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,580
- Don't do that.
- We should hurry.

510
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,010
- We should go fast.
- Just go.

511
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,750
- Go fast.
- Stop it already!

512
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,850
Just go.

513
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,550
- Go quickly.
- Hey!

514
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,920
Seriously... Are you crazy? Hey!

515
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,790
You'll break the bridge.

516
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,990
(After locking up the cowards,
he works out his upper body.)

517
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,890
This is really scary. The horror...

518
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,400
I'm so scared.

519
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,830
Why is he shaking it so hard?

520
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,600
You should hold this, Ji Hyo. Okay.

521
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,100
Why are you shaking it?

522
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,770
Don't do it, Jong Kook!

523
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,870
Honey!

524
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,470
Stop it!

525
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,810
(The participants barely made it
to the fixed area by running.)

526
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,980
Jong Kook is really excited.

527
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,010
He has...

528
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,980
- no one to play with him at home.
- That's true.

529
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,050
- Right.
- I feel bad for Jong Kook.

530
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,220
He has no one to play with him
at home. That's why...

531
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,560
(Feeling pity)

532
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,720
He's having a lot of fun.

533
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,190
- Stop it!
- He should play...

534
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,760
- with his child.
- It's not shaking.

535
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,560
- It's not working.
- Don't do that.

536
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,730
Look over there.

537
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,700
Are Daniel and Haha still there?

538
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,400
What's wrong with him?

539
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,500
That muscular pig.

540
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,000
Seriously, I can't walk.

541
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,740
Why are you shaking it?

542
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,310
How did you end up with me?

543
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,610
I'm such a coward.

544
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,480
I'm not faking it.

545
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,550
- What do we do?
- We have to go. What do we do?

546
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,350
Can you go?

547
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,750
- We can't stay here forever.
- Right.

548
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,950
Darn it. What do I do?

549
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,560
You never imagine
that you'll fall off the bridge.

550
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,230
You don't think there is
even a 0.01 percent chance.

551
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,730
- I'm scared too.
- What? Are you scared?

552
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,360
You're only doing this too
because you get paid.

553
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,700
Haha, let's go.
We'll walk holding hands.

554
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,100
The best thing to do is walk
while looking up at the sky.

555
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,370
- At the sky?
- Come here.

556
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,040
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

557
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,910
- Keep looking up at the sky.
- Okay.

558
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,080
(No one's better than the other.)

559
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,350
- What... Gosh, what do I do?
- It's rocking.

560
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,650
- I looked down.
- I can feel it.

561
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,180
- Don't ever look down.
- Darn.

562
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,390
- Haha, close your eyes.
- Sure.

563
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,520
- Haha, hold the railing.
- I'm keeping my eyes closed.

564
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,960
- Sure.
- I'll let you guide me.

565
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,060
My eyes are closed.

566
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,730
- Let's talk about something funny.
- Sure.

567
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,090
- Like what?
- What has amused you lately?

568
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,200
Hey! Don't do things like that.

569
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,230
- What has...
- Like what?

570
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,100
(He lost his grip on the railing.)

571
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,370
Don't do things like that.

572
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,700
Haha, the sections of the railing...

573
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,040
- Hold on.
- are disconnected. Be careful.

574
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,970
- Hey.
- The railing...

575
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,540
- Why are you so timid?
- The railing.

576
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,940
- Why are you such a chicken?
- It's the railing.

577
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,840
Think that you're filming
for a drama series.

578
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,110
- I see.
- You're playing the role...

579
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,650
- of someone courageous.
- Is that so?

580
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,520
- Get into character.
- Like "Mission: Impossible?"

581
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,420
I have indigestion and want to barf.

582
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,990
What did you have to eat?

583
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,220
- It stinks.
- Hold on.

584
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,190
- I had eggs.
- Eggs?

585
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,490
(The unpleasant smell of eggs
breaks him out of character.)

586
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,590
Where's Haha?

587
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,090
- Is he not coming?
- He's way behind us.

588
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,490
- Really?
- Are you kidding me?

589
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,030
Jong Kook, why don't we
rock the bridge for them?

590
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,360
- Let's do that.
- I'll stand in the middle.

591
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,600
Do you have the courage
to rock the bridge yourself?

592
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,670
- I can't.
- Let's do this.

593
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,300
- I'll do it, Jong Kook.
- Let's do this.

594
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,670
- I'll run to the middle.
- This will be bad for them.

595
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,140
- Jong Kook will rock the bridge.
- In the middle.

596
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,540
Haha won't be able to continue.

597
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,570
Don't!

598
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,310
(Rocking the bridge while humming)

599
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,980
- He rocks it hard.
- This is terrifying.

600
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,440
- Don't!
- Haha.

601
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,780
Don't do it, Jong Kook.

602
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,210
- Hold on.
- Don't you dare.

603
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,620
- Wait. Hold on.
- Don't do this!

604
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,850
- Jong Kook, don't do this.
- Wait.

605
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,350
(He's enjoying it more
this time around.)

606
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,520
I... I'll do better.

607
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,590
- Jong Kook.
- Don't, darn it!

608
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,790
Please don't do this.

609
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,160
(Did their outcries make Jong Kook
stop what he was doing?)

610
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,260
- No way.
- Start on the left.

611
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,730
- One, two, three. To the right.
- Run for it.

612
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,770
- And go.
- It's scary either way.

613
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,000
Follow my lead. To the right.

614
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,700
- We'll all die anyway.
- Right, left, right.

615
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,440
Daniel's hands are going
to cramp up.

616
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,770
- To the right.
- Se Chan.

617
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,440
- Why aren't you scared of this?
- Check it out.

618
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,880
Ji Hyo, can we go
before they rock it some more?

619
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,940
- Yes, let's go.
- We can keep going, right?

620
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,280
- Where are you going?
- What a relief.

621
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,780
- Where are you going?
- Why are you going that way?

622
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,420
(Bidulginang Falls,
Observation Deck)

623
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,150
(Team Ji Hyo
heads to the observation deck.)

624
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,590
- Let's go before it gets rocked.
- Keep walking.

625
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,590
- Seok Jin.
- Yes?

626
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,620
(Seok Jin, to the observation deck)

627
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,690
Do they have coffee
at the observation deck?

628
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,220
Of course. I'm sure of it.

629
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,830
How can an observation deck
not have coffee?

630
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,230
- Exactly.
- Absolutely.

631
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,800
I don't think that's the case
for this one.

632
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,000
The fancier place
might not have any.

633
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,930
We might have better luck
at the other place.

634
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,440
(Bidulginang Falls,
Observation Deck)

635
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,740
(Detective Kook's plausible reasoning)

636
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,570
- Where are you headed?
- The waterfall.

637
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,740
We should head this way.

638
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,640
- Honey, let's go to the waterfall.
- Sure.

639
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,740
- The waterfall.
- Let's go.

640
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,410
- Come on.
- Are you headed to the waterfall?

641
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,380
- No, the observation deck.
- We're going to different places.

642
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,420
- In opposite directions.
- Right.

643
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,220
I'll trust your hunch.

644
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,750
- To the left.
- Hold on.

645
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,050
I looked down again.

646
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,160
- Hold on.
- Only look ahead.

647
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
Where should we go?

648
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,890
The waterfall?
Wouldn't that be scarier?

649
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,490
I don't know.
Let's just hurry and choose.

650
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,960
Wouldn't it be better
to cross this first?

651
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,400
- Are you going to?
- We have to.

652
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,500
- It's not like we can stay here.
- Where are we going?

653
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,570
- Let's avoid Jong Kook.
- We should.

654
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,870
- Come on. Let's run.
- Jong Kook might...

655
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,370
- I want to run.
- Are we running?

656
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,370
Whatever!

657
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,410
- This is terrifying.
- Are you actually running?

658
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,710
(Bidulginang Falls,
Observation Deck)

659
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,280
(Only Team Jae Seok
chose the waterfall.)

660
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,810
- Let's go to the observation deck.
- The observation deck.

661
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,810
We'll choose the obvious option.

662
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,910
(Where is
the National Heritage Stamp?)

663
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,420
- I want to run.
- Are we running?

664
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,450
Whatever!

665
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,420
- This is terrifying.
- Are you actually running?

666
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,220
When you run, the bridge shakes!

667
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,760
- What the...
- My gosh!

668
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,060
Why is it shaking so much?

669
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,990
- It's rocking too hard.
- Stop it.

670
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,160
- It's scary.
- Stop that.

671
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,830
Seok Jin, come on.
It's better to hurry.

672
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,130
I'm getting motion sickness, though.

673
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,030
My gosh.

674
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,670
Let's run for it.

675
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,500
- I can't run.
- Hey!

676
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,740
- I can't run.
- Can you let me through?

677
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,310
- Let me through.
- I can't let go.

678
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,210
I'm only running because I'm scared.

679
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,810
This isn't fun for me.

680
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,110
This is killing me.

681
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,210
(Only he's being chased by fear.)

682
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,580
- Run faster.
- No way.

683
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,780
- I didn't get to do that.
- We're safe now.

684
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,850
We're good.

685
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,820
There's no way we can drop now.

686
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,220
- Seok Jin.
- Yes?

687
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,390
(He wanted to rock the bridge too
which is why he's trying it.)

688
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,560
- What are you doing?
- What is this?

689
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,820
- Don't be so mean.
- What's the matter with you?

690
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,390
- That's so mean!
- Come on.

691
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,730
(He wanted to rock the bridge too
which is why he's trying it.)

692
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,360
It's rocking too hard.

693
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,100
- This...
- My gosh!

694
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,270
- What is it?
- Goodness.

695
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,930
- Well...
- What's the matter with you?

696
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,370
The railings are disconnected.

697
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,640
What's the matter with you?

698
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,610
I can't believe you.

699
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,610
It's rocking too hard.

700
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,010
Coming through.

701
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,440
Don't rock the bridge.

702
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,880
The railings are disconnected.
They act like traps.

703
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,080
These are like traps.

704
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,150
(The more we see him,
the more we realize he's flimsy.)

705
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,450
This is no joke.

706
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,590
One, two, one...

707
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,160
Three. Three times six is eighteen.

708
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,330
And 4 times 9 is 36. Okay.

709
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,400
- Get here faster!
- Fine. I'm coming.

710
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,560
You're not as scared
as you used to be.

711
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,830
I'm fine with things like this.

712
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,200
Did being on the Nevis Swing
help you?

713
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,340
- I'm okay with bridges like this.
- The Nevis Swing?

714
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,940
That was way scarier.

715
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,370
Daniel, you're safe now.
You can look down.

716
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,140
- Daniel.
- Look down.

717
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,210
- He's just as terrified.
- He's chicken too.

718
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,310
I love that about him.

719
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,110
- I don't look as pathetic.
- Right?

720
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,150
Look at him.

721
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,620
Please air the footage
of me running.

722
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,480
- It was courageous of me.
- My goodness.

723
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,850
That wasn't easy.

724
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,320
- Still...
- Look at him sweating.

725
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,260
- If he got on the Nevis Swing...
- This wasn't too bad.

726
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,020
- Get him on the Nevis Swing.
- Let's have him ride it.

727
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,730
(Daniel wipes his sweat,
having barely made it.)

728
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,890
- Pick up the pace!
- This is as thrilling...

729
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,000
as an amusement park ride.

730
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,300
- I can't get on those rides.
- Goodness.

731
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,500
- My shoulders are cramping up.
- Ji Hyo, I want coffee.

732
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,940
Why would you say that
out of the blue?

733
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,040
(She wants to eat and drink
even though she's scared.)

734
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,570
- I also want patbingsu.
- My gosh.

735
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,740
She wants coffee and patbingsu.

736
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,110
- Can you believe it?
- Green tea patbingsu.

737
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,710
(Meanwhile,
Jong Kook enjoys the view.)

738
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,220
Goodness. Check out the view.

739
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,220
I can't say that I'm fond...

740
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,020
of high places.

741
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,590
But I have faith in structures...

742
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,630
that were built to last
with sturdy materials.

743
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,560
I'm not a fan of bridges
that weren't properly made...

744
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,900
and am scared of them.

745
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,170
See how sturdy this is, though.

746
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,370
You can see the science
and technology behind it.

747
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,540
Check this out.
Do you see these thick cables?

748
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,510
It's all based on technology,
and it's safe.

749
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,010
Anyway, this place is great.
It's worth visiting.

750
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,980
Goodness.

751
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,780
(Where is Jae Seok, his partner?)

752
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,220
It'd be nice
to bring my parents here.

753
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,790
(He's being chased
by his own demon too.)

754
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,730
What are you doing? Just walk.

755
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,000
(A strategy that works with cowards)

756
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,760
This is too scary.

757
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,970
I'm terrified.

758
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,740
(But unlike Haha,
Jae Seok is actually really fast.)

759
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,210
Hey, here it is.

760
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,040
Look.

761
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,140
It's here.

762
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,750
Is it the stamp?

763
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,380
They all went the other way.

764
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,180
No way. This is crazy.

765
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,990
(Nice)

766
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,460
He's pleased.
Check out his reaction.

767
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,730
He's happy. See?

768
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,190
Check out his reaction.

769
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,860
I saw your reaction from down there.

770
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,900
Really?

771
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:40,930
Is it the actual stamp?

772
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,200
- Is it the stamp?
- I think it is.

773
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,170
Please open the passport
to the page for Pocheon...

774
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,070
- No way.
- and stamp your passport.

775
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,040
- Okay.
- This is great.

776
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,640
I have a good feeling...

777
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,640
- about this day.
- This is great.

778
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,750
See?

779
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,710
What did I tell you?
It wouldn't be...

780
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,880
at the fancier place.

781
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,620
We're going to the waterfall.

782
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,920
(Only Team Jae Seok
found it plausible to come here.)

783
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,650
This was great though.
It was a nice workout.

784
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,720
(Stamped)

785
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,130
(Is this the actual stamp?)

786
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,260
- Darn.
- Is it not the one?

787
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
(Dud!)

788
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,640
Why were you happy about this?

789
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,070
(He made a huge fuss
without realizing it was a dud.)

790
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,370
But there was a stamp here.

791
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,810
This was a dud.

792
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,440
You failed to obtain
the National Heritage Stamp.

793
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,280
- Why were you happy about this?
- Darn.

794
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,280
This isn't your first rodeo.

795
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,780
But there was a stamp here.

796
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,420
Still.

797
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,590
To be honest,
I wanted to head the other way.

798
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,090
You said we should come here.

799
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,660
I wanted to head the other way.

800
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,790
And we're the only ones here.

801
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,760
Unbelievable.

802
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,260
Why did we have to come here?

803
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,470
(While Jae Seok and Jong Kook
blame each other)

804
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,070
Is the real stamp over there?

805
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,800
Most of us are here.

806
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,400
Did only one team go that way?

807
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,470
- Stamp the passport.
- Here?

808
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,940
(Team Seok Jin
stamps their passports first.)

809
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,080
- Let's do this.
- There are two.

810
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,210
- We need the Pocheon stamp.
- Please let it be it.

811
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,880
- Nice!
- Nice!

812
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,690
(They obtained
the National Heritage Stamp!)

813
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,450
(The stamps are actually
at the national heritage sites.)

814
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,920
- It's the observation deck!
- Okay.

815
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,860
We're off to a good start.

816
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,590
This is amazing.

817
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,060
You'll now get the chance...

818
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,800
- to place the investment stamp.
- Sure.

819
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,430
(An investment stamp?)

820
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,300
What's an investment stamp?

821
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,340
(Only two teams
who secured investments...)

822
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,080
(can head home straight away!)

823
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,250
By stamping
the National Heritage Stamp,

824
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,280
you'll receive hints
about the investments.

825
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,650
- No way.
- There are five types...

826
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,020
of investment stamps,

827
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,520
so choose whichever one you want...

828
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,720
- and stamp it.
- Okay.

829
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,560
- No way.
- It must be random.

830
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,860
Why are there five of them?

831
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,930
- We pick one out of five?
- Yes.

832
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,490
Any one? Which one, Seok Jin?

833
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,930
- We're first?
- Where do we stamp it?

834
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,230
- Choose one stamp.
- And stamp it on this?

835
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,230
Pick whatever one you want.

836
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,630
Why do you think this has
the cherry blossom mark?

837
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,640
Yes, let's pick this. It's just...

838
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,940
- It might be meaningless.
- Do I stamp it here?

839
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,440
- You must open it.
- This one opens too?

840
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,640
What stamp is this big?

841
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,210
(They stamp it cautiously.)

842
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,850
What is this?

843
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,980
(The hint
is an undecipherable shape?)

844
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,890
- What is this?
- What is it?

845
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,520
What's this?

846
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,050
We must figure it out now.

847
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,320
Are you done?

848
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,920
- You're done?
- Yes, we're done.

849
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,730
- It makes no sense.
- Not yet.

850
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,730
(The hint's meaning is yet unknown.)

851
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,530
Pick one. Trust your hunch.

852
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,660
(Team Haha chooses next.)

853
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,930
I choose this one.

854
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,930
Okay.

855
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,370
(They choose the same
as Team Seok Jin.)

856
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:34,970
What's this?

857
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Haha.

858
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,480
You do it weirdly.

859
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,180
Is this how you use stamps?

860
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,610
(CEO Ha stamps things weirdly.)

861
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,550
- Is this how you do it?
- Press it down hard.

862
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,420
- Haha...
- Oh, this is...

863
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,750
- how it works.
- You never used a stamp before?

864
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,750
Is this it?

865
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,520
- What is this?
- What's this?

866
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,550
(They can't tell...)

867
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,090
It looks like some kind of shape.

868
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,190
(the shape either.)

869
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
Okay.

870
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,130
- Let's...
- Pick one stamp.

871
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,300
- Ji Hyo. Let me...
- Okay.

872
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,460
Follow your energy.

873
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,700
- My energy.
- Yes.

874
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,940
Which do you feel is it?

875
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,970
Let's see.

876
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,040
- This one.
- Okay.

877
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,210
- How about it?
- Okay.

878
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,440
(They chose a different one!)

879
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,780
- I'll press down.
- Okay.

880
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,010
(What hint piece
did Team Ji Hyo get?)

881
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
What's this?

882
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,420
- Should we hide it?
- Yes.

883
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,720
(Numbers 1 and 2?)

884
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,190
- Keep it safe.
- Yes.

885
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,550
(It's a completely different hint
from the previous two teams.)

886
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,760
We're done.

887
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
- We go over there?
- Yes.

888
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,830
We all have to go there anyway.

889
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,360
- Shoot. I really...
- We'll walk, right?

890
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,130
Let's drive there.

891
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,160
Over there?

892
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,230
You want to drive over there?

893
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,470
The dud...

894
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,140
Why did we do this?
What does this mean now?

895
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,540
What happens to us
now that we got a dud?

896
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,240
You don't get anything this time.

897
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,640
- No investment?
- There's an investment stamp.

898
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,810
Let's walk slowly over.

899
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,480
- Yes, let's.
- It's a nice workout.

900
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,080
Oh, well. I feel dejected now.

901
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,250
I'd have felt scared
if this were a shabby bridge.

902
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,390
- I'm so scared.
- But this is so sturdy.

903
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,190
It's sturdy, but it's scary.

904
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,560
It's so sturdy,
and the rails are raised.

905
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
My gosh...

906
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,730
I'd have felt scared
if this were glass.

907
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,830
Glass would be worse.

908
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,500
I don't trust glass,
but this is metal.

909
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,700
- My gosh.
- Look.

910
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,340
- It's total metal.
- The stamp was over there.

911
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,240
What? And even if
you fall through a hole,

912
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,210
the ropes down there catch you.

913
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,680
Will you be quiet?

914
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,850
- Look down there.
- Do you think that's comforting?

915
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,280
Even if a hole appears and we fall,
our legs will get caught.

916
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,620
You won't fall right through.
But you're thin, so you might.

917
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,290
Venture Kim, come on.

918
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,720
You're thin,
so you might fall right through.

919
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,360
- Through here.
- We should've come here.

920
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,030
Oh, dear.

921
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,030
You can't tell yet.
- You can't.
- We were wrong.

922
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,130
It was so brave of me to run.

923
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,300
- It's the observation deck.
- Let's go.

924
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,530
Jong Kook, do you eat a straw?

925
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,000
Not a straw, coffee.

926
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,240
Coffee, yes. Not the straw, though.

927
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,740
Okay. Hey, Ye Eun. You need to eat.

928
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,640
- I do eat now.
- Yes, Ye Eun.

929
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,280
Ye Eun, you should eat.

930
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,410
I eat now.

931
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,210
On TV, the lower half...

932
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,020
- of her face was gaunt.
- Yes.

933
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,520
- Eat some more.
- So...

934
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,550
You told me to lose weight.

935
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,790
When did I say that?

936
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,560
- We wanted you to be healthy.
- You said I should lose weight.

937
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,020
- No.
- I was kidding.

938
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,460
Ye Eun, look.

939
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,630
"You told me to..."
Your voice trails off.

940
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,630
Yes.

941
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,330
- It's not funny.
- "You told me to..."

942
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,300
- You lack the energy.
- There's less energy.

943
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,230
The old you
would've shouted the sentence.

944
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,300
Let's rest.

945
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
(Ji Bajie used to be loud.)

946
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,470
- Yes.
- "I'm so annoyed!"

947
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,570
"You told me to..."

948
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,940
Your voice doesn't ring out as much.

949
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,040
- You look like you lack the energy.
- Yes.

950
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,210
- While we're on the move,
- Yes.

951
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,920
we'll play a trendy rhythm game
for another chance to get...

952
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,480
- an investment stamp.
- Okay.

953
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,220
We were too busy chatting
that we didn't play a game.

954
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,820
- Let's play the game.
- Okay.

955
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,090
- It's popular nowadays.
- What is it?

956
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,090
It's the Really Clever Game.

957
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,030
- It's the what came?
- The Really Clever Game.

958
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,590
Relly clever rolly really,

959
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,030
- relly clever relly clever.
- One person starts...

960
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,730
by naming who they want
to attack and a number...

961
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,730
between 1 and 4.

962
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,040
The named person
must say "really clever..."

963
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,340
- that number of times per motion...
- "Really clever."

964
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,670
per rhythm in order.

965
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,910
"Really clever?"

966
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,140
- Okay.
- Seok Jin, three.

967
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,180
Seok Jin, three.

968
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,080
Really clever really.

969
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,810
Ye Eun, two.

970
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,820
Really clever.

971
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,690
- Only Jae Seok's team has no stamp.
- Right.

972
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,620
- "Really clever!" Okay, got it.
- The top two teams will win.

973
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,620
Okay, let's go!

974
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,820
- I want to avoid trendy games.
- "Really clever."

975
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,930
I want to avoid trendy games.

976
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,500
(Running Man's packed
with rhythm game geniuses.)

977
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,130
- My panties...
- "My panties."

978
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,200
Strawberry, watermelon,
Koran melon, melon...

979
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,340
"Koran melon?"

980
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,740
(They never successfully played
a trendy rhythm game.)

981
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,540
- I can't do this at all.
- "Relly cleber."

982
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,010
"Really cleber."

983
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,510
- "Really clever."
- "Rally cleber."

984
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,910
Really clever cleber.

985
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,720
- No. Clubber.
- Relly cleber clubber.

986
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,120
- Shoot.
- Really clever rally clever.

987
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,290
Really clubber.

988
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,650
- We're done for.
- We got it.

989
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,850
Relly cleby.

990
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,920
- Really clever.
- Relly claver.

991
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,030
Really clever.

992
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,230
Really club...

993
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,000
Accentuate the first syllable.

994
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,100
Really clever.

995
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,930
Rolly clobby. Rell...

996
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,930
(Another grim reaper
joined the group.)

997
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,570
He's honestly...

998
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,140
- He's not good at anything!
- "Really clever!"

999
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,740
- He's not brave either.
- Really clever."

1000
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,940
- I can't concentrate.
- That's great.

1001
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,340
If I concentrate, I beat everyone.

1002
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,410
Pretend you're acting.

1003
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,850
Let's try playing.

1004
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,280
- Yes!
- You're a great guy.

1005
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,350
I'm acting a scene.
I should do that.

1006
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,320
- Really clever.
- Rolly clolly...

1007
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,650
(It looks like
the newbie will suffer.)

1008
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,290
Really clever. I did it.

1009
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,960
- Let's play a practice round.
- Okay.

1010
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,120
- We got it.
- Great.

1011
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,330
Really clever.

1012
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,300
(A really fun game)

1013
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,830
(Let's play it relly cleverly.)

1014
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,570
That's so childish.

1015
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,840
- Yes.
- Really clever.

1016
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,740
Isn't it great? Or how about...

1017
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,770
On a really...

1018
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,940
(He makes up a tune
like he's an AI program.)

1019
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,210
- Let's play.
- We're so clever.

1020
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,280
(Really clever, really clever)

1021
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,320
(Singing along)

1022
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,480
(It's a popular TV commercial jingle.)

1023
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,590
- Let's play, one, two, three, four
- Let's play, one, two, three, four.

1024
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,120
(Seok Sam kicks it off.)

1025
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,490
Ye Eun, three!

1026
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,830
Really clever really.

1027
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,230
- Sa Chan, fire.
- What?

1028
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,300
(Sa Chan, fire!)

1029
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,000
- "Sa Chan?"
- "Sa Chan?"

1030
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,040
- "Sa Chan, fire?"
- "Sa Chan, fire?"

1031
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,500
- "Sa Chan, fire?"
- "Sa Chan."

1032
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,140
I got called that
because of my suit?

1033
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,840
- What's "Sa Chan?"
- What's "Sa Chan?"

1034
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,110
- What's "Sa Chan?"
- Ye Eun.

1035
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,410
I meant Se Chan.

1036
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,010
- Se Chan's now Sa Chan?
- "Sa Chan?"

1037
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,210
- Sa Chan, Oh Chan.
- That's funny.

1038
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,420
- You did well.
- Very clever.

1039
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,220
Accentuate
the first part of the word.

1040
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,390
"Real" and "clev."

1041
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,390
- Okay. "Real" and "clev."
- "Real" and "clev."

1042
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,560
- "Real" and "clev."
- Are you ready?

1043
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,220
- Ready, go.
- Really clever.

1044
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,090
(After a practice round,
they play the 1st round.)

1045
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,100
(Really clever)

1046
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,860
(Relly clever?)

1047
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,700
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

1048
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,630
Daniel, three!

1049
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,640
(Will the "real and clev" tactic work?)

1050
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,610
Real, clev, roll!

1051
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,580
Real, clev, roll!

1052
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,140
- What?
- I told you what...

1053
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,480
- Again, you...
- What was that?

1054
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,080
- What was that?
- What are you doing, fool?

1055
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,580
The rest of the words are silent?

1056
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,650
- Real, clev, roll...
- What was that?

1057
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,220
I meant to accentuate
the first syllables...

1058
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,760
- You spewed out the words?
- He calculated mathematically.

1059
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,660
- How is math involved?
- "Really clever."

1060
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,090
He has great energy.

1061
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,390
Again. Let's go.

1062
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,930
- "Clever."
- Ye Eun will start.

1063
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,730
- You psycho.
- One, two, three, four.

1064
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,670
- Really clever
- Really clever

1065
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,040
(Wrong again)

1066
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,940
- Really clever
- Really clever

1067
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,140
- One, two, three, four.
- Jae Seok, two!

1068
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,880
(She attacks Jae Seok.)

1069
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,110
(Extremely tense)

1070
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,350
Rolly clever!

1071
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,210
Rolly clever!

1072
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,620
- What?
- "Rolly?"

1073
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,480
- He's rolling about.
- It's "really."

1074
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,990
- "Really."
- Just say you misheard.

1075
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,190
- I can't.
- It's not "rolly clever."

1076
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,320
- Well...
- It was noisy.

1077
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,020
- It was noisy. I couldn't hear.
- Yes.

1078
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,530
- But you responded.
- Why did you respond, then?

1079
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,830
You played.

1080
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,200
- You played.
- Why did you play, then?

1081
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
It was so noisy.

1082
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,560
- It was noisy.
- Especially...

1083
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,830
- these guys.
- You should've complained.

1084
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,400
- That's true.
- I didn't hear at all.

1085
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,840
- I didn't hear her.
- We should play again.

1086
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,100
We should. I couldn't hear her.

1087
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,500
- But you played.
- You're a coward.

1088
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,670
You tattled to Jong Kook?

1089
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,040
- I knew it.
- It's not "rolly."

1090
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
I knew it.

1091
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,480
- I'm being honest.
- That's true.

1092
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,710
- They were too noisy.
- Yes.

1093
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,210
- You're right.
- Right?

1094
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,910
- You're right.
- It was too noisy.

1095
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,120
- Hey.
- It was too noisy.

1096
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,920
Whatever the case,
it's Jae Seok's turn.

1097
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
Look.

1098
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,720
(The last round was voided.)

1099
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,920
(Really clabber)

1100
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,820
One, two, three, four, go.
Like that.

1101
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,460
- Okay.
- Ye Eun will start again.

1102
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,460
- Okay.
- Okay.

1103
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,200
We can go slow.
There's no need to go fast.

1104
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,400
- Ready.
- One, two, three, four.

1105
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,930
(Really, rolly)

1106
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,470
(Really clever)

1107
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,740
(Really clover)

1108
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,540
- "Really clover?"
- One, two, three, four.

1109
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,610
- Haha, three!
- Rolly, relly, claver!

1110
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,380
(Rolly, relly, claver!)

1111
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,010
Haha!

1112
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,010
(Not one word was right.)

1113
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,710
- Hey, he...
- It was Jae Seok next.

1114
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,650
- What a coward!
- What was that?

1115
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,120
What a coward!

1116
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,820
He's a typical middle-aged man.

1117
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,990
Rolly...

1118
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,020
- Are you that old?
- What was that?

1119
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,590
- You're old. Can't you keep up?
- Haha...

1120
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,860
Follow the trend.

1121
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,860
- What's wrong?
- We have math brains.

1122
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,360
Why did you stutter?

1123
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,870
I really didn't expect...
Okay, fine.

1124
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,030
Is that how you'll play?

1125
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,200
You lost another point.

1126
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,240
- Okay.
- Yes.

1127
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,510
- "Really clever."
- One, two, three, four.

1128
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,940
(Rolly clover)

1129
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,340
(Rolly rolly)

1130
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,610
- Really clever
- Really clever

1131
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,280
- One, two, three, four!
- One, two, three, four!

1132
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,110
Seok Jin, four!

1133
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,750
(Will he succeed
in a trendy fashion?)

1134
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,180
Really clubber really clubber.

1135
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,920
- What a mess.
- "Clubber..."

1136
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
- He messed up.
- He messed up.

1137
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,090
- A mess-up.
- A mess-up.

1138
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,120
- He called himself a mess-up.
- "Really clever."

1139
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,530
You'll keep getting stuck
at the second person.

1140
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,730
Let's stick to just one and two.

1141
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,930
- One and two?
- That's a good idea.

1142
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,300
- One and two works.
- Okay.

1143
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,300
- Hey.
- "Really clever."

1144
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,000
- Let's slow it down.
- Yes.

1145
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,300
- Slow down.
- Let's change the pace.

1146
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,940
Once you're used to it,

1147
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,970
- we'll go up to three.
- Okay.

1148
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,440
Do your palms hurt?

1149
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,610
Yes.

1150
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,040
For real? What did you do?

1151
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,310
(Teary-eyed, hand shaking)

1152
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,650
- Seok Jin, four!
- Really clubber really clubber.

1153
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:43,450
(He got too enthusiastic
and slapped his thighs hard.)

1154
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,460
- Are you okay?
- What did you do?

1155
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,260
- I'm fine. You try it.
- Do you need an ointment?

1156
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,490
- You should try it.
- Right.

1157
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,660
- Oh, okay. From the beginning.
- Go slowly.

1158
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,300
Ready, set, go.

1159
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,630
- Really clever
- Really clever

1160
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,200
(They lowered the number.
Will they succeed in a long rally?)

1161
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,400
- One, two, three, four!
- One, two, three, four!

1162
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,040
Jae Seok, two.

1163
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,710
Really clever.

1164
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,210
Seok Jin, two.

1165
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,440
(Even Jae Seok successfully passes.)

1166
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,480
Really clever!

1167
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,680
(He succeeds as well!)

1168
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,780
Ji Hyo, three!

1169
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,980
- Hey, so...
- No.

1170
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,120
Ji Hyo, three!

1171
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,150
- Hey, so...
- No.

1172
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,790
- You can't do three.
- Three isn't allowed.

1173
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,290
Why are you being greedy?

1174
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,390
- Don't be greedy!
- You're trying to win!

1175
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,090
- Seok Jin, you shouldn't...
- Right.

1176
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,660
We said we'd do two or below
for your sake.

1177
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,890
- Let's go up to three now.
- What's wrong with you?

1178
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,330
- Three? Let's do that.
- Because we're all...

1179
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,530
Then, are we going up to three?

1180
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,800
- Sure, let's go up to 3.
- Let's go up to 3.

1181
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,870
Then, we'll do three more rounds.

1182
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,840
- Three rounds? That's the end.
- Okay.

1183
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,440
Let's do this seriously.

1184
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,140
Seriously, for real.

1185
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,440
- Let's start over.
- "Really..."

1186
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,540
- Let's go really slowly.
- "Claver..."

1187
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,940
- Really slowly.
- Slowly.

1188
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,240
- "Really claver?"
- Ready, set, go.

1189
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,950
- "Really, really, clever..."
- "Really clever..."

1190
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,550
(They're trying to control
their tongues really seriously.)

1191
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,550
I can pronounce it,
but the rhythm is hard.

1192
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,390
I can't pronounce the words.

1193
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,520
- You just have to spit it out.
- It's so...

1194
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,050
"Really, cleeber, rally!"

1195
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,190
(Really, cleeber)

1196
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,390
(Rally!)

1197
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,530
- Did you say "rally?"
- What?

1198
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,230
- "Rally."
- What was that?

1199
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,530
- Did you hear me? I did it.
- You were wrong.

1200
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,100
- You got it wrong.
- But I did it.

1201
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,700
- But you got it wrong!
- Was it wrong?

1202
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,000
You said "rally."

1203
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Ready, go.

1204
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,140
- Really clever
- Really clever

1205
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,610
(They start with Seok Sam.)

1206
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,540
- Really clever
- One, two, three, four.

1207
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,180
Jong Kook, three.

1208
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,050
Real... Really, cleber, really?

1209
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,410
Really, cleber, really?

1210
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,420
Gosh, this is just... Jong Kook.

1211
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,020
Jong Kook.

1212
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,620
(The single man is very happy to go
on an outing as it's been a while.)

1213
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,220
- I mean...
- This is so much fun.

1214
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,460
Really, cleber?

1215
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,030
Hey.

1216
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,660
- You even got the rhythm wrong.
- Hey.

1217
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,160
(Game time with friends makes them
all hum with joy.)

1218
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,500
- That was the worst.
- What was that?

1219
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,670
- Gosh, seriously.
- What?

1220
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,200
Really clever rolly.

1221
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,230
(Team Jae Seok happily loses
a point.)

1222
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,570
- Let's go slowly.
- Cleber...

1223
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,600
- Really slowly.
- Go slowly.

1224
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,200
- Ready, set, go.
- Really, cleber...

1225
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,880
(This time, it's the slow version.)

1226
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,910
It's working.

1227
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,480
- Really clever
- Really clever

1228
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,580
- One, two, three, four!
- One, two, three, four!

1229
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,950
- Niel, three.
- Who?

1230
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,120
- Niel?
- What?

1231
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,490
- Mi Ae?
- Who's Mi Ae?

1232
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,920
- Oh, me? Niel.
- Niel!

1233
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,020
- Hey.
- Why do you keep using...

1234
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,660
- a nickname only you know?
- You're the only one who knows...

1235
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,960
- Only you...
- Yennie.

1236
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,600
- Don't use names only you know!
- Yennie...

1237
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
You call people Niel, Yennie,

1238
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,170
and honey. What is that?

1239
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,200
Honey!

1240
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,640
(Ye Eun, Yennie)

1241
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,910
(Daniel, Niel)

1242
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,740
(Kim Jong Kook, Honey)

1243
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,010
- Stop calling me Honey!
- Yennie, Niel.

1244
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,050
- Why do you keep doing that?
- What is that?

1245
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,410
- Were you off in a different world?
- What are you doing?

1246
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,780
Do you play games these days?

1247
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,450
- Daniel.
- Yes, Daniel.

1248
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,590
- Just call him Daniel.
- Daniel. Got it.

1249
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,890
- All right. Let's go.
- Okay.

1250
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,460
- Then, do I go first?
- Sure.

1251
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,590
(This round, Niel will start.)

1252
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,860
- Ready, go.
- Ready, go.

1253
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,630
(The final round begins.)

1254
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,330
- Really clever
- Let's keep a rally going.

1255
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,200
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

1256
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,100
Seok Jin, three.

1257
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,140
- Really clever really!
- That's it.

1258
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,600
Ye Eun, two.

1259
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,440
(One person passes!)

1260
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,640
Really clever!

1261
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,310
Se Chan, three.

1262
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,910
Really clubber really!

1263
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,780
(Really clubber really!)

1264
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,220
That was awful.

1265
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,480
- You ruined it.
- Hey.

1266
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,950
- We were so close.
- We just can't do it.

1267
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,020
We were doing well, though.

1268
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,090
It just didn't work.

1269
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,460
- I thought he got it.
- The rally was...

1270
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:07,520
We're in last place.

1271
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,690
- The results are in.
- Yes?

1272
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,430
- We got it.
- Tied for first place,

1273
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,360
it's Jae Seok and Jong Kook,
as well as Ji Hyo and Ye Eun.

1274
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,770
- So, these two teams,
- We did it.

1275
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,130
once we get off the bus
when we arrive,

1276
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,170
- you will get investment stamps.
- Okay!

1277
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,510
- We made up for it.
- Nice!

1278
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,210
Really clever really!

1279
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,440
So, we have arrived.

1280
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,750
The two teams that won the mission
will get off first...

1281
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,010
- and get their stamps.
- Okay.

1282
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,010
- And then, we'll get going.
- Okay.

1283
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,080
- Get off first.
- Okay. Nice.

1284
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,520
Today, so... You know?

1285
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,950
Ji Hyo and Ye Eun's team is
doing well in the beginning.

1286
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,150
- We're going to win.
- Seok Sam.

1287
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,690
- They won in a row.
- Daniel.

1288
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,190
- My goodness.
- The ones without will go first.

1289
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,230
You can stamp the page
for Yeoncheon.

1290
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,230
(These two get to touch the stamp
for the first time today.)

1291
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,330
Okay.

1292
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,800
- This is it. My goodness.
- My gosh.

1293
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,730
- Oh, my. Yeoncheon.
- We came all the way to Yeoncheon.

1294
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,140
- No, this isn't Yeoncheon.
- It's not?

1295
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,500
The location is different.

1296
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,840
- Now, you have investment stamps.
- Okay.

1297
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,780
There are five types of
investments stamps,

1298
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,240
- as you can see on the right.
- Yes.

1299
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,820
You can stamp one of your choosing
from them.

1300
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,920
Which one do you want to choose?

1301
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,880
I'm not really sure about this.

1302
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,050
- You should choose.
- Just go ahead.

1303
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,350
- No, you choose.
- So, which one is it?

1304
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,120
- No, you saw earlier.
- Which one catches your eye?

1305
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,560
(Contemplating)

1306
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,730
Which one grabs your attention?

1307
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,600
(Unlucky Hand Yu chose a dud
at the suspension bridge.)

1308
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,900
Which one catches your eye?

1309
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,040
Really? Then, let's leave that out.

1310
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,700
That's too in the middle.

1311
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,710
- What are you doing?
- Anyone can tell...

1312
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,740
that it's too smack dab
in the middle. It's tempting us.

1313
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,280
It keeps tempting us. See here?

1314
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,810
Or wouldn't the ones on the side
be better among these?

1315
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,010
Then, let's go with
the one on the side.

1316
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,550
(He chooses the safe choice
on the side.)

1317
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,580
This one.

1318
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,850
You can stamp it
according to the size.

1319
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,960
- The size is exactly the right fit.
- Make it fit.

1320
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,320
You have to stamp it well.

1321
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,560
Gosh, this wasn't bad either.

1322
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,630
Then you should've said so sooner.

1323
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,890
- What's this?
- What is this?

1324
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,360
(They check the hint piece.)

1325
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,600
- What's this?
- What is this?

1326
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,230
- What is it?
- What's this?

1327
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,300
What is this?
It kind of looks like...

1328
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,240
Isn't this the writing
from the "Predator" series?

1329
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
You know, those movies.

1330
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,240
Oh, if you put it up to something...

1331
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:04,610
(Hush!)

1332
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,510
- There must be something if you...
- Hey.

1333
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,450
Only brainy guys like us
think about that. The others here...

1334
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,880
- Who else would...
- You're right, Jae Seok.

1335
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,050
- They wouldn't know.
- You're right.

1336
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,650
- We're not praising ourselves.
- Okay. Right.

1337
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,250
We're just speaking in comparison.

1338
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,720
- Right, it's in comparison.
- Yes.

1339
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,160
- Nice. I'll hold onto it.
- Kook Jong, hold onto this.

1340
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,790
- Okay.
- Okay.

1341
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,590
- You've done this earlier, right?
- Yes.

1342
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,300
- There we go.
- There we go.

1343
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,800
I'm so happy, Ji Hyo.

1344
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,370
All right. You've gained
an investment stamp now.

1345
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,040
Which one do you want?

1346
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,010
Remember, we did this one before?

1347
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,810
Should we go in order?

1348
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,980
- Just go by your gut feeling.
- Gut feeling? Okay.

1349
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,180
What does your gut say?

1350
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,050
I say either 1 or 3.

1351
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,110
(I say either 1 or 3.)

1352
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,110
Which one is number one? This?

1353
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,450
Yes, either 1 or 3.

1354
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,220
- Number one? Shall we go with this?
- Okay.

1355
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,490
(They choose according to
Ji Hyo with the golden touch.)

1356
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,620
- Stamp it deep.
- Okay.

1357
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,790
- Oh, my. What could it be?
- This is...

1358
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,060
What is it?

1359
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,090
What is this?

1360
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,190
What could it be?

1361
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,430
(Team Ji Hyo has the advantage
in solving the hints.)

1362
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,730
- Do we have to dry it?
- Yes, I think so.

1363
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,860
(Team Ji Hyo has the advantage
in solving the hints.)

1364
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:02,970
Let's go.

1365
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,570
Good. Hey, Se Chan. Let's go.

1366
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,640
(Hint Pieces: Team Jae Seok,
Team Seok Jin, Team Haha, Team Ji Hyo)

1367
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,310
- My gosh. What is this?
- This isn't man-made, is it?

1368
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,470
- Gosh, let's go.
- It's for real.

1369
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,710
- It isn't man-made, right?
- My goodness.

1370
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:14,140
This is actually for real, right?

1371
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,410
(A grand sight
that makes their jaws drop)

1372
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:16,980
My gosh. What is this?

1373
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,180
- It's for real.
- It isn't man-made, right?

1374
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,580
- Gosh, Ji Hyo.
- This is so impressive.

1375
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,220
- What is this?
- This is...

1376
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,520
- Gosh, it's a grand sight.
- It's so beautiful.

1377
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,020
- Gosh, this place is...
- What is this?

1378
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,930
- Hey, there's fish in here too.
- There's fish.

1379
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,530
Gosh, this place is worth a visit.

1380
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,170
It's really impressive.

1381
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,300
- It's so cool.
- This place is beautiful, right?

1382
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,700
Gosh, it's cool.

1383
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,040
What? Why?

1384
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,740
- This is...
- It's so cool.

1385
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,340
- This is...
- Gosh, how beautiful.

1386
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,010
You look like someone here
to perform for "Golden Oldies."

1387
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,810
- Gosh, this is no joke.
- Oh, I kind of want to...

1388
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,910
drink makgeolli here.

1389
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,680
With some green onion jeon.

1390
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,280
- I'll take a photo for you, sir.
- Thank you.

1391
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,050
Goodness, sir.

1392
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,090
- Does he have a show here tonight?
- All right. One,

1393
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,720
- two, three.
- Oh, my.

1394
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,220
- Like you have a show...
- Oh, goodness.

1395
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,430
- You have a show here tonight?
- Yes.

1396
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,660
- So, this place was...
- It's so...

1397
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,030
an abandoned quarry...

1398
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,400
- that was turned into...
- Right?

1399
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,970
- a cultural space.
- Really?

1400
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,770
- I thought so.
- Lake Cheonju and rocky cliffs...

1401
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,570
boast a magnificent sight.

1402
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:19,010
It's one of the places to visit
on the National Heritage Course.

1403
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,380
As you've come to
the National Heritage Course,

1404
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,750
this mission will be...

1405
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,110
- for two investment stamps.
- Okay.

1406
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,710
(2 hint pieces)

1407
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,880
- That's how we will proceed.
- Gosh, we...

1408
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,080
- Ji Hyo, we have to do this.
- This mission...

1409
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,650
This mission is
When Life Gives You Paint.

1410
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,890
- In 100 seconds, the offense team,
- Yes?

1411
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:35,720
with rubber bands
around your arms and legs,

1412
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,290
you must get the paint
on your hands...

1413
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,860
on the defense team's face
and body...

1414
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,430
- as much as you can.
- Okay. We can do this.

1415
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,560
- Paint?
- Paint.

1416
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,230
The defense team can't go past
the yellow line...

1417
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,800
and defend yourselves...

1418
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,370
- with the sponge bats.
- Okay. We've got this.

1419
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,640
- After both teams take turns...
- We've got this.

1420
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,740
- with offense and defense,
- Yes, we can do this.

1421
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,440
- the team with less paint wins.
- Okay.

1422
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,110
- This is our time.
- We're good.

1423
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,950
We've already decided on
who you will be facing.

1424
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,420
- Yes.
- Since there is a girls' team,

1425
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,980
the girls' team will be...

1426
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,820
- So... Yes.
- They should be our opponents.

1427
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,090
- They'll face Seok Jin and Se Chan.
- Okay!

1428
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,220
- No, they have to face me.
- He's the least...

1429
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,960
- I mean... I'm really...
- He's so weak.

1430
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,390
- You can handle...
- Hey, you say it.

1431
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,160
- But how can we...
- He can't do anything.

1432
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,390
Hang on.

1433
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,900
- How can we do this?
- Hey, you're...

1434
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,630
- But the women...
- That team is so strong.

1435
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,440
will be able to control the rubber
bands a little more easily.

1436
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,570
- We'll go easy on you. Like this.
- No way.

1437
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,540
- Seok Jin, we have to win.
- We must.

1438
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,010
- No joking around.
- So,

1439
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,880
Team Jae Seok and Jong Kook...

1440
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,650
will compete against
Team Haha and Daniel.

1441
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,750
- Okay!
- How can we do this?

1442
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,380
He's a bigger scaredy-cat than me.

1443
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,620
First, you will change
into your uniforms.

1444
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,820
- All right.
- Okay. Nice.

1445
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,090
- Wear this first.
- Okay, extra large.

1446
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,220
It's an extra large.

1447
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,030
- Oh, wear this first?
- You have to wear it underneath.

1448
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,930
Do you want a large?

1449
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,030
Yes, a large.

1450
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,230
Give me an extra large.

1451
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:48,530
(Laughing)

1452
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,170
I think we have to zip up
all the way to the face.

1453
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,100
- That's right.
- I see.

1454
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,440
Gosh, you seriously look...

1455
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,440
Whatever you do,
it suits you, Se Chan.

1456
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,510
(As they get changed...)

1457
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,380
- This look is...
- I know, right?

1458
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,380
(Only 1 person is struggling alone.)

1459
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:11,850
How do I do this?

1460
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,120
(How do I do this?)

1461
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,200
- What is this? How do I do this?
- Your legs...

1462
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,330
- Put your legs in first.
- Oh, I put my legs in?

1463
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,940
(Daniel shoves his long legs in.)

1464
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,570
Daniel,

1465
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,540
do you ever get called foolish?

1466
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,840
Do people say that to you?

1467
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,280
I get called that quite often.

1468
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,180
- But in a different sense.
- I haven't heard that.

1469
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,920
I've never been called that
in my life.

1470
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,920
- But you'll hear it often now.
- No.

1471
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,690
- Put this on, then.
- How do I do this?

1472
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:45,890
- Why is this so hard?
- This?

1473
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:47,760
- He's struggling with it.
- I put my feet in first?

1474
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,690
- I can't believe him.
- I mean...

1475
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,790
Can you help me?

1476
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,260
This...

1477
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:54,960
Hold on a second.

1478
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,100
- It's snug.
- It's fine.

1479
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,630
(Snug)

1480
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,470
- It's too snug.
- It's fine.

1481
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,740
- I said it was fine.
- Hold on.

1482
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,770
- Lower this.
- Why won't it fit?

1483
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:03,910
- But...
- That's it.

1484
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,840
- What?
- You were faking it.

1485
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,840
- They got divided...
- I know what you mean.

1486
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,510
- with one on each side.
- I know what you mean.

1487
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,850
- Mine doesn't have one.
- Here we go.

1488
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,980
Se Chan, mine doesn't have a zipper.

1489
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,680
I need to take this off.

1490
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,990
Is he for real?
Why can't he put on a simple suit?

1491
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:19,220
This is what I meant
about being a dummy.

1492
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,890
I've never been one
to take care of others.

1493
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:23,590
I never had to wear
anything like this before.

1494
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,630
Even so, one usually figures it out
with common sense.

1495
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,100
- Is that so?
- All right.

1496
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,760
Who's going first?

1497
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,570
- We'll go first.
- Sure.

1498
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,230
- You'll get it on your body.
- Hit me.

1499
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,300
On us?

1500
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,100
You have to block the others
from getting it on you.

1501
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,440
(Chuckling)

1502
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,610
- It doesn't hurt.
- You just made him angry.

1503
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,080
Hit me.

1504
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,050
- This hurts.
- It doesn't.

1505
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,680
- This hurts.
- Hit me.

1506
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,350
Isn't this
what I got hit with last time?

1507
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,020
Okay. I got it.

1508
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,360
(The sleeping lion
had his nose hair pulled out.)

1509
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,760
It's fine. You can take the hit.

1510
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,830
- Okay, good.
- On our bodies?

1511
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,430
Can you make sure
his bands are tight?

1512
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:00,930
On our bodies?

1513
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,130
(Jong Kook tries it out.)

1514
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,170
- He can't make it here.
- Is it difficult for you?

1515
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,040
(The defense zone
is still far ahead.)

1516
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,170
- It's hard to make the distance.
- How is it?

1517
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,770
- Is it tough for you?
- It keeps pulling us back.

1518
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:11,840
Is it difficult for you?

1519
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,540
It keeps pulling us back.

1520
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,240
Really? No way.

1521
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,950
I guess we're safe, then.

1522
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:20,380
- Let's have one of us survive this.
- Sure.

1523
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,080
- I'll shield you from them.
- Okay.

1524
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,790
The team with more paint on them...

1525
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,020
- will lose.
- Sure.

1526
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,690
Please get ready.

1527
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,660
- Is it 100 seconds?
- Yes. Get ready.

1528
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,430
- Pink!
- Okay.

1529
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:32,030
- Get ready.
- Pink is Jong Kook's color.

1530
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,030
Right.

1531
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,730
(What?)

1532
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:42,070
(He charged through the defense zone
like it was his master bedroom.)

1533
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,240
- Wait. Hold on.
- What?

1534
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,070
- No way.
- He made it all the way here.

1535
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,580
Oh, no.

1536
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,810
(Daniel wasn't aware
of Jong Kook's strength.)

1537
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,150
(Pulling)

1538
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,220
Get them off him.

1539
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,120
- Watch out.
- Help me.

1540
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,390
(Being seasoned nicely)

1541
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:59,450
We're good.

1542
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:01,160
- Wait.
- Get more on them.

1543
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,530
All right. Here I go.

1544
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,730
- Hurry.
- Get more on them.

1545
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,030
Try to get out of their reach.

1546
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,200
I can't believe him.

1547
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,300
- Haha... Let's get Haha.
- Hey!

1548
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,700
- Can you escape them?
- They can't get back there.

1549
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,170
Can't we move further back?

1550
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,900
Hey, come here.

1551
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,410
(Iron Locust
can't pull himself forward.)

1552
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,980
Are they different from Jong Kook's?

1553
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,280
Do you have different rubber bands?
What's going on?

1554
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:25,880
No way.

1555
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,520
- It's tougher than it seems.
- Get paint on them!

1556
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,650
(A fun beating begins.)

1557
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:30,850
How is it so easy?

1558
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,220
(He barely makes it
across the line.)

1559
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,290
(Rolling)

1560
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,390
I don't have any paint on me!

1561
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,760
If it's this tough for Jae Seok,
we won't stand a chance.

1562
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,760
This will be tough.

1563
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,830
Why is it so easy for Jong Kook?

1564
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:44,330
(However, someone does it easily.)

1565
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:47,240
(The full force
of the kimchi factory's best employee)

1566
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:49,910
(Grabbing)

1567
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:52,670
(The salted cabbage
was easily grabbed.)

1568
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:53,780
(Throwing him down on the floor)

1569
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,810
Daniel, get back here.

1570
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:58,410
(He gets spicy seasoning
all over him.)

1571
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,620
Daniel, I'm sorry,
but I need to stay clean.

1572
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,690
Are you sure you gave Jong Kook
the appropriate bands?

1573
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,390
(Just then)

1574
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,090
What on earth...

1575
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,190
(Lady Kook at the kimchi factory
awakens for the 2nd time.)

1576
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:12,530
- Hold on.
- You have 15 seconds left.

1577
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,200
How is he getting here so easily?

1578
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,130
- Seven, six,
- Haha's peaceful.

1579
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,430
- five,
- Seriously?

1580
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,170
- four, three,
- Daniel has paint all over him.

1581
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,640
- two, one.
- It's over.

1582
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,900
Get away from me, you monster!

1583
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,740
- No way.
- Okay.

1584
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,970
Look at Daniel.

1585
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,280
I didn't think
he'd take it this far.

1586
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,750
(Panting)

1587
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:30,980
(Daniel's exhausted.)

1588
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,220
Hold on a second.

1589
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,690
Shouldn't you have done something
about this?

1590
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,650
It was too easy for Jong Kook.

1591
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,990
Do the bands
have the same elasticity?

1592
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:44,260
- He's a mess.
- Jong Kook's unstoppable.

1593
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,330
You'll be playing
opposite roles now.

1594
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:48,560
- Okay, I'll show you.
- Mine kept pulling me back.

1595
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,670
- I doubt Daniel can reach them.
- I don't think he can.

1596
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:51,970
He's too flimsy.

1597
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,640
(I'm not.)

1598
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,070
Daniel's tall and has long legs.

1599
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,770
- He's naturally fit.
- Of course.

1600
00:48:58,770 --> 00:48:59,780
If I put my mind to it,

1601
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,380
- I can get it done.
- Absolutely.

1602
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:07,450
(He may not have the fittest body,
but he's in decent shape.)

1603
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,820
- Can't I pluck out just the one?
- Not this one.

1604
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,820
(His mediocre fitness level
only proved itself just once.)

1605
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,720
He's good at this!

1606
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,990
(Can he prove himself
once again today?)

1607
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,590
- You must show them.
- I know.

1608
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,830
- I'll show you.
- Leave it there.

1609
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,960
- Jae Seok.
- Daniel, remember what I said.

1610
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:24,270
- It's better to stay in one corner.
- Yes, that's better.

1611
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:25,830
- Keep one of them away.
- Exactly.

1612
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,100
- Okay?
- Okay.

1613
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:28,800
- Okay.
- Yes!

1614
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,010
(What's with them?)

1615
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,110
- Are you ready?
- He didn't get hit that much.

1616
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,140
Get ready.

1617
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,180
(The brutal revenge match)

1618
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,220
- Look at that.
- He made it quite far.

1619
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,220
(Daniel was confident.
How secretly strong is he?)

1620
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,120
Hold on.

1621
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,260
(Pulling back)

1622
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,760
- No way.
- Daniel, you can do this.

1623
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,130
You can't be this bad.

1624
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,290
What's his problem?

1625
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,060
- What's wrong with you?
- Seriously.

1626
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,400
- You're overacting.
- Come on.

1627
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,370
- Hold on.
- Let's do this. One...

1628
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,600
- They can't make it here.
- Darn.

1629
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,840
- Two, three.
- Seriously.

1630
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,470
- You're overacting.
- You can't make it here.

1631
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:03,740
You're not getting near us.

1632
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:05,870
- Are you kidding me?
- This is fun!

1633
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,580
- Get over here.
- Guys.

1634
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,710
- Get over here.
- Get back here.

1635
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,480
- You zombies.
- Get over here, you punks.

1636
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,120
- You zombies, get over here.
- One.

1637
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,420
(It turned into a Whac-A-Mole.)

1638
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,880
- This is heavy-duty.
- Get over here.

1639
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,450
- Get over here.
- How did you make it to us?

1640
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:18,990
- Let's do this.
- Stop this nonsense.

1641
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:20,420
- This is heavy-duty.
- We'll go on "one."

1642
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,120
- One,
- How did you make it to us?

1643
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,230
two, three.

1644
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,260
(Beanpole and Shortie are coming!)

1645
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,290
You...

1646
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:29,700
You punks.

1647
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,730
(Shortie becomes shorter
after getting hit on the head.)

1648
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,840
- Hold on a second.
- You punks.

1649
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,040
- You punks.
- Wait.

1650
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,140
(Meanwhile, Beanpole
can't even manage his own body.)

1651
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,580
Reach out, guys.

1652
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,050
- You punks.
- You punks.

1653
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:46,580
(The "You Punks" massage continues.)

1654
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,520
- You punks.
- You punks.

1655
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,590
It hurts.

1656
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:55,520
(Dozens of strikes)

1657
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,430
(They couldn't be more annoying.)

1658
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,690
- This is fun.
- It's true.

1659
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,500
- How did you make it to us?
- This is fun.

1660
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,000
(Short Kid goes to the dogs
and becomes the Really Short Kid.)

1661
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,200
(Here I come once again!)

1662
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,470
- You punks.
- Reach out.

1663
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,440
- You punks.
- You punks.

1664
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,640
- You punks.
- Let me push you.

1665
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,110
(Dragging)

1666
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,010
- You punks.
- Work together.

1667
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,210
What are you doing?

1668
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,980
- Five, four,
- You punks.

1669
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,650
- You punks.
- three, two,

1670
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,150
one.

1671
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,250
Why you...

1672
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:27,920
You punks.

1673
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,160
(Game over)

1674
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,590
- Okay!
- They're terrible at this.

1675
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:32,890
(Knocked out)

1676
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,430
- What...
- Hey, Daniel.

1677
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,660
- I can't believe him.
- Are you okay?

1678
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,770
You were hilarious.

1679
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,600
Jae Seok and Jong Kook
won this round.

1680
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,070
- Okay.
- Nice!

1681
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,540
Your suits are too clean.

1682
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,040
- This was no joke.
- We won.

1683
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,970
- But...
- The bands pull back hard.

1684
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,910
How did Jong Kook make it
to us earlier?

1685
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,040
It was our moment to shine.

1686
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,480
We're moving onto the next round.

1687
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,710
Seok Jin and Se Chan will be...

1688
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,950
- on the offense first.
- Sure.

1689
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,080
- Oh, no.
- That first attempt...

1690
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,790
- I'll stand in front of Seok Jin.
- You can stand over here.

1691
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,560
Ye Eun, why do you keep
following me around?

1692
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,690
You think too little of me,

1693
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,160
but you'll be surprised.

1694
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,460
- He's stronger than you think.
- He's on the stronger side.

1695
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,960
He's stronger than you think.

1696
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,700
The ladies are wearing
extra pads underneath,

1697
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,640
- so touch them all you want.
- Got it.

1698
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,900
We're wearing pads underneath.

1699
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,070
You're wearing extra pads.

1700
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,670
Yes, of course.

1701
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,810
Hold on.

1702
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,380
We should aim for their legs.

1703
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,750
- You're right. Hold on.
- But they're wearing extra pads.

1704
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:25,280
Still, this could be controversial.

1705
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,350
Still.

1706
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,420
- They're wearing thick pads.
- Okay.

1707
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,580
We should be more careful.

1708
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,890
Touch me all you want.

1709
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,120
Touch me all you want.

1710
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,160
Hold on a second. Come on.

1711
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,660
What's going on?

1712
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,630
- Touch me all you want.
- She's insane.

1713
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,800
- Why you...
- She's trying to bury us.

1714
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,800
(Ye Eun activates the trap.)

1715
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,200
Ji Hyo, let's stand like this.

1716
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,270
- This is only a game.
- All right.

1717
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,370
Of course.

1718
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:51,740
Get ready.

1719
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,810
- My gosh.
- Darn.

1720
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,010
Let's go!

1721
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,650
- My gosh.
- Darn.

1722
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,590
(Se Chan approaches
the defense zone.)

1723
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:08,160
(He starts rubbing paint
mostly on her arms and legs.)

1724
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,090
(Power Seok Sam charges.)

1725
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,500
You punk.

1726
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,860
You punk.

1727
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:19,630
(Gibbon fights back hard.)

1728
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,300
You punk.

1729
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,700
(She takes out one human.)

1730
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,070
(She subdues the human
on the other side too.)

1731
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,270
Ye Eun, hey!

1732
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:27,640
- Are you kidding me?
- I can't play this game properly.

1733
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,810
Get as much paint on them
as you can.

1734
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:29,840
- Go.
- Okay.

1735
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,950
- Get her.
- Ye Eun, I'm coming for you.

1736
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,110
Seok Jin, get her and come help me.

1737
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:33,350
- Okay!
- Here we go.

1738
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,790
You punk.

1739
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:39,250
(You punk... Laughing)

1740
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,190
(Attacking the face)

1741
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,020
(The highly intelligent gibbon
can strike upward.)

1742
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,960
- Hey!
- The face.

1743
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,430
She keeps hitting him in the face.

1744
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,100
She's striking with uppercuts.

1745
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,830
(Here...)

1746
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:50,830
(and there)

1747
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,670
- You punk.
- Grab her.

1748
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,570
You punk.

1749
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:59,840
(Just then, Seok Sam 59
gathers all his might.)

1750
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,840
(He's dangerously close.)

1751
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,810
Seok Jin.

1752
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:07,180
(Seok Sam did it.)

1753
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,920
Seok Jin.

1754
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:14,190
(He's pulled back
after barely getting some paint on her.)

1755
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,760
Hold on. The bands are tangled.

1756
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:18,590
Wait, the bands are tangled.

1757
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:19,630
(The bands are tangled,
just like Seok Sam's luck.)

1758
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:21,800
- Please!
- How do I untangle this?

1759
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,630
- That's his fate.
- Please!

1760
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,400
- That's his fate.
- What's happening?

1761
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,270
Ji Hyo, stand like this.

1762
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,310
You have ten seconds left.

1763
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,370
(Charging with 10 seconds left)

1764
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:33,940
I...

1765
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,280
The bands are tangled.

1766
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,550
Roll over once more to the side.

1767
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:39,210
While lying down.

1768
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,920
(Trying to untangle himself)

1769
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,920
Okay, I got it.

1770
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,980
(Time's up)

1771
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,290
- We still got some on them.
- Your time is up.

1772
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:48,160
- Our time is up.
- How is he so unlucky?

1773
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,920
- It's not bad.
- We still got some on them.

1774
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,360
- You did.
- Not bad.

1775
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,490
- Gosh, this is hard.
- It's hard, right?

1776
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,730
- Okay, you won't be able to come.
- That's not easy.

1777
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:55,830
What do we do?

1778
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,270
Will we be able to do this?

1779
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:00,270
(Team Ji Hyo uses rubber bands
that are more elastic.)

1780
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,700
Ready.

1781
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,100
I'll be right here.

1782
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,110
(Team Ji Hyo on offense
versus Team Seok Jin on defense)

1783
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:08,580
I'll be right here.

1784
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:11,350
What is this?

1785
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,780
This.

1786
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,250
Right here. On your face.

1787
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,450
What are you doing?
Why aren't you coming?

1788
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:19,490
On your face.

1789
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,320
- This.
- Why aren't you coming?

1790
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,430
- Hey! You...
- This.

1791
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,790
What are you doing?

1792
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:26,390
- What are you doing?
- You can't put the paint...

1793
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:28,530
- all the way over there!
- Ji Ye Eun, what are you doing?

1794
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:31,100
- Hey, Ji Ye Eun!
- Hey, you have no strength...

1795
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,470
because you're always on a diet!

1796
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:33,500
How come you have no strength?

1797
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,100
You kept losing weight...

1798
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,370
- that you're now...
- Hey, get up!

1799
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,010
- You're the worst.
- Hey, get up.

1800
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,410
- She can't even get up.
- This is the best spot.

1801
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,240
- But...
- She's like a newborn calf.

1802
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,250
Why won't this work?

1803
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,050
Gosh, Yang Se Chan!

1804
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:48,350
Gosh, Ji Hyo...

1805
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:50,290
- Hey, look at Ji Hyo.
- Gosh, she's just...

1806
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:53,190
She's like the female version
of Jong Kook.

1807
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:55,660
Ji Hyo is going forward, at least.

1808
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:58,190
(As the female Jong Kook
is dominating...)

1809
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:01,100
- What is this?
- What are you doing?

1810
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,500
(Taunting)

1811
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:07,000
I'll be right here. Come on.
All right.

1812
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,700
Right here. It's this face.

1813
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,070
No, come over here. All right.

1814
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:14,510
I'm just letting you touch my face.
Come on.

1815
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:15,780
- Gosh, Ji Ye Eun. What is that?
- My gosh!

1816
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,080
- Oh, no.
- Ye Eun!

1817
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,150
It's so easy!

1818
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:21,080
Is she a newborn calf or something?
What is that?

1819
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,120
Come here!

1820
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,890
(She simply weighs a bit less.)

1821
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,450
- Hey, are you a caterpillar?
- What is she doing?

1822
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:29,190
- Darn it. This is so hard.
- Hurry up and go!

1823
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,590
- Leave her alone.
- Do your best!

1824
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:33,460
(Her arms and legs flail
like a baby calf.)

1825
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,860
Do your best!

1826
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,570
Hey, get up!

1827
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:38,800
(They all cheer for her
as if they're really watching a calf.)

1828
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,500
Why won't this work?

1829
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,600
Eat some food, kid!

1830
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,800
Come on, Ye Eun.

1831
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,010
- You have ten seconds left.
- Again.

1832
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,210
All right. Here. Come on.

1833
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:48,840
She's like a female Jong Kook.

1834
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,880
(She fails to take her first steps.)

1835
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,880
What is that?

1836
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,980
- Gosh, what's wrong with her?
- Over here...

1837
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,120
Hey, Ye Eun!

1838
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,450
- Her body seems okay, but...
- How can she be so...

1839
00:56:58,450 --> 00:56:59,790
(Moo)

1840
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,090
(Ye Eun couldn't stand up
in the end.)

1841
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,390
- This was too easy!
- See?

1842
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:05,990
- You have no strength without food.
- What is this?

1843
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,930
Do you really not have
that much strength?

1844
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:09,330
What is that?

1845
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:12,270
- Gosh, my heart breaks.
- It's because you don't eat.

1846
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:16,970
- Ji Hyo and Ye Eun have more paint.
- Yes.

1847
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,410
- Easy.
- Then, the winning team will get...

1848
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:22,340
- stamps and investment stamps.
- Okay!

1849
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:25,450
First, Team Jae Seok
and Jong Kook will go.

1850
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:26,610
- Okay!
- Sounds good.

1851
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,680
It's so hot.

1852
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,780
- I have to stamp this first, right?
- Yes, that one is...

1853
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,550
- Okay.
- Use the National Heritage Stamp...

1854
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,490
and the investment stamp.
First, go to the Cheorwon page...

1855
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,160
- in your passport.
- All right. Please open it.

1856
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,590
- Cheorwon.
- Stamp the National Heritage Stamp.

1857
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,660
Cheorwon.

1858
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,500
The Cheorwon page.

1859
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,200
(They conquered a National Heritage.
They can choose 2 hints.)

1860
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,740
- My goodness.
- Okay.

1861
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:48,840
Two of them.

1862
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,970
(Team Jae Seok's hint piece)

1863
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:54,380
There is a picture that connects.
We can't choose the same one.

1864
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,980
- If it's the same one, it'll be...
- There must be something to this.

1865
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,550
- That's right. See?
- Oh, look at this.

1866
00:57:58,550 --> 00:57:59,680
That's right.

1867
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,380
There will be something
that connects, Jae Seok.

1868
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,720
Let's go with this one.

1869
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,690
(He chooses another one.)

1870
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,160
(Team Jae Seok's hint piece)

1871
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,260
What is this?

1872
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,690
(Team Jae Seok's hint piece)

1873
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,190
What could this be?

1874
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,560
Look at this. Something like this.

1875
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,430
See? If we put these together...

1876
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:19,300
If we put them together,
we'll get something.

1877
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,840
This is... One, two? What is it?

1878
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:22,970
Oh, overlap them.

1879
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,540
(Will the secret of the investment
be revealed...)

1880
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,570
(when they overlap the hint pieces?)

1881
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:28,510
- You get this.
- What could it be?

1882
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,880
- I like this one.
- How about this, Seok Jin?

1883
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,550
- Good. Do you have good hunches?
- Okay.

1884
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,580
- Seok Jin. I have a great hunch.
- You do?

1885
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,480
- Then, you do this one.
- Okay.

1886
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,390
What is this? I'll do this one.

1887
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:39,950
All right. Let's go. I didn't look.

1888
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:42,520
(Team Seok Jin's hint piece)

1889
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,590
- What is this?
- Is that it?

1890
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,900
Darn it. Where...

1891
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,160
It's right here.

1892
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,230
- Here.
- Oh, it fell.

1893
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,600
Did it fall?

1894
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,800
(Anyway, they got a new piece
and the same one as a prior piece.)

1895
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,410
This is the same one as before.

1896
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:58,640
(Team Seok Jin's hint piece)

1897
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,480
- Is it the same one?
- Do we have to put these together?

1898
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,740
I think we have to overlap these...

1899
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,050
- Stack them together.
- to get something from it.

1900
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,680
- So, we have to keep stacking them.
- Yes.

1901
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,980
And we have to make something.

1902
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,480
You're done with your stamps.

1903
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,690
We'll move to have lunch.

1904
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:13,320
- Let's go. My gosh.
- Let's go.

1905
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:14,390
What is this?

1906
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:16,190
What could it be?
Is it a random game again?

1907
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,290
- What is this?
- What could this be?

1908
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:20,190
Is there a dish you're reminded of
when you think of Pocheon?

1909
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,630
- Idong galbi!
- Idong galbi!

1910
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:22,800
- Pocheon is all about Idong galbi.
- Idong

1911
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,170
- Galbi, Idong galbi
- Makguksu.

1912
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:27,370
- Idong galbi.
- It looks so good.

1913
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:30,000
- Pocheon is all about Idong galbi
- Oh, protein.

1914
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,510
- If you take those off...
- What's this?

1915
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:33,810
- Don't touch them, though.
- Oh, what?

1916
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:35,180
- Are these all...
- Just look at them for now.

1917
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,080
- It must be lamb.
- They're bones.

1918
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,980
- When these come up, we will...
- It's lamb?

1919
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,320
It's lamb.

1920
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,480
The ribs you see in front of you...

1921
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,950
have different amounts of meat...

1922
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,390
- on each of them.
- I know.

1923
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:47,790
You can choose the rib you want
and grill as much...

1924
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:49,720
- as you get.
- This is just...

1925
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,330
- too harsh.
- You're so cruel.

1926
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:52,530
- This is like a lucky draw.
- Also,

1927
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:55,960
the three teams that choose
the longest ribs...

1928
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,570
will get a chance to get...

1929
00:59:58,570 --> 00:59:59,700
- two investment stamps.
- Nice.

1930
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,200
- Do you have a hunch?
- Just to add,

1931
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,200
- this is your last chance.
- I have a hunch.

1932
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,300
- It's your last chance.
- Is that right?

1933
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,910
- Just look and choose a number...
- I think I know.

1934
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,540
and stand in front of it.

1935
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:09,340
- Haha, I'm great at lucky draws.
- Then, rock-paper-scissors...

1936
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:10,950
- Are you sure?
- I'm great at lucky draws.

1937
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:13,280
But no one can tell
just by looking at them.

1938
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,350
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Decide with rock-paper-scissors.

1939
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:16,420
If you don't play, you're last.

1940
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,490
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1941
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:18,820
Okay!

1942
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,250
Hey, you fool.

1943
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:23,390
(Team Seok Jin is in last place.)

1944
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:25,890
- Gosh, seriously? So annoying!
- If you don't play, you're last

1945
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:27,130
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1946
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,630
(Daniel loses.)

1947
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:30,430
- Haha, it's okay.
- Scissors!

1948
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:33,070
- That's it.
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1949
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,100
Hey, awesome.

1950
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,440
I'm even more anxious that you won.

1951
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,710
- You usually don't win.
- Then, choose numbers first.

1952
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:39,570
- All right. Choose.
- Pick a short one.

1953
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,410
- If it pops right out, it'd be bad.
- You can't pull it out yet.

1954
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:43,010
The fact that this part is
slightly lifted...

1955
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,550
Is it due to its weight?

1956
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:46,450
Or is it because it's short,
and they had to...

1957
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:47,880
- force it in?
- The investigation has begun.

1958
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,950
This one is lying flat.

1959
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,420
Is that because it's stable?

1960
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:54,190
- Gosh, what do we do?
- This is...

1961
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:57,730
- These. I think it's 1 or 2.
- Only 1 is long?

1962
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:59,430
- We just have to avoid being last.
- Hey.

1963
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:00,800
(Detective Kook's choice is
the heavy-looking number 1 or 2.)

1964
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,960
- Let's go with this one.
- I just don't want to lose.

1965
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:02,960
- You want to do this 1?
- Number 3!

1966
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,800
- Shall we go with this? Hang on.
- Number two.

1967
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,900
- This looks the most unstable.
- Really?

1968
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,000
- Between numbers 1 or 2.
- Number 3.

1969
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,700
- No one knows anyway.
- Okay, I'll listen to you.

1970
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:10,710
No one knows.

1971
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,170
- Number 2?
- Let's go. Number 2.

1972
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,610
- Out of the way.
- Choose number three.

1973
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,210
- Ye Eun, which one?
- Then, it should be number three.

1974
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:16,740
I wanted to go with number two...

1975
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:17,950
- This one is kind of in the air.
- Hey, Food Fighter.

1976
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:19,580
- Let's go with number 1.
- Number 1?

1977
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,580
No, number one is ours.

1978
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:21,880
- Give us this, just this once.
- We'll take number one.

1979
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,880
- Number 1.
- Number 1.

1980
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,090
- Let's do this.
- We are...

1981
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:26,590
very precise. I have a hunch.

1982
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:27,720
- It's this one.
- Is that so?

1983
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,390
- I have a hunch. It's this one.
- Is that so?

1984
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:30,790
- Then, it's this one.
- We choose...

1985
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,730
- number three, which you gave up.
- All right.

1986
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,800
- Let's reveal them,
- This one is in the air.

1987
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,800
- starting with number one.
- They had to shove it in by force.

1988
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,470
- Pull it out?
- No doubt.

1989
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,330
- Ji Hyo.
- If this is long...

1990
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:40,800
(Food Fighter becomes serious
when there's food on the line.)

1991
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,110
(Will Food Fighter's hunch
work this time too?)

1992
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,710
(It's long!)

1993
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,550
- See this?
- We should've picked number one.

1994
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:52,150
- Isn't that a long one?
- It's long.

1995
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:54,720
It's long. Yennie, it's a long one!

1996
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,350
(Jealous, anxious)

1997
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,550
- This one is a long.
- It must be number one.

1998
01:01:58,550 --> 01:01:59,890
- It's long. Yennie, it's long!
- It was number one.

1999
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,190
- Gosh, number one was all right.
- Then, it could be long, short,

2000
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:03,560
- long, short.
- Number one was all right.

2001
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,590
Short.

2002
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:05,930
(Will number 2 have a lot of meat
attached to it too?)

2003
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,830
- Number one was all right.
- Short.

2004
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,800
Short!

2005
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,230
(That's it.)

2006
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,670
(They chose the bone
with barely any meat on it.)

2007
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:15,770
- Long, short, long, short!
- I said number one was good too!

2008
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:16,800
Long, short.

2009
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,110
I said number one was good too.

2010
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,110
Come on. I said
we should choose number three!

2011
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:22,010
I said number one, Jae Seok.

2012
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,150
Numbers 1 or 2. Darn it.

2013
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:26,480
We should've gone with number 1.
It was either numbers 1 or 2.

2014
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,650
- Numbers 3 and 4 will go at once.
- At the same time.

2015
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,850
- At the same time?
- In 1, 2...

2016
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,220
- Two, three.
- Two, three.

2017
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,390
(Which of the two will get to feast
on galbi?)

2018
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,390
(Daniel gets
the large piece of galbi.)

2019
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:39,630
Daniel!

2020
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:42,600
(Meanwhile, Seok Jin...)

2021
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,700
(Still, there is more meat
than Team Jae Seok's bone.)

2022
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:47,170
Hang on. This is the longest.

2023
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:48,200
- This is the longest.
- Hang on.

2024
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,710
- Right, number four is the longest.
- Look at that.

2025
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:52,770
See, Haha? I was right.

2026
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,810
Except for Team Jae Seok
and Jong Kook,

2027
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:56,280
the other three teams...

2028
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,310
- will get two stamps each.
- Come on!

2029
01:02:58,310 --> 01:02:59,850
- This would've been better...
- Stamps!

2030
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:01,320
- than our choice.
- Wait.

2031
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,420
How are we supposed to grill this
and eat it?

2032
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,220
- We still get two bites.
- Right.

2033
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:07,490
- Then, you can go in and eat...
- Yes, we could have a bite each.

2034
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:09,120
- right away.
- Let's go, Ye Eun.

2035
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,490
It's a shame we don't get stamps.
Darn it. That was the worst.

2036
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:15,800
Gosh, Daniel. This is crazy.
Goodness, we have...

2037
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,800
We can't eat this. It's...

2038
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,800
Gosh, we came all the way here,
but we can't eat this.

2039
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,200
Our table is awesome.
Daniel, this is crazy.

2040
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,200
Haha.

2041
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,710
- The others have marinated crab.
- Hey, there's spicy marinated crab.

2042
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:25,970
What an abundant feast.

2043
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,840
This guy is really good.

2044
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,940
- Ji Hyo!
- This is so nice.

2045
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,580
This is insane.

2046
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:34,180
- I'm going crazy.
- I'm so happy.

2047
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:35,350
- This is better.
- Idong galbi.

2048
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,920
- An automatic deboning machine.
- Hey, this looks tasty.

2049
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,120
Right? Let's go.

2050
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,090
- You're good.
- Yes.

2051
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:43,620
I see why everyone is obsessed
with Daniel.

2052
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,390
Gosh, what's this?

2053
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:46,960
(Gosh, what's this?)

2054
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,560
- He's annoying.
- He's suddenly acting this way.

2055
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,830
He's annoying.

2056
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:51,930
- Gosh,
- How aggravating.

2057
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:54,170
- that won't satisfy anyone.
- What's that?

2058
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:56,240
We got such a small amount.

2059
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,670
Look at ours.

2060
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:58,940
What are you going to do?

2061
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,310
Jae Seok, my goodness.

2062
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:01,510
- For goodness' sake.
- My goodness.

2063
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:03,380
How did you get that
even though you picked first?

2064
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,250
We can eat the side dishes.

2065
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:08,650
Why did we even get charcoal?

2066
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:10,790
It's here to keep us warm.

2067
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:12,590
- The weather is hot.
- It's here to keep us warm.

2068
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:13,960
What's that? I see.

2069
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,860
- I know what it is.
- I think it's the sauce.

2070
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,960
- Haha.
- We'll grill it right away.

2071
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:19,490
- You have tongs over there.
- Yes.

2072
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:22,500
(He picks up the king-sized rib.)

2073
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,800
(He places it over the charcoal.)

2074
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,100
It's a proper rib.

2075
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:27,540
- Here.
- What should I do?

2076
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:28,800
Put it around the sauce.

2077
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,570
- Three layers.
- That's right.

2078
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:31,710
Three layers.

2079
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:34,810
Daniel doesn't disappoint.

2080
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:36,040
I have the best drawing skills.

2081
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,310
He's the Excitement Math teacher.

2082
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:39,510
It's "Exciting."

2083
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:41,320
- This is exciting indeed.
- It's "Exciting."

2084
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,680
Olympus Academy.

2085
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,020
- Olympus.
- Yes.

2086
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,890
- Isn't it "Olympia?"
- I don't know.

2087
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:48,420
Isn't it "Olympia?"

2088
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,520
It's hot.

2089
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,190
- We need to grill them at once.
- Yes.

2090
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,790
(Ji Hyo and Ye Eun placed 2nd.)

2091
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,200
- The weather is hot.
- It's here to keep us warm.

2092
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:55,930
(Excited)

2093
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:56,930
(Galbi makes Food Fighter smile
from ear to ear.)

2094
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:59,430
- It's so nice.
- I'm so happy.

2095
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:01,040
- This too. Shall we grill it?
- Shall we grill it?

2096
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,440
(They put the remaining garlic
on top of the meat.)

2097
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,800
- This is insane.
- My goodness.

2098
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,740
It's so nice. Galbi.

2099
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,240
- I'm so happy.
- Shall I cut it, Ji Hyo?

2100
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,940
- Shall I cut it?
- It's so nice.

2101
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,140
It looks delicious.

2102
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,680
(They can cut it easily
since it's tender.)

2103
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:14,680
This is insane.
I'm going crazy, Ji Hyo.

2104
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,720
I really want to eat it.

2105
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,050
This is insane, Daniel.

2106
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:19,850
I can't believe
Daniel made this happen.

2107
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:21,720
- Seriously.
- It's insane.

2108
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,260
We'll have a piece each.

2109
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:25,960
- What's this?
- We'll get two pieces.

2110
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,300
My goodness.

2111
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:30,700
For goodness' sake.

2112
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,730
This is too much.

2113
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,340
We should eat this.

2114
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,940
- We should eat this.
- Yes.

2115
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:38,110
We should eat side dishes.

2116
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:40,610
There aren't many side dishes.

2117
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:43,580
This is better than usual.

2118
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,150
(Eating)

2119
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,350
How is shredded white radish
so tasty?

2120
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:49,950
- You know...
- It's so tasty.

2121
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:50,950
Is this citron?

2122
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,390
These are...

2123
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:55,460
the side dishes
that go well with galbi.

2124
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,590
Try it. It's citron lotus root.

2125
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,590
It's so crunchy and nice.

2126
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,930
The meal feels so lacking
without meat.

2127
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:04,570
Eating the lotus root
makes me feel healthy. It's nice.

2128
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,730
(Trainer Kook is satisfied
with the fiber.)

2129
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:08,140
This lotus root is undercooked.

2130
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:09,440
I think it's crunchy and nice.

2131
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:13,410
I'm so bad at something like this.

2132
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:15,610
- Gosh.
- We picked a good one, right?

2133
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,610
You remain unlucky.

2134
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:19,610
- Seriously.
- You really remain unlucky.

2135
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,950
Placing first didn't help.

2136
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,520
When is the event
for the two of you?

2137
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,650
- We'll perform last.
- Is that so?

2138
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:29,260
Pocheon...

2139
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,190
Excuse me?

2140
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:33,430
- Nothing.
- Seok Jin, get some rest.

2141
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,130
- Don't worry about it.
- You're in a bad mood,

2142
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:36,560
- so you can't make good comments.
- Seriously.

2143
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,600
Daniel does well when it matters.

2144
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:40,970
Haha.

2145
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,400
This is incredible.

2146
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,840
Haha grills meat well.

2147
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,210
This is incredible.

2148
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,840
It looks delicious.

2149
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:50,610
(Covered in paint,
he eats a piece of galbi.)

2150
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:52,010
It's so tasty. My goodness.

2151
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,310
Dip it in the sauce.

2152
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,280
When you dip it in the sauce,
the taste is insane. What's this?

2153
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,690
It's no joke.

2154
01:06:57,690 --> 01:06:58,890
(CEO Ha dips the meat
in the special garlic sauce.)

2155
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,720
Dip it in the sauce.

2156
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:05,030
(The aroma of garlic envelopes
the sweet galbi.)

2157
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:06,160
Isn't it tasty?

2158
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:08,960
Gosh, this place is insane.

2159
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,800
- There's so much meat, right?
- Yes.

2160
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,500
There's so much meat.

2161
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,030
(They can put a pile of meat
in front of them.)

2162
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:16,440
- We can't keep up with the speed.
- I know.

2163
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:17,710
There's so much meat.

2164
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:19,470
This is incredible.

2165
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:20,780
It looks tasty.

2166
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,480
- I'm jealous.
- It's so tasty.

2167
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,110
- Is it tasty?
- Yes. It's no joke.

2168
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,180
This is...

2169
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:28,880
(They forget about eating.)

2170
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,220
I really want to eat it.

2171
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:32,890
(They inhale meat
as much as they want.)

2172
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:34,120
I really want to eat it.

2173
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,760
It's honestly tasty.

2174
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,920
There's so much meat.

2175
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:38,190
As for us...

2176
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:40,060
- Shall I put meat here?
- Yes.

2177
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,100
Ye Eun, it's rare for you
to get this lucky.

2178
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:45,300
Eat up. Seriously.

2179
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,630
It looks delicious.

2180
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,570
(Foodie Genius eats the meat
with pickled onion.)

2181
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:54,040
(She knits her brows
because it's so tasty.)

2182
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,810
It's tasty, right?

2183
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:57,450
I'm jealous.

2184
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,150
You know, it looks delicious.

2185
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:00,950
It's so tasty.

2186
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,390
- Eat some rice.
- I have rice.

2187
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:08,490
- Eat it.
- For goodness' sake.

2188
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:09,790
(Food Fighter savors the taste.)

2189
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:11,290
I can divide it.

2190
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:12,330
It's so tasty.

2191
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:15,030
(Due to a harsh diet,)

2192
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:18,300
(Ye Eun was like
a deflated balloon.)

2193
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,270
(She regains liveliness
thanks to galbi!)

2194
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,540
(She recharges her energy
with the strength of food.)

2195
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,740
Ye Eun is going crazy.

2196
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:29,740
I think this is a famous restaurant.

2197
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:32,710
(She gains weight as well as power.)

2198
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:34,680
Now that we're eating this...

2199
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,320
Ye Eun is eating with gusto.

2200
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,820
She's eating without talking.

2201
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:39,090
It's so tasty.

2202
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:40,820
It's so tasty.

2203
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:43,160
(I'll go on a diet once more
tomorrow.)

2204
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,030
- We have something to cut, right?
- Yes.

2205
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,460
Is there something to cut?

2206
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:47,800
- There's a small bit.
- It's nice.

2207
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:51,170
This is too much. My goodness.

2208
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,570
We should've gotten something
we could eat.

2209
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:54,940
Hey, that's...

2210
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:56,240
Hey, isn't that...

2211
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,370
- something for a dog?
- Gosh.

2212
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:00,070
Not even a dog can eat this.

2213
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:02,480
People who have a dog say.

2214
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,780
"Please pack this."

2215
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:06,010
- Seriously.
- This won't be enough for a dog.

2216
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:07,050
(Eating)

2217
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:09,980
- Seriously.
- This won't be enough for a dog.

2218
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,090
You...

2219
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:12,720
(You...)

2220
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,890
Hold on.

2221
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:15,960
- Hey, you punk.
- What?

2222
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,420
Why did the meat turn short?

2223
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,160
(The meat got halved in an instant.)

2224
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:22,900
- I checked if it was cooked.
- Hey.

2225
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:25,770
Why check if it's cooked
when there's only a tiny bit?

2226
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,330
I had to check.

2227
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,970
You're ridiculous.

2228
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:30,200
All right.

2229
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,410
- It's done.
- Cut the meat.

2230
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:34,540
Is it tasty?

2231
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:35,680
It's totally tasty.

2232
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,710
(A tiny bit)

2233
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:41,550
- Stop it.
- You punk.

2234
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:43,450
- What?
- You punk.

2235
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,790
(A strand of galbi)

2236
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:47,760
Eating this much... All right.

2237
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,390
(It's the most precious piece
of meat.)

2238
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:52,830
- Look at this.
- There's no more.

2239
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:54,300
I can't cut this part.

2240
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,100
(It's a pie in the sky
to Team Jae Seok.)

2241
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,270
At a barbecue restaurant,
they pull off the meat.

2242
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:00,630
Give me the scissors.

2243
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:01,640
(Give me the scissors.)

2244
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,540
(Jong Kook tries to pull off
what little meat there is.)

2245
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,440
There isn't any meat for us.

2246
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:08,880
If I pull it off...

2247
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,580
Look at this. Eat it.

2248
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,110
(Jong Kook puts the meat
on Jae Seok's plate.)

2249
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:13,780
There's usually meat
on the other side as well.

2250
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:15,220
But that isn't the case on our bone.

2251
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:17,790
Just eat it.

2252
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:19,520
We need to cook it thoroughly.

2253
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:21,790
Why don't we get doenjang jjigae?

2254
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:24,630
It's for a table that ordered galbi.

2255
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:25,760
(Focused)

2256
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,830
Meat you pull off
from the bone is tasty.

2257
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:30,560
- That's right.
- Yes. Meat at the end.

2258
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,300
(He succeeds in gaining meat.)

2259
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,740
It's tasty.

2260
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:41,810
Jae Seok, it's savory. Eat it.
It's savory.

2261
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,040
It's savory.

2262
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:45,950
- Eat half of it.
- I have meat.

2263
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,250
- It's okay.
- Eat half of it.

2264
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:48,650
- Gosh.
- For goodness' sake.

2265
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:50,250
You're sharing it with me.

2266
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:51,290
(His heart flutters.)

2267
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:53,620
To be honest,
I wanted to go that way.

2268
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:55,420
You asked to come this way.

2269
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:59,060
(They bickered all day long.)

2270
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,530
Look at this. Eat it.

2271
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:01,900
(Being offered half a piece of meat
melts his heart.)

2272
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,160
- Eat half of it.
- I have meat.

2273
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,400
- It's okay.
- Eat half of it.

2274
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,870
- Gosh.
- For goodness' sake.

2275
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:07,430
You're sharing it with me.

2276
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,040
(The Ttuk Kkuk brothers
are amicable.)

2277
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,070
(The old hawk looks for a chance.)

2278
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:13,710
You're sharing it with me.

2279
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:15,480
Mister.

2280
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,750
(Apprehended right away)

2281
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,910
- It's chewy. Try it.
- Seriously.

2282
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:21,280
(He gives up quickly
without using much strength.)

2283
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,180
I'll eat it in a delicious way.

2284
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:27,450
(A small bit of meat
and a spoonful of rice)

2285
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,820
(A bite of meat)

2286
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,330
(Savoring with his eyes)

2287
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:33,490
My goodness.

2288
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:34,800
(The frugal meal
leaves him dissatisfied.)

2289
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,900
Ye Eun.

2290
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,830
Would you give me the potato salad
if you aren't going to eat it?

2291
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,500
I'm going to eat it.

2292
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:41,740
Are you going to eat it?

2293
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:43,400
It tastes amazing with the sauce.

2294
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,410
Haha.

2295
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:47,040
- What is it?
- Shouldn't you give me some meat?

2296
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,040
Why?

2297
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:49,640
"Why?" You punk, you...

2298
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,740
(Annoyed)

2299
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:52,510
Listen.

2300
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,820
Seok Jin, eat some meat.

2301
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:57,820
(Daniel gives him a bone.)

2302
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:59,490
This is annoying. Hey.

2303
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:00,650
Hey, Daniel.

2304
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,090
This is driving me crazy.

2305
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,860
Does anyone like...

2306
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:07,290
- spicy marinated crab?
- Yes.

2307
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:08,530
- I like it.
- Do you like it?

2308
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:10,300
- Yes, I like it a lot.
- I like spicy marinated crab.

2309
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,430
That's good to know.

2310
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:12,600
(Carefree)

2311
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:14,800
- Come here.
- Seok Jin, suppress your anger.

2312
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,770
- Seok Jin, suppress your anger.
- He was just asking.

2313
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:18,440
- He was just asking.
- Suppress your anger.

2314
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:20,640
Hey, you acted like
you'd give it to me.

2315
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,610
- You gave me this earlier.
- I was just asking.

2316
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:23,810
- For goodness' sake.
- Try it.

2317
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:27,750
The first-place team
will get the stamps now.

2318
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:29,520
- Haha, I'll bring them.
- Go ahead.

2319
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,580
I'll bring them.

2320
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,720
It's too bad
that we won't get any stamps.

2321
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,850
Seriously.

2322
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:35,890
The stamps are the problem.

2323
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:38,760
Please pick two and stamp them.

2324
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,100
Okay. My goodness.
There are two pieces of paper.

2325
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:44,030
(This time, he'll pick 2 out of 5.)

2326
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,470
I think I should stamp this.

2327
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:51,340
(Team Haha's hint piece)

2328
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:54,340
(He receives a new hint.)

2329
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:56,280
What's this? Seriously.

2330
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,780
(He stamps another one.)

2331
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:01,280
The colors are different.

2332
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,550
(He chooses 2 without any overlaps.)

2333
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:05,050
The colors are different.
The earlier one was black.

2334
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:09,020
Will we combine them later?

2335
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,460
Perhaps we'll combine them.

2336
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,790
Since there are red and blue,

2337
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:17,000
we might wear the Expo glasses
and look at the hint pieces.

2338
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,400
What was that?

2339
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,330
The Expo. The character, Bitdori.

2340
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:21,440
(The character name is Kkumdori.)

2341
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,240
Right? Those glasses.
The holographic glasses.

2342
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,240
(He seems to be talking about
the 3D glasses.)

2343
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,440
That must be it.

2344
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:28,210
All right.

2345
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:31,510
(Team Seok Jin has
2 overlapping hint pieces out of 3.)

2346
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:32,680
I don't even need to think.

2347
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:34,380
All right.

2348
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:36,950
(Team Seok Jin's hint pieces)

2349
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:38,190
It's the same one again.

2350
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:39,620
(It's an overlapping one again.)

2351
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:41,160
It's a different one.

2352
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,320
(With the last hint piece,
his team gets 3 in total.)

2353
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,660
This one.

2354
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:46,530
(Team Ji Hyo currently has 2 hints.)

2355
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:49,760
(Team Ji Hyo's hint pieces)

2356
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,570
This one.

2357
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:55,440
There are a lot.

2358
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:56,870
My goodness.

2359
01:13:56,870 --> 01:14:00,670
(Team Ji Hyo becomes the only team
to collect 4 without any overlaps.)

2360
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:01,810
What are these?

2361
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,010
(Hint Pieces)

2362
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:07,080
(What do these hints mean?)

2363
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:08,920
Okay.

2364
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,050
Let's go.

2365
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,890
Are we meeting an investor?

2366
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:12,890
Seriously. Who could it be?

2367
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:14,990
Is the investor like
the last hurdle?

2368
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:16,020
- I guess so.
- There must be something.

2369
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,090
- There must be something.
- Yes.

2370
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:20,260
You visited the nooks and crannies
of Pocheon...

2371
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,860
- and got the investment stamps.
- That's right.

2372
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:23,930
- That's right.
- We did that.

2373
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:25,830
At the last location,

2374
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:28,240
you'll figure out
the hidden secret...

2375
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,500
of the investment stamps
you've collected.

2376
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,840
(The moment they figure out
the secret of the hint pieces)

2377
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,410
- I see.
- Then you'll naturally acquire...

2378
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:37,740
- the investment contract.
- The stamps.

2379
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:42,520
(Solve the secret of the pieces
to receive investment.)

2380
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:44,150
The investment contract...

2381
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:46,350
- can only be signed by two teams.
- Okay.

2382
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:47,890
If you succeed in signing
the contract,

2383
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:49,490
- you can go home right away.
- Can we go home?

2384
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:50,520
- Yes.
- There must be something.

2385
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,690
Once you arrive at the location,

2386
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:55,360
walk around freely
with your teammate.

2387
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,560
- Freely?
- Yes.

2388
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,400
- Okay.
- Freely

2389
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:03,440
(Which two companies
will have a successful business?)

2390
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,740
- What's this place?
- Don't be

2391
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:06,210
(Sanjeong Lake Sculpture Park)

2392
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,080
- Sanjeong Lake.
- It's Sanjeong Lake.

2393
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,540
Is it really Sanjeong Lake?

2394
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,450
- I only came here in winter.
- Sanjeok noodles?

2395
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,280
- Sanjeok noodles.
- Not sanjeok noodles.

2396
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,410
- Sanjeok noodles?
- Lake.

2397
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:16,220
- Lake.
- Sanjeong Lake.

2398
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,850
- Sanjeong Lake.
- It's my first time coming here.

2399
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:19,750
I rode a duck boat here.

2400
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,750
With whom?

2401
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:21,760
My wife.

2402
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,160
You'd better be certain.

2403
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:24,360
- Really?
- It'll get aired.

2404
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,530
Please edit it out.

2405
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:29,530
We aren't the ones
you need to worry about.

2406
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:32,070
- We trust whatever you say.
- Seok Jin.

2407
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:34,000
- I can't believe it.
- Seok Jin's face turned red.

2408
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,370
His face turned red.

2409
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,800
- I don't know if she was my wife.
- We...

2410
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,370
- We trust whatever you say.
- Okay.

2411
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:41,540
- It might lead to a problem.
- "With whom?" "My wife."

2412
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:42,880
"Never mind. Please edit it out."

2413
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:43,910
(Just as Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong's
mistake gets aired)

2414
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:45,280
What? What's this place?

2415
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,950
- Gosh, it's...
- It's an amusement park.

2416
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:48,350
- It's a pirate ship.
- What's this?

2417
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:50,120
I want to play baseball.

2418
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,750
Gosh, I want to play baseball.

2419
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:53,220
(The land of dream and hope
hides the secret of investment.)

2420
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,220
Should we go around
and do what we want?

2421
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,160
- Jong Kook, come here.
- It's a race. Let's find it.

2422
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,890
- It begins when we step out.
- Yes.

2423
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,330
- Who are we looking for?
- Who are we looking for?

2424
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:01,760
- The investor?
- The investor?

2425
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,800
What's that?

2426
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,900
Are we looking for the investor?

2427
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,400
What's this?

2428
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,430
I think we need to go on the rides.

2429
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:09,000
(The pirate ship, Team Haha)

2430
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,600
Hey, hurry up.

2431
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:13,710
- It's so big.
- We should check out the rides.

2432
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:16,410
Maybe we need to go
to the highest place...

2433
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:17,980
and look down.

2434
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:20,080
Haha.

2435
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:21,620
- Do we need to go on the rides?
- Let's go on the rides...

2436
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:23,480
and look down.

2437
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,490
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

2438
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:27,790
I'm bad at the rides.

2439
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:29,690
Haha, you'll be fine
if you bend over.

2440
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:31,790
- Bend over if you're scared.
- Sir, don't make it too long.

2441
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:33,460
- I throw up a lot.
- Ride at the front.

2442
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,760
I'm sorry. I'll shout up there.

2443
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,270
- Haha, at the top...
- I'm bad with rides.

2444
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:40,770
Oh, I... Why is it moving?

2445
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:42,300
Oh, I...

2446
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,470
(He makes a fuss
when it moves an inch.)

2447
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:44,940
It moves.

2448
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:48,310
- What's this?
- Haha, what's this?

2449
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:50,510
Do we need to look down
from the top?

2450
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:52,880
- But... Haha.
- I'm bad with rides.

2451
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,020
What could these be?
We need to look at them...

2452
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,320
- and find the investor.
- We need to find the investor.

2453
01:16:57,650 --> 01:16:59,290
(Team Haha's hint piece)

2454
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:00,390
One, two.

2455
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:02,190
(Team Haha has
3 out of 5 hint pieces.)

2456
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,560
- Don't they come together?
- Hold on. There are colors.

2457
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,660
- There are colors, right?
- Yes.

2458
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:07,230
- Blue.
- Blue, black...

2459
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:09,100
Sir, I don't think I can do this.

2460
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,430
It dropped.

2461
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,900
Let me try for a while longer.

2462
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,230
Haha, give them to me.
I'll find them.

2463
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:18,270
Gosh, suddenly... Gosh, hold on.
Gosh, my stomach.

2464
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:22,280
What are we looking at?

2465
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,180
- What? Does your stomach tickle?
- My stomach tickles.

2466
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:26,450
Haha, what should I do?

2467
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:29,420
(The newbie scaredy-cat
isn't good with the rides.)

2468
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:32,120
Where is the hint?

2469
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,250
(They suppress their fear
and look around.)

2470
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:35,460
(There's nothing.)

2471
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,630
Sir, I don't think I can do this.
I'm sorry.

2472
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:41,260
(They give up after 10 seconds.)

2473
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:43,330
I'm about to throw up. Are you okay?

2474
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:45,200
- Haha, I'm okay.
- No.

2475
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:46,700
- Haha, I'm okay.
- No.

2476
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:49,270
(Retching)

2477
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,640
(He's about to throw up galbi.)

2478
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:53,870
My goodness.

2479
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:57,210
- Are you okay?
- I...

2480
01:17:57,310 --> 01:17:59,350
We just had a meal. Sir, I'm sorry.

2481
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:00,450
(They nearly give up
on trying to find a hint.)

2482
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:02,420
I bet you haven't seen a weaker man.

2483
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:04,450
I find it fascinating too.

2484
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:05,450
(While the two scaredy-cats
suffer on the pirate ship)

2485
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:07,150
Aircraft Jang Yeong Sil.

2486
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:08,920
Gosh, people will get
a history lesson here.

2487
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:10,320
- Aircraft Kang Kam Chan.
- Aircraft Kang Kam Chan.

2488
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,430
- There's a camera.
- There's a camera.

2489
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:14,390
(They find another camera.)

2490
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:16,460
Will we get something
if we go on the ride? No, right?

2491
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,300
If we go on this ride...

2492
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,100
Do we need to go up in the sky...

2493
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:22,870
- and use these as maps?
- Is that it?

2494
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:25,570
Do we need to go up in the sky
and use these as maps?

2495
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:28,310
- Maybe that's the way to go.
- But we won't go up far.

2496
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:29,340
Still, we'll be in the sky.

2497
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:31,040
- Maybe they make up...
- Okay.

2498
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,250
- a big map.
- Do they make up a map?

2499
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,380
- Look at this. Isn't this a train?
- What?

2500
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,280
I think...
It's made of tracing paper.

2501
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,450
There must be a reason.

2502
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:39,850
- Maybe we need to layer them.
- Of course.

2503
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:41,560
- Maybe we need to go somewhere...
- And stick them.

2504
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,560
- and hold them up.
- I don't think I can do this.

2505
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,590
I'm sorry.

2506
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:45,430
- See? They're on a ride.
- They're on a ride.

2507
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,090
I can't go on the pirate ship.
I'll throw up.

2508
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:48,730
- I'll throw up too.
- I'll throw up.

2509
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:50,060
The pirate ship
will make me throw up.

2510
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:52,630
(They refuse to go
on the pirate ship.)

2511
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:55,970
Maybe we need to go on this ride.

2512
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,310
If it spins, I'll throw up.

2513
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:01,710
But there's a camera.
Should we go on this ride?

2514
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:03,180
- Should we go on that ride?
- The roller coaster?

2515
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:04,540
- The dragon coaster.
- Let's go on that ride.

2516
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,950
Let's see what's there.

2517
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:08,250
(They move to go on an easier ride,
the dragon coaster.)

2518
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:10,450
(Team Haha, Team Jae Seok)

2519
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:12,320
There's a camera here as well.

2520
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,390
Right?

2521
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,690
Why...

2522
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:16,490
Let's go on this ride.

2523
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:18,020
- Shall we do that?
- Okay.

2524
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,360
- All right.
- Shall we do that?

2525
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:21,130
How strange.
Why are we going on this ride?

2526
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:22,630
Make sure they don't fly away.

2527
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:24,970
I won't throw up
unless it's a spinning ride.

2528
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:27,470
You're right.
I'll wear my cap like this.

2529
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,570
This isn't an intense ride.

2530
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:31,710
Still.

2531
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:34,470
Blue, red, and black.

2532
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:35,980
The colors must mean something.

2533
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:36,980
(What's the connection
between the rides and the pieces?)

2534
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,550
- Blue, red...
- Come to think of it, it's blue.

2535
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:40,980
Red.

2536
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,650
This one is black. My goodness.

2537
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,120
(The roller coaster sets off.)

2538
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,260
- Gosh.
- Why are you going, "Gosh?"

2539
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:50,690
- Why are you going, "Gosh?"
- It's more than I expected...

2540
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:52,560
- This is so...
- Jae Seok, look.

2541
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,630
It's similar to the drawing.

2542
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,500
(How are these similar?)

2543
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,630
It's similar.

2544
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:01,230
(They enter the section
with the highest speed.)

2545
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,370
It's similar.

2546
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:05,670
Seriously. Jae Seok, it's fast.

2547
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:07,070
- It's fast.
- Look around.

2548
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:11,750
- Why is it so fast?
- Jae Seok, look around.

2549
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:12,980
(CEO Kim searches for the hints
with his small eyes.)

2550
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:13,980
Hold on.

2551
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:15,220
(CEO Kim searches for the hints
with his small eyes.)

2552
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,280
What? Igloo.

2553
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,390
Igloo...

2554
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:22,760
(The roller coaster
goes down again!)

2555
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:28,130
(They keep spinning
without any gain.)

2556
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:30,400
- Children...
- Gosh.

2557
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:33,900
Jae Seok,
children will love this ride.

2558
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:35,700
- For goodness' sake.
- My goodness.

2559
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,500
Even the dragon coaster
isn't an easy ride.

2560
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,170
So this is the dragon coaster. Gosh.

2561
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:40,440
Hold on. Where...

2562
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,640
(UFO, miniature car)

2563
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:42,680
Okay.

2564
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:45,180
We'll get motion sickness.

2565
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:46,480
- Shall we ride this?
- Let's ride this.

2566
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,180
Okay. There's a camera.

2567
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:49,620
I feel queasy.

2568
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,350
It's for two people.

2569
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:53,650
- Seok Jin.
- Yes? Let's go.

2570
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,190
I think we need to solve something.

2571
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:56,520
What are we supposed to... I see.

2572
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,360
- Se Chan, as we pass by,
- Okay.

2573
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:01,090
we might see words.

2574
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:04,030
We might see words as we pass by,
so look for them.

2575
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,700
Is this all?

2576
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:08,170
Hold on. Is this all?

2577
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:10,140
What's this?

2578
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,740
- There's nothing.
- There's nothing.

2579
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:15,080
This ride is for babies.

2580
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,810
(Serious)

2581
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:18,080
What's this?

2582
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:19,910
Look at the ceiling.

2583
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,580
- There's nothing, right? Se Chan.
- There's nothing.

2584
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,250
(There's nothing.)

2585
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:26,390
Look between the cars.

2586
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,890
(They even look between the cars.)

2587
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:29,190
There's nothing, right?

2588
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:30,720
(They even look between the cars.)

2589
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,790
I don't know what to do.

2590
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:34,830
Seok Jin, there's nothing.

2591
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,560
There's nothing, right?
Hey, let's see the hint pieces.

2592
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,270
- Okay.
- Let's layer them.

2593
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,100
Take a look. There you go.

2594
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:43,770
- Nice.
- It's like this.

2595
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:45,440
Put the squares together.

2596
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,440
The images are different, so...

2597
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:49,110
- Turn this.
- Okay.

2598
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:50,540
Like this.

2599
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:52,150
(They turn change the directions.)

2600
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:54,880
Doesn't it look like a map
that leads somewhere?

2601
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:56,880
- Seriously.
- The circles...

2602
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:00,090
That team...

2603
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:01,860
is layering the hint pieces.

2604
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:04,390
- What happens then?
- Something must be different.

2605
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:06,460
We can see them like this...

2606
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:08,130
or like this.

2607
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:10,000
Hold on. Isn't this it?

2608
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:11,970
Look. This is the route.

2609
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:13,700
One, two... One.

2610
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,440
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

2611
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:19,110
(Unsure)

2612
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:21,310
Maybe something is over here.

2613
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,180
(Blinking)

2614
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:24,810
- Like this.
- I have no idea.

2615
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:26,380
This is...

2616
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:28,550
(The tragedy is that Ji Hyo is
the brainy one in the team.)

2617
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:30,550
- I can't see them.
- Isn't it...

2618
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:33,920
- What should we do?
- The Roman...

2619
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,460
Isn't it Greek?

2620
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:38,290
(The empty-headed sisters
rack their brains diligently.)

2621
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:40,630
Jae Seok, maybe 1 and 2 are
a password.

2622
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,260
What is it?
(The two of them exit
the dragon coaster.)

2623
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,800
Do we really need to go
on the rides?

2624
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:49,470
- Hold on. Come here.
- What?

2625
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,840
- Jae Seok, this is it.
- Let's see.

2626
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:58,040
This is it. It's a map.

2627
01:22:58,310 --> 01:23:00,350
- Hold on.
- Jae Seok, here.

2628
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:06,550
(Jong Kook and Seok Jin said
that they were like maps.)

2629
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:07,620
This is it.

2630
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:09,160
- Flip it over.
- Isn't this it?

2631
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,160
- Yes! Seok Jin, that's right!
- The circles.

2632
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,190
- What?
- Isn't this it?

2633
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:14,690
(Uninvited guests turn up.)

2634
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:15,930
(Flustered)

2635
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:16,960
What?

2636
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,670
You can't look.

2637
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:20,770
- We have hints too.
- We came here to see it.

2638
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:22,540
- You can't look.
- All right.

2639
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:24,200
- Go ahead.
- We'll go next.

2640
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,470
(Team Seok Jin has
a similar hint piece.)

2641
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:28,310
- It's the general map.
- Yes.

2642
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:29,340
We were right.

2643
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:31,040
- It's the general map.
- Yes.

2644
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,310
(Amusement park map,
Team Seok Jin's hint piece)

2645
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:34,380
It's the general map.

2646
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:36,880
We need to use these pieces
to find the investor.

2647
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:38,850
It looks the same as this.

2648
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:40,050
Right. Where is this?

2649
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:42,120
It's here. Right here.

2650
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,990
Right. Here.

2651
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:45,660
- Here.
- Here.

2652
01:23:46,290 --> 01:23:49,330
- We don't have all five.
- We're lacking some of them.

2653
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:52,200
(It becomes a map
locating the rides.)

2654
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,200
(Team Jae Seok's hints)

2655
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,300
(Then what do these hints indicate?)

2656
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:55,640
This hint locates these.

2657
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:57,700
- Right.
- Jae Seok.

2658
01:23:58,170 --> 01:23:59,970
The order. One and two.

2659
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:02,310
One, two.

2660
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,050
They're looking from behind.
I'll cover you.

2661
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,450
One, two.

2662
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:09,280
(Team Seok Jin's hints)

2663
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,120
- This is the order.
- This is 1 and 2.

2664
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,750
- One and two.
- One and two.

2665
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:13,890
(They got a peep
at Team Jae Seok's hint.)

2666
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:16,320
One and two here. One, two?

2667
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:21,430
- Hey.
- What?

2668
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,760
- Hey.
- What?

2669
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,200
- Y, R...
- What? Y.

2670
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,970
- Y, R.
- R.

2671
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:29,940
Y, R.

2672
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,170
What's Y and R?

2673
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:36,280
(CEO Yang with sharp eyes)

2674
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:39,350
- You get an R mark.
- An R mark?

2675
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:40,950
(Whispering)

2676
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:43,520
- An R mark?
- There's an R mark.

2677
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,550
(They found the R mark.)

2678
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:46,190
- It's crazy.
- Come here.

2679
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:47,720
Where are you going? Come here.

2680
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,160
(The secret of the hints...)

2681
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,860
(Two R marks appear
when the hint papers overlap.)

2682
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,190
- You get an R mark.
- An R mark?

2683
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:55,260
Look. It's an R mark.

2684
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:56,260
(They point to specific rides.)

2685
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,360
- Get lost.
- Quiet.

2686
01:24:58,030 --> 01:24:59,670
I got goosebumps.

2687
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:02,100
Where are they?

2688
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:04,140
- R marks.
- R marks. We should go here.

2689
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:05,770
- Where is it?
- Where is it? It's an R mark.

2690
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:07,670
- It's the UFO.
- It's an R mark.

2691
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:09,810
- Come here.
- It's crazy.

2692
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:11,710
- Come.
- It is an R mark, right?

2693
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:13,210
- Right. It's an R mark.
- It is an R mark.

2694
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:14,350
Should we combine our hints?

2695
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:15,720
- What should we do?
- What?

2696
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,820
- Should we combine our hints?
- Seok Jin.

2697
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:19,820
It's the UFO. Hold on.

2698
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,150
First...

2699
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:23,860
- We know what it is.
- Are you sure?

2700
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:25,330
UFO...

2701
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:26,430
- Hey.
- Jae Seok.

2702
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:27,590
Come this way.

2703
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,260
- Jae Seok.
- It's the UFO. Let's go.

2704
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,830
Let's go to the UFO.

2705
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,130
- This...
- He's coming. Se Chan is coming.

2706
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:37,270
(Se Chan goes after them!)

2707
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:38,570
(Who will get on the UFO first?)

2708
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:40,040
- It's this way.
- We have to run.

2709
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:41,170
This is the right one.

2710
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:44,140
(It's Team Jae Seok.)

2711
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,180
But it's...

2712
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:46,180
(Team Jae Seok quickly went
to the answer.)

2713
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:48,450
- Is this the one?
- Shouldn't we shout out something?

2714
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:50,380
There should be something here.

2715
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:53,190
- It's coming.
- It's crazy.

2716
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:54,850
- What's happening?
- Hey.

2717
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:57,460
(A drone comes to them.)

2718
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:58,990
- Something is coming.
- Something is coming.

2719
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:00,660
- Something is coming. Why?
- Something is coming.

2720
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:02,160
- Why is it coming?
- Why is it coming?

2721
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,570
(The drone came
with a blue envelope.)

2722
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:09,970
(What's inside the envelope?)

2723
01:26:09,970 --> 01:26:11,000
Jae Seok.

2724
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:16,340
(Investment Contract)

2725
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:19,180
- Okay.
- How...

2726
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:20,810
Congratulations, Team Jae Seok
and Jong Kook.

2727
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:22,620
You succeeded
in attracting investment.

2728
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,080
You can gladly get off work.

2729
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,020
- Okay!
- Okay!

2730
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:27,750
- We're in trouble.
- There is news...

2731
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,520
that Pocheon's Big Hand decided...

2732
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:30,860
- to invest one million dollars...
- Hey!

2733
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:32,160
- worth of R money in Ttuk Kkuk AI.
- We got the investment!

2734
01:26:32,190 --> 01:26:33,890
- They got it.
- We can't go there again?

2735
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:36,000
- No. You should go somewhere else.
- We have to find a different place?

2736
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,000
- That was the location.
- Come here.

2737
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,730
That's the one, then.
There is one more.

2738
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:41,940
There is another one?
Do you know where it is?

2739
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:48,140
(Ssaebssaeb took a peek
at Team Jae Seok's hint earlier.)

2740
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:49,980
- Let's go quickly.
- Come this way.

2741
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,440
I think there's an R mark here.

2742
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,380
- I think that's this one.
- Then...

2743
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:56,020
- Even the second team can get it.
- Yes.

2744
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:57,480
(Only one team can get exempted
from the penalty now.)

2745
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,520
Goodness.

2746
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,290
We solved the hint, though.

2747
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:01,620
(Which team will get on
the Jumping Boat and leave work?)

2748
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,090
- It's here.
- What?

2749
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:05,120
- It's over.
- It's here.

2750
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,130
(Haha and Daniel?)

2751
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:12,370
(The math teachers solved

2752
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:14,200
- It's this one.
- This one.

2753
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,700
Let's ride that and see.

2754
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:17,570
Wait. Can you ride this?

2755
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:18,710
I'll get on it.

2756
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:21,170
(They ride the Jumping Boat
unwillingly.)

2757
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:24,640
- I think it's coming to us.
- What is it?

2758
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:27,050
- Is it not?
- What is that?

2759
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:28,620
I think it will drop something.

2760
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:30,580
- Where is it going?
- Right?

2761
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:32,490
- What is this?
- My eyes. My head.

2762
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:33,890
- It's so bright.
- Come down.

2763
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:35,190
- Give it to us.
- We got it.

2764
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:36,460
- Right. We got it.
- Haha.

2765
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:37,460
Mister.

2766
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:38,790
What?

2767
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:39,790
(Feeling envious)

2768
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:41,060
- An investment contract!
- An investment contract!

2769
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:42,630
"Congratulations! You succeeded
in attracting investment."

2770
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:43,630
"You can get off work
with the contract."

2771
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:45,570
- We can get off work!
- Goodness.

2772
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:47,970
Pocheon Warren Buffett's
last investment site...

2773
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:50,070
was revealed to be Exciting Math.

2774
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:51,100
(Exciting Math is the last startup
to be invested by K-Warren Buffett!)

2775
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,640
They got it by chance.
We knew after solving the puzzle.

2776
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,070
- We're going!
- It was this place.

2777
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:56,410
- We're leaving!
- Mister.

2778
01:27:56,410 --> 01:27:58,310
- It was this one.
- What? You may speak.

2779
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,950
- We're going home!
- You...

2780
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:02,050
- When did you get here?
- Yes. The UFO.

2781
01:28:02,050 --> 01:28:03,450
- It's not fair for us.
- It was crazy.

2782
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:04,480
It was funny for us.

2783
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:06,790
(What's more...)

2784
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:10,560
(They missed the chance
in the very beginning.)

2785
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:11,790
We solved the puzzle.

2786
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:13,330
- You thought that was where R was.
- That's what we thought.

2787
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:14,330
Right.

2788
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:16,160
Then we saw this one,
but they were riding it.

2789
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,560
They were riding it. Yes.

2790
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:19,330
- Let's go!
- We're getting off work.

2791
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:21,200
- Bye.
- Bye.

2792
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,000
- Bye!
- Bye.

2793
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,110
- Hey. Exciting Math! Yes!
- Yes!

2794
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:28,570
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

2795
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:30,440
We should leave without our mics.

2796
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,210
The audio!

2797
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:33,880
- Exciting!
- Math Department!

2798
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,280
- Cross!
- Cross!

2799
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,680
The science department.

2800
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:38,690
But I studied liberal arts.

2801
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:40,390
I scored five in maths.
Did you know that?

2802
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:42,590
I got one correct.

2803
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:44,590
- The mic? Okay.
- The mic.

2804
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:45,830
(Their mics are removed too.)

2805
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:47,290
It's...

2806
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:49,300
- What is it?
- That...

2807
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:50,900
- I hate bugs. Help me.
- Hey.

2808
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,500
- Is it gone?
- He's...

2809
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,070
- Is it gone?
- It's gone.

2810
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,070
- Why are you scared of this?
- Don't do that!

2811
01:28:57,070 --> 01:28:58,640
I'm so scared of bugs.

2812
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,610
It's gone. Hey!

2813
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:03,880
I've never seen
such a coward before.

2814
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:05,580
- Is it gone?
- We were really unlucky.

2815
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:06,950
Are we the last?

2816
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:09,150
Shall we put
the same colors together?

2817
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:10,620
Overlap the same colors.

2818
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:13,990
(The spaceship starts moving!)

2819
01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:15,960
One, two, two.

2820
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:20,090
It's scary!

2821
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:21,560
It's been a long time
since I last rode this.

2822
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:22,700
(The spaceship starts moving alone.)

2823
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:24,030
Do we have to ride the blue one?

2824
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:26,070
- Let's just go high.
- Hold on.

2825
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:28,170
- Hi!
- This isn't the time for that.

2826
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:29,840
- We have to get off work.
- Hi!

2827
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,200
- Hi.
- Everyone's gone.

2828
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,370
We shouldn't be doing this.

2829
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:33,670
- It's not the time for this.
- For the penalty,

2830
01:29:33,670 --> 01:29:35,980
you have to get
the get-off-work stamp.

2831
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:39,280
The get-off-work stamp
is in the middle of Sanjeong Lake.

2832
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:42,220
(They get on the chick boat.)

2833
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:43,520
- Goodness.
- Seriously.

2834
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,950
- Did you bring the passport?
- I brought the passport.

2835
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:47,350
(They flee
from the angry investors...)

2836
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:48,990
Let's go.

2837
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:51,360
- Is this moving forward?
- How is it? Is it doable?

2838
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,160
- It's tiresome.
- Is it doable, Se Chan?

2839
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,590
- Drive it...
- It's nice.

2840
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,830
- The water is really clear.
- It's Chick Boat Two.

2841
01:29:57,830 --> 01:30:00,100
- Let's go.
- Shall we do it together?

2842
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:01,530
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

2843
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:03,070
- Let's go quickly.
- Why is it shaking so much?

2844
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:04,340
Is it that one?

2845
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,770
- Where...
- The one in the middle.

2846
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:08,670
- The boat...
- It's really tiresome.

2847
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:11,580
Goodness.
My thighs are getting tired.

2848
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,380
- You feel it.
- You feel it already, right?

2849
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:15,550
- Let's go.
- One, two.

2850
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:18,150
- One, two.
- One, two.

2851
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:20,390
- One, two.
- This is hard work.

2852
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:21,420
Why is it so...

2853
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,160
- You're not pedaling, are you?
- I am.

2854
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:27,690
(I'm pretending to do so.)

2855
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:29,030
Hey.

2856
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,730
- That was why I was struggling.
- I'll do it now.

2857
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,070
(CEO Jee is being tricked
by his ex-swindler partner.)

2858
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:36,500
- I'm tired.
- Go a bit further.

2859
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,700
- One, two.
- You're not doing it now.

2860
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,970
(Cha cha)

2861
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:42,040
Okay.

2862
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:44,180
Okay.

2863
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,910
- I'll start pedaling.
- That was why it didn't move.

2864
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:47,780
(It takes a long time to get there
because of the fake pedaling!)

2865
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:50,050
- Be careful.
- Don't worry.

2866
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:52,550
- I should pull this.
- Those are cherry blossoms.

2867
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:53,720
They're so pretty.

2868
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,290
You're seeing the cherry blossoms
of this year with me.

2869
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:58,060
I'm seeing them with you.
I like that.

2870
01:30:58,060 --> 01:30:59,090
There are cherry blossoms
over there too.

2871
01:30:59,090 --> 01:31:01,330
Gosh. This is nice.

2872
01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:02,800
I like this.

2873
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,500
They're so pretty.

2874
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,400
But my legs are starting to hurt.

2875
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:09,900
We can just go home slowly.

2876
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:11,470
Right. Let's go home slowly.

2877
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:13,110
I can go home slowly.

2878
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:14,110
Stamp it.

2879
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:15,740
They said we have to stamp it
to go home.

2880
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:16,780
Okay. Good.

2881
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:18,240
This looks fun.

2882
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:20,680
- This looks fun!
- Don't touch it!

2883
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,280
Please stamp ours too.

2884
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:24,920
Please stamp ours, Se Chan.

2885
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:28,050
I'll stamp it if you let me
stamp it on your forehead.

2886
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:29,960
- This one!
- Okay. Stamp on it.

2887
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:33,730
(He stamps on her forehead.)

2888
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:35,390
Okay. You can get off work.

2889
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:36,800
(Laughing)

2890
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,300
- Look at Ye Eun.
- Se Chan!

2891
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:39,370
Hurry.

2892
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:40,400
(Laughing)

2893
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:42,540
I'm getting off work.

2894
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:44,070
- Well done, everyone.
- Thank you.

2895
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:45,640
- It's cute.
- It's cute.

2896
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,810
This is really pretty, Ji Hyo.
It's the best shot.

2897
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:49,410
- No. Thank you.
- Thank you.

2898
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:51,480

double life of the killers)

juniors must obey.)

2907
01:32:06,490 --> 01:32:07,490
(Hurry up!)

2908
01:32:07,490 --> 01:32:09,000
(Did you call for me?)

2909
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,660
(Workplace romance is a bonus.)

2910
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:12,400
(If you eat this,
you have to go out with me.)

2911

came down while they were chatting.)

(they capture a zone!)

2915
01:32:23,310 --> 01:32:24,810
(And...)

2916
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:27,550
(The killers begin their work.)

2917
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:28,880
(Seung Ho!)

2918
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:29,880
