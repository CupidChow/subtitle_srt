1
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:21,354
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,039
Ji-na!

3
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,417
Ji-na…

4
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:43,918
Mom.

5
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,921
You see…

6
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:52,677
Tell me everything that happened.
Don't leave out a single detail.

7
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,898
ART ROOM

8
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,079
The art classroom has no CCTVs.

9
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,498
I saved footage taken
from the CCTVs in the hallway.

10
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,335
-We'll call you after we analyze this.
-Okay.

11
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,342
Ms. Kim Jin-hee.

12
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,635
Oh, Mr. Paik.

13
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,762
-Did they find anything?
-Not yet.

14
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,473
The police left
with the security camera footage.

15
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,643
How is Shi-an? Is her surgery over?

16
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,769
No, not yet.

17
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:47,106
-Did you see Shi-an's phone by any chance?
-No, I didn't see it.

18
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,025
It wasn't in the art room either.

19
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:53,947
But her surgery is taking so long.
My goodness.

20
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,867
I'm going crazy.

21
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,953
What's wrong? Do you know something?

22
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:05,458
If you've seen anything suspicious,
please tell me. Please.

23
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,086
Mom.

24
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,632
What happens if she dies?

25
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,925
Shut up!

26
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,387
Don't say a word.

27
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,849
Don't make matters worse.

28
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,687
If you make things worse,
I won't tolerate it.

29
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,442
Even though you're my daughter.

30
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,319
Understand?

31
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,202
I'm going into a meeting.

32
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,915
I was leaving the office
to go to a meeting.

33
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,959
Hey, Ji-na. Where are you going?

34
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,006
I don't know how to say this.

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,174
Why? What happened?

36
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,846
Shi-an is so dead.

37
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,056
I'm going to kill her.

38
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,146
-Are you certain?
-What should we do?

39
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,607
What can we do now?

40
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,903
It's hard to tell whether she actually
did it though. I wasn't at the scene.

41
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,196
That's why I couldn't say
anything to the police.

42
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,909
It's too early to tell if that's
what happened. I was also afraid.

43
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,286
Thank you for telling me this.

44
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,788
Did you see Ji-na after that?

45
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,707
I tried looking for her afterward.

46
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,711
But I couldn't see her anywhere
after Shi-an got hurt.

47
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,421
I understand. I'll stay in touch.

48
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,818
Did you analyze the footage taken
from Asung Academy?

49
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,528
Yes, we have. Sit down, please.

50
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,597
Hello?

51
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,975
Yes.

52
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,186
The surgery is over.
She's in the ICU right now.

53
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,521
She's still unconscious?

54
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,815
Now don't be shocked by
what I'm about to tell you.

55
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,442
Go ahead. What is it?

56
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:40,446
I just saw the hallway footage.
I'm going to see Principal Noh right now.

57
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,742
I need to check whether Ji-na had anything
to do with Shi-an's accident.

58
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,036
-Ji-na?
-Yes.

59
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,831
Ms. Kim just told me that…

60
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,466
I'll go with you.

61
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,886
I need to meet her too.
As Shi-an's guardian.

62
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,526
Passcode.

63
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,779
Unlocked.

64
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,364
The door is open.

65
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,537
The door is closed.

66
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,011
Are you on your way, Mr. Jang?

67
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,723
Please come here quickly. Okay.

68
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,003
Bring me all the security footage
in the school

69
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,381
and report to me about the police
investigation over this accident.

70
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,177
Is that you, Mr. Jang?

71
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,268
Choi Shi-an's legal guardian
wishes to see you, Principal.

72
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,556
-What is this about, Officer?
-I came to request your cooperation.

73
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,851
-Where is your daughter, Kim Ji-na?
-Why are you asking?

74
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,396
Because she possibly
is the assailant who injured Shi-an.

75
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,690
Assailant? Based on what evidence?

76
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,568
Have a look at the security footage first.

77
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,535
Ji-na is seen running out of the art room
after Shi-an was injured.

78
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,329
So? Is that all you have?

79
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,374
The footage shows she was
the closest person to the scene

80
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,960
of the accident
before other students discovered Shi-an.

81
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,005
How can you claim that my daughter
is the assailant based on that?

82
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,716
Someone overheard Ji-na
saying she would hurt her.

83
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,217
Shi-an is so dead.

84
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,344
I'm going to kill her.

85
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,679
Just based on those words,

86
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,015
you're claiming that
my daughter hurt Shi-an?

87
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,144
I'd like to talk to Ji-na.

88
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,940
I want to ask her
what caused her to say those words.

89
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,070
You're here, Mr. Jang.

90
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,408
You already lawyered up, I see.

91
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,328
As the principal,
it's my duty to call our legal team

92
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,498
after such a serious accident
took place on school grounds.

93
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,082
He's a police officer.

94
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,127
And this is Choi Shi-an's legal guardian.

95
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,379
They're accusing Ji-na
of being the attacker

96
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,381
and want to speak to her right now.

97
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,343
How can you treat her like a suspect
without concrete evidence?

98
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:34,096
My client will not comply.
Please follow the proper procedures.

99
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,016
We didn't say
she was a person of interest yet.

100
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,601
We'll send you a police summons,

101
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,811
so please cooperate
with our investigation.

102
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:41,729
Okay, Officer.

103
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,902
Hello?

104
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,862
You're Choi Shi-an's guardian, correct?

105
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,905
Yes, I am.

106
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,575
-Could you come to the hospital right now?
-What? Right now?

107
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,037
I'll be there right away.

108
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,288
Is it the hospital?

109
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,915
Yes, I think I have to go.

110
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,041
Let's go.

111
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,836
I'll return tomorrow
to talk to your daughter.

112
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,674
-Make her available for questioning.
-Sure, Officer.

113
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,219
You better pray that Shi-an gets better.

114
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,264
Your life depends on it
more than anyone else's.

115
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,891
Let's go.

116
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,693
Are you all right?

117
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,951
I have

118
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,621
truthfully told you
all the facts of the situation.

119
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,043
What will happen to Ji-na in this case?

120
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,629
She has to deny she did it intentionally.

121
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,091
And she needs to say that it happened
accidentally while they were arguing.

122
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,635
Then we can use
an unintentional assault defense.

123
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,764
But the real issue is
whether the student dies.

124
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:03,769
What if she does?
In that case, what will happen?

125
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,938
It'll be considered
involuntary manslaughter.

126
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,898
And Ji-na could be sentenced.

127
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,405
How about offering a settlement
to the victim's guardian?

128
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,700
Since she's not even the student's mother.
She's just a guardian.

129
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,416
A settlement?

130
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:32,882
Do you think they would
accept a settlement?

131
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,177
They're going to use
this incident to pressure me.

132
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,054
They would never agree to a settlement.

133
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,431
And I became

134
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,225
a member of the board today.

135
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,312
Soon, I'll be succeeding my dad
and becoming the foundation's chairwoman.

136
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,398
I worked so hard to get here.

137
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,859
I waited so long for this day.

138
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,156
We just need to cover it up.

139
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,283
Cover it all up.

140
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,203
Nothing will go wrong.

141
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,997
No problems, whatsoever.

142
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,751
We thought she had regained consciousness.

143
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,544
But her condition has deteriorated.

144
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,926
How long will she be in a coma?

145
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,969
Her recovery is taking longer
than I expected.

146
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,348
We're monitoring her carefully
in case she suffers internal bleeding.

147
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,725
-Please do your best, Doctor.
-I will.

148
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,524
Shi-an.

149
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,026
Can you hear my voice?

150
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,619
Stay strong.
I'm hoping to see you awake tomorrow.

151
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,708
CHOI SHI-AN

152
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,043
DELETE MESSAGES

153
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,923
4 MESSAGES SELECTED

154
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:56,841
DELETED

155
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,057
Is it true

156
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,852
you said you would kill her?

157
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,687
I didn't mean it like that.

158
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,981
-I said it out of anger.
-You!

159
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,652
I don't care what you meant
when you said those words.

160
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:22,741
When you talk to the police tomorrow,
tell them you never said it. Understand?

161
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,079
Shi-an isn't dead, is she?

162
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,291
How can you worry about her right now?

163
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,920
If she wakes up, she could implicate you.

164
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,966
She'll tell the police exactly
what you did to her.

165
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,678
I didn't do anything to her.
I told you everything, Mom.

166
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,763
I really didn't do anything…

167
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,892
I don't believe a word you say.

168
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,061
You always had issues with her.

169
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,231
It wouldn't surprise me at all
if you did something very vicious.

170
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,817
You're capable of doing such things.

171
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,822
Don't make that dumb expression.
Now listen carefully.

172
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,995
You must not mention
the global gifted class to the police,

173
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,498
or that textbook.

174
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,921
Ji Yoon-su and Mr. Paik didn't seem
to know about the textbook.

175
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,923
So don't slip up.

176
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,760
If you mention it by mistake,
you're going to get it.

177
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,348
What? Are you scared?

178
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,769
-Over a matter like this?
-Mom.

179
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,563
Ji-na.

180
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,984
Why do you make me so mad?

181
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,069
I found myself praying like this.

182
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,409
You're not going home?

183
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,911
You should get some sleep.

184
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,875
Even if I go home,
I don't think I'll be able to sleep.

185
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,254
The bathroom is over there.

186
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,964
So use it if you want to wash up.

187
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,633
Drink this while it's still warm.

188
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,303
Thank you.

189
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,056
I'll go to the precinct in the morning
to check what time Ji-na will be coming,

190
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,225
and find out
what she said under questioning.

191
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,978
I'll also ask
if there'll be any other witnesses.

192
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,732
I'm going to stop by the school
and talk with the students.

193
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,443
There might be someone else
who knows about the textbook.

194
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,695
I'll find a way to see Ji-na.

195
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,864
You should reconsider that.

196
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,074
Principal Noh probably won't allow it.

197
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:13,495
Ji-na might be
in a frightened state right now.

198
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,831
She could be too scared

199
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,501
to say anything or seek out
someone who would listen to her.

200
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,836
Let's find that out on our own.

201
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,881
When Shi-an wakes up,

202
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,216
let's answer all of her questions
and let her know

203
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,719
what happened to her.

204
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,139
All right, let's do that.

205
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,517
What? It's Senator Sung!

206
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,145
Could you please comment
about your upcoming court case?

207
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,856
Do you really have no knowledge
that your daughter cheated?

208
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,275
Ms. Yoo, why are you pleading
guilty to the charges?

209
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,985
What about Ms. Sung?

210
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,447
The cheating scandal case will be
heard by the Seoul District Court today,

211
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,699
and prosecutors
will charge Ms. Yoo Hye-mi.

212
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,909
I'm very sorry

213
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:56,789
for letting the public down
due to my wife's actions.

214
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,501
I had no inkling
whatsoever of my wife's involvement.

215
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,713
I sincerely apologize to all parents

216
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,174
with children who probably felt anger

217
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,303
and disillusionment towards my family.

218
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:20,187
We shall humbly accept the court's
judgment no matter the outcome.

219
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,606
Do you have anything to say, Ms. Yoo?

220
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,820
I have made a big mistake
that no one should have ever done.

221
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,449
As a mother with great expectations
for my daughter,

222
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,411
I had a lapse of judgment
that I deeply regret.

223
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,413
-I'm very sorry.
-The college your daughter

224
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,916
was accepted to discuss her acceptance.
Do you have anything to say?

225
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,210
I'm sorry, Ye-lin.

226
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,964
You've ruined your life because of me…

227
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,841
YOO HYE-MI PLEADS GUILTY,
BREAKS DOWN IN TEARS

228
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,259
I'm so sorry.

229
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,555
Will your acceptance be canceled?

230
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,765
Just go to school.

231
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,522
Yesterday, at school…

232
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,568
Never mind.

233
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,364
SENATOR SUNG AND WIFE YOO HYE-MI IN COURT

234
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,202
It's unfortunate about your mom.

235
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,873
However, your mom is willing
to make sacrifices for you.

236
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,875
You need protection.

237
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,678
Is that so? Is Shi-an still in a coma?

238
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,264
I see.

239
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,977
Could you please go over Ji-na's testimony
before she is questioned by the police?

240
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,730
Thank you, Mr. Jang.

241
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,072
Tell Ji-na to come see me.

242
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,574
She wasn't in her room.
I think she's taking a shower.

243
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,951
-Tell her to hurry and come see me.
-Okay.

244
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,001
Ma'am, she's nowhere in the house.

245
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,295
She's not here?

246
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,140
Ji-na.

247
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,941
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

248
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,859
JI-NA

249
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,739
Ji-na won't be coming in for questioning?

250
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,243
I just got a call from her mother.
She says her daughter is sick.

251
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,288
Then is there no way
to interview her today?

252
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,083
It's very likely
she's making an excuse to not comply,

253
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,251
but we can't force her.

254
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,798
It's me.

255
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,844
Really? I see.

256
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,848
I came home to get some change of clothes.
Let's talk later.

Sung Yoo-chan.

262
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,465
Sung Yoo-chan.

263
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,634
Aren't you going to school?

264
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,182
Where did he go?

265
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,449
MR. PAIK SEUNG-YOO

266
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,371
Hello? Seung-yoo?

267
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,414
Ji-na!

268
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,585
Ji-na!

269
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,425
Why are you yelling here?

270
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,385
Did Ji-na come here?

271
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,513
Why would Ji-na come
to my place in the morning?

272
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,557
-Did something happen?
-Do you want something to happen?

273
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,476
Seriously, what's your problem?

274
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,603
Hey, Yeon-woo. You listen to me.

275
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,523
Whatever you expect is going
to happen, will never happen.

276
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,279
What the heck is going on?

277
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,374
What do you need to ask?

278
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,419
I heard about the accident at school.
He doesn't know anything about it.

279
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,922
Yoo-chan.

280
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,342
If you have any questions for me,
go ahead.

281
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,222
How is Shi-an right now?

282
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,558
Thanks for asking about her condition.

283
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,728
Shi-an is still in a coma.

284
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,190
We're waiting for her to wake up.

285
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,113
Do you know anything about this textbook?

286
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,413
I don't know.

287
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,127
Shi-an said all the global gifted class
students had this textbook.

288
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,545
I don't know. I really don't.

289
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,965
Then after yesterday's incident,
did Ji-na say anything to you?

290
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,927
Yoo-chan.

291
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,848
If you know anything about it,
please tell me.

292
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,057
I don't know anything.

293
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,193
Ji-na, answer your phone.

294
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,238
-Answer it!
-The number you have dialed…

295
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:15,125
If it's a global gifted class textbook,
did Asung Academy issue it to them?

296
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,460
I don't know yet.

297
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,213
All I know is that Shi-an got hurt
over this textbook.

298
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,256
Over that textbook?

299
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,468
I think the student who owned
this textbook and the person

300
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,179
who gave it to the class
got caught by Shi-an.

301
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,767
I think that's why Shi-an got hurt.
That's my theory.

302
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,313
Anyway, thank you
for bringing Yoo-chan with you.

303
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,274
Are you going after my brother too?

304
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,027
You're assuming he did something wrong.

305
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,573
Even if we discover that the global
gifted class was at fault,

306
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,283
Yoo-chan could be a victim in all of this.

307
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,285
That's what happened to you too.

308
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,497
Your parents and teacher encouraged
you to take the easier way.

309
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,342
The problems will be picked
from this list.

310
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,302
Memorize them all.

311
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,388
Mr. Han Myung-jin says
the math questions are super hard.

312
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,389
You have to memorize them all.

313
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,517
How did you get the internship
at the AI Research Center?

314
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,186
Did you prepare for the Olympics
at school like you claim?

315
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,401
Seung-yoo.

316
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,697
Can you send me
the photo of that textbook?

317
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:33,495
It's true that there was
an unfortunate accident at school.

318
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,581
The police might request
to interview your children.

319
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,875
-Interview?
-My daughter is very timid.

320
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,794
The police already contacted me.

321
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,838
They said Je-ni was
in the security footage.

322
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,798
Don't worry at all.

323
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,552
Do not personally respond
to any request the police make.

324
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:52,681
Only proceed after first talking
to our foundation's legal counsel.

325
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,058
-Then there won't be any problems.
-Okay.

326
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:55,976
Also,

327
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:00,272
the consulting for the global gifted class
will have to be delayed.

328
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,984
-Did you all bring the textbook?
-Yes, of course.

329
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,411
OH JI-HYE

330
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,370
AHN JE-NI

331
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,288
KYUNG SOO-YOUNG

332
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,637
Good morning.

333
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,056
-How is Shi-an's condition?
-Still the same.

334
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,101
But a classmate of hers came to visit.

335
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,853
-A classmate?
-Yes.

336
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,623
Ji-na!

337
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,766
-Are you okay?
-Ji-na!

338
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,228
Are you both all right? Did you get hurt?

339
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,271
It's okay, Ji-na.

340
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,857
I know you came
because you were worried about her.

341
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,193
Shi-an is okay.

342
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,154
She'll be okay. And you will be okay too.

343
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,037
Passcode.

344
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,081
The door is open.

345
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,465
The door is closed.

346
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:01,017
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

347
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,104
Press pound after you finish.

348
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,065
Ji-na, this is my last warning.

349
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,192
Call me right now.

350
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,070
Or let's die together!

351
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,198
If you don't want to see me die,
call me right now!

352
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,495
Is she…

353
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,082
thinking about killing herself?

354
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,876
Or did she go to the police?

355
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:30,964
I'm going crazy.

356
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,177
Ji-na!

357
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,264
Where were you?

358
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,599
What do you think you're doing?

359
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,151
Did you have something to eat?

360
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,073
Your mom doesn't know
you came here, does she?

361
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,701
No, she doesn't.
Are you going to tell her?

362
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,996
If you don't want me to,
I won't tell her. Don't worry.

363
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,001
I have something to show you.

364
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:16,760
-This is a profile I made. It's your file.
-About me?

365
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:22,932
The file includes video footage of you
stealing a watch, a student profile,

366
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,851
and other personal information.

367
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,855
Why do you have this?

368
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,360
I once wanted to get payback from your mom

369
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,696
for the terrible thing she did to me.

370
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,328
TRASH

371
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:46,164
EMPTY TRASH

372
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,044
I'm embarrassed
about what I did and I'm sorry.

373
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,880
Now I deleted it after showing it to you.

374
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,424
Could you also do that for me?

375
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,720
Could you tell us what happened?

376
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,099
Ji-na.

377
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,227
I was very surprised to see you here.

378
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,938
I didn't imagine
that you'd show up at the hospital.

379
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,691
You're brave. I mean it.

380
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,447
Do you remember when I said
we should have a frank discussion

381
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,700
and that I would answer
all your questions?

382
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,578
Yes.

383
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,914
I think that time is now.

384
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,667
That's right, Ji-na.

385
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,503
Try to be brave.

386
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,422
Please.

387
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,092
Are you going to believe…

388
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,137
everything I say?

389
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,180
Yes.

390
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,029
-I heard there was an accident at school.
-Yes, there was.

391
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,491
A very disgraceful accident.

392
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,578
The police came to the school

393
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,913
and they even tried
to question my daughter.

394
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,749
So what did you do this time?

395
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,626
Now your students have to undergo
questioning by the police?

396
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,213
You have no gratitude, do you?

397
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,091
You take what I give you
without a thank you

398
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,177
and blame me when things go wrong.

399
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,636
You recognize this, don't you?

400
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,513
Tell me about this textbook.

401
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,558
Where'd you get that photo?

402
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,273
Give it to me!

403
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:39,027
I have to cover that up. There won't be
any problems that way. Give it!

404
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:49,788
It wasn't me.

405
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,208
I didn't break the plaster bust.

406
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,797
All right. Take it slow.

407
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:05,261
You haven't made
any new math textbooks recently, have you?

408
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,305
No, I haven't. What are these pictures?

409
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,307
Aren't the math problems similar
to the ones you made before?

410
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,434
This textbook came from that cram school.

411
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,895
And the global gifted class students
all had a copy.

412
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:14,813
And so?

413
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,315
But there's something wrong
with this textbook.

414
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,399
What is it?

415
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,651
Hey, Shi-an.

416
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,154
Let me call you back.

417
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,619
Where did you get this? Why did you take
pictures of it without permission?

418
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,954
Tell me the truth.

419
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,122
Where did you get that textbook?

420
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,960
How could the problems in it
be identical to the exam problems?

421
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,170
Give me your phone!

422
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,257
You, Yoo-chan, Je-ni, and Soo-young…

423
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,468
All the global gifted class
got high scores on the math test.

424
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,136
They also had the textbook, didn't they?

425
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,681
You know that cheating is wrong.

426
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,140
And you know it's shameful.

427
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,435
I know you're afraid now.

428
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,480
But tell me the truth.
How did this happen?

429
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,565
All right.

430
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,277
I'll explain everything.
But first, delete all the pictures.

431
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,573
-I'll tell you if you delete them.
-No. This is evidence.

432
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,741
Evidence?

433
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,619
I'm going to tell everything you did
to Mr. Paik and Ms. Ji.

434
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,872
I'll also talk to the media
and report it to the Office of Education.

435
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,583
What? You'll report me?

436
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,294
Give it to me now!

437
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,964
I said give it to me!

438
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,008
Give it to me!

439
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,552
-Stop it!
-Give it!

440
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,891
You better give it to me!

441
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,434
I won't give it to you!

442
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,941
Give it to me!

443
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,818
Stop it!

444
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,111
-Give it!
-No, I won't.

445
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,034
Move out of the way!

446
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,199
Shi-an.

447
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,451
Shi-an.

448
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,204
Shi-an.

449
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,206
Shi-an.

450
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,584
Shi-an.

451
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,694
I didn't do it intentionally.

452
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,073
I didn't think something
like that would happen.

453
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,199
I'm not lying.

454
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,953
I see.

455
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,871
So it was an accident.

456
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,124
Do you really

457
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,209
believe me?

458
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,253
I believe you.

459
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,879
Really?

460
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,384
You wouldn't tell a lie when you came
here to check on Shi-an.

461
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:32,969
My mom

462
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,722
didn't believe me.

463
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,618
This is my most cherished plant.

464
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,953
You poor thing.

465
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,171
You tended to it and carefully grew it
to that size and shape.

466
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:12,967
But look at it. Everything you touch
is fragile and weak,

467
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,553
breaking instantly in mere seconds.

468
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,473
You ungrateful girl!

469
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,726
-How dare you lecture me.
-I'm warning you.

470
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:26,439
-Don't even think about hurting Yoo-chan.
-It's too late.

471
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,192
You don't understand?

472
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,360
There's no stopping me.

473
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:36,491
I wouldn't have come this far
if I had planned on stopping.

474
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,659
You probably think
it's too late to fix it.

475
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,453
I cherished this plant so much.

476
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,914
It's too hard to make things
right now, isn't it?

477
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,248
How ungrateful.

478
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,835
How dare they treat me like this?
What spoiled brats.

479
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,888
I thought you weren't to blame
for what you did.

480
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,599
I blamed the adults
in your life for indulging you.

481
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,937
But now you have to stop blaming others
and take ownership of your mistakes.

482
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,942
We can correct this mistake.
If you show some courage, I'll help you.

483
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,547
It's okay. Say hi to her.

484
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:46,018
Shi-an, Ji-na came to visit.

485
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,937
She's worried about you.

486
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:52,942
Can I

487
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,111
touch her hand?

488
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,071
Sure.

489
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,087
Shi-an.

490
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,718
I'm sorry. I really am.

491
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,807
I made a mistake.

492
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,858
Please get well. Okay?

493
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,039
She says they're weak and fragile.
The kids I cared for?

494
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,416
She's so wrong.

495
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,922
Eventually, they'll all come back,
won't they?

496
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,966
Once they realize that
there's nowhere else in society

497
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,677
that supported and protected them
like Asung did,

498
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,601
where do they think they'll go?

499
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,978
They're in the palm of my hand.

500
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,231
Such brats.

501
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,619
Hello?

502
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,686
Ji-na, what are you doing here?

503
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,897
Your daughter has given a witness
statement about the school accident.

504
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,401
She argued with Shi-an,
and it quickly turned physical.

505
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,237
The plaster bust fell on top of Shi-an
when she bumped into the shelf.

506
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,656
And it hit her on the head.

507
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,868
She stated that it was an accident.

508
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:09,996
That's it?

509
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,789
What? Is there anything else?

510
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,374
No, I mean…

511
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,418
Could I see the statement she gave?

512
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,377
Here.

513
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,881
We cannot close the case solely
based on Ji-na's statement though.

514
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,176
We'll have to also interview Shi-an
after she wakes up from her coma.

515
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,012
We need to hear her side of the story.

516
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,639
Please cooperate
with any further questioning.

517
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,516
Of course, Officer.

518
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,310
Ji-na, let's go.

519
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,587
What do you think you're doing?

520
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,632
You were gone all day. Why did you
come to the office without telling me?

521
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,302
Because you didn't believe me
when I told you

522
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,722
that I didn't hurt Shi-an intentionally.

523
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,849
I wanted to tell the truth.

524
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:13,851
How is that a bad thing?

525
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,313
Did you only mention that?

526
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:22,234
Did you talk about the textbook
or the global gifted class?

527
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,654
Answer me!

528
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,325
I didn't mention it.

529
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,329
Good. Very good, Ji-na.

530
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,289
Well done.

531
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,296
Do you know how worried
I was about you all day?

532
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,132
I thought my heart was going to explode.

533
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,134
I'm sorry, Mom.

534
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,181
Don't ever do something like this again.

535
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,558
Don't see the police by yourself.

536
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,312
You have to discuss
such matters with me first, okay?

537
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,439
Okay.

538
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,442
Good girl.

539
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,694
Good girl. My daughter.

540
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,781
Please don't make me
worry about you like this.

541
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,450
Do you know

542
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,537
what I went through today?

543
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,122
I won't, Mom.

544
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,542
I won't do it again.

545
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,128
I'm sorry.

546
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,176
Don't ever do this again.

547
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,888
I was so upset.

548
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:05,463
Ji-na told the police it was an accident,
that she didn't do it on purpose.

549
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,048
Check Shi-an's condition at the hospital.

550
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,802
Also, tell Ji Yoon-su and Paik Seung-yoo
that we're very sorry about what happened

551
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,804
and Ji-na had no intentions
of hurting her.

552
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,014
Just in case,

553
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,393
find out if they will accept a settlement.

554
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,274
Okay, I understand.

555
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,200
I do believe you were worried
about what you were doing though.

556
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,042
Mr. Paik, it's me.

557
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,795
The cheating scandal that
occurred at Asung High is being handled

558
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:50,174
handled by the court. The accused parent
and teacher are on trial.

559
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:54,178
The guilty parties will be sentenced,
and everything will be wrapped up.

560
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,682
Good work.

561
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,686
There are always enemies
on all sides coming at you.

562
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,939
I'm relieved that you handled the matter

563
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,149
so adeptly.

564
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,902
Thank you for trusting me, Dad.

565
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,156
I'll have time to go fishing now

566
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,326
after I leave everything to you.

567
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,668
Well…

568
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,005
-About Yeon-woo's allies on the board…
-I'll ease them out.

569
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:34,260
Yeon-woo seems to have taken it hard.

570
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,471
She's been holed up in her house.

571
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,104
Really? Then you have everything set?

572
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,941
Yes, it's all set.

573
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,819
Okay.

574
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,707
Nice to meet you. I'm Ryu Sung-jae.

575
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,959
Nice to meet you too.

576
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,794
ASUNG ACADEMY
BOARD CHAIR SELECTION SESSION

577
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,134
Let's all be seated.

578
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:38,157
Your father keeps asking us to call Shi-an
and why she hasn't come.

579
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,367
He's refusing to eat too.

580
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,994
He just stares at the chessboard.

581
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,580
Dad.

582
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,334
We came, Professor.

583
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,669
Do you miss Shi-an?

584
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,840
It was a good game, Professor.
I hope to see you again.

585
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,805
Where is Shi-an?

586
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,570
Let me take this.

587
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,032
Hello?

588
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,117
Really? Today?

589
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:24,870
All right.

590
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,750
We shall begin the selection
of a new board chair

591
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,461
for the Asung Academy,
an accredited school.

592
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,798
Now please submit
the candidates you support.

593
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,966
I recommend Ms. Noh Jung-ah.

594
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,719
I do, too.

595
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,847
Is there any other candidate you support?

596
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,610
The prosecutors came
and took all the files.

597
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:59,738
They somehow found the files
we didn't give to the auditors.

598
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,698
This has to be an inside job.

599
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,416
What do you mean? They took all of it?

600
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,292
That's what I said.

601
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,628
You need to come up with a counter plan.

602
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:17,172
I don't have any enemies
who would do this to me.

603
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,633
It's obvious
that you're their target, and not me.

604
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,093
Handle this.

605
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,094
Wait a minute.

606
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,221
Why should I handle it?

607
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:27,683
You gained the most
from the math museum project.

608
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,270
So why should I handle this for you?

609
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,772
What? What did you say?

610
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:37,484
I only pushed for the budget,
so that it would be built in my district.

611
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,071
The screening process
and site selection were overseen by you.

612
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,198
So handle it yourself.

613
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,491
I'm hanging up.

614
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:52,833
Senator Sung is only going
to save himself?

615
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,628
Call Professor Cha Seong-won,
the head of AI Research Center

616
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,381
and Principal Noh of
Asung Academy immediately.

617
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,299
Yes, sir.

618
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,142
Start the plan.

619
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,102
Okay. Got it.

620
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,442
EXCLUSIVE REPORT: SCANDAL COMMITTED
BY MINISTRY, SITTING SENATOR, AND SCHOOL

621
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,658
SENATOR SUNG MIN-JOON

622
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,536
Now please raise your hands
if you approve of her

623
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,997
becoming the new board chair.

624
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:49,014
Under a unanimous decision by the board,
Noh Jung-ah has become

625
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,891
the new board chairwoman.

626
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,204
-Senator, we have a big problem.
-What is it?

627
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,539
Take a look at this.

628
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:18,168
EXCLUSIVE REPORT: SCANDAL COMMITTED
BY MINISTRY, SITTING SENATOR, AND SCHOOL

629
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,925
I feel a heavy responsibility
as the new chairwoman of the board.

630
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:29,304
Asung Academy has led the nation
in nurturing young global talent.

631
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:33,517
I shall do my very best

632
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,769
in upholding our reputation
as a leading school…

633

EXCLUSIVE REPORT: SCANDAL COMMITTED
BY MINISTRY, SITTING SENATOR, AND SCHOOL

634
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,445
Ms. Noh.

635
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,453
Dad.

636

WHISTLEBLOWER TRIGGERS INVESTIGATION OVER
CLAIMS, CORRUPTION IN MATH MUSEUM PROJECT

637
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,659
Prosecutors launched
an investigation after an audit

638
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,620
revealed that the current senator,
Minister of Education,

639
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,913
and exclusive private school principal
sought financial gain

640
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,915
from establishing
the National Math Museum.

641
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,419
The Board of Audit and Inspection
received a tip

642
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,672
about rampant corruption surrounding
the Math Museum project

643
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,091
that includes rigged bidding
for the construction,

644
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,053
irregularities in site selection
and misuse of subsidies.

645
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:54,640
Criminal charges have been filed
against Education Minister Shin Seung-jae,

646
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,392
Senator Sung Min-joon,

647
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:01,104
and Asung Academy Principal Noh Jung-ah.

648
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,523
Hello?

649
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:07,319
I sent a press release to the media.
It'll be in the papers soon.

650
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,820
Really? Today?

651
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,698
Okay.

652
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:31,051
This massive scandal came to light
when the anonymous tip

653
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,595
turned out to be true.

654
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,516
According to the whistleblower,
the idea for the Math Museum project

655
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,311
from Lucifer Prize winner Paik Seung-yoo,
an Asung Academy teacher.

656
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,606
However, Asung Academy
Principal Noh Jung-ah had it redesignated

657
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,860
as a state project
funded by the taxpayers' money.

658
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,618
This way.

659
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,746
There and there. Start searching.

660
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,226
What do you think you're doing?

661
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,898
I have a search warrant here
on corruption charges against you.

662
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,944
-Please cooperate with our search.
-A search warrant? How dare you!

663
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:31,987
MINISTER KYUNG WOO-MIN

664
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:32,904
I found a safe!

665
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,451
Carry it out.

666
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,295
Open it, please.

667
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:51,715
If you refuse to comply, you will be
charged with obstruction of justice.

668
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,092
There's nothing in it.

669
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,136
Find the master key!

670
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:10,275
Please cooperate, ma'am.
You're not helping your case.

671
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,867
I found the master key.

672
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,261
Yes. You're here?

673
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,888
Where are you?

674
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,822
What? There's nothing in it.

675
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,038
-There's nothing?
-It's empty.

676
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:32,667
Unlocked.

677
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,419
The door is open.

678
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,273
I want to tell the truth to the police.

679
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,567
But I'm afraid.

680
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,153
My mom would never forgive me.

681
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:01,988
Ji-na.

682
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,784
Even if you tell people the truth,

683
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:08,203
not everyone will believe you.

684
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:12,123
What you say might not be
what the public wants to hear.

685
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,963
I don't want you to get hurt
during that process.

686
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:20,966
But,

687
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:26,221
I would like you to think of a way
to make amends to Shi-an.

688
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:27,973
But how?

689
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,433
You can free yourself.

690
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,645
Don't live a life forced upon
you by your mom.

691
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:40,485
You decide what kind of life
you want to live.

692
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,336
Thank you for making
this difficult decision, Ji-na.

693
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,801
-Hello.
-Hi, Mr. Paik.

694
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:09,514
These textbooks were given
to the students. They were in the safe.

695
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,807
And…

696
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,310
I also found this.

697
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,288
All right. Let's begin.

698
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,458
What will be your move?

699
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,256
Knight?

700
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:44,883
Knight…

701
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,389
I'll defend like this.

702
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,393
Your next move?

703
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,026
2021 SCHOOL PARENT DONATION LIST

704
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,073
2021 FIRST HALF YEAR BANK DEPOSITS

705
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,158
2021 SECOND HALF YEAR BANK DEPOSITS

706
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,952
STUDENT: KYUNG SOO-YOUNG,
SUNG YOO-CHAN, AHN JE-NI, OH JI-HYE

707
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,713
See. There's nothing in it.

708
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:28,176
We already obtained evidence of corruption
in the math museum project.

709
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,721
Come with us for questioning.
You're a crime suspect.

710
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,766
-I'm going to call my lawyer.
-As you wish.

711
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,434
Take her.

712
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,943
Call Mr. Jang.

713
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,153
-Quickly.
-Okay.

714
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,280
Come with us.

715
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,576
Finish searching the office!

716
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,001
Mr. Paik, it's me.

717
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:14,139
Those are the materials
related to the midterm exam.

718
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:17,142
It has everything including
the original copy of the math test,

719
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,310
answer sheet,
and minutes to the teacher meetings.

720
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:21,563
Thank you, Vice-principal.

721
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,274
I won't reveal my source.

722
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,653
Perhaps, it's time I reveal
that I'm the source.

723
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,453
She says they're weak and fragile.
The kids I cared for?

724
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,704
She's so wrong.

725
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,665
Once they realize
that there's nowhere else in society

726
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:43,543
that supported and protected them
like Asung did,

727
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,504
where do they think they'll go?

728
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,841
They're in the palm of my hand.

729
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,178
I saw her behavior.

730
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:56,222
Principal Noh is on a downward spiral.

731
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,518
And also…

732
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:05,148
I apologize for the way
I treated you and Ms. Ji.

733
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,026
I am sincerely sorry.

734
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:26,753
2022 REGULAR EXAM FOR THE 2ND TERM

735
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,674
I think we're done once we add
the material the vice-principal gave us.

736
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,218
You'll go straight to
the Office of Education, right?

737
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,053
Yes, let's go together.

738
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,558
Hiding the king through castling…

739
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,769
That's a good maneuver.

740
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,772
I'll respond with my rook.

741
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:46,773
Check.

742
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,443
All right. Let's see.

743
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,738
Having the professor here
makes this place less quiet.

744
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:56,783
-How about this?
-Dad.

745
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,034
Dad.

746
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,542
Shi-an.

747
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,918
Shi-an.

748
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,294
Shi-an.

749
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:12,590
Shi-an.

750
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,734
Shi-an.

751
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,982
I think I can come up with something
by using his notes.

752
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,359
How dare they treat me like a criminal
who ruined their kids' lives?

753
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,236
What did I do wrong?

754
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,655
He told me he wanted
to make them apologize to you.

755
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,449
I felt he meant it when he said that

756
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,451
more so than when he promised
he'd make you happy.

757
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,453
You never held a grudge against me.

758
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:25,538
You understood me.

759
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,706
Thanks.

760
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,666
I'd like to complete it
whatever it may turn out to be.

761
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,878
I don't care how long it takes
or whether I fail.

762
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,881
Could you make another promise?

763
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:41,471
