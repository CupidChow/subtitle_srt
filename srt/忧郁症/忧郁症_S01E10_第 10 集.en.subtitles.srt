1
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:21,312
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,120
What's going on?

3
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,457
I'm having dinner with Principal Noh here.
Senator Sung is also here.

4
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,544
The principal somehow knew
and she was going to your room.

5
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,672
Welcome, Minister.

6
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,549
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

7
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,801
It's been a long time, sir.

8
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,887
Hello, Professor Cha.

9
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,930
Sorry I couldn't attend
the launch ceremony.

10
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:56,973
That's all right, sir.

11
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,808
The ceremony went well.
Let's all sit down.

12
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,768
Sure.

13
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,688
Minister, thanks to your support,

14
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,732
the launch ceremony went very smoothly.

15
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,527
-Shall we bring your order?
-Sure.

16
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,280
It seems like

17
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,784
the principal got lost
in the hallway and is looking for us.

18
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,727
Stay still for a moment.

19
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,303
There you are.

20
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,891
-Yes?
-The senator is looking for you.

21
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,976
Okay.

22
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,236
-Yes?
-Where are you?

23
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,404
The minister is here.

24
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,822
All right. I'll be there.

25
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:50,920
Are you okay?

26
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,010
I don't need it.

27
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,222
Let's go.

28
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,724
Go ahead.

29
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,852
-Join your dinner party.
-I can skip it.

30
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,563
We can't be seen leaving together.

31
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,320
PRINCIPAL NOH JUNG-AH

32
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,868
Oh, hello.

33
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,454
-The minister is with us.
-Okay.

34
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,414
Mr. Paik teaches math at Asung Academy.

35
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,665
Of course, I know him.

36
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,792
I was there at the Mathematician Olympics.

37
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,544
-It's great to see you.
-Me, too.

38
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,254
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

39
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,424
-Let's eat now.
-Sure.

40
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,301
-Eat.
-Okay.

41
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,160
I'm very sorry, Director.

42
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,664
Due to a personal matter, I have to go.

43
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,862
We should have built a math museum
like Mathematikum in our country already.

44
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,699
Then we could have produced
more brilliant mathematicians

45
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,951
like Mr. Paik, don't you agree?

46
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,746
In that regard, Mr. Paik,
you're very remarkable.

47
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,833
He didn't receive any public support.

48
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,334
He achieved it by himself.

49
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,586
I agree. It's truly outstanding.

50
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,463
What is your secret?

51
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,092
It's thanks to
my high school math teacher.

52
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,261
I knew it.

53
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:07,015
There's always a great teacher
behind those who attain greatness.

54
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:11,019
Your teacher would be so proud
of what you've achieved.

55
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,646
I'm not sure about that.

56
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,273
She was let go from the school.

57
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,275
What? Why?

58
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,819
The school, parents,

59
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,405
and students didn't like her.

60
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,159
Well, let's move on
to a less serious topic.

61
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,077
Let's all have a drink.

62
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,205
I wonder why everyone disliked her.
She didn't do anything wrong.

63
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,501
I never met another teacher
like her in my life.

64
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,964
Well, I do remember
a little about what happened.

65
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,509
She sort of stood out, didn't she?

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,474
In Korea, it's not easy to keep teaching
if you stand out like she did.

67
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,517
-I don't…
-I think that's enough.

68
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:57,732
I don't think she'd like people
talking about how she resigned

69
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,318
due to a scandal.

70
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,608
RESIGN

71
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,818
WHAT KIND OF SCHOOL IS THIS?

BOYCOTT MATH CLASS

74
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,761
You mentioned the development
of mathematics, right?

75
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,263
Let me ask you a question.

76
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,558
Why did Archimedes jump out of his bathtub
and run through the streets?

77
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:17,520
He realized the relationship
between volume and density.

78
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,688
Correct.

79
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,732
Every student in the country
will give that same answer.

80
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,485
But nobody mentions how happy he felt

81
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,029
when he discovered a solution,

82
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,490
or the painstaking process,

83
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,452
or the happiness he felt
while seeking an answer.

84
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,371
If you give a student
a learning experience

85
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,206
where they'll have a "eureka" moment,

86
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,959
then you won't need
to force the kid to study.

87
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,587
Museums and public support.

88
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,755
None of that is necessary.

89
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,259
I learned that in high school.
That's my secret.

90
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,808
I must excuse myself.

91
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,202
Take me to Ruchenville Officetel.

The number you have dialed cannot be…

95
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,326
Hello?

96
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,333
-What's wrong? Are you all right?
-I can't breathe.

97
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,919
I'm having trouble breathing.

98
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,088
What's your apartment number?

99
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,235
It's me.

100
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,909
Are you okay?

101
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,002
Hang in there.

102
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,839
Please.

103
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,394
Take us to the nearest hospital.

104
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,740
Hang in there. Just a little longer.

105
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,874
Ma'am, take a deep breath.

106
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,168
She has difficulty breathing.

107
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,794
She's got a fever
and experiencing cold sweats.

108
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,380
Does she have
an underlying medical condition?

109
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,798
No, not that I know of.

110
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,884
But she had
a frightening incident earlier.

111
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,218
I'll give her a sedative
and check her symptoms.

112
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,137
We need you to fill out a hospital form.

113
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,891
Ma'am, take a slow breath.

114
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,684
Where do you feel discomfort?

115
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,936
All right. Inhale slowly.

116
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,106

00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,539
The audit by the Office of Education
isn't a problem, is it?

120
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,667
Of course, not.
I'm sorry that this happened.

121
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,337
-I'll see you again.
-Sure.

122
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,714
-Good night, Minister.
-Take care, Senator Sung.

123
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,554
Goodbye.

124
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,350
Shall we go?

125
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,477
-Sure. You first.
-Okay.

126
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,272
-Why did that guy bring that up?
-What was he wearing at the ceremony?

127
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,025
Seung-yoo? Why are you asking?

128
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,405
It's nothing. Take care.

Seung-yoo has balls.

131
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,228
He mentioned Yoon-su
in front of everyone there?

132
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,482
I wonder why everyone disliked her.
She didn't do anything wrong.

133
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,943
I never met another teacher
like her in my life.

134
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,364
Yoon-su was like that too.

135
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,827
If she thought she was right,
she would fearlessly speak up.

136
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,746
She was very blunt and direct.

137
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,457
I know that.

138
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,751
That's why she made me feel uncomfortable.

139
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,882
She made me feel like I was turning
a blind eye to wrongdoings.

140
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,883
Exactly.

141
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,011
That's how it feels.

142
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,764
She didn't care an ounce
about other people's feelings.

143
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,017
Why dwell on the past?

144
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,769
That's who she was.

145
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,898
Your personality
wasn't a good fit with her.

146
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,108
That's right.

147
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,654
We were so different.

148
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,283
I wasn't wrong.

149
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,912
Just different.

150
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,670
I don't like that expression on your face.

They're boycotting her class? My gosh.

154
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,841
Did you see
what they wrote in the classroom?

155
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,134
Heavy stuff.

156
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,137
I don't need to see it.
It's obvious. The parents are furious.

157
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:11,058
I wonder how long she'll stick around.

158

Gosh.

-I know, right?

There she is! Ji Yoon-su!

161
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,153
Resign!

162
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,872
Open your eyes.

163
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,208
Try opening your eyes.

164
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,752
Are you all right? Get up.

00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,679
You're in a hospital. How do you feel?

166
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,558
Do you have a headache? Are you dizzy?

167
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,810
I'm okay.

168
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,103
Hold on a second.

169
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,360
Your fever has gone away. That's a relief.

170
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,241
You have to finish getting your IV drip.

171
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,119
It's stuffy in here.
I'd like some fresh air.

172
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,083
Did anything happen?

173
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,002
No, nothing.

174
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,677
You can't get weak already.
You're just getting started.

175
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,682
I imagined the day
I'd confront her so many times.

176
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,101
But when I saw her in person,

177
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,271
I got scared.

178
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,484
That's understandable.

179
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,029
No matter how much time passes,

180
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,366
when a victim faces the assailant,
it feels like it happened just yesterday.

181
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,746
Meanwhile, the person who did it
hardly remembers and is doing well.

182
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,042
What do you want to say
to her when you see her?

183
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,005
Say what you want.

184
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,216
Think of me as her.

185
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,062
Say you're sorry.

186
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,565
For making students boycott my class,

187
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,859
making fellow teachers shun me,

188
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,279
and making school parents
throw eggs at me.

189
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,990
Apologize for everything you did.

190
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:32,908
Keep going.

191
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,911
For framing someone else
for something you did,

192
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,498
for trampling
all over someone else's life.

193
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,627
Good. What else?

194
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,177
For making someone
who smiled often lost someone's smile.

195
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,681
For making an innocent person cry.

196
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,907
SEUNG-YOO

197
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,827
You probably had your reasons.

198
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,413
I don't think you did it
without a good reason.

199
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,167
I like someone.

200
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,336
I like her even more
after not seeing her for a long time.

201
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,599
Are you feeling better?

202
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,309
Yes.

203
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,901
Do you have time tomorrow? Can we meet?

204
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,238
What about Ye-lin?

205
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,578
She owes you an apology too.

206
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,548
Sure. Let's have dinner tomorrow at 6 p.m.

207
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,845
Okay. See you then.

208
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,481
Get some sleep.
Don't worry about anything.

209
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,726
REPORTER CHO YOON-AH

210
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,647
-Hello?
-Mr. Paik. We did it.

211
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,983
The prosecutors
will pay Asung Academy a visit.

212
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,943
I see. I'll talk to you soon.

213
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,741
-You're leaving?
-Yes, I need to go home.

214
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,326
Have this for breakfast.

215
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,164
You need to eat it.

216
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,375
I have to go to work,
so I'll call you later.

217
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,086
There will be good news.

218
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,721
ADVANCED MATH CLASS

219
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,557
Who finished the assignment
the teacher gave us?

220
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,975
It was really hard.

221
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,894
Do you think anyone solved it?

222
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,188
Did the teacher give us
an unsolvable assignment?

223
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,064
It's ridiculous.

224
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,066
It's so annoying.

225
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,277
It's too hard.

226
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,947
-Did you solve it?
-Give it.

227
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,410
So there's a problem
you can't solve either?

228
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,536
By the way…

229
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,956
-I found this photo.
-Show me.

230
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,708
-What is that?
-When did you take it?

231
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,251
-What is it?
-What?

232
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,171
I took it when the teacher gave a lecture.

233
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,048
-What?
-Do you like Seung-yoo?

234
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,010
Yes, I like the teacher.

235
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,262
-What?
-For real? You really like him?

236
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,513
I can't believe you.

237
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,476
He's my favorite mathematician,
and I respect him.

238
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,810
What's wrong with that?

239
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,192
Unbelievable.

240
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,319
I think she really has feelings for him.

241
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,780
Mr. Han Myung-jin, come with us.

242
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,032
Why should I talk to you, prosecutors?

243
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,201
I don't have anything to say
and I didn't do anything wrong.

244
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,453
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

245
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,581
If you refuse to come with us,
we'll bring an arrest warrant next time.

246
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,752
Fine. I'll go.

247
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,422
But let me be clear. I'm innocent.

248
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,841
There has to be a misunderstanding.

249
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,928
He's accused of taking a bribe
in exchange for securing admission.

250
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,517
The audit could have been over
if Mr. Han hadn't gotten in trouble.

251
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,062
Tell Han not to cause bigger problems
when he's questioned.

252
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,146
And…

253
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,442
have a disciplinary committee
investigate Mr. Han's actions.

254
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,903
Geez, this is outrageous.

255
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,156
What will happen to Mr. Han?

256
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,241
I don't know.

257
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,077
Why did he accept a bribe?

258
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,709
I got a call
from a former Asung school employee

259
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,129
after we aired the story about
Senator Sung rigging the competition.

260
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,088
An employee?

261
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,299
She said she was unfairly terminated.

262
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,677
And told me that she merely did

263
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,431
-what Mr. Han told her to do.
-And?

264
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,933
I was about to meet her
because she had more to say,

265
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,811
but she didn't show up.
And I couldn't reach her on her phone.

266
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,939
Recently, Han Myung-jin's name
came up again

267
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,483
while I was investigating
the admissions scandal.

268
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,609
Who mentioned his name?

269
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,487
A parent who gave a bribe
to Han in exchange

270
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,197
for securing admission for his kid.

271
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,784
But the parent didn't want
his identity to be revealed,

272
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,453
so he didn't press charges.

273
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,581
-Do you have the parent's number?
-Yes.

274
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,915
There is a way.

275
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,252
The parent can report him
without revealing his identity.

276
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,545
COMPLAINT FILED AGAINST
ASUNG ACADEMY WITH PROSECUTION

277
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,463
AMIDST OFFICE OF EDUCATION AUDIT

278
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,597
Hello? This is the Asung Academy
of Mathematics and Arts.

279
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,891
Hey, it's Dad.

280
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,187
I got your paper.

281
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,149
Good job.

282
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,153
Let's meet. I haven't seen you, son.

283
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,406
I have to go to class.

284
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,450
I'll call you.

285
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,748
-What did he say?
-He said he'd call us.

286
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,463
At least, he answered the phone.

287
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,882
Why didn't you let me talk to him?

288
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,094
You're still reading that?

289
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,971
You've been spending days on it.

290
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,567
What is this news?

291
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,778
A teacher at Asung Academy, which is
being audited by the Office of Education

292
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,656
due to allegations of bribery
in its admission process,

293
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,742
has been accused of accepting a bribe
in exchange for admitting an applicant.

294
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,744
-Prosecutors are investigating.
-What?

295
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,123
The accused teacher, Mr. Han,
teaches math at Asung Academy

296
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,126
and taught at Asung High, as well.

297
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,461
No way. Mr. Han Myung-jin?

298
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,712
My gosh.

299
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,341
There will be a thorough investigation.

300
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:49,052
The school is being audited
over allegations of taking bribes

301
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,428
from high ranking officials

302
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,139
-to admit their children.
-Honey!

303
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,433
The ongoing audit
and these new allegations…

304
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,770
Isn't that Han Myung-jin?

305
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,730
What happens now? He's being questioned.

306
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,525
What if he talks to the authorities
and tells them everything?

307
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,819
Be quiet. Don't say that out loud.

308
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,529
Do something!

309
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,157
You can't let him be questioned.

310
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,242
-What's the matter?
-What?

311
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,456
You're all dressed up.
Are you going somewhere?

312
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,167
I'm having dinner with someone.
I'll get going.

313
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,085
Okay. Have a nice dinner.

314
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,171
Happy birthday to you.

315
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,256
-Have a nice evening.
-Okay.

316
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,806
What are you going to do?

317
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,549
Happy birthday.

318
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,260
-How did you know?
-Your social media.

319
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,931
What would you like to order?

320
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,360
CIVIC GROUP PRESSES CHARGES AGAINST
TEACHER INVOLVED IN BRIBERY SCANDAL

321
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,578
Come in.

322
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,580
The director is here.

323
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,500
Come in.

324
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,795
-Director.
-Did you get home safely?

325
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,048
Yes, I'm sorry for leaving like that.
Something came up.

326
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,341
That's all right.

327
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,426
You had something to tell me, didn't you?

328
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,222
I'm planning on growing our business.

329
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,140
There will be a few changes.

330
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,475
A few changes?

331
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,062
I will expand into international
admissions consulting for students.

332
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,565
It's my field of expertise.
So the offer is very appealing.

333
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,068
We'll have to refocus
the math clinic and our courses

334
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,404
to prep students for Ivy League schools.

335
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,614
-I see.
-After I sign a partnership contract,

336
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,366
I'll fill you in on the details.

337
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,077
I'd like to also introduce
our new business partner to you.

338
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,539
All right.

339
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,179
I'd like to apologize

340
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,724
for what I did.

341
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,604
When you brought up
the photo I took in Jeju,

342
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,150
it took me by surprise,
so I didn't know how to react.

343
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,695
I'm sorry.

344
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,450
I didn't imagine that
things would get out of hand. Really.

345
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:03,038
I had no idea
it would be shown at Ms. Ji's wedding.

346
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,293
I wonder who did it then.

347
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,423
If it wasn't you,

348
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,427
then who showed the picture
and created a firestorm?

349
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:23,600
I'm not questioning you.
I just wanted to know.

350
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,020
Who did it and why?

351
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,732
It was Principal Noh.

352
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:37,072
I didn't even show
that picture to my parents.

353
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,242
Nobody saw it except her.

354
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,537
That must have been tough.

355
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,416
She used you.

356
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,670
You didn't intend to use
that photo like that.

357
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,673
But she did it without telling you.

358
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,928
It must have weighed heavily on you.

359
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,357
Thanks.

360
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,709
Hello?

361
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,878
-Where are you?
-I'm on my way home.

362
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,130
Stop where you are.

363
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,756
What? Why?

364
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,760
What are you doing here?

365
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,263
I was in the area. Happy Birthday.

366
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,146
-Did you have a party?
-What?

367
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,856
No, I just had dinner.

368
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,858
With whom?

369
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,735
Seung-yoo.

370
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,238
-Are you dating him?
-No.

371
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,533
But why are you talking like that to me?

372
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,452
Be careful around him.

373
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,454
What?

374
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,582
I saw Ms. Ji.
She lives in the same building as me.

375
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,923
Ms. Ji.

376
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,760
-Ms. Ji.
-What?

377
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,721
I'm done.

378
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,849
All right. That's all for today.

379
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,769
How's school?

380
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,936
It's chaotic.

381
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,565
Mr. Han was taken by the authorities.
It was a mess.

382
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,444
Don't get distracted by such things.
Focus on your studies.

383
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,197
And take advantage of anything
the school offers you, okay?

384
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,323
Okay.

385
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,493
By the way,

386
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,371
Professor Ji Hyeon-wook
is your dad, isn't he?

387
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,501
-How did you find out?
-You have the same last name,

388
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,962
so I asked Mr. Paik if he was your dad
and he said he was.

389
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,717
I'm going to visit the professor
again to play chess.

390
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,178
Can I?

391
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,138
Sure.

392
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,723
Thank you.

393
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,521
I almost forgot. Ms. Ji.

394
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,442
Mr. Paik gave us this problem to solve.

395
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,819
But it's too hard.

396
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,613
Could you take a look at it?

397
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,618
I'll go now. Good night.

398
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,468
Everyone goes through that.

399
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:49,222
You stop getting excited over a problem.

400
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:53,726
It's not fun
and you don't want to tackle it.

401
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,019
That happens.

402
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:59,107
All mathematicians go through that.

403
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,318
A mathematician
who doesn't face such struggles

404
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,613
cannot go on and solve the next problem.

405
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,798
How are you feeling? Better?

406
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,010
-Yes.
-Can we go somewhere to talk?

407
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:10,970
Get in.

408
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,855
I saw Ms. Ji.
She lives in the same building as me.

409
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,316
-Since when?
-When I moved there.

410
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,694
Do you think Seung-yoo knows that or not?

411
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,097
I read the article.

412
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,891
What's your plan?

413
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,353
I'm going to punish them.

414
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,358
They're going to lose a lot of sleep.
I can guarantee that.

415
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,193
Prosecutor Park Jung-won?

416
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:12,865
During a committee hearing last year,
I gave him a tough time.

417
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,285
I don't have any insight
on what's going on.

418
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:24,544
I knew Han Myung-jin
would cause trouble sooner or later.

419
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,797
Why didn't you fire him sooner?

420
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,175
Are you saying it's my fault?

421
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,054
Don't you remember that it was your wife

422
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,349
who bribed him to get the answer sheet?

423
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,684
What I'm saying is that

424
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:44,105
we need to tie up any loose ends.
And cut them loose.

425
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,690
Like that. Good.

426
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,954
I didn't like Han Myung-jin…

427
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,966
Principal. It's me, Ye-lin.

428
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,393
-What brings you here at this hour?
-I'm sorry for coming at this hour.

429
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,812
I have something to tell you.

430
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,898
Sit down.

431
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,532
What is it?

432
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,869
Are you here because of Mr. Han too?

433
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,996
What about Mr. Han? What is it?

434
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,083
You didn't see the news?
Everyone has been talking about it.

435
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,130
Damn it.

436
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,924
If it's not about that, then why?

437
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,054
Ms. Ji Yoon-su has returned.
She's in Hangok-dong.

438
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,813
Have you seen her?

439
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,232
Someone saw her and knows where she lives.

440
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,069
Noh Jung-ah, Sung Ye-lin,

441
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,279
Sung Min-joon,

442
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,073
Han Myung-jin, and Choi Sung-han.

443
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,535
Those are the people involved
as far as I know.

444
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,663
I'm going to rattle their nerves.

445
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,583
The more worried they get,

446
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,336
it'll be likely
they'll betray and blackmail one another.

447
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,884
So?

448
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,719
I thought you should know.

449
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,140
Do you still like Seung-yoo?

450
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,895
You gave me that photo of her
because you were consumed with jealousy.

451
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,565
You still can't get over him,

452
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,861
so you come straight here
after hearing that Ji Yoon-su is back?

453
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,780
The fact that she has returned
doesn't only affect me.

454
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,659
That's how you always handle a matter.

455
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:06,455
You never get your own hands dirty
and make someone else get what you want.

456
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,999
I didn't make you do anything.

457
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,252
I had no idea
you would use that photo like that.

458
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,254
I used it?

459
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,387
Did you say,

460
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,682
"use"?

461
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,109
Ye-lin.

462
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,571
You don't seem to remember clearly.

463
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,490
It was for your sake.

464
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,787
I did it for your sake.

465
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,959
You and your mom

466
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,172
got the answer sheet from Mr. Han.

467
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,466
But Ji Yoon-su found out.

468
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,554
If I hadn't used that photo,
what would have happened to you?

469
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,059
Ye-lin, answer me.

470
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,899
You're accusing me of using it?

471
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,860
That's not true.

472
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,739
I helped you with that problem.

473
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,577
So find a solution by yourself this time.

474
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,417
Figure out if Seung-yoo
is also involved in this.

475
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,463
And you want to know
that more than anyone else.

476
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,966
I'll do it.

477
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,676
But…

478
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,930
don't expect anything like
the photo I took in Jeju.

479
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,975
I'm not going to share anything with you.

480
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,370
You heard everything, right?
Ji Yoon-su has returned.

481
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,174
Did you have to treat her like that?

482
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,427
Then what should have I done?

483
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,512
That I'm going to
work together with your dad

484
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,848
like last time
and take care of everything?

485
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,851
You're going to take some kind of action.

486
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,562
The audit and accusation
against Han Myung-jin…

487
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,856
Don't you think Ji Yoon-su is behind it?

488
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,319
Could she have done it by herself?

489
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,278
Then…

490
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,114
Paik Seung-yoo is helping her?

491
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,785
While they fight each other,

492
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,624
let's work as a team.

493
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,088
Seung-yoo.

494
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,092
I'm worried about you.

495
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:10,097
You might lose everything you've achieved.

496
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,229
I haven't achieved great things.

497
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,149
And I can always start over.

498
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,109
But…

499
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,572
there's one person
I don't want to lose again.

500
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,786
Do you trust me?

501
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,040
You'll never have to hide again.

502
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,626
You'll have nothing to fear,

503
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,170
and you won't suffer from nightmares.

504
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,465
I want to bring back your smile.

505
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,302
That's all I want.

506
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,127
Go in.

507
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,006
Isn't it dangerous to ride a motorcycle?

508
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,050
Not if you wear a helmet and drive safely.

509
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,886
Have you been on a motorcycle?

510
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,973
Do you want to ride it? It's exhilarating.

511
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,560
Seung-yoo.

512
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,272
I'm worried about you.

513
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,124
CHOI SHI-AN

514
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,544
IF K IS AN INTEGER, PROVE THAT K
IS A PERFECT SQUARE NUMBER

515
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,851
This textbook was made for you
under a partnership

516
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,313
with the top educational
consultant in the industry.

517
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,317
Unfortunately, the other students
will not be receiving this textbook.

518
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,362
So you'll have to be considerate
towards them

519
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,615
to ensure they don't feel disadvantaged.

520
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,658
-Okay.
-Okay.

521
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,620
There's no need to feel guilty, though.

522
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,456
You will become
leading members of society,

523
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,750
so you have a big responsibility.

524
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:52,504
A minister, senator, or CEO.

525
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:57,134
You need to follow in
your parent's footsteps.

526
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,222
You're dismissed. Study hard.

527
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,475
-Okay.
-Okay.

528
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,561
Kim Ji-na.

529
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,522
You can remain.

530
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:13,108
Mr. Han was fired.

531
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,152
He's been fired? Just like that?

532
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,363
The disciplinary committee
made a decision.

533
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,198
The committee agreed to terminate him.

534
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,578
-What is that?
-What is going on?

535
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,623
My goodness. Isn't that Mr. Han's car?

536
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:28,916
I think it's his.

537
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,971
-What is going on?
-He's coming back?

538
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,641
What? You can talk to me.

539
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,228
What's your problem?

540
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:52,272
If I was born with your privilege,
looks, and brains,

541
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,900
I wouldn't act like that.

542
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:58,404
I'd take advantage of
your privilege instead of rebelling.

543
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,156
-Old fogey.
-What did you say?

544
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,367
You think you're a great mom, don't you?

545
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,537
You tell me I'm not grateful
and why I have a problem.

546
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,872
How can you be a good mom
if you don't understand?

547
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,251
I'll go if you're done talking.

548
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,055
-Where do you think you're going?
-To speak to the principal.

549
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,808
Don't just stand there. Take him away.

550
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,477
Don't touch me. Let go!

551
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,063
I said let go!

552
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,023
What are you doing?

553
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,275
-Let go!
-What's going on?

554
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,568
-Let go.
-That's crazy.

555
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,902
Let go!

556
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,696
Go back to your classrooms!

557
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,449
-And you? Isn't it shocking?
-Did you get a good shot?

558
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,159
Hey, this is the one.

559
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,332
How come you have that textbook?

560
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,793
Where did you get yours?
What's that textbook?

561
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,338
You don't need to know.

562
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,425
-Did you steal that?
-What? Me?

563
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,760
Isn't that the math clinic textbook?

564
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,472
I barely got in.
So it's impossible for you.

565
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,765
Where did you get that?

566
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,267
What are you talking about?

567
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,897
You forgot you're not supposed
to talk about it?

568
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,024
If you break that rule,
you'll get kicked out.

569
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,692
So be quiet.

570
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,451
So she does go to that math clinic.

571
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:28,577
Let go!

572
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,706
Why am I fired? The investigation
isn't even finished yet.

573
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,501
I worked for 20 years for the school.

574
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:39,588
How could you fire me overnight?

575
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,673
Let go of me, you bastards!

576
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,677
You'll pay for this.

577
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,680
I'm not going down by myself.
This rotten school!

578
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:59,066
I'm sorry. I should have prevented him
from entering the school.

579
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,860
Are you taking care of that matter?

580
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,530
I'm already on it.

581
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,131
Did you get off work?

582
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:35,018
Your school is in the news.

583
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,980
Is everything okay with you?

584
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,941
Yes, I'm okay.

585
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,195
It's just as Ms. Yoo said.

586
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,739
You're all grown up.

587
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,661
I read your paper.

588
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,666
You read it all?

589
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,377
You sent it to us for us to read,
didn't you?

590
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,421
It's hard to understand
the concepts in it.

591
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,631
Tell me about it. It was hard.

592
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:09,011
I looked up the terms
and Googled references.

593
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,514
I even stayed up all night.

594
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,809
I couldn't understand a single sentence.

595
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,317
The paper you wrote reflects who you are.

596
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,571
You're my son, but…

597
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,117
you're so different from me.

598
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,078
You were always so brilliant.

599
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:43,545
I didn't know how to nurture
your talent and raise you.

600
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,424
It was hard and I floundered.

601
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,472
I thought I could understand
how your mind works

602
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:56,224
if I could understand even
one sentence in your paper,

603
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,853
but I failed miserably.

604
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,564
Is Mom

605
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,399
fine?

606
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,318
Sure. She's well.

607
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,696
Come visit us once. Have a homemade meal.

608
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,410
I got rid of the trophy room.

609
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,913
Where did you put them all?

610
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:21,833
They were meaningless
when you were never coming home.

611
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,835
You threw them out?

612
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,924
I put them out on the balcony in a box.

613
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,184
I'll visit you on the weekend.

614
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,355
Okay. Don't forget.

615
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,447
Did you skip lunch again?

616
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,617
You're not eating your meals.
That can cause problems.

617
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,910
No.

618
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,540
I'll send your meal to your room.
So please eat it.

619
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,166
I'll check later.

620
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,501
Damn it.

621
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,716
Professor.

622
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,470
How are you?

623
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,224
I came to do my homework.

624
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,478
I have a really tough assignment.

625
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,980
Could you help me with it?

626
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,277
This is the problem, Professor.

627
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,740
IF K IS AN INTEGER, PROVE THAT K
IS A PERFECT SQUARE NUMBER

628
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,757
Ms. Ji.

629
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,386
Ms. Ji Yoon-su.

630
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,487
You look different.

631
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,953
When did you move here?

632
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,080
Why do you need to know?

633
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,416
I didn't think you'd return.

634
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,251
I'm surprised.

635
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,673
Why are you back?

636
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,302
Do I have to answer that?

637
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,555
It's not a difficult question to answer

638
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,016
compared to my next questions.

639
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,562
I saw you together with Seung-yoo.

640
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:53,276
What are you planning with him?

641
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,174
You shouldn't be doing that.

642
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,677
Doing what?

643
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,220
Well,

644
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,391
of course, I see why
you might need Seung-yoo.

645
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,186
I don't know what kind of work
you're doing,

646
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:32,315
but you can use his fame
by claiming to be the teacher

647
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,693
that taught a brilliant mathematician.

648
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,696
But you shouldn't do that.

649
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:41,741
Just because your life was destroyed,
doesn't give you the right

650
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,535
to ruin Seung-yoo's.

651
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:50,083
And do you know this?

652
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:54,588
Seung-yoo had a big crush
on you back then.

653
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,008
You two even made a cute couple.

654
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,012
But things are different now.

655
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:06,016
Do you think
he still has those feelings for you?

656
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:14,858
He probably feels guilt
and remorse for what happened.

657
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:38,256
Wow! I solved the problem you gave us!

658
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,009
Professor Ji Hyeon-wook
helped me solve it.

659
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,428
Are you at the nursing home?

660
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:47,557
I'm continuing the chess game.
Do you want to come and watch?

661
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:02,781
PAIK SEUNG-YOO

662
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,117
I think you understand what I'm saying.

663
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,453
Please don't harm Seung-yoo's career.

664
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,538
I'm asking this as a favor.

665
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,541
You're right.

666
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,380
My life was ruined.

667
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,092
It was hard to accept.

668
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,511
Thanks for forcing me
to confront that fact.

669
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,764
But…

670
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:31,393
I'm not embarrassed about my life.

671
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,688
I don't feel any shame.

672
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,566
Because I didn't do anything wrong.

673
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,986
Even back then.

674
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:44,823
Are you blaming me
for what happened to you?

675
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,829
Of course, it was unfortunate.

676
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,834
Why are you smirking?

677
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,421
You turned out

678
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,257
just as I predicted.

679
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:08,179
I was hoping you'd mature and learn
how to apologize for your actions.

680
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,350
Ye-lin.

681
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,021
This isn't something unfortunate.

682
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,315
You're supposed to apologize

683
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:23,445
after doing something wrong

684
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,782
that destroyed a person's life.

685
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,327
You should admit you were wrong.

686
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,041
I know that

687
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,668
nothing will change.

688
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:41,880
But…

689
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,091
saying that this was unfortunate…

690
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,470
changes the equation.

691
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,390
The circumstances will drastically change,

692
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,267
now that you've said that.

693
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,938
I had excluded you until now, you know.

694
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,319
You're a smart girl,
so I expect you'll get my drift.

695
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,870
You weren't keeping tabs on
where Ji Yoon-su was?

696
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,917
I did know she was teaching math
at a cram school in the suburbs.

697
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:23,296
But I don't know where
she's been for the last year. I'm sorry.

698
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:25,757
Did you find anything suspicious
after Seung-yoo came to our school?

699
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,801
I didn't detect anything.

700
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:34,432
Did the Office of Education's audit
have anything to do with Mr. Paik?

701
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:38,228
Do you think he came
to our school with an ulterior motive?

702
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:42,482
Report back to me
where Paik Seung-yoo goes

703
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,776
and who he meets.

704
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,150
And do you know this?

705
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:29,821
Seung-yoo had a big crush
on you back then.

706
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,825
You two even made a cute couple.

707
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,078
But things are different now.

708
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,470
PAIK SEUNG-YOO

709
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,334
Why do you have…

710
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,885
Give it to me.

711
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,015
You didn't solve it?

712
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,142
You couldn't?

713
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,853
No, I couldn't.

714
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:32,355
So?

715
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,234
Do I have to work on a problem like this?
What's the point?

716
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,403
Why are you so angry?

717
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:43,408
Are you embarrassed that
you couldn't solve a problem like that?

718
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,285
But why did you look at the answer first?

719
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,330
You should have tried until you solved it.

720
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:52,250
You weren't like this before.

721
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:55,420
The joy from working on a problem
without looking up the answer…

722
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,256
The anguish from being stumped.

723
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:03,302
The thrill and anxiety you feel.
The process was pure joy.

724
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,186
I don't feel those emotions anymore.

725
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,775
What does not solving a problem
have to do with my life?

726
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:20,194
Does it change anything?

727
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,613
It's just trivial math.

728
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,910
You wanted to solve it!

729
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:31,164
You worked on it for hours

730
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,541
and then came to the library
to find the answer.

731
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,589
You can't get the problem out of your head

732
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,593
and you see it
even if you try hard not to.

733
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:47,180
Your hand scribbles

734
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,184
possible solutions without even thinking.

735
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,480
We stayed up all night at school once

736
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,858
to solve a problem. It was pure joy.

737
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,960
Yes, it's trivial math.

738
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,713
It's just math.

739
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,701
My love for her is true.

740
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:16,621
No margin of error. No contradictions.

741
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,539
There's an empty board seat
in our foundation.

742
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,375
-Choi Shi-an did what?
-What did she plagiarize?

743
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,211
Seems like she solved it
by referencing a paper.

744
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:27,798
You act like you're superior
and different from me.

745
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,592
But we're not different, after all.

746
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,135
Can't you just trust me
and let me handle this?

747
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:33,179
What damning evidence do you have?

748
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:36,724
You're controlling yourself quite well.
Even though you must have a lot to say.

749
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:38,142
Does it look like I'm controlling myself?

750
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:46,609
