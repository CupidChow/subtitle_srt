ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,317
Paik Seung-yoo.

3
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,944
Paik Seung-yoo.

4
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,529
Paik Seung-yoo!

5
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,835
I found you.

6
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,222
Eco bag?

7
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,932
Yes, we got our bags mixed up.

8
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,267
So you go to Asung High?

9
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,604
Let me reintroduce myself.

10
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,779
I teach math at Asung High School.
My name is Ji Yoon-su.

11
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,740
And you're…

12
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,409
Paik Seung-yoo?

13
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,645
Do you like math?

14
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,231
No.

15
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,408
This is your answer sheet, right?

16
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:40,952
No, it's not mine.

17
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,249
This vector sign
is what they use in universities.

18
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,087
Do you expect me to
believe that you don't like math?

19
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,259
You're in big trouble

20
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,469
for lying to me.

21
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,680
You shouldn't lie to your teacher.

22
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,559
I'll give you detention.

23
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,604
Come to this classroom
by 7:30 a.m. on Monday.

24
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,023
-And bring your camera.
-Why do you need my camera?

25
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,108
It's part of your detention.

26
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,068
I'll see you on Monday then.

27
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,619
If you're a no-show, I'll dock your grade.

28
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:30,919
DAD

29
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,880
Don't be late for your 6 p.m. appointment.

30
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,571
It's a tricky math problem.

31
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,241
The author of the problem
wanted it to be too hard to solve.

32
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,619
The teacher told the class that
she wouldn't give out

33
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,330
CSAT prep math problems
to the math club members.

34
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,332
Why did she make them solve this?
It doesn't even help.

35
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:13,378
I think the teacher, Ms. Ji, is focused
on winning the Math Olympiad.

36
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:18,925
The 3rd and 6th problems in the Olympiad
are the most difficult of them all.

37
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,095
You can't solve them
by using conventional methods.

38
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,931
I heard that Ye-lin got the answer right.

39
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,269
Gyu-young tells me
that Ye-lin didn't solve it.

40
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,353
Didn't she?

41
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,856
-Then who did?
-Nobody knows.

42
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,442
If nobody knows,
then why even bring it up?

43
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:40,947
You know Gyu-young gets
so competitive around Ye-lin.

44
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,282
Oh, it's warm in here.

45
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,409
-Gosh.
-The weather is so good today.

46
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,452
Hello, sir.

47
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,872
My son is Paik Seung-yoo
and he'll be joining your course today.

48
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,584
I see. But he has to pass
our placement test first.

49
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,796
Sir. Can anyone take a placement test now?

50
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,882
I'm pulling Ye-lin out
of this cram school.

51
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,719
How could the worst student
at Asung take a placement test here?

52
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,095
Unbelievable.

53
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,725
You're acting so haughty
because Ye-lin is the top student?

54
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,643
She used to lag behind Seung-yoo
by a mile.

55
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,938
What did you say? By a mile?

56
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,649
It's a fact. You don't remember?
I can refresh your memory.

57
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,153
-Go ahead and refresh my memory.
-Ye-lin scored 28 points back then…

58
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,446
What? So what?

59
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,657
Let me tell you again
because you can't remember!

00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,960
Oh, sir. I'm so sorry.

63
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,129
I'll make sure he doesn't do that again.

64
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,216
If you'll give my son
another chance, I'll bring…

65
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,219
Hello? Sir? Hello?

66
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,932
He didn't show up?

67
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,017
No.

POPULAR TEACHER JI YOON-SU
MENTORS GIFTED STUDENTS IN MATH

69
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,229
-Please prepare a chateaubriand steak.
-Okay.

70
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,232
It has a nice marbled look.

71
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,278
Where is my dad? Did he go somewhere?

72
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,407
Did he go fishing again?

73
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,367
He left very early…

74
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,661
You were terrific today.

75
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,998
I was on a roll, wasn't I?

76
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,126
Oh, hey. Yeon-woo and I
went fishing together.

77
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,544
Just a minute.

78
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,300
Dad was amazing today.
He caught a huge fish.

79
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,971
-Please cook spicy fish stew for dinner.
-Okay.

80
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,774
All right.

81
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:05,985
Cheers.

82
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:11,032
It's too bad
you don't like spicy fish stew.

83
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,868
Jung-ah is a picky eater.

84
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:14,952
I can make you sushi.

85
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,288
No, thanks. Enjoy it.

86
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,125
How is the high school
credit system faring?

87
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,086
We're fully compliant. By the way--

88
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,506
We're also going
to join the program, Father.

89
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,423
I see.

90
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,926
Grading the essay section
and written questions

91
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,677
under the high school credit system
will be radically different.

92
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,513
Oh, so then what?

93
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,349
We're focusing
on the International Baccalaureate.

94
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:40,603
Our International Middle School will focus
on debating skills and essay writing.

95
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:45,316
Education needs to focus on producing
students who can become productive members

96
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,610
of society and
be internationally competitive.

97
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,531
I see. I'm excited about that.

98
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,117
We're working on a special project
with the Ministry of Education.

99
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,620
The Ministry of Education?

100
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,122
We're planning to remake our school
into a school for the gifted.

101
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,583
-Right.
-We have to pass the evaluations first,

102
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,127
so we think the special project
will boost our chances.

103
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,841
I don't know how you're planning it,
but you need to be careful.

104
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,681
It'll look bad if the public learns about
any links between the ministry

105
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:20,393
-and a private school.
-Yeon-woo has a good point.

106
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,562
-You have to be careful.
-Sure.

107
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,898
I was going to play golf
with Vice Minister Shin.

108
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,694
But I think I'll have to delay it.

109
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,113
All right.

110
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,867
I'd like some sushi.

111
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,128
It's finished. You can take it.

112
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,255
Thanks.

113
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,633
Oh, right.
I think I added too much wasabi.

114
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,803
I know you don't like spicy foods.
Sorry about that.

115
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:59,015
No need to be sorry. I won't eat it.

116
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,692
What is it this time?

117
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,446
Yeon-woo, can you raise the level
of the quality of your school?

118
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,697
Quality?

119
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,452
Parents around Hangok-dong are saying
that your school isn't good anymore.

120
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,037
Did you know about that?

121
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,582
-Fewer students got into top high schools.
-Jung-ah.

122
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,127
How long will you bend over
backward to please the parents?

123
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,423
Are you a businessperson?
Try to be classy.

124
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,093
You don't know anything about reality.

125
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,013
The college admissions
isn't about education.

126
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,473
It's spawned an industry.

127
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,141
How could you say that?

128
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:46,062
College admission results
bring prestige, power and fame.

129
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,149
Analyze the needs of your clients
and produce results.

130
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,944
That's how you maintain our reputation
as a family of educators.

131
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,420
You know, whenever
you talk about a "family of educators",

132
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,588
it's laughable.

133
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,802
I mean, you didn't grow up with us.

134
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,722
I like your strong work ethic though.

135
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,810
My late grandfather,
Han Sung-pil, the school founder,

136
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,603
would have been fond of you.

137
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:33,651
He liked hardworking staff
who showed dedication.

138
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,905
Oh, right.

139
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,783
Asung High hired Ji Yoon-su
as a teacher, right?

140
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,285
You know her?

141
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,787
We went to Asung High together.

142
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,998
But don't mention me to her.

143
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,020
He's the fiance of Ji Yoon-su?

144
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,732
He's an officer at the MoE,
and he oversees planning.

145
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,776
Small world, right?

146
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,737
It turns out he's the son
of former prime minister Ryu Hyun-il.

147
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,949
No wonder Vice Minister Shin favors him.

148
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,495
You'll add a high school category in
the International Mathematician Olympics?

149
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,207
Yes, I think it'll spur interest
in science among high schoolers.

150
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,793
And the Math Council
and the MoE will co-host it.

151
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,086
It's a win-win.

152
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,172
That'll raise the profile
of the Math Council

153
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,300
and help the ministry get
good evaluation in the government report.

154
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,885
Exactly.

155
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,136
He's very smart.

156
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,013
And he's good at execution.

157
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,764
He's the opposite of Ji Yoon-su.

158
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,724
How so?

159
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,354
How will you select the judges?

160
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:57,359
We'll have to appoint
a few of our people to the panel.

161
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,905
But before we get to that,

162
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,284
how will you choose
the team to represent Asung High?

163
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,537
If they're chosen by the principal,
that'll create an uproar.

164
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,082
We'll have to hold a school math contest
just for the sake of it.

165
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,710
-All the students will compete in it.
-The entire school?

166
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,545
We got so many complaints from parents

167
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,590
when we sent a team drawn
from AP students to the English contest.

168
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,885
So we can't pick a team like that anymore.

169
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:29,767
But do you even like Ji Yoon-su?

170
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,310
It doesn't seem like you do.

171
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:37,316
I don't need her especially.

172
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,568
Then what do you need?

173
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,572
Just a vessel to guide
Asung High students.

174
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,787
All right.

175
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,125
What's that?

176
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,088
Just a second.
I need to submit this application today.

177
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,138
-What?
-I have a surprise gift.

178
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,807
A surprise gift?

179
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,518
What is it?

180
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,020
We're adding a high school category

181
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,357
to the International
Mathematician Olympics.

182
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,276
A high school category?

183
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,446
And we'll co-host the Olympics
with the Math Council.

184
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,157
That's fantastic.

185
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,661
-Is it that great?
-Of course, it is.

186
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,955
Then students from our school
can compete too, right?

187
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,207
Asung High will probably send one student.

188
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,295
How's work? You started teaching classes.

189
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,255
Oh, right.

190
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,884
Did you meet the director?
She's the chairman's daughter.

191
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,302
Yes.

192
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,305
She's peculiar.

193
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,849
Their family makes all the decisions,

194
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,935
so they have got more power
than the principal or vice-principal.

195
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,564
Even though the director
was born out of wedlock,

196
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,275
rumor has it that
she's in contention to succeed her dad.

197
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,321
They say she has complete control
over the foundation operations.

198
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,907
Are you listening?

199
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,577
So when will they
announce the Competition?

200
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,288
I'm talking about
more important stuff than that.

201
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,749
-He'd be a great contestant.
-Who?

202
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,751
I told you before.

203
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,587
There is a Ramanujan in our school.

204
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,705
Paik Seung-yoo?

205
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,709
Yes. Can I see his student record
from last semester?

206
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,795
Oh, sure.

207
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,882
But why? Did he get into any trouble?

208
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,134
No, it's nothing like that.

209
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,845
I'm just curious about him.

210
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,391
STUDENT RECORD: PAIK SEUNG-YOO

211
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,063
10TH GRADE, MATH, 9TH PERCENTILE

212
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,986
11TH GRADE, MATH, 9TH PERCENTILE

213
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,120
A school math contest?

214
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,207
The Ministry of Education is
co-hosting the Mathematician Olympics

215
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,292
and they will add a high school category.

216
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,504
YOUTH MATHEMATICS SPEECH COMPETITION

217
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,131
Oh, right.

218
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,092
Did your boyfriend tell you?

219
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,595
How do you know him?

220
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,140
He works at the MoE, right?

221
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,479
It says each school
can only send one contestant.

222
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,606
Yes.

223
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,693
So we'll pick the student
who wins the school math contest?

224
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,654
Please collaborate
with the other math teachers

225
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,948
to come up with problems that
can accurately assess math skills.

226
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,908
All right. I'll get right to it.

227
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:24,668
Oh, I found the student
who solved the problem.

228
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,212
Oh really? Who was it?

229
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,214
I won't tell you.

230
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,634
But you'll figure it out anyway.

231
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,596
Because that student is very gifted.

232
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,481
IMO 2017
YOUTH MATHEMATICS SPEECH COMPETITION

233
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,982
I presume you all know.

234
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,401
The International Mathematician Olympics

235
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,571
that mathematicians around the world
look forward to every year.

236
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,407
Our country will host it
for the first time.

237
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,828
What's amazing is that
you'll have a chance to compete in it.

238
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,040
But how?

239
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,251
There will be a high school category
in the Olympics.

240
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,797
We'll hold a math contest to pick
one student to represent the school.

241
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,804
I'll also choose the math club team
based on the math contest results.

242
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,681
So enter the contest
if you want to join the math club.

243
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,891
-Okay.
-Okay.

244
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,146
Memorize all of this
for our next class. Got it?

245
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,272
-Okay.
-Class is over.

246
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,566
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

247
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,071
Take a nap after I leave, slacker!

248
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,449
-Goodbye, Teacher.
-Goodbye, Teacher.

249
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,247
Hey, Paik Seung-yoo.

250
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,292
What a nice camera.

251
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,963
Hey, don't touch it. It's not yours.

252
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,757
Ms. Ji Yoon-su wants
to see you in her classroom.

253
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,467
Bring that with you.

254
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,663
You're here. Come in.

255
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,466
-Connect your camera to the laptop.
-For what?

256
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,678
I was thinking about using your photos
to make a course material.

257
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,848
But maybe we can do something
more interesting.

258
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,946
Wait a minute.

259
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,704
-Let's put the photos in here.
-What photos?

260
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,957
Cycloid, Fractal, and Tessellation.

261
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,042
CYCLOID: LOCUS OF A POINT
ON THE RIM OF A CIRCLE OF RADIUS

262
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,126
FRACTAL: INFINITELY COMPLEX PATTERNS,
SELF-SIMILAR ACROSS DIFFERENT SCALES

263
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,377
I saw your photos.

264
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,795
TESSELLATION: TILING OF A PLANE
USING ONE OR MORE GEOMETRIC SHAPES

265
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,426
All right. Next, type this.

266
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,474
These are not photos of an eave, branch,

267
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,185
or window.

268
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,275
Type that down. Below the photo.

269
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,662
If you look at it through the lens
of math, you'll see something new.

270
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,627
Hold on.

271
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,053
Okay.

272
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,057
Now type below the photos.

273
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,478
Quote.

274
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,066
Taking applications
to select a contestant…

275
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:27,536
who will represent Asung High at the 2017
International Mathematician Olympics.

276
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,540
Date and time: 10:00 a.m.,

277
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,210
September 9, 2017.

278
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,047
Venue: Asung High auditorium.

279
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,132
No quota limits.

280
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,885
Anyone can enter.

281
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,971
Unquote.

282
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,058
Let's take a look.

283
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,439
Will you enter?

284
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,317
No.

285
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,488
That's done.

286
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,950
Can I go?

287
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,830
I wonder why you didn't come
in the morning

288
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,957
and why you're
in the 9th percentile in math.

289
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,503
You say you don't like math,
but you obviously like it.

290
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,174
I've got questions,
but I won't ask you anything.

291
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,091
But instead…

292
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:36,354
WHAT'S THE PROBABILITY

293
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:40,942
WHEN "N" POINTS ARE RANDOMLY SELECTED
INSIDE A CIRCLE,

294
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,320
THEY FORM VERTICES
OF A CONVEX N-GON? (WITH N≥4)

295
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,033
Try to solve this problem.

296
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,995
Come here tomorrow at 7:30 a.m.

297
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,331
Why should I?

298
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,335
When mathematicians work on a proof,
they become candid.

299
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,463
I want to see that side of you.

300
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,549
So why do I need to be candid with you?

301
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:11,014
-Think I can help your career in some way?
-Do you think you're special?

302
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,644
Do you think you're a genius?

303
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,649
There are a lot of students
who have a gift like yours.

304
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,983
And do you also know this?

305
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,529
Among famous mathematicians,
a few of them have a low IQ.

306
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,240
So why are you asking me to do this?

307
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,954
It's not because you have a special gift.

308
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,711
But you have a perspective on math,
and that is quite unique.

309
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,926
I like it.

310
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,847
Don't be late tomorrow.

311
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,112
WHAT'S THE PROBABILITY WHEN "N" POINTS
ARE RANDOMLY SELECTED

312
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,947
INSIDE A CIRCLE, THEY FORM VERTICES
OF A CONVEX N-GON? (WITH N≥4)

313
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,289
Excuse me.

314
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,958
You must be Ms. Ji Yoon-su, right?

315
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,626
Yes, that's me.

316
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,380
I'm Paik Seung-yoo's dad.
He's a junior here.

317
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,258
You're his father?

318
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,606
So your son…

319
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,940
Do you remember the news back then?

320
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:47,152
A math genius
who enrolled in MIT at age 10.

321
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,696
But that boy's name was Paik Min-jae.

322
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,156
He changed his name.

323
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,703
When he returned from America,
he was labeled as a failure.

324
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,544
What do you think?

325
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,174
-He's quite different.
-What?

326
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,929
You mean right now?

327
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,890
He's going through puberty.

328
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,017
Puberty?

329
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,186
Teenagers go through a rebellious period.

330
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,230
He's in the throes of teenage angst.

331
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,527
But why did you come to see me?

332
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,697
I heard that you teach
gifted students very well.

333
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,700
I don't think you've met a boy
like Seung-yoo though.

334
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,787
You'll find him a delight to teach.

335
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,249
Could you also prepare him to compete
in the Math Olympiad?

336
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,209
Please guide him to a better future.

337
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:50,257
I don't know anything
about his past though.

338
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,592
Well, if you spend time with him…

339
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,886
Do you know what happened
to him in America?

340
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,266
Regardless of what happened,

341
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,185
it's already been eight years
since he came back.

342
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,603
Eight years?

343
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:12,654
But the talent he has
doesn't just vanish, you know.

344
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,323
If you could guide him…

345
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,994
I don't think Seung-yoo needs
my guidance right now.

346
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,163
Then what do you think he needs?

347
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,209
I don't know what that is yet.

348
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,546
I'm sorry that I can't be of any help.

349
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:32,966
Well…

350
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,888
What do you mean?

351
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:43,268
I don't think it's necessary
to let all the students compete

352
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,602
in the school math contest.

353
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:47,897
Why?

354
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,443
Because it's unnecessary competition.

355
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,445
Unnecessary competition…

356
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:57,407
It serves no purpose to have poor students
enter the math contest.

357
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,702
Is there a criterion where specific
students shouldn't enter a contest?

358
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,247
And another criterion
for students who can enter?

359
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,627
Who will decide that?

360
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,255
Me? You?

361
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,549
Or your dad?

362
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,932
I'm sorry for being thoughtless.

363
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,274
Ye-lin.

364
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,617
I see that
you're feeling a lot of pressure.

365
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,622
The school and your parents

366
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,627
expect a lot from you, don't they?

367
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,135
Ye-lin.

368
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,889
But you still have to try your best.

369
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,310
Otherwise,

370
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:09,938
I'll drop you.

371
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:18,154
You know there are other gifted students
besides you here, right?

372
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,367
Answer me.

373
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,828
Yes, ma'am.

374
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,040
All right. You're dismissed.

375
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,815
WHAT'S THE PROBABILITY WHEN "N" POINTS…

376
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,352
PAIK MIN-JAE

377
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,899
BOY GENIUS PAIK MIN-JAE FALTERS

378
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,359
SUSPICIONS ABOUT BOY GENIUS

379
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,237
GENIUSES SUFFERING FROM MELANCHOLY

380
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,615
YOUNG GENIUS, FAILED TO LAUNCH

381
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,786
PAIK MIN-JAE, THE WINNER OF
INTERNATIONAL MATHEMATICAL CONTEST…

382
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:14,312
WHAT'S THE PROBABILITY WHEN "N" POINTS…

383
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:54,412
But you have a perspective on math,
and that is quite unique.

384
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,249
I like it.

385
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:25,860
MATH CLASSROOM

386
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,101
How about trying this?

387
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,894
Since when…

388
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,797
MATH CLASSROOM

389
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,494
You'll keep working
on this problem, right?

390
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,747
Well, I haven't found the solution yet.

391
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,340
Promise me one thing.

392
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,645
Don't fall in love with this problem.

393
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:17,318
As a mathematician,
solving a problem doesn't make you happy.

394
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,696
Also, an unsolvable problem
doesn't make you unhappy too.

395
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,201
Then why do mathematicians

396
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,496
keep solving problems?

397
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,206
When you work on it,

398
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,250
there's a tingling sensation,

399
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,293
excitement,

400
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,754
or anxiety that you feel.

401
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,013
Whether or not you find the answer,

402
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,599
it's the moment
when you're engrossed in it

403
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,061
that enraptures you.

404
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,243
We stayed up all night.

405
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,537
I came to erase the problem.

406
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:11,747
Why?

407
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,672
I felt like I was imposing it on you.

408
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,928
I'd like you to be free
from any constraints.

409
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,274
Here.

410
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,484
I found your button.

411
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,153
What?

412
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,573
You found it.

413
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,078
Thanks.

414
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,088
What did you say?

415
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,429
Ms. Ji spent the night…

416
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,516
with that student.

417
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,063
The student you told me to look into.

418
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,106
Paik Seung-yoo. 11th Grade, Class No. 8.

419
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:23,486
Bring me Paik Seung-yoo's files.

420
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,030
Okay, Director.

421
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:41,212
So that's the end of detention.

422
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,382
You don't need to come tomorrow.

423
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,028
That was exhilarating.

424
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,494
But I'm also afraid.

425
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:19,166
You're Paik Seung-yoo,
not Paik Min-jae anymore.

426
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,169
I'm glad to meet you.

427
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,204
WINNER: GOLDEN MORNING STAR

428
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,418
All right!

429
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,297
Hey, did you see that?

430
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,507
I told you that Golden Morning Star
would win.

431
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,468
I'm a good judge of horses.

432
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,304
The horse I picked could have won.
It came in second.

433
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,473
-The Number Three horse?
-Yes.

434
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,476
No, it didn't have a chance.

435
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,520
It was never in the lead even once.

436
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,690
So that's not winning. It just lost.

437
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,109
Now listen.

438
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:31,280
A winning horse is usually sired
by a champion horse.

439
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,615
Their stature is different.

440
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,492
They have got broad shoulders,

441
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,578
a thick chest and a slender hind profile.

442
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,624
They have to be born with good genes?

443
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,045
So if they're not born with those traits,

444
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:49,298
they can't win
no matter how hard they try?

445
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,384
What?

446
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,054
They already have
a head start when they're born.

447
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,598
So there's no way you can beat them.

448
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,434
Isn't that true?

449
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,901
Hi.

450
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,861
Have a seat.

451
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,035
Why did you call me at this hour?

452
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,249
You're busy
since the semester began, right?

453
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,084
Book a spa when you have time.

454
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:29,129
Are the school math contest
preparations coming along fine?

455
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,841
There's not much to do.
We always administer tests.

456
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:36,470
But must you let
all your students enter the math contest?

457
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,849
-What's the matter?
-It's a lot of work.

458
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,309
You have to grade them.

459
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,354
And there is no need
to give false hope either.

460
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,647
False hope?

461
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,859
I'm not saying this will happen,
but what if some random kid gets chosen,

462
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,654
-but has to relinquish his entry ticket?
-A random kid?

463
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,949
-You mean Paik Seung-yoo?
-You know that kid?

464
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,911
Senator, he's not a kid.
He goes to our school.

465
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,246
That kid is…

466
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:07,084
I know that kid.

467
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,795
He's got lots of problems.

468
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:13,090
He was called a math genius,
but that turned out to be all hype.

469
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,343
You know he's the worst student
in your school.

470
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,013
Then what's there to worry about him?

471
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,472
I'm not worried.

472
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,058
I just want to avoid a messy situation.

473
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,810
We've planned this
whole Olympics project together.

474
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,562
Planning it…

475
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,732
doesn't mean we pick the winners.

476
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,358
What are you saying?

477
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,277
What about Ye-lin then?

478
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,614
Senator, why are you acting like this?

479
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,575
-Like a demanding child.
-What?

480
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,744
A child?

481
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:48,042
Do you know how to get
what you want the easy way?

482
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,920
Instead of saying what you want,

483
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,716
you listen to what the other person wants.

484
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,473
-Did you like the food?
-It was delicious.

485
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,769
When will they start the next show?

486
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,315
Oh, my, Ms. Noh.

487
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:14,860
Oh, hello, Ms. Yoo.

488
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,779
What brings you here?

489
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,989
I'm having dinner
with our TV production crew.

490
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,491
I had a meeting here.

491
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,577
I see. But why are you alone?

492
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,580
Something came up, so I need to go.

493
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,706
Really?

494
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:31,710
I should be treating you to a nice dinner.

495
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,921
-Let's go out together.
-Shall we? Okay.

496
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,047
Let's go.

497
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,385
Goodbye.

498
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,229
I'll treat you to a nice dinner soon.

499
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,939
-Oh, sure.
-Good night.

500
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,191
-Take care.
-Okay.

501
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,790
Competition is fierce to get accredited
as a school for the gifted.

502
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:13,210
The city is only going to allow one school
to receive that special status,

503
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,129
but 15 charter schools are vying for it.

504
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,048
I heard that a commission

505
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,884
is being selected to decide that.

506
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,594
You want to install

507
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,389
the right commission members?

508
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,103
If you secure a school
for the gifted in your district,

509
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:35,899
won't it help you get re-elected?

510
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,539
I'll do everything possible.

511
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,293
In return, you'll handle
that math contest matter, right?

512
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:58,755
In addition to that,
Ye-lin's academic standings can't fall.

ASUNG HIGH SCHOOL

517
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,175
Asung High?

518
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:48,555
-Oh, hello?
-Am I talking to Paik Seung-yoo's father?

519
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,390
Yes, this is he.

520
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,143
Hello, I'm Choi Sung-han,
Vice-principal at Asung High.

521
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,563
Hello, sir. Why are you calling?

522
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,107
Could you meet me tomorrow at school?

523
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,234
Pardon?

524
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,361
Sure.

525
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,739
What is this about, may I ask?

526
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,741
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

527
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,785
I'll see you tomorrow then.

528
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,787
Okay, Sir. Good night.

529
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,167
What kind of trouble did he get into?

530
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,270

A MATHEMATICIAN'S APOLOGY
BY G.H.HARDY

536
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,270
-It's all done.
-Thank you.

537
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:24,873
Congratulations.

538
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,251
I…

539
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:30,754
Seung-yoo is…

540
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,216
Yes, I think he's regained his focus.

541
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:39,721
You need to be very supportive now.

542
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,475
You can't

543
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,520
let him fail twice.

544
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,481
Of course, not.

545
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:53,318
As the director of school affairs,
our school values a gifted student

546
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,986
like Seung-yoo,

547
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:58,406
but what's important is his future,

548
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,742
not something for the school.

549
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,453
Yes.

550
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,375
Finding the equation

551
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,253
of a parabola…

552
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:16,550
-Gosh. You like math, Min-jae?
-Yes.

553
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,385
How much do you like it?

554
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,262
One hundred percent!

555
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:24,641
-One hundred percent?
-Min-jae, have some fried chicken.

556
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,187
Wow. You like math
more than you like fried chicken.

557
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,188
Yes.

558
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:35,360
-Are you not going to eat?
-No matter what people say about our son

559
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:36,945
that he turned into a dummy,

560
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:42,033
Seung-yoo still has the skills,
doesn't he?

561
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,494
Yes.

562
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:49,082
He never lost it. Min-jae.

563
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:50,584
Min-jae.

564
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:11,938
Ms. Ji.

565
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,816
What? Seung-yoo.

566
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,279
-You live here too?
-Yes.

567
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,698
-He's a student?
-Yes. He goes to our school.

568
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,408
Could you return my umbrella?

569
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,078
-Your umbrella?
-I let you borrow it. Last time.

570
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,623
I remember.

571
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:33,627
-You need it now?
-Yes, right now. I need it.

572
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,173
Sure.

573
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,634
Wait a minute. I'll bring it down.

574
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,782
Seung-yoo. Where are you?

575
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,408
I'm almost home.

576
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,744
You are? Then get here quickly.

577
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,537
Okay.

578
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:15,460
So you're the person whose bag
got mixed up with hers on the train?

579
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,504
And you also go to Asung High?

580
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,798
What a coincidence.

581
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,677
I hope you'll get along with…

582
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:31,977
What?

583
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,856
I'm home.

584
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,484
Seung-yoo!

585
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,695
Oh, my son.

586
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:47,325
I'm so proud of you.

587
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,703
Get ready.

588
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:53,164
Transfer to a science high school.

589
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:54,958
Let's start over.

590
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,628
Your teacher told me everything.

591
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,589
You can do well
if you put your mind to it.

592
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,508
Why did you make us worry so much?

593
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,264
I received a letter of recommendation
from your school.

594
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,809
I'll hire a tutor,
so prepare for the admission exam.

595
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,688
I'm not going.

596
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:20,108
-Seung-yoo.
-I'm not doing it.

597
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:21,901
I'm not going there!

598
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,570
-Come on, Seung-yoo.
-You won't go?

599
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,030
Why you!

600
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:28,408
Wait. Honey, please!

601
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,826
Look at those trophies!

602
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:30,910
Look at it!

603
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,081
I've been patient
with you for eight years.

604
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,169
Sometimes, I told myself
you were dead to me.

605
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,671
That made me feel better for a while.

606
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,673
Fill this with trophies again!

607
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,844
Until you do as I say,
you can't do whatever you want.

608
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,472
Fill this with trophies again!

609
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,474
Answer me!

610
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,893
I said answer me!

611
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,290
What is this?

612
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,293
I'm taking those to school.

615
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,424
Yes, that's right.

616
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,385
Why take them to school?
Just throw them out.

617
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:36,976
I know. You can donate them
to your school library.

618
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,020
They're hard-to-find books, right?

619
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,029
Next week, when will we look at dresses?

620
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,823
-Thursday.
-Right.

621
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,242
I'll get going. Go inside.

622
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:07,590
Seung-yoo.

623
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,478
What's the matter?

624
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,358
Science high school?

625
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,403
What? What are you talking about?

626
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:33,533
You're Paik Seung-yoo
and not Paik Min-jae anymore.

627
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,453
I'm glad to meet you.

628
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,540
You lied to me.

629
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,829
Seung-yoo's dad called?

630
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,165
Yes, he called earlier.

631
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:25,210
Seung-yoo has a school interview today
and has to leave early.

632
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:30,673
I heard that Seung-yoo
was a famous math genius years ago.

633
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,303
Is that why you took an interest in him?

634
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,811
Paik Seung-yoo!

635
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:46,564
Ms. Ji Yoon-su wants you
to come to her classroom.

636
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,092
Sit down.

637
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,473
Let's do this together.

638
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,560
Let's do math together.

639
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,522
Don't go to that school. Learn math here.

640
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:29,774
You told my dad
I should go to a science school.

641
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,570
I don't know how things led to that.

642
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:35,989
But I'll talk to your dad.

643
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:42,787
It doesn't matter
if you're a math genius or not.

644
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:46,165
It doesn't matter if you can
still do math like you used to.

645
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:47,709
But…

646
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,422
You know how it feels and so do I.

647
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,554
When you're solving a problem,
you don't hear anything else.

648
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,556
There's nothingness in that moment.

649
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,241
You feel totally free.

650
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:26,456
Don't give up on that, Seung-yoo.

651
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,261
Hello?

652
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:44,766
Right now?

653
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,228
Okay.

654
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,362
-I have to go now.
-Seung-yoo.

655
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:03,159
I couldn't solve that problem.

656
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,580
I thought I could.

657
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,751
But I couldn't solve it.
I'm going to give up.

658
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,214
You said there are unsolvable problems.

659
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,346
Get in. Hurry.

660
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,015
Wait!

661
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:15,857
Mr. Paik, let me teach Seung-yoo.

662
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,360
You told me you couldn't help him.

663
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:22,447
You changed your mind
since I'm transferring him?

664
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,659
I'm sorry but it's too late, Ms. Ji.

665
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,620
-Now get in, son.
-You have to leave him alone.

666
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:30,747
What?

667
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,875
Seung-yoo can reach his abilities
only if you stop constraining him.

668
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:42,049
Learn math from me, okay?

669
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,430
I can't believe this.

670
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,349
Now, get out of the way.

671
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,392
Get in the car.

672
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,102
Get in.

673
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:02,403
Have a good day, Ms. Ji.

674
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:43,236
What a teacher. Unbelievable.

675
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,322
She refused to teach you when I asked her.

676
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,450
-When did you meet her?
-Who?

677
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:51,577
Ms. Ji?

678
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,080
On Monday.

679
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,543
I felt like I was imposing it on you.

680
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:02,255
I'd like you to be free
from any constraints.

681
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,346
Thanks to your school director's
recommendation,

682
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,892
the science school called.
They want you to come in for an interview.

683
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,854
-Then we're…
-I've waited for this day.

684
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,399
I prayed so hard.

685
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,278
Win the Nobel Prize, son.

686
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,280
There is no Nobel Prize for math.

687
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:30,157
The other medal they give…
The ones equivalent to a Nobel.

688
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:33,494
Or work at NASA on rockets.

689
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:38,791
Be a professor at Cambridge or MIT.

690
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,878
Set up a math institute
with your name on it.

691
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:48,050
Don't be like your old man.
Do great things.

692
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,070
Can I do those things at Asung High?

693
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:11,741
-What can Asung High offer?
-Mathematics. I'll try hard.

694
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:15,328
We put the apartment up for sale.
I'm going to sell the cafe too.

695
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:19,498
You can stay at the school dorm.
They have one there.

696
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:24,170
We're going to pay off all our debts
and move to a small town.

697
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:26,255
It's decided.

698
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:30,468
MATH CLASSROOM

699
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:34,096
Isn't the second problem too difficult?

700
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,932
Who cares? It's a math contest.

701
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:39,226
There are too many complex equations
you have to use to solve it.

702
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,270
Should we make that the last problem?

703
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,023
Or we could reduce the number of problems.

704
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:47,985
It's okay. The students will choose
which ones they'll solve.

705
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,864
It'll be so hard to grade them.

706
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,034
We have to determine the point system too.

707
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,800
YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF YOUR DESTINY

708
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:18,349
NOBEL WINNER IN CHEMISTRY,
NOBEL WINNER IN PHYSIOLOGY OR MEDICINE

709
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,363
Let's go for lunch.

710
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:34,699
-I'm famished.
-Good job.

711
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,492
Wait for me.

712
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:38,035
What are you going to have?

713
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:59,056
MATH CLASSROOM

714
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:09,525
ASUNG HIGH SCHOOL MATH CONTEST

715
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:24,081
You think you can do well
on the admission exam?

716
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,669
Don't get nervous.
Call me after you're done.

717
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,088
Okay.

718
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:58,783
Ye-lin.

719
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,910
I took care of it.

720
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:03,329
So now you just have to
perform well, okay?

721
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,538
Okay.

722
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,613
2017 SCIENCE HIGH SCHOOL ADMISSIONS EXAM

723
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:37,965
PROVE THAT THERE IS
ONLY ONE PLANE THAT INCLUDES POINT P

724
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:06,035
ASUNG HIGH SCHOOL MATH CONTEST

725
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,248
We don't know who among you

726
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:13,959
will compete in the International
Mathematician Olympics.

727
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:19,882
It's a rare opportunity,
so pour all your energy into it.

728
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:25,804
I hope you'll do your best,
Asung High students. Shall we begin?

729
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,308
There's…

730
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:33,979
still some time left.

731
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:40,444
All right. We have to follow the schedule.

732
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:43,030
How about we pass out
the blank answer sheets first?

733
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:45,282
Let's begin.

734
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:52,206
Pass out the blank sheets.

735
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:09,181
Shall we close the door now?

736
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:57,146
I solved it.

737
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:02,651
I solved the problem.

738
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:47,446
Don't worry about Paik Seung-yoo.
He's not the competition.

739
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:49,198
Try to take care of it.

740
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:53,118
I wonder how this will grow
under your stubborn personality.

741
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,953
Are you sure you won't regret it?

742
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,747
You should be worried.

743
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:59,083
You might never
get the top score in math again.

744
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,627
I'll explain everything later.
It's really important.

745
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,712
More important than
our wedding preparations?

746
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,757
-Why are you suddenly acting like this?
-It's not sudden.

747
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,550
I want to learn more about you.
Don't hide who you are.

748
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:11,595
Really? Can I really show you
everything about me?

749
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:17,142
