1
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:21,354
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,530
Welcome.

3
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,875
It's been a while since
I last saw you, Ms. Ji.

4
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,460
How have you been?

5
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,755
Sorry for asking you to come
on such short notice. Have a seat.

6
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,801
It's Paik Seung-yoo!

7
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,595
Paik Seung-yoo!

8
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,430
Are you here to press charges
against Asung High School?

9
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:56,514
Yes, I am.

10
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,600
You are still claiming
that you were framed to cover up

11
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,643
-a cheating scandal at the school?
-Yes.

12
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,730
You mean you had no relationship
with the math teacher, whatsoever?

13
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,315
You're claiming that
you two are completely innocent, right?

14
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,403
Then could you explain this?
I received a tip.

15
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:17,035
I don't have the right to ask
for a favor, but here I am.

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,037
Please go ahead.

17
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,665
Ms. Ji, how do you see my son's situation?

18
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,920
I'm very disappointed and worried.

19
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,672
I don't understand what he's doing.

20
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,050
Why is he risking his career like that?

21
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,510
It worries me.

22
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,679
It worries me too.

23
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,183
Ms. Ji, could you please
do a favor for me, then?

24
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,605
You don't care?
Because you're in love with her?

25
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,732
Yes. I'm in love with her.

26
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,068
-What did he say?
-Mr. Paik, could you clarify?

27
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,612
Are you in love
with your former math teacher, or not?

28
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:06,084
I only have one expectation from my son.

29
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:11,381
I don't wish for him to gain more fame
by producing more brilliant work.

30
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,508
He loves math so much.

31
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,344
It pains me to see him try to prove a case

32
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,180
that happened four years ago.

33
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,936
What are your expectations then?

34
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,648
I want him

35
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,570
to live an ordinary life,

36
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,447
like other people his age.

37
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,828
Please help me, Ms. Ji.

38
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,791
I'm pleading with you.

39
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,221
I also have something to tell you.

40
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:05,101
We've received your filing,
and we'll contact you soon.

41
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,102
Okay.

42
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,649
COMPLAINT FILING

43
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,484
-There he is!
-He's coming out.

44
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,571
Could you comment about
what you said on the tape?

45
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,907
If you said that on tape,
how can you claim you were framed?

46
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,199
You said that mathematicians

47
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,285
can only tell the truth
in your speech at the ceremony.

48
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,621
Is that why you won't say anything?

49
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,498
Because it's not true that you didn't have
a relationship with your teacher?

50
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,667
-What is the truth then?
-Tell us!

51
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,878
-Mr. Paik Seung-yoo!
-Please tell us the truth!

52
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,812
The fourth board meeting
of Asung Foundation shall begin.

53
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,318
I would like to add another item
to the agenda.

54
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,530
It's a serious case of fraud
committed against the foundation.

55
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:03,785
Also, it needs to be expedited because
it may result in disciplinary action,

56
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,828
such as the termination of Principal Noh.

57
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:15,797
Shouldn't such an important item
be submitted to the board beforehand, sir?

58
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,384
Let her speak.

59
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,678
Please look at the presentation.

60
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,641
Somnium is a non-profit foundation

61
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:30,311
that Principal Noh founded
with Lim Hyung-bin recently.

62
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,022
Principal Noh used it
as a vehicle to funnel money

63
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,566
out of Asung Foundation's Parents Fund.

64
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,366
-What evidence do you have?
-The names of the donors

65
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,120
who pledged money to Asung Foundation
are also on the list of donors to Somnium.

66
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,832
The amount of the pledged donations
are also identical.

67
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,920
Let me explain.

68
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,881
May I speak to the board?

69
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,927
An internal audit will look
into Principal Noh's conduct.

70
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,805
Once the audit is finished,

71
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,350
the board will decide
whether to terminate her employment.

72
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,728
That will be all.

73
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,078
Good job.

74
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,832
Even the wily Noh Jung-ah
won't be able to get out of this one.

75
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,167
Thanks, Aunt.

76
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,009
Dad.

77
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,635
I don't want to hear your excuses.

78
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,970
I'm not making any excuses.

79
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,680
I just want to tell you the truth.

80
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,270
The money that went
to the non-profit are not donations.

81
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,731
They're consulting fees.

82
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,191
Consulting?

83
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,735
Yes.

84
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,781
It's money that students paid
for consulting services

85
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,533
to apply to Ivy League schools
and to bribe admission officers.

86
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,535
They'll be given in the form
of "donations."

87
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,330
I think you were lining your pockets!

88
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,082
Dad.

89
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,293
Dad, I don't need

90
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,338
that money at all.

91
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,466
My dream

92
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,386
is to follow in your footsteps
and lead the Asung Foundation.

93
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,722
But not Yeon-woo.

94
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,808
She wants to run the Foundation

95
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,935
under the principles of her maternal
grandfather, who founded Asung.

96
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:40,817
Only I can build upon your work
and further develop Asung Foundation.

97
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,735
Only you and I can

98
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,155
take Asung into a bold, new future.

99
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,069
Do you like math?

100
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,904
No, I don't.

101
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,041
HANGOK ART HALL

102
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,714
Yoon-su, I'm leaving you
this voice message.

103
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,842
I exposed Jung-ah in the board meeting.
I think it's going well.

104
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,719
Call me when you get this message.

105
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,989
She's gone crazy.

106
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,899
What the hell was that?

107
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,319
Why hit the brakes at the last minute?
So now you know when to stop?

108
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,072
You stopped first.

109
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,949
When will you stop being afraid of me?

110
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,244
Sorry,

111
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,829
but you don't scare me.
I find you disgusting.

112
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,541
You were never a member
of high society nor do you fit in,

113
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,001
but you pretend you are one
and won't give up.

114
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,342
All right.

115
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,594
I get it.

116
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,221
But did you know this?

117
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,641
Dad wasn't a founding member of Asung.

118
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,980
So he understands me better
than anyone does.

119
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,940
That's our dad.

120
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,193
Don't take a victory lap yet.

121
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,823
Ji Yoon-su is your source, isn't she?

122
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,252
What? You've been relieved of your duties?

123
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,213
For the time being.

124
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,759
You'll be the interim principal
starting today.

125
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,053
Oversee the midterm exams

126
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,056
and water my plants for me.

127
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,351
Okay, Ma'am.

128
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,904
PRINCIPAL NOH JUNG-AH

129
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,169
You're claiming that
you two are completely innocent, right?

130
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,755
Then could you explain this?
I received a tip.

131
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:34,008
You don't care?
Because you're in love with her?

132
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,761
Yes. I'm in love with her.

133
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,346
Mr. Paik, could you clarify?

134
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,848
Are you in love with
your former math teacher, or not?

135

CURRENT RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE MATH TEACHER?

138
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,131
You don't care?
Because you're in love with her?

139
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,926
Yes. I'm in love with her.

140
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,302
Mr. Paik, could you clarify?

141
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,722
Are you in love with
your former math teacher, or not?

142
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,891
CALL

143
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,562
Hello?

144
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,607
So it's you, Ye-lin?

145
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,734
Did you see the news?

146
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,278
Where are you?

147
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,919
You should have heeded my warning.

148
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,589
I told you not to hold
Seung-yoo back in his career.

149
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,425
Don't harm his reputation.

150
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,010
You have no shame?

151
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,474
-You're not ashamed of what you did?
-You should be embarrassed, not me.

152
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,062
I didn't do anything to Seung-yoo.
You did.

153
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,314
This all happened because of you.

154
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,484
No matter what you do,
it'll never hurt Seung-yoo's life.

155
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,572
You can't hurt his career
or have him as your boyfriend.

156
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,491
You think you can have him then?

157
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,370
I'm not talking about myself.
This is about you.

158
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,372
It's clear that you either want him

159
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,624
as your boyfriend or destroy his life
if you can't have him.

160
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,211
I thought you weren't to blame
for what you did.

161
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,423
I blamed the adults
in your life for indulging you.

162
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,136
But now you have to stop blaming others
and take a look at yourself.

163
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,055
Look at the face you're making.

164
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,267
Do you feel happy after doing this?

165
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,123
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

166
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,057
We're at the destination, sir.

167
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,635
When you found an error…

168
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,265
in your math proof,

169
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,268
how did you feel, Professor?

170
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,524
What is proof?

171
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,280
I can prove the sum and who's wrong,

172
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:29,869
but why can't I prove my love
towards another person?

173
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,745
Love is…

174
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,707
imperfect.

175
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,592
People's feelings are imperfect.

176
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,345
Imperfections…

177
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,765
also plague math.

178
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,899
They're all connected.

179
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,883
Hey, slow down.

180
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,011
Hey, you need to slow down.

181
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,804
Hey! You're too fast!

182
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,140
Slow down already!

183
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,892
Hey, snap out of it!

184
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,321
Get out of the car!

185
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,329
What's wrong? Don't you know when to stop?

186
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,916
I don't know.

187
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,252
I don't know when to stop.

188
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,673
And how to stop what I'm doing.

189
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,092
I don't know.

190
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,052
…and go faster than others.

191
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:14,765
But if you cross the line and drive
on the shoulder, you could hurt others.

192
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,725
Most importantly, you will hurt yourself.

193
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,951
CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING
LUCIFER PRIZE WINNER?

194
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,619
PAIK SEUNG-YOO, CENTER OF DEBATE,
MATH COMMUNITY DISMAYED

195
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,253
PAIK SEUNG-YOO

196
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,354
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

197
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,829
When did you get here?

198
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,833
What are you doing there?

199
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,711
I wanted people to know

200
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,007
that you did nothing wrong.

201
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,968
That you were a good teacher…

202
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,596
I wanted to make things right.

203
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,975
But it didn't work out.

204
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:42,936
It's all my fault

205
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,149
because I fell in love with you.

206
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,497
Seung-yoo, look at me.

207
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,628
Do you have regrets?

208
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,925
That you came this far?

209
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,388
I don't regret anything either.

210
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,394
I don't regret anything that happened

211
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,272
after I first met you.

212
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,872
Why don't we go somewhere?

213
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,958
Anywhere.

214
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,002
Wherever.

215
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,601
All right.

216
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,023
Let's go. Anywhere is fine.

217
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,436
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

218
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,062
SUNG-JAE

219
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,165
Sung-jae!

220
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,377
Were you busy all day?
You weren't answering my calls.

221
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,881
The board meeting went well.

222
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,346
Jung-ah will be fired.

223
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,308
Let's go have dinner.

224
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,186
I can't have dinner with you.
I have an appointment.

225
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,939
I'm sorry for how I behaved last time.

226
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,858
I grew up in a dysfunctional family.

227
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,695
See what I'm doing to gain
my dad's approval?

228
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,825
I want you to meet my dad.
I'll tell my dad about our marriage plans.

229
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,538
I think we should take a break
from our relationship.

230
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,959
I need time to think.

231
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,586
Is it because of Yoon-su?

232
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,839
You still have feelings for her?

233
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,551
Do you have an inferiority complex
towards her?

234
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:07,849
That's the only explanation I can think of
that makes sense of your reaction.

235
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,187
And this has nothing to do with Yoon-su.

236
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,524
I need time to think
because of you, Yeon-woo.

237
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,907
You were out here?

238
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,620
Did you sleep well?

239
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,499
This spot is really warm. Sit down.

240
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,010
It's so serene and peaceful here.

241
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,808
It was a good idea to come here.
You haven't had a vacation yet, have you?

242
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,645
Let's rest for the entire day.

243
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,442
Read a book, listen to music
and just gaze into the distance.

244
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,073
Are you hungry? I could go buy some food.

245
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,951
Stay here…

246
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,955
a little longer.

247
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,936
It's snowing.

248
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,774
What?

249
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,592
-It's hot!
-Are you okay?

250
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,766
Oh, no.

251
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,148
You were cooking the eggs
on high heat. Who does that?

252
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,192
-I was just…
-You rarely cook, do you? I can tell.

253
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,319
I don't cook much.

254
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,780
Wait a minute. Let me check the cabinets.

255
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:09,990
See if there's any food.

256
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,659
There was kimchi in the fridge.

257
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,912
-Why don't we make kimchi fried rice?
-I'll do it.

258
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,623
Sit on the couch.

259
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,585
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

260
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,969
It's delicious.

261
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,805
I've got other talents than just math.

262
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,683
So how is your arm? Is it okay?

263
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,684
It's fine.

264
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:43,190
There's a music museum nearby.
Let's visit it after we eat.

265
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,357
Sure.

266
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,985
This is really good.

267
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,118
2021 MIDTERM EXAMS, MATH

268
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,562
I'm so screwed. What am I going to do?

269
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,335
You did badly, right?

270
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,337
Too bad.

271
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,388
Did you see Shi-an's answer sheet?

272
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,473
-She got it all wrong.
-I know. She was showing off.

273
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,934
Yes. Look at her now.

274
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,852
I forgot my phone.

275
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,822
What are you doing? Don’t touch my stuff!

276
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,866
Ji-na, you didn't write down
any equations.

277
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,369
-What?
-There's no sign of you solving it.

278
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,623
I did all the calculations in my head.

279
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,208
What is it? What's wrong?

280
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,835
She's arguing with me
about my answer sheet.

281
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,714
Je-ni, you didn't show your work either.

282
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,800
-How can you only have the answer on it?
-Mind your own business.

283
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,886
Why are you arguing with us
after you got a low score? Let's go.

284
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,644
The allegations against my daughter,

285
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:48,231
accusing her of cheating by stealing
the answer sheet, are not true,

286
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,150
and the case was dismissed
by a judge four years ago.

287
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:54,070
Hence, I will take legal action
to prove I've done nothing wrong

288
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,614
and also file a defamation lawsuit

289
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:00,702
-for these false allegations.
-Senator Sung!

290
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,789
Are you truly innocent?

291
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,709
You've really done nothing wrong?

292
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,128
Could you tell us your name?

293
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,964
Please tell us the truth.

294
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,508
What are you doing at my press conference

295
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,177
when you're tied up
with your own legal problems?

296
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,970
Seung-yoo came to see me.

297
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,015
He asked me to give a witness testimony.

298
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,559
Why didn't you come to see me, Senator?

299
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,895
You know what will happen
if I start talking.

300
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,189
Either find a way to
halt this or cut a deal.

301
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,732
Look here, Mr. Han.

302
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,610
I have no idea what the heck
you're talking about.

303
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,949
Don't ever show your face here again
if you don't want me to press

304
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,702
blackmail charges against you. Understand?

305
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,703
I taught Ye-lin's

306
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:48,041
for three years
and helped her get good grades.

307
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,251
You'll go to hell if you don't repay

308
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,546
-what I did for her.
-What you did for her?

309
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,889
Did you help students out
of the goodness of your heart?

310
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,433
You took bribes.

311
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,275
SENATOR SUNG COUNTERSUES
PAIK SEUNG-YOO FOR DEFAMATION

312
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,276
Honey.

313
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,738
Honey, you need to call Seung-yoo. Hurry.

314
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,782
He probably knows about this, right?

315
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,287
Did you hire a good lawyer?

316
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,708
I told you to figure out
who's the real problem.

317
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,377
Your son is seeing Ms. Ji.

318
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,171
So why are you mad at us? Unbelievable.

319
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,674
Get out. How dare you come here?

320
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,593
Take a look.

321
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,262
You still don't believe it?

322
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,390
I told you to keep your son in line.

323
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,309
And give Ji Yoon-su a piece of your mind.

324
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,604
Get out! I don't want to see your face.

325
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,189
I'm leaving! I'll go.

326
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,026
Hey, Hye-mi!

327
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,945
What?

328
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,989
You should keep a close eye
on your husband

329
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,949
instead of gossiping about my son.

330
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,784
-What?
-You have no idea?

331
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,786
Guess who your husband
is having an affair with.

332
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,787
I saw them together.

333
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,541
-Gosh.
-What's that look on your face?

334
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,042
So you knew about their affair?

335
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,295
What did you see?

336
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,923
Even though you knew about it,
you couldn't confront her?

337
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,176
I guess you couldn't.
You treated her like royalty.

338
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,178
You were always super nice to her.

339
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,347
Tell me what you saw!

340
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,477
This. Noh Jung-ah did this
to your husband.

341
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,481
They looked good together.

342
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,318
You're acting like a stalker, you know.

343
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,875
Jeez, I can't believe it.

344
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,718
Shocking news. Principal Noh
has been relieved of her duties.

345
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,844
-Oh, my gosh.
-What's going on?

346
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,095
Really?

347
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,765
What is this?

348
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,360
DAD

349
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,254
Yes?

350
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,463
Where are you?

351
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,215
I just met with Minister Kyung Woo-min.

352
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,258
What did he say?

353
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,719
He'll meet with the Hangok police chief
to help us with the investigation.

354
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,097
Is your press conference over?

355
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,979
Mr. Han came to see you? And?

356
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,398
I got rid of the phone
that has the answer sheet.

357
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,482
So there's no proof.

358
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,569
I wasn't going to cave in to his threats.
I sent him away.

359
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,153
But what?

360
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:06,781
Witness testimony?

361
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,158
Yes, he's planning to give
a witness statement

362
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,160
to the police regarding our case.

363
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:14,497
I think he came to see me
to talk about that. What should I do?

364
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,333
Can't you handle stuff like this
by yourself?

365
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,795
Why do I have to always come up
with a plan to save the day?

366
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,430
Yes, Principal?

367
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,764
How is everything?

368
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,893
It's quiet.
The auditors came in the morning and left.

369
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:39,188
Meet with Mr. Han and find out
what he's planning.

370
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,650
Okay, I'll see to it.

371
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:55,580
Mr. Han, this is Choi Sung-han.

372
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,458
Let's meet.

373
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:08,176
PRINCIPAL NOH JUNG-AH

374
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,395
Is it true that Principal Noh
has been relieved of her duties?

375
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,691
Shouldn't we've been notified about
what is going on? We're the PTA.

376
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,276
None of that matters.

377
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,737
Call Principal Noh here.

378
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,283
Everyone, have a seat.

379
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,369
Ms. Yoo…

380
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,555
Any visitor can play
that piano if they wish.

381
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,519
You can listen to a piano solo
or play a piece yourself.

382
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,187
That's the theme of this museum.

383
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,149
Is it similar to your plans
for your math museum?

384
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:06,776
Yes, it's similar.

385
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,654
I can't wait to see it.

386
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,549
There's an audio room
for listening to music. Want to see it?

387
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,013
The parents mentioned that
you were relieved of your duties.

388
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,057
They wanted to hear about
the situation directly from you.

389
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,892
They were furious.

390
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:55,074
Not a day goes by at school
without a new incident happening.

391
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,910
We're all so worried, right?

392
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:01,289
Tell me about it. It won't stop.
It's giving me a headache.

393
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,667
Principal Noh,
we'd like you to explain to us

394
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,003
why the board relieved you of your duties.

395
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,339
I'm very sorry.

396
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:14,343
A minor incident
has caused you to worry, I see.

397
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,595
A minor incident?

398
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:19,057
The donations you gave, which were
set aside to cover the Ivy League

399
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,309
consulting fees,
resulted in a misunderstanding.

400
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,896
I'm sorting it out with the board,
so there's no need to worry.

401
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,524
More importantly, we just had midterms.

402
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,402
How did your children do on the exams?

403
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,571
Soo-young did pretty well.

404
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,615
-So did my daughter.
-Je-ni did well.

405
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,868
As I expected. I'm sure
you'll be satisfied with their scores.

406
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,954
I'll clear things up
with the board, so don't worry.

407
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,457
Is this rumor
also a misunderstanding, then?

408
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,503
There's a rumor going around
that you're romantically involved

409
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,797
with a married man,
whose wife is a PTA member.

410
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,007
-No way.
-My husband has high standards.

411
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,550
That's absurd.

412
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,303
So what's going on here?
Could you please clarify?

413
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,830
What are you thinking?

414
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,835
-What?
-Why aren't you saying anything?

415
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,920
Is there something I need to say?

416
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,882
I'm uneasy.

417
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,679
Can this peaceful time last?

418
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,558
I went by Hangok Art Hall yesterday.

419
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:48,688
It brought back memories
of the time I first met you.

420
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:54,610
You were like a guarded cat back then.

421
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,488
But now,

422
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,658
you're like a rock.

423
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,872
A person with unwavering resolve.

424
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,752
That reassures me.

425
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,353
Just a second.

426
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,532
I also have something to tell you.

427
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:46,787
I don't want to see Seung-yoo
live an ordinary life.

428
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,623
He loves math

429
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,168
more than

430
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,253
he knows.

431
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:55,671
And so?

432
00:36:55,755 --> 00:37:00,301
I agree with you. Instead of him
proving this school case,

433
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:04,847
I'd rather see him work on something
more meaningful and worthwhile.

434
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,974
I hope

435
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,187
he'll continue to prove
as a mathematician.

436
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,708
Please come down to the station
for a few questions regarding the lawsuit

437
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,001
filed by Senator Sung.

438
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,294
Okay.

439
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,140
SENATOR SUNG COUNTERSUES
PAIK SEUNG-YOO OVER BASELESS CLAIMS

440
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,022
Hold on. What are you talking about?

441
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:59,694
Are you implying that she's having
an affair with one of our husbands?

442
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,529
Is that it?

443
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,906
Please.

444
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,992
That's not possible. It's nonsense.

445
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:10,121
That's why we should let the principal
explain the situation.

446
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,789
Right?

447
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:15,001
It's true I have special relationships.

448
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,839
-Ms. Noh!
-Special relationship? Oh, my.

449
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:20,756
With whom?

450
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,091
I just met…

451
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,679
with. Minister Kyung Woo-min.

452
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,141
At a hotel.

453
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,269
Soo-young recently transferred

454
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,647
to our school through
a special admission process.

455
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:40,526
So the minister wanted
to show his gratitude.

456
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,737
That's why I personally met with him.

457
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,994
Your husband came to see me several times.

458
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:54,248
Whenever Je-ni's grades would fall,
he'd ask me to help Je-ni more.

459
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,583
So…

460
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,044
Everyone.

461
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,547
All of the fathers of the global
gifted class have met with me personally

462
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:05,134
for special consultation.

463
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,845
Without those consultations,

464
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,432
do you think your children
would have been admitted to this school?

465
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,894
Why are you suddenly quiet?

466
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,192
There must have been a misunderstanding.

467
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,652
I need to excuse myself. I'm running late.

468
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,571
-Me, too.
-I need to go too.

469
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,990
Wait!

470
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,450
Have a good day!

471
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,418
You found out everything?

472
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,630
So you wanted to embarrass me, huh?

473
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,715
What about your husband?

474
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,885
This always happens.

475
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,721
Instead of confronting the husband,

476
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,432
wives always go after the mistress
to grab her by the hair.

477
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,809
It's so pathetic.

478
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,271
How could you do this to me?

479
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,564
Do you think it's unfair?

480
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:05,277
Think about what your children gained

481
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,239
from the special relationship
I had with your husband.

482
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,952
If you still find it unfair,
then give everything back.

483
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,374
Are you willing to do that?

484
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,694
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

485
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,578
The annual school budget report,

486
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,290
cash withdrawal statements, and contracts

487
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,209
have lots of discrepancies.

488
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,421
I spotted some irregular transactions too.

489
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,258
Fix it before you get in trouble
for embezzlement.

490
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,763
-Why aren't you saying anything?
-I have done everything

491
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,724
you have asked from me,

492
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,894
even doing jobs that
were unrelated to school affairs.

493
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,395
So how can you accuse me

494
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,943
of embezzlement over pocket change
that I took for doing personal errands?

495
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,402
You find it unfair?

496
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,404
PRINCIPAL NOH JUNG-AH

497
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,866
You need to know your place.

498
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,119
How dare you think of becoming
the principal of this academy!

499
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:23,123
Your job is doing my errands
for some chump change.

500
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,459
You're dismissed!

501
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,986
Where would you like to meet?

502
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,874
Does it hurt?

503
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,671
I guarantee that people will prefer
your proof to theirs.

504
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,341
Do you know who you're like?

505
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,342
Principal Noh.

506
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,305
She'll brainwash and gaslight people
to get what she wants.

507
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,056
Do you want to become like her?

508
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,210
Are you inside?

509
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,255
Open the door.

510
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,133
I said open the door.

511
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,647
Hello?

512
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,822
Have a seat.

513
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,579
Would you like a drink?

514
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:34,463
So what's your plan, Mr. Paik?

515
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,852
Noh Jung-ah and Senator Sung
have never been found guilty.

516
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:53,023
They always got away with it
due to lack of evidence.

517
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,358
I'm aware of that.

518
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,361
That's why I went public
with my allegations.

519
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,614
I wanted to publicize the scandal
to create a firestorm.

520
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:04,326
You could also act friendly
on the surface, but backstab them.

521
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,500
You have Noh and the senator's plans
for the math museum, don't you?

522
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,169
Hand them over to me.

523
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,297
-Why are you helping me?
-I'm helping?

524
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,424
Then what is this?

525
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,554
I'm also a victim
in their scheme against Yoon-su.

526
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,514
Did you forget that?

527
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,945
My wife knows about our affair?

528
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,114
Did you tell Hye-mi about us?

529
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,158
That's crazy. Why would I tell her that?

530
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,160
I don't know.

531
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,288
Perhaps you wanted to end our affair

532
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,416
because things are so chaotic.

533
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:55,461
That's nonsense. You don't trust me?

534
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:59,840
Then keep Hye-mi in line.
Make sure she doesn't cause any problems.

535
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,259
What did you say? You didn't deny it?

536
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,889
How could you admit that?
You should have lied!

537
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,974
-Why would I lie?
-What?

538
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,310
Why does it matter
whether she knows or not?

539
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:15,105
It's your family matter, not mine.

540
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,159
You'll find evidence of bribery paid
by donations and grant money.

541
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,164
You have insights
on how the developer and land were chosen,

542
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,459
so piece it together.

543
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,629
Okay.

544
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,673
How is Yoon-su doing?

545
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,553
I wanted to…

546
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,350
have them apologize to her.

547
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:58,190
-I didn't know it would be this hard.
-Your goal was to have them apologize?

548
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,611
I like that.

549
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:05,489
By the way, I have some good news for you.

550
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:10,202
Principal Noh could get fired.

551
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,455
That's…

552
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,375
Yoon-su's plan.

553
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,018
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

554
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,937
MS. JI YOON-SU

555
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,528
MR. HAN MYUNG-JIN

556
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,826
You were having an affair
behind mom's back, Dad?

557
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,161
No, Ye-lin. It's not what you think it is.

558
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,205
Your dad made a promise to me.

559
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:59,042
He promised to be eternally loyal to me
if I gave you some extra help.

560
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,086
He's merely keeping that promise.

561
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,254
Be quiet.

562
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,965
Ye-lin, don't listen to her.
I'll explain everything.

563
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,008
Are you a little kid?

564
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,051
You don't get it?

565
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,764
Your dad cut a deal for your sake.

566
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,728
For my sake?

567
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,521
For me?

568
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,398
Ye-lin.

569
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,774
Stop lying!

570
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,068
I believed you.

571
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,697
You said you were doing it for my future.

572
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,825
You told me to study hard
because you were supporting me.

573
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,370
But tell me now.

574
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,332
Was it really for my sake?

575
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,377
No, it wasn't. It was a lie!

576
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,879
You lied to me!

577
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,551
How long were you going to lie to me?

578
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,803
Tell me.

579
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,014
Ye-lin, you see…

580
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,809
I'm not going to let her use me again.

581
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,980
And stop saying you did it for me.

582
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,393
Thank you for coming.
I thought you should know this.

583
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,980
Principal Noh could be fired.

584
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:48,652
-She'll be fired?
-Of course, she'll put up a fight.

585
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,573
If I talk to the authorities,

586
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,370
how can you protect me?

587
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:01,998
If you make the right decision,
I'll do everything I can.

588
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,000
So that you won't get hurt, Mr. Han.

589
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,087
Mr. Han…

590
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:14,761
The student I helped
and sacrificed my career for

591
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,472
doesn't even treat me
like a teacher anymore.

592
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,393
But you're treating me like a teacher.

593
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,687
Please do what's right.

594
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:39,703
I heard you'll give
a witness testimony tomorrow

595
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,581
regarding the scandal involving
the senator and Principal Noh.

596
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,000
-So?
-What do you plan on telling them?

597
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,753
Why are you interested?

598
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:52,215
You're also deeply involved in it,

599
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,550
so that must worry you.

600
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,762
I'm not going down all alone.

601
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,098
And that's a fact.

602
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,433
Of course.

603
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:06,646
I do not wish to see you take the fall
for this whole scandal.

604
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,523
In fact,

605
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,610
I could help your cause.

606
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,157
PRINCIPAL NOH JUNG-AH

607
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,919
It's been a long time, Mr. Han.

608
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:30,754
What is going on?

609
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,590
I know you're going through a tough time.

610
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,927
I know the hospital director,
so I asked for a special favor.

611
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,678
She can stay in this private suite.

612
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:43,683
Let me apologize on behalf
of Senator Sung for his rude behavior.

613
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,812
Are you doing this because
I might talk to the authorities?

614
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,856
Yes.

615
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,318
Why did you have to do that?

616
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,612
You took bribes without my knowledge.

617
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:59,616
If you had stayed loyal to me,
I would have rewarded you financially.

618
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,874
Here's a little gift.

619
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,920
I'll see you tomorrow then.

620
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,394
Principal Noh could be fired.

621
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,981
If you make the right decision,
I'll do everything I can.

622
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,993
2017 ASUNG HIGH SCHOOL

623
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,086
2017 ACADEMIC AFFAIRS NOTES

624
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:09,936
Hello?

625
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,158
Hi, Ms. Ji.

626
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,785
-Hi.
-How have you been?

627
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,247
Did you finish your midterms?
It must have been tough.

628
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,708
But I didn't do well on the test.

629
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,002
-Was it difficult?
-Yes.

630
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,755
-And…
-Here's your order.

631
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,632
You didn't have dinner yet? Let's eat.

632
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,883
Okay.

633
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,801
-Thank you.
-Enjoy your food.

634
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:42,928
By the way…

635
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,849
-Here's a present.
-What's inside?

636
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,894
Your birthday is coming up.

637
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,397
These are so pretty.

638
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,942
Thank you, Ms. Ji. I love these sneakers.

639
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:03,281
This is Mr. Paik's new book.

640
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,367
I wanted to read it.

641
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,660
Shi-an.

642
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,580
Don't tell anyone that you met me today.

643
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:12,958
Why?

644
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,460
Let's eat first.

645
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:48,493
MS. JI YOON-SU

646
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:12,851
Yoo-chan.

647
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:18,314
Why did you do that?

648
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,650
Did you enjoy it?

649
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,694
Enjoy what?

650
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,237
You're playing dumb now?

651
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,573
Jung-ah told me everything.

652
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:32,787
What's going on?

653
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,376
All right. Yes, she tried to seduce me.

654
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,840
-She did what?
-But I never slept with her.

655
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,425
I turned her down.

656
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:49,220
So that hurt her feelings,
which is why she said that.

657
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,597
Really?

658
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,349
That makes so much sense.

659
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,518
I don't care if you believe me or not.

660
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:59,189
I'm at my wit's end
because of Paik Seung-yoo right now.

661
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,357
Paik Seung-yoo! Gosh!

662
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:06,571
I've been summoned
to the police for questioning tomorrow.

663
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,826
HANGOK POLICE STATION

664
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,622
SECURE INTERVIEW ROOM A

665
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,460
I'll begin questioning you
regarding the defamation charges

666
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,170
levied against you
by Senator Sung Min-joon.

667
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,213
Okay.

668
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:27,634
We'll begin our investigation of the 2017
cheating scandal at Asung High.

669
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,511
Okay.

670
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,221
Were you aware of the fact
that the answer sheet

671
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:34,182
to the math test was leaked
to your daughter, Sung Ye-lin?

672
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,225
No.

673
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:40,146
Is it true that you knew about the leak
and then tried to cover it up?

674
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,357
No, that's not true.

675
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,194
When Ms. Ji, a math teacher,
discovered she had cheated,

676
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:50,240
they framed. her for having a relationship
with a student and fired her.

677
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,200
She wasn't framed. It actually happened.

678
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:54,494
Even Paik Seung-yoo's father filed charges

679
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,455
against the teacher for inappropriate
conduct towards a minor.

680
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,959
The charges were dropped
and she was found innocent.

681
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,920
In Paik Seung-yoo's complaint,

682
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:06,548
he claims that
you had an intimate partnership

683
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:09,008
that went beyond
just a teacher-parent friendship.

684
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,010
Is that correct?

685
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,096
An intimate partnership?

686
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,766
Are you claiming we had an affair?

687
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,811
They claim we had an affair
while they claim they were framed?

688
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:20,812
Gosh.

689
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,939
What hypocrites.

690
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:26,651
Senator Sung was a member
of the Education Committee

691
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:30,196
when Asung High was elevated
to a specialized school and included

692
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,866
in the high school credit program.
I'm certain he exerted influence.

693
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,534
How did I influence it?

694
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:38,329
Are you accusing me of taking a bribe?

695
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:41,166
Then take a look at our bank transactions.

696
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,257
The witness is here.

697
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,259
The witness?

698
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,396
The witness is here.

699
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,397
Bring him in.

700
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:45,855
Mr. Han.

701
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,941
Mr. Han Myung-jin?

702
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:52,195
Yes. I came to give my witness
statement regarding the cheating scandal

703
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,323
involving Sung Ye-lin.

704
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,487
What are you doing here?

705
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,198
-We're from Hangok Police Station.
-It's better this way.

706
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:03,493
Now that the bribery scandal has broken,
someone has to take the fall.

707
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:05,078
What did you tell her?

708
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,665
Dad, why don't you ever
ask me what I want?

709
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,251
I'm going to expose everything
your sister did.

710
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,711
Your job is done here, Seung-yoo.

711
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,380
Now follow your own path.

712
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:18,007
So you think
you can do things differently?

713
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,510
I'm more curious
in how this will end for you.

714
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,845
Will you be able to protect
what matters to you?

715
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:31,270
