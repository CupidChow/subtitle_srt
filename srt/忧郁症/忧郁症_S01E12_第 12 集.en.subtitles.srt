1
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:21,354
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:27,152
A math proof is either true or false.

3
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,196
Those are the only two things that matter.

4
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,908
You can't call a math proof
true if it's not.

5
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,078
Nor can you call a proof false
when it's true.

6
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,788
Mathematicians cannot lie.

7
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,627
However, in the messy world we live in,

8
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,755
sometimes what's false
is considered to be true

9
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,341
while what is true
is considered to be false.

10
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,178
That's exactly

11
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,973
what happened here at Asung High,

12
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,059
the predecessor of Asung Academy,
four years ago.

13
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,731
There was a rumor about a teacher

14
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,817
having an inappropriate relationship
with a student.

15
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,571
This so-called scandal rocked Hangok-dong

16
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,698
and it was sensationalized.

17
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,411
The truth was buried by false claims.

18
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,164
And a false narrative became the truth.

19
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,250
I was at the center

20
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,587
of the teacher-student scandal.

21
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,673
I was the high school student.

22
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,865
You need to see this.

23
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,290
I was at the center
of the teacher-student scandal.

24
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,750
I was the high school student.

25
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,927
This isn't the time or place
to bring up your personal story.

26
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,471
I'm speaking as a mathematician.

27
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,692
Like I said earlier,
you cannot lie in math.

28
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,363
I believe in the power of logic and proof.

29
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,198
Today,

30
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,827
I will present to you
a new project to seek for the truth.

31
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,581
What were the facts and lies

32
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,668
behind the scandal that unfolded
at Asung High four years ago?

33
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,589
Who was behind pushing the false narrative

34
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,676
while burying the truth,
and what was their purpose?

35
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,513
I will lay out my proof.

36
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:18,865
Are you claiming that someone defamed
another person's character?

37
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:19,866
That's correct.

38
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,255
Why did Seung-yoo say those things?
He's gone crazy.

39
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,884
-Is this why he became a teacher here?
-But who defamed who?

40
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,594
Perhaps he's talking about the time

41
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,554
Ms. Ji accused Ye-lin
of cheating on the midterm--

42
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,724
Hey, So-jung. Don't talk about something
you're not sure about.

43
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,728
What the? Why are you picking on me?

44
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,022
-What's gotten into him?
-He's acting crazy too.

45
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,618
You've ruined my event.

46
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,911
How so?

47
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,749
Asung Academy of Mathematics and Arts,
Asung High,

48
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,961
National Math Museum
are the trending terms right now.

49
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,129
This is great publicity
if you were to ask me.

50
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,262
You're picking a fight with me,
aren't you?

51
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,890
If this bothers you…

52
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,352
Principal Noh, prepare yourself
for a fight like me.

53
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:35,275
At this point, whoever makes threats
or tries blackmail is the guilty party.

54
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,918
My gosh. Really.

55
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,255
He's totally gone mad. Seung-yoo.

56
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,468
Ye-lin, don't worry.

57
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,471
Your dad and the principal
will take care of this.

58
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,556
Okay?

59
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,350
Gosh.

60
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,481
Let's hold a press conference too!

61
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,941
Don't send the reporters away.
Let's do it!

62
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,109
And then what?

63
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,696
So we'll tell them we didn't frame anyone
and it's not about us?

64
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,864
Shall we?

65
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,450
Come to your senses.

66
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,660
He didn't mention us by name.

67
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,204
It's just a matter of time
before people find out.

68
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,581
How will you respond then?

69
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:55,229
Is an apple seed a fruit?
Or is it not a fruit?

70
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,900
-What are you talking about?
-A seed is not a fruit.

71
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,987
But if you plant a seed,
it'll become a fruit.

72
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,826
So a seed isn't a fruit,
but it can also be a fruit.

73
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,244
What are you talking about?

74
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,583
Why cannot it appear false
when, in fact, it is true?

75
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,922
You really don't?

76
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,593
You need to know.
You should be explaining yourself.

77
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,637
That's the right thing to do.

78
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,474
I wish you'll explain everything to me.

79
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,945
Have some hot coffee. Here.

80
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,698
-What if…
-Yes?

81
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,702
If I'd admitted what I did was wrong,
what would've happened after?

82
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,455
What? What did you do wrong?

83
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,540
You know.

84
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,251
I cheated on the math exam
with the answer sheet you gave me.

85
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,711
-But then Ms. Ji found out--
-Why is that your fault?

86
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,171
Then whose fault is it?

87
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,049
Ye-lin.

88
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,594
You need to get your head on straight.

89
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,849
None of us did anything wrong.
I only did what was good for you--

90
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,725
Please stop saying that!

91
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,186
Did anything you do for me turn out well?

92
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,106
Ye-lin. How can you say that?

93
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,527
I've always done what's best for you.
Do you think I did it for me, then?

94
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,530
I'll ask you one last time.
You have nothing to say?

95
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,704
Oh, my! Ye-lin!

96
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,083
Try to breathe. Calm down. Okay?

97
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,631
Could you tell me
where I can find Sung Ye-lin?

98
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,924
Over here, Honey.

99
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,097
What happened to her?

100
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,475
She went into shock.
She suddenly couldn't breathe.

101
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,062
Honey, you can fix the matter, right?

102
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,814
What did Principal Noh say?

103
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,109
-Is it true what he said?
-What?

104
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,861
Did Ye-lin cheat
on her exams in high school?

105
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,697
Be quiet! Are you crazy?

106
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,449
Come here. Who said that?

107
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,541
PAIK SEUNG-YOO, "I WAS INVOLVED IN
THE TEACHER-STUDENT SCANDAL"

108
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,255
WHAT'S THE TRUTH BEHIND
THE ASUNG HIGH SCANDAL?

109
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,862
What the hell was that?

110
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,699
Do you know what you just did?

111
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,159
I told you I made up my mind.

112
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,078
I know why I have to do this.

113
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,704
This isn't the right way.

114
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,416
You're risking your bright career.
It's not smart.

115
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,628
-Why would it ruin my career?
-Do you have to ask?

116
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,589
You're a mathematician.
What's more important than that?

117
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,132
You don't need to prove my case.

118
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,593
Why did you have to do this
while putting your reputation on the line?

119
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,011
It's not the most important thing.

120
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,390
There are more important things
to me than math!

121
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,393
Why did I do math?
How did I become a mathematician

122
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,103
and win the Lucifer Prize?

123
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,689
Because I'm super smart?

124
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,400
Or because you were a good teacher?

125
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,193
No.

126
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:34,699
I was at the center
of the teacher-student scandal.

127
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,200
I was the high school student.

128
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,743
Is it funny to you?

129
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,122
Look at their expressions.

130
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,083
They're mad and shocked,
but they can't show it on camera.

131
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,253
He's so reckless.

132
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,345
Yoon-su told you to leave
Seung-yoo out of the plan, right?

133
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,145
But Seung-yoo made it clear
he's going to be a part of it anyway.

134
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,356
Let them handle that past scandal.

135
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,943
Meanwhile, we'll work on
what we can attack her with right now.

136
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,821
He is quite serious

137
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,533
with his intentions
when it comes to Yoon-su.

138
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,453
So what if he is now?

139
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,081
He should give up on her.

140
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,251
I guess weighing things out
is not considered love.

141
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,879
To Seung-yoo, I mean.

142
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,051
For the past four years,

143
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:40,222
I worked on math proofs like crazy
because that's all I had left.

144
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,933
It was the only way to protect my sanity.

145
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,312
And now I've finally found you. But why…

146
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,149
Why are you telling me that
math is all that matters to me?

147
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,028
Why can't there be something
more important than that?

148
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,719
I have…

149
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,140
never wanted to be more important
to you than math.

150
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,309
That won't change.

151
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,438
The case you told everyone you would prove

152
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:34,068
isn't more beautiful or worthy
than one equation in a geometry proof.

153
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,008
Wouldn't it be a waste
to ruin his reputation now?

154
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,594
Why do you look so shocked?

155
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,807
You've seen it before.
The photo of you two at the airport.

156
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,287
NOH YEON-WOO

157
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,917
NOH YEON-WOO

158
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,420
I'm sorry for calling a meeting
at such an early hour.

159
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,214
As the principal, I would like to address
what Mr. Paik said yesterday

160
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,967
and also inform you
about an important matter.

161
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,680
In regards
to Mr. Paik's statements yesterday,

162
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,766
we will conduct an investigation
and take action against him.

163
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,061
Is it true that
there was cheating going on

164
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,522
at Asung High?

165
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,236
Why are you looking at me?

166
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,072
What did you hear?
They're all baseless rumors.

167
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,242
Baseless rumors? I'm not making this up.

168
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,285
Now…

169
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,705
This is Asung Academy, not Asung High.

170
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,583
And midterms are coming up soon.

171
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:18,047
Maintaining a high GPA is important
when applying to Ivy League schools.

172
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,884
I have set up a meeting
with a top educational consultant.

173
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,888
He will provide us with
the latest admission criteria and trends

174
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,848
that were obtained through his contacts

175
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,434
among admissions officers
at Ivy League schools.

176
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,769
Let's go meet him now.

177
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:37,525
These are the list of students
in the global gifted class.

178
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,609
LIST OF STUDENTS
PARTICIPATING IN THE PROJECT

179
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,530
What's wrong?

180
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:47,326
Is it because Ms. Ji might learn
of our pay-to-play admissions scheme?

181
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,454
I've kept this a tight secret.

182
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:55,709
But I’m nervous
because she worked closely with me.

183
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,421
That's Minister Kyung Woo-min,
Senator Sung Min-joon.

184
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,423
Hankook University Professor,
Son Seung-yeon,

185
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,592
And Myungjin Daily chairman, Kim Yeon-jun.

186
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,265
Those are the parents
of the global gifted class.

187
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:13,269
So even if we were to get caught…

188
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,065
These high-powered individuals
are backing us.

189
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,651
So what's there to worry about?

190
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,862
Come in.

191
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,282
Asung Academy school parents are here.

192
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,329
I was at the center of…

193
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,416
Dear, what is he talking about?

194
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,917
I was the high school student.

195
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,837
Why is Seung-yoo doing this?

196
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,594
Seung-yoo.

197
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,639
-What's going on, son?
-I know you're shocked.

198
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,476
Let's sit down first.
I need to tell you something.

199
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,813
Principal Noh, what should we do?

200
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,232
Is there any way I can help?

201
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,863
Ji Yoon-su is such a devil.

202
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:09,199
It turns out she's a famous instructor
at a math clinic in Hangok-dong.

203
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,702
I almost sent Yoo-chan to that clinic.

204
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,913
It gives me chills just thinking about it.

205
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,712
I'll see you afterward.

206
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,883
You bought this for me in Italy, remember?

207
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,135
Director Noh had
the same accessory on her handbag.

208
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,262
It must be a similar item.

209
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,558
I didn't sleep well last night,
so I don't look so great.

210
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,527
How is Ye-lin?

211
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,946
Oh, yes.

212
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,199
She's also in bad shape.

213
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,036
Ye-lin has had it tough
for quite some time.

214
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,664
For how long?

215
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,874
You didn't know?

216
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,420
She knew about the relationship
between Ms. Ji and Paik Seung-yoo.

217
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:08,300
She knew what?
What does that have to do with Ye-lin?

218
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,844
Then…

219
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,765
what you're saying is true?

220
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,308
Someone spread false rumors

221
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:21,063
about you and Ms. Ji to cover up
Ye-lin's cheating scandal?

222
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,233
-Yes.
-Forget it.

223
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,819
We pressed charges,
but the judge dismissed them.

224
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,404
Bringing it up now won't change anything.

225
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,863
So I have to handle it
before it's too late.

226
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,532
I said forget about it!

227
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,409
Quit teaching there.

228
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,953
-Dad.
-Why can't you stay out of this?

229
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,831
Why are you messing up your career?

230
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,251
You're still young and this is
the most important period in your life.

231
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,003
You've got so much to accomplish.

232
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,089
I'm not messing anything up.
I'm resolving an unresolved problem.

233
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,800
Are you still seeing her?

234
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,638
Answer me! Are you?

235
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,018
It's not what you think it is.

236
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,394
Then what is it?

237
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,021
I'll tell you everything later.

238
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,106
I have to go work now,
so I'll come by again.

239
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,524
Was this your plan all along?

240
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,819
You sent us your thesis paper

241
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,864
and came over for dinner

242
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,576
-for us to soften us up, right?
-How can you say that, Dad?

243
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,246
Then make a promise.

244
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,124
That you won't see her again!

245
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,879
Who'd believe someone
who's trying to prove there was no scandal

246
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,757
if you're still seeing her?

247
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,759
Am I wrong?

248
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,142
If you see her again,

249
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,936
I won't see you ever again.

250
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,608
If you keep seeing her, I'll disown you.

251
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,445
What? My goodness…

252
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,740
Jeez…

253
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,914
-Don't be bothered by what your dad said.
-It's okay.

254
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,625
-I'll come again.
-Okay.

255
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,881
Why does he have to be so…

256
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,424
He's a liar.

257
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,677
My mom says they were all over each other.

258
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,012
-Like how?
-How?

259
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,681
-They stayed late together at school…
-At night?

260
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,266
-They were in an empty classroom…
-That's crazy.

261
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,601
Stop gossiping about them.

262
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,896
You don't know anything.
You weren't even there.

263
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,107
So? What do you know then?

264
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,817
I know more than you do.

265
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,237
You went to that cram school, didn't you?

266
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,031
Ji Yoon-su is the math instructor there.

267
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,741
My mom told me everything.

268
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,286
No wonder she made every student sign
a confidentiality agreement.

269
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,871
Because she has a dirty past.

270
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,542
She was fired anyway.

271
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,087
Seung-yoo and that woman
should be driven out of this neighborhood.

272
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,755
Watch your mouth!

273
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:56,135
-Don't tell me what to do.
-Be quiet!

274
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,804
Everyone, sit.

275
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,642
Mr. Paik Seung-yoo won't be here.
So study by yourselves.

276
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,726
Open your books.

277
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,109
You're relieved from all of your duties.

278
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,195
You won't be teaching any classes.

279
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,907
Your conduct was inappropriate
for a teacher and you broke our rules.

280
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,619
Read it and then sign it.

281
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,877
SIGNATURE: PAIK SEUNG-YOO

282
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,379
A disciplinary committee
will open an investigation.

283
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,135
You can't stop what I'm doing
by firing me.

284
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,554
You're aware of that, right?

285
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:47,978
You'll prove love through math?
Is that even possible?

286
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,733
What about proving that there is no love?

287
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:57,237
Can that be proven by equations?

288
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,700
I like your spirit.

289
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:07,497
This might be the most difficult problem
you've ever tried to solve.

290
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,833
What do you mean?

291
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:15,130
To prove what you want,
it might be unrelated to defamation,

292
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,426
but rather, more relevant
to the definition of love.

293
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,373
Seung-yoo might quit his teaching job.

294
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,669
To be more precise,
he's getting fired, I think.

295
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,797
How are you going to cope
without someone on your side?

296
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,715
Hey.

297
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,386
I once said
you were a scary person, didn't I?

298
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,097
I take that back.

299
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,848
-You're pathetic.
-What?

300
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,768
Your mom is the school principal,

301
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,063
so why do you feel the need to pick on me?

302
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,274
She's got power and
I have nobody like that behind me.

303
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,945
You don't like your mom that much, right?

304
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,074
Yet, you enjoy all the privileges
that come from being her daughter.

305
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,326
You're a hypocrite.

306
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,340
Hey, hurry up and come out!

307
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,553
Hey, hurry up! Come out!

308
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,223
I know you're in there!

309
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,142
You're shameless!

310
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,854
You thought I didn't know
you had a relationship with him?

311
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,023
You seduced him when he was a teenager.

312
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,067
And you seduced him again
now that he's famous?

313
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,110
Open up!

314
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,486
I said open up!

315
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,904
Open up!

316
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,531
Isn't that actress Yoo Hye-mi?

317
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,533
What is she doing here?

318
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,785
You're an embarrassment.

319
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,998
You better be prepared, because you're
going to pay for what you did.

320
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,633
Come to school.

321
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,802
The principal would like to see you.

322
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,619
Why did you want to see me?

323
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,537
Sit.

324
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,337
There's something
I would like to share with you.

325
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,513
Do whatever you want with it.

326
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,484
I'm paying you back

327
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,779
for the photo you gave me.
The one you took at Jeju Airport.

328
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,326
I picked out the best ones among hundreds.

329
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,246
Make good use of it.

330
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,150
-Hello?
-Where are you?

331
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,161
Why did you want to see me now?

332
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,037
I'm busy. We could talk
about it at home later.

333
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,039
I went to Ji Yoon-su's apartment.

334
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,501
-Did you see her?
-No, she refused to open the door.

335
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,670
What are you planning to do?

336
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,048
Principal Noh is going to handle it,
so don't worry about it.

337
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,800
How can I not worry?

338
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,304
Did anything you get involved in
have a good outcome?

339
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,516
Be careful and don't do
anything reckless this time.

340
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,770
You can't do anything
without Principal Noh, right?

341
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,439
What?

342
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,194
See you.

343
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,738
After the audit is finished,
let's enjoy some wine too.

344
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,072
What is this?

345
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,867
Are you having an affair with her?

346
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,827
What is the meaning of this?

347
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,829
How dare you spy on me?

348
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,500
Tell me what's going on right now.

349
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,169
What's going on with her?

350
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,338
We do a lot of deals together.

351
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,633
-What? Deals?
-You don't know what that is?

352
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,968
Thanks to Principal Noh,

353
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,721
Ye-lin and Yoo-chan have benefited
a lot from her school.

354
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:18,433
So, in return, I funnel information
to her and try to please her.

355
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,227
You didn't know about that?

356
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:24,147
So you give her information
and also your love?

357
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,650
-Hey, Hye-mi!
-Oh, my.

358
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,360
We shouldn't be arguing over this.

359
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,946
Come to your senses!

360
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:35,742
Instead of spying on me,
keep an eye on Ye-lin.

361
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,379
Is Yoon-su still hanging out
with that younger guy?

362
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,965
How could that incident resurface?

363
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:53,969
Mother.

364
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,346
Hurry up and marry Yeon-woo,

365
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,974
the daughter of chairman Noh.

366
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,187
You need to project a wholesome image
before things get out of hand.

367
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,732
What if another wild rumor
goes around that involves you?

368
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,360
I'll do what I think is right.

369
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,653
Really?

370
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,949
You were humiliated by a woman
whom we never approved of.

371
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,951
And you keep telling us that?

372
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,954
End of discussion. Get married.

373
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,671
Please sign there.

374
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,882
Goodbye.

375
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,384
-Let's go.
-Sure.

376
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,683
Hurry up and marry Sung-jae.

377
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,268
I'll leave that to you.

378
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,022
Sure, Mother. Don't worry.

379
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,030
Come in.

380
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,617
-Please bring our order.
-Okay.

381
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,838
You'll find this useful
in the board meeting.

382
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,591
Check the names
of the shareholders' list first.

383
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,842
I will.

384
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,095
This is exactly what I needed.

385
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:25,018
And if I can prove that she stole profits
from the foundation

386
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,104
to line her own pockets,
then I can bring her down.

387
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:29,481
You must hurry.

388
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,524
Once she loses her position,

389
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,818
it'll help Seung-yoo
with his fight against her.

390
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,573
By the way,
I also brought a present for you.

391
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,502
LEARNING WISDOM OF LIFE IN NATURE
JEJU VERTA SCHOOL

392
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,921
If you want,
I'll give you a recommendation.

393
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,964
If you're interested in the job, tell me.

394
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,765
Come and join us.

395
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:08,019
I called him to join us for lunch.
Is that okay?

396
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,314
Sit down.

397
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,448
You were with your mom, right?

398
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:24,619
She texted me, saying she
wants us to get married soon.

399
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,751
We're getting married.

400
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,213
Karmic connections
are quite strange, right?

401
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,967
It's hard to predict
how things will turn out in the end.

402
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,222
You also have a special connection
with Seung-yoo.

403
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,854
Yoon-su.

404
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,482
Are you two finished talking?

405
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,028
-I'll get going.
-You're not going to wish us well?

406
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,910
Congratulations. To both of you.

407
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,593
How could you look upset
in front of Yoon-su?

408
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,095
Couldn't you maintain your composure?

409
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,681
Are we talking about me
not being considerate?

410
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,602
Were you showing
any consideration towards me?

411
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,729
I showed great consideration, actually.

412
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:36,608
I didn't mention to her
that I haven't decided to marry you yet.

413
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,906
This better be the last time…

414
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,951
you ever bring Yoon-su
into our relationship.

415
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,872
That is, if you're interested
in marrying me.

416
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,876
Yoon-su handed me some key evidence.

417
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,130
Jung-ah will never become

418
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,842
the next chairman of Asung Foundation.

419
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,262
So do the calculations in your head.

420
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,973
Then decide how we'll move forward
with our relationship.

421
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,746
If our relationship

422
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:36,459
is based on calculations,
I don't understand why you waste energy

423
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,002
on doing this to me.

424
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,528
She still forgets things.

425
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,907
-Hey, Seung-yoo!
-Over here.

426
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,868
Yesterday was really intense.

427
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,912
My knees got weak and I almost fell.

428
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,706
-Hi.
-Are you feeling all right?

429
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,792
-There had to be repercussions.
-I got relieved from my duties.

430
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,712
I'm really curious about something.

431
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,464
What's going on between you and Ms. Ji?

432
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:24,841
Do you like her?

433
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,594
What are you talking about?

434
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,888
You had a crush on her
back in high school.

435
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,598
Do you still like her?

436
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,730
What? What do you mean?

437
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:43,234
-Have you met Ms. Ji?
-He sure has. They're really close.

438
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:48,114
-Is that true?
-That can't happen. It's wrong.

439
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,490
-Why is it wrong?
-What?

440
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,827
-Well…
-Hold on a second.

441
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,580
You said you were framed.

442
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,249
That the scandal involving you
was sensationalized.

443
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,752
But you're seeing her now?

444
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,338
What's happening?
You both like each other?

445
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,006
Hey, let's not talk about it.

446
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,467
-Hey, Seung-yoo!
-Hey!

447
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,552
He's crazy.

448
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,389
-Ye-lin?
-Hey, why is she here?

449
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,599
When did she get here?

450
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,683
Seung-yoo!

451
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,652
I like you.

452
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,450
I like you.

453
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,328
I said I like you.

454
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,039
Why aren't you saying anything?

455
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:45,505
You didn't want me.
You wanted my confession, right?

456
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,882
So you played with my emotions, right?

457
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,260
I was hoping you'd tell me
why you did that back then.

458
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,979
I did it because I liked you.

459
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,147
I got jealous.

460
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,567
I wanted to break up
your relationship with her.

461
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,737
Then why are you crying
and getting upset if you like me?

462
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,158
If you like someone,
you feel happy around them.

463
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,204
And you hope that
person will be happy too.

464
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,166
You don't like me.

465
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,293
Then what?

466
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,505
You couldn't get what you wanted
for the first time in your life,

467
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:31,092
so you wanted to make me miserable
along with the person I liked.

468
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,724
Follow me.

Hello?

Isn't this Ji Yoon-su's phone?

475

This is Ryu Sung-jae.

Why do you have her phone?

Did Yoon-su agree

478
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:19,760
If you fail to prove your case,
who will be harmed the most?

479
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,473
You're a hotshot mathematician,
so you'll be able to move on,

480
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,475
but Yoon-su doesn't have that option.

481
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,312
What are you trying to say?

482
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,565
If Yoon-su disagrees,
then take a moment to think it over.

483
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,526
Ask her

484
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,321
what she wants.

485
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,699
Don't push her into doing something

486
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,619
and don't impose your way
of doing things on her.

487
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,205
Are you giving me advice?

488
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,625
What if I had acted like that?

489
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,129
It's a murmur of regret.

490
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:02,178
I'm not cheering you on or anything,
so don't get the wrong idea.

491
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,979
Even if I fail to prove my case,

492
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,107
I'll make sure that Yoon-su
will not be harmed in any way.

493
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,570
I won't let that happen.

494
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,865
Did you know this?

495
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,910
The deepest cut comes

496
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,288
from the person you're closest to.

497
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,608
-Where are you going?
-There was a car following you.

498
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,986
-Right now?
-And he's also taking pictures.

499
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,780
Act normal and go home.

500
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,533
Stay here.

501
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,911
-How did you get this?
-Ryu Sung-jae gave it to me.

502
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,371
I'll call you. Stay inside.

503
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,753
The door is closing.

504
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,618
I'd like to report a suspicious vehicle.

505
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,833
Let go!

506
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,544
Who are you? Who hired you?

507
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,760
-Let go!
-Who are you?

508
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,418
Sir! Are you okay? Wake up!

509
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,798
Paik Seung-yoo.

510
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,551
He's being treated inside. Bed number two.

511
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,181
Seung-yoo.

512
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,435
Are you his guardian?

513
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,353
Is his injury serious?

514
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,939
He suffered a mild concussion.
The scans show no brain damage.

515
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:27,234
But his condition needs to be monitored.
Call me when he wakes up.

516
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,527
Okay, Doctor. Thank you.

517
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,455
Are you awake?

518
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,124
I'll call the doctor.

519
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,506
I'm fine.

520
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,466
Just wait a minute.

521
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,718
Are you really okay?

522
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,971
Does your head hurt?

523
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,787
He was driving an unregistered vehicle.
They're looking for him.

524
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,541
-What about the camera?
-I think he ran away with it.

525
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,003
How long has he been following me?

526
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,965
Go in.

527
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:17,595
If you don't feel well,
go to the hospital.

528
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,100
I don't know how to proceed

529
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,395
without making this hard for you.

530
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,107
I don't want that to happen.

531
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,820
Should I stop…

532
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,656
what I'm doing?

533
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,995
Go home first. Get some rest.

534
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,124
And get some sleep.

535
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,044
Take care.

536
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,530
UTN NEWS

537
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,115
These are interesting photos.

538
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:23,077
Would you like me to air this on the news?

539
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,453
Not right now.

540
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,748
We'll give you an approximate date.

541
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,209
So please air it on the news then.

542
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,462
Principal Noh said that

543
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:38,550
she is making this
special request only to you, Mr. Park.

544
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,178
-Gosh.
-And this…

545
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,014
As you requested.

546
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:45,849
FRIEND AND FRIEND

547
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,251
Hello, Mr. Han.

548
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,345
I met with Ms. Park, a school assistant,

549
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,306
who worked at Asung High four years ago.

550
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:32,604
She agreed to give a witness statement
on what happened and who ordered it.

551
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,148
So what?

552
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,152
You could tell the truth with her

553
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,320
or you can refuse to.

554
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,951
Regardless of what you decide,
I'm going to expose the truth.

555
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:50,205
You're threatening me?
I got fired by the school

556
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,541
and prosecutors
are building a case against me.

557
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:57,045
I'm offering advice
and also asking for a favor.

558
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,340
If you take the witness stand,

559
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,634
the judge will take that
into consideration.

560
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,928
But if you decide not to,

561
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:09,016
then you'll probably take the fall
for all that unfolded at Asung High.

562
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,810
The situation will become worse
for you than it is now.

563
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,730
You're the only one being prosecuted
over the admissions scandal

564
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,482
at Asung Academy, aren't you?

565
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,822
I'm asking for your help, Mr. Han.

566
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,041
-Thank you.
-Have a good day.

567
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,253
Hee-sung.

568
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,757
We need to talk.

569
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,550
-Get out.
-What?

570
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,720
Don't call me by my name and just leave!

571
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,931
-Get out! Didn't you hear me?
-My gosh.

572
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,182
Get out!

573
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:53,227
I heard everything.

574
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,313
To cover up what your daughter did,
the school framed my son.

575
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,856
So get out.

576
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,441
Why are you getting mad at me?

577
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,276
Listen to me.

578
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,570
We shouldn't be arguing right now.

579
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,489
You and I have to join forces

580
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,866
to chase that woman out
of this neighborhood.

581
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,201
What are you talking about?

582
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,120
They're so much in love.

583
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,873
Seung-yoo goes to see her every day.
It's really intense.

584
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,084
-What?
-She lives in this neighborhood!

585
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,710
-Please leave.
-What did you say?

586
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,921
-Get out now!
-Oh, my. What's your problem?

587
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:23,882
I told you to leave.

588
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:27,135
You shouldn't be treating me
like this. Gosh.

589
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,554
I'm not lying!

590
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,974
Where does she live?
Do you have her address?

591
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,437
You don't like me.

592
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,357
You couldn't get what you wanted
for the first time in your life,

593
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,652
so you wanted to make me miserable
along with the person I liked.

594
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,672
Make good use of it.

595
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,106
SUNG YE-LIN

596
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,778
Hello?

597
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,839
You told me it's not true that I like you.

598
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,260
Well, you're not in love
with Ms. Ji, either.

599
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,388
You won't give up on her
because of your guilt.

600
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,850
I'm going to the authorities tomorrow.

601
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,436
To press charges against Principal Noh

602
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,231
and your dad for their involvement
in the cheating scandal.

603
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,609
You need to do what's right.

604
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,319
Ms. Ji and I are not
your problem right now.

605
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,237
You need to come to your senses.

606
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,157
She's using you
because she knows how guilty you feel.

607
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,367
Ye-lin!

608
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,162
Do you know who you're like?

609
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,122
Principal Noh.

610
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:23,335
She'll brainwash and gaslight people
to get what she wants.

611
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,045
Do you want to become like her?

612
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,714
It's not too late.

613
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,591
You can change.

614
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,427
-I met Ms. Ji.
-What?

615
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,304
I told her to stop seeing you.

616
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,599
But she said she wouldn't.

617
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:41,436
Instead, she's hiding behind you
and using you.

618
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,398
So snap out of it!
You're being played for a fool!

619
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,192
I'm warning you.

620
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,904
Don't ever do that to her again.

621
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,744
If she's not using you, then what is it?
Did she say she loves you?

622
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,123
You don't care
if she uses you like a tool?

623
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,833
Because you're in love with her?

624
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,918
Yes.

625
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,338
I'm in love with her.

626
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,732
-Hello, Ms. Ji.
-Hi. Come in.

627
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,735
-It's cold today, isn't it?
-It's fine.

628
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,451
It came as a shock, didn't it?

629
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,078
A lot of shocking things
are happening lately.

630
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,998
I'm fine. I'm worried about you.

631
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,253
Here.

632
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,089
You made this yourself?

633
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,467
Yes. It's to prepare you
for your midterms.

634
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,677
Wow. Thank you, Ms. Ji.

635
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,393
Hello?

636
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,896
You're Mr. Ji Hyeon-wook's
guardian, right?

637
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,482
Yes, I am.

638
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:24,956
MS. JI YOON-SU

639
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:35,675
CHOI SHI-AN

640
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,968
Hello?

641
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,929
There's bad news, Mr. Paik.

642
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,200
Dad.

643
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,327
What happened?

644
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,621
He suffered insulin shock.

645
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,706
He hasn't been eating well recently.

646
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,793
His pneumonia has worsened
since he isn't getting enough nutrients.

647
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,088
He's been working obsessively.

648
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:16,758
Writing notes and reading.
That's what he does every day.

649
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,374
Dad.

650
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,710
Why are you getting up?

651
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,378
Dad.

652
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,338
Dad.

653
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,551
Dad!

654
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,974
Why aren't you eating?

655
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,895
Why are you obsessed with these notes?

656
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,939
No. That's not it.

657
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,526
I'm not.

658
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,126
Did you solve the problem?

659
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,133
You need to solve it
even you don't want to.

660
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:48,767
I'm scared.

661
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:54,648
Because I feel like
I'm falling in love with the problem.

662
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:58,443
Sometimes you can only solve
a problem when you love it.

663
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:05,116
There are problems
you can't solve unless you go crazy.

664
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:10,163
Only a problem like that
has the right to shatter my life.

665
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,968
What if the premise has an error?

666
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,552
Then you have to get rid of it.

667
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:31,476
If you work on it despite knowing
it's wrong, then you'll hit a wall.

668
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,441
However,

669
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,363
the life of a mathematician is
searching for answers in the dark.

670
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:49,411
Sometimes, it's not necessary
to find the solution.

671
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,920
Are you okay, Professor?

672
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,510
Why did he take that off?

673
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,471
I'll go tell the nurse.

674
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,591
Just wait a little longer.

675
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,385
I'll finish this quickly.

676
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:51,639
The people who did this
to us will pay for it.

677
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,561
I'll set the record straight about us.

678
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,814
And let's reset our relationship

679
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,484
without any more guilt or remorse.

680
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,946
It'll just be the two of us.

681
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:12,410
Let's have a fresh start.

682
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:29,469
Do you think we can
start over our relationship?

683
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,600
The premise is that we weren't in love.

684
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,229
But can the conclusion be "love"?

685
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:43,566
Our hearts are true.

686
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:49,197
-So how can you say it's false?
-No.

687
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:54,035
This isn't a problem
that says what's true is false.

688
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,166
There's an error in the premise.

689
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,171
Your proofs…

690
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,133
were always beautiful.

691
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,763
Clear and clean.

692
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,312
A proof with numerous errors…

693
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,524
doesn't fit you.

694
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,136
Sleep now.

695
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,222
And don't skip your meals.

696
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:41,976
I'll come again.

697
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:56,282
Mathematics is bold…

698
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,910
and harmless.

699
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,708
It doesn't have any purpose.

700
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,419
It's virtuous.

701
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:15,260
Like a kid running forever.

702
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,766
It really is.

703
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,081
You brought me something very useful.

704
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,462
You're crying?

705
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,049
Oh, my.

706
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,067
Why are you crying?

707
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,486
You're settling this. You've done it.

708
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,494
Do you think

709
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,999
Seung-yoo ever felt pained
for you at any moment?

710
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,592
They believe their love is pure and noble.

711
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,386
That doesn't exist.

712
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:47,143
And you're proving that to them.

713
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,687
That such a thing doesn't exist.

714
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:56,361
I guarantee that people will prefer
your proof over theirs.

715
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,456
INCOMING CALL

716
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,047
Hello?

717
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:26,182
The fourth board meeting
of Asung Foundation shall begin.

718
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,021
I would like to add another item
to the agenda.

719
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:36,150
It's a serious case of fraud
committed against the foundation.

720
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:40,363
It needs to be expedited, because
it may result in disciplinary action,

721
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,323
such as the termination of Principal Noh.

722
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,957
It's Paik Seung-yoo!

723
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,667
Paik Seung-yoo!

724
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,585
Are you here to press charges
against Asung High School?

725
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:55,670
Yes, I am.

726
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,755
You are still claiming
that you were framed to cover up

727
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,799
-a cheating scandal at the school?
-Yes.

728
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,927
You mean you had no relationship
with the math teacher, whatsoever?

729
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,221
You're claiming that you two
are completely innocent, right?

730
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,517
Then could you explain this?
I received a tip.

731
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,822
You don't care?
Because you're in love with her?

732
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,866
Yes. I'm in love with her.

733
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,285
-What did he say?
-Mr. Paik, could you clarify?

734
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:30,037
Are you in love with
your former math teacher, or not?

735
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:36,252
This isn't a problem
that says what's true is false.

736
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,422
There's an error in the premise.

737
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:02,361
How have you been?

738
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,474
I wanted to have them apologize to her.

739
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:32,391
Yoon-su.

740
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,019
But it didn't work out
because I fell in love with you.

741
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:37,355
When will you stop being afraid of me?

742
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:39,190
You don't scare me. I find you disgusting.

743
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,693
You were never a member
of high society nor do you fit in,

744
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,779
but you pretend you are one
and won't give up.

745
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:49,867
I don't regret anything
that happened after I first met you.

746
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:52,578
Why don't we go somewhere? Anywhere.

747
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:56,040
All right. Let's go anywhere.

748
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:03,840
