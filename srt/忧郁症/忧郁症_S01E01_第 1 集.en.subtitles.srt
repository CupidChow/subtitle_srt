1
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,354
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,816
YEAR 2017

3
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,580
Hi Hye-mi.

4
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:41,082
Oh, hi. Hello Gyu-young.

5
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,253
-Hye-mi!
-Hello.

6
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:10,862
ASUNG HIGH SCHOOL
SCHOLARSHIP EVENING PARTY

7
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:27,003
I express my sincere apologies
to the parents and students

8
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,547
of Asung High School
who are here with us tonight.

9
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,175
The recent news coverage of our school
has probably been a bit upsetting.

10
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:36,596
Our school is portrayed as a place
for the privileged class.

11
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,015
Most people call it…

12
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,435
"chance" nowadays.

13
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,314
Influential moms, dads, grandparents,
or principals from the privileged class…

14
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,066
All of that is true.

15
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,819
Asung High students are high achievers,

16
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,280
thanks to having such privileges.

17
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,951
Competition to get into top institutions
has always been fierce.

18
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,538
During the Qing Dynasty,

19
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,874
there was a scholar who kept failing
the imperial examinations.

20
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,836
So he decided to commit suicide
by hanging himself.

21
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,296
But before he did it, he complained
to the Great Jade Emperor.

22
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,800
"I tried so hard to pass the exam
but why couldn't I pass it?

23
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,513
How can people who are lazier
and less smart than me pass it?"

24
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:23,393
Hearing this complaint,
the Jade Emperor summoned two Gods.

25
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,355
The God of effort and the God of fate.

26
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,150
The emperor made the two Gods
compete in a drinking contest.

27
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,110
Who did you think won?

28
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,696
The God of fate drank seven glasses

29
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,324
while the God of effort
was only able to drink three.

30
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,412
From this fable, came the saying,

31
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,831
"Unchil gisam."

32
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,794
The success of a person depends
on luck rather than talent or effort.

33
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,087
Bullshit.

34
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,131
People describe the luck
that Asung High students

35
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,008
were born with as "privilege."

36
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,302
Which one would people pick
if you gave them two options?

37
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:01,973
If they could have "luck" or "effort,"
which one would they choose?

38
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,270
Luck trumps effort in today's world.

39
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,229
That's nonsense!

40
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,359
Lucky, privileged people
already rule the world.

41
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,694
That's bullshit!

42
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,699
-Oh, my!
-What's her problem?

43
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,578
Doesn't she have any shame?
How could she show up here?

44
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,456
Don't tell a false story, Director.

45
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,419
It wasn't the God of effort
who competed against the God of fate.

46
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,305
It was the God of justice.

47
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,807
The real lesson from "Unchil gisam"

48
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,436
is that although luck plays
a part in life,

49
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,480
justice underlies our society

50
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,775
and thus, luck alone
cannot determine everything.

51
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,946
It can't be helped
if the teachers and parents here

52
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,031
reject what I just said.

53
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,618
But

54
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,162
I wish…

55
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,082
the students…

56
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,835
will remember this.

57
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,846
Many people say that.

58
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,101
Losers who don't have
the courage to carry out justice

59
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,480
or use the luck that comes their way.

60
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,902
Weren't you summoned
by the police for questioning?

61
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,447
Bye, Ms. Ji Yoon-su.

62
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,366
-Take her away.
-Let's go.

63
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,703
Hurry.

64
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,996
How dare you come here?

65
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,559
Ms. Ji!

66
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,394
Block him.

67
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,986
I'll prove it.

68
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,073
I'll prove it myself.

69
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,285
Take her.

70
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,810
-She was a good teacher.
-A good teacher?

71
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,353
Then why did she do such a thing?

72
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:58,107
There are things you do in life
that don't create a problem

73
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,109
as long as they're swept under the rug.

74
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,947
But it's just that Ms. Ji
wasn't able to keep it hidden

75
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,658
from view.

76
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,162
-You call yourself a teacher?
-Say something!

77
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,207
-Don't you feel any shame?
-You're not saying sorry?

78
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,166
Oh, my. Ms. Min.

79
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:28,179
Her special feelings for him
and her eagerness to help

80
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,350
led to this incident.

81
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,564
Ms. Ji Yoon-su.

82
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,652
Did you sleep with him?

83
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,906
Did you sleep with your student?

84
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:56,582
Paik Seung-yoo, a junior at Asung High.

85
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:09,095
4 MONTHS AGO

86
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,437
Oh, no!

87
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,939
Oh, my goodness!

88
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,733
It's a hit-and-run!

89
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,361
Hello? There's been an accident
at Cheongju station.

90
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,864
A motorcycle hit a lady
and fled the scene.

91
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,115
The license plate number?

92
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,118
VROOM QUICK SERVICE
010-891-0276

93
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,163
Did anyone see the license plates?

94
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:39,292
Chungbuk Cheongju, Cha 2418.
That's the plate number.

95
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:43,212
I also saw the phone number
on the side. It's 010-891-0276.

96
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,676
Damn it.

97
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,388
That's not how you solve it.
Give it to me.

98
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,307
Let me try.

99
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,350
You can solve it like this.

100
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,478
You're no better than I am.

101
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,188
You can't solve it either.

102
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,108
-No, turn it that way…
-This way?

103
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,943
-Hey kids.
-It's Mom. Mom's here.

104
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,237
Come on.

105
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,828
Didn't you forget anything?

106
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,247
-My pyraminx!
-Why did you forget it?

107
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,588
What the?

108
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,840
Hey, it's solved.

109
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,024
-Hey.
-Hi. You came.

110
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,736
Let's go in.

111
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,412
-Welcome, ma'am.
-What's all the fuss about?

112
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,626
Take care of my luggage. Make sure
it doesn't get mixed up with theirs.

113
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,961
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,928
Ms. Min.

115
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,472
-Get up.
-Why?

116
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,809
-This table is reserved.
-For who?

117
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,646
-Hye-mi.
-Hi.

118
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,234
Oh, my. Ms. Min, it's been a long time.

119
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,070
So it has, Ms. Yoo.

120
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,239
-Gosh, she called her "Ms. Yoo."
-How could she say that?

121
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,367
Ms. Min, it seems like
you don't know that this table is reserved

122
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,744
because you don't come often.

123
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,871
This table is reserved?
But I don't see any nameplates.

124
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,915
Well, they're not reserved in our names.

125
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,835
-How?
-Based on the academic rank of your child.

126
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,839
So the seating is determined
by where your child is ranked

127
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,340
in the school.

128
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,761
I think your seat is over there.

129
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,431
That's where Seung-yoo is ranked, I think.

130
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,225
But you can sit here if you want.

131
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:15,364
If she's not smart,
she should at least be quick-witted.

132
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,784
-Hye-mi, sit here. Hurry.
-Okay.

133
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,662
That's your seat.

134
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,799
Yes?

135
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,427
Yes. Did you get there?

136
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,304
I'm here.

137
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,097
Don't hang up. Keep your phone on.

138
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,642
Okay.

139
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,314
HUSBAND

140
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,565
She's here.

141
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,692
Oh, my. She's here.

142
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,237
-Hello.
-Hello.

143
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:59,992
What's the occasion?
Is this a school parent get-together?

144
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,037
-We came for the lobster lunch.
-We came for the lobster lunch.

145
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,416
Gosh, Ji-na looks so pretty.

146
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,153
May I have your attention?

147
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,365
Today, we, the school parents
of Asung High,

148
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,866
came together to have lunch.

149
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,619
By sheer coincidence,

150
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,831
it so happens that today is also
Director Noh Jung-ah's birthday.

151
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,500
All right. Shall we have a toast?

152
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,501
-Sure.
-Sure.

153
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,211
Director Noh, Happy Birthday to you.

154
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,171
-Happy Birthday to you.
-Happy Birthday to you.

155
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,715
-Happy Birthday.
-Live long and prosper.

156
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,052
Director Noh, please give a speech.

157
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,059
Thank you for wishing me a Happy Birthday.

158
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,478
As the director of Asung High,

159
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,315
I'd like to talk about a few matters as
we're about to begin the second semester.

160
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,529
The changing educational policy
is quite concerning to all of you.

161
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,991
Any news about educational policy
is cause for alarm.

162
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,203
Elimination of charter schools,
rolling admission restrictions,

163
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,622
or equalizing high school education…

164
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,876
These are all efforts
to dumb down education.

165
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:38,799
However, Asung High students
won't become average by such policies.

166
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,342
Our children are special.

167
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,762
We'll implement a curriculum
that will differentiate us from the rest.

168
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:48,517
But will it be okay to totally ignore
the educational policy?

169
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,686
Of course not.

170
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,815
So Asung High will participate
in a new initiative

171
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,694
announced by the Ministry of Education
called the high school credit system.

172
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,156
-We'll be participating?
-Yes.

173
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:06,118
But we will do it our way.
The Asung High School way.

174
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,560
DAD

175
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,509
Math.

176
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:07,263
It's a subject that instills fear
and despair among many Korean students.

177
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:12,351
But math is also a differentiating factor
in the college entrance exams.

178
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:17,189
We will be introducing
a special advanced math class.

179
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,864
So we have recruited
a special teacher to teach the class.

180
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:31,495
We will hire a math teacher
who has taught talented students

181
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,165
who have gone on to win
math competitions including Math Olympiad.

182
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:39,712
She graduated from Asung High,
Class of '05. Her name is Ji Yoon-su.

183
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,214
She received a B.S in mathematics
from Hankook University.

184
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,050
Since 2012, she's been teaching
at Cheongan High in Cheongju.

185
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,470
In the last few years, her students
have gone on to win Math Olympiads.

186
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,391
And what's notable is that
these students didn't go to cram schools.

187
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,560
They only relied on regular math classes.

188
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,731
They prepared for the Math Olympiad
just through regular math classes.

189
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,357
Really?

190
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,359
It's hard to believe though.

191
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,906
You mean students from
a public high school beat students

192
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,533
from science high schools
in the Math Olympiads?

193
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,701
That's correct.

194
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,745
And their secret is…

195
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,331
This.

196
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,085
I'm on my way. I'll see you soon.

197
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,421
Okay. Get here safely.

198
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,590
I'm sorry.

199
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,161
Excuse me.

200
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,457
How old are you?

201
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,377
-Six?
-Yes.

202
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,830
DAD

203
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,047
Hello.

204
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,298
Welcome, Hardy.

205
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,966
Today, you'll be giving
a math problem, right?

206
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,884
Yes.

207
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,510
I'll begin right away.

208
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,680
I came up with a problem
where you don't need to use a formula.

209
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,184
A six-year-old girl living on planet Earth

210
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,937
takes a train from her home
that goes south for 1km.

211
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,399
And then, she spots a bear
and chases it by going 1km east.

212
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,569
Then she goes 1km north,

213
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,654
where she returns home.

214
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,703
So the question is,
what color is the bear that the girl saw?

215
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,504
-The bear's color?
-Does that make any sense?

216
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,840
She went south, east and north,
but ended up back home?

217
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,621
Think carefully. It'll come to you.

218
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,124
-I can't figure it out.
-It's too hard.

219
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,125
White.

220
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,378
Correct.

221
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,964
CORRECT

222
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,010
Could you hurry, please?

223
00:18:59,012 --> 00:18:59,972
I'm sorry.

224
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,186
White? A polar bear?

225
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,521
Why is it a polar bear?

226
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,483
Could you explain your answer, 3cut?

227
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,413
Since 3cut isn't replying, I'll explain.

228
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,959
You have to start with the premise
that the Earth is not flat

229
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,670
in order to solve this problem.

230
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,215
Oh, so that's why you said
the girl is on planet Earth.

231
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,383
That's right.

232
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:40,679
You go 1 km, another 1 km, and 1 km again.

233
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,348
Since it's the arctic circle,
the girl saw a polar bear.

234
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,813
TEACHER! THANKS TO YOU, MATH IS SO FUN!

235
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,233
I'M GOING TO STUDY HARD
AND GO TO THE SAME COLLEGE YOU WENT TO!

236
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,235
I WANT TO BECOME A MATH TEACHER LIKE YOU!

237
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,945
Oh, my.

238
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:04,156
A train is approaching.

239
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,743
We have arrived at Seoul Station.

240
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,912
Please make sure
you have all of your belongings with you.

241
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:11,955
Oh, I forgot!

242
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,666
Excuse me.

243
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,836
Excuse me. Sorry.

244
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,171
Sorry.

245
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,640
What?

246
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,850
Oh, thank you.

247
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,528
Yes. I just arrived.

248
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,409
Get in.

249
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,870
You must be tired, right?

250
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,498
I'm sorry that I couldn't pick you up.

251
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,459
I had a hectic day.
I just got off work now.

252
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,087
It's all right. The train ride was nice.

253
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,213
Me too.

254
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,382
-What?
-I mean, it's nice that you're here.

255
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,598
The seat belt is holding me back.

256
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,891
Let's go.

257
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,060
Do you have all of your belongings?

258
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:17,938
Yes.

259
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,904
Okay. Watch your step in the dark.
Stand right there.

260
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,573
One, two, three.

261
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,535
Surprise!

262
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,330
Should I sing that song?
Okay. I guess I shouldn't.

263
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,458
These are the boxes you sent ahead.

264
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:43,088
You packed a lot.
You'll have to organize them.

265
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,925
But you already bought furniture.

266
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,136
Yes, my mom bought it.

267
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,848
There's so much to prepare
for the wedding, you know.

268
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,849
I see.

269
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,064
What? You don't like the furniture?

270
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,315
It's not that.

271
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,153
-The place is already fully furnished.
-Fully furnished?

272
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,365
Well, if you open the cabinets,
they're bare.

273
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,367
So it's our job to fill them up.

274
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,955
Okay. I'll do that.

275
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,251
Teaching at Asung High
will help your career.

276
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,755
It'll be reorganized into an Academy
of Mathematics and Arts for the gifted.

277
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,133
An Academy of Mathematics and Arts
for the gifted?

278
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,886
What a fancy name.

279
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:38,143
-What?
-What now? You lost something?

280
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,063
What? Oh, thank you.

281
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,319
The guy wearing the 1729 cap?

282
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,701
He's here.

283
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,288
Seung-yoo.

284
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,499
Where have you been all day?
And why weren't you answering your phone?

285
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,127
You missed your counselor appointment too.

286
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,547
Answer me! Where were you?

287
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,342
-I went to Cheongju.
-Cheongju?

288
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,760
Why did you go there?

289
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,137
It's the anniversary of his death.

290
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,139
Why would you go there?

291
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,058
That was a long time ago.
You didn't need to go.

292
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,392
Come and sit over here.

293
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,353
Seung-yoo.

294
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,564
Just sit here for a minute, okay?

295
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,067
There's something important to discuss.

296
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,319
Sit here for just a while.

297
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:33,323
Honey, don't raise your voice.

298
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,916
You're getting another chance
after eight years.

299
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,877
So start over again.

300
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,632
Really?

301
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,427
Could you give that person
my number if he calls?

302
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,054
Okay. Thanks.

303
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:02,060
-They don't have it at the Lost and Found?
-No, nobody brought it.

304
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,314
You're so forgetful.
I knew you'd lose something.

305
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,567
How could you constantly
forget your things?

306
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:13,697
My notes and laptop were in the bag.
What will I do now?

307
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,535
Why are you touching his camera?

308
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,245
I'm just having a look.

309
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,960
What's going on with these pictures?

310
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,177
-Hold on.
-What?

311
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,184
They're Mersenne primes.

312
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,812
-What kind of primes?
-Mersenne primes.

313
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,356
A prime number
that is one less than a power of two.

314
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,776
Ms. Ji, I don't understand it at all.

315
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,654
Sorry, I get nauseous
when you talk about math.

316
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,415
Is he a mathematician?

317
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,903
What? Oh, thank you.

318
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,706
Did you leave your number
at the Lost and Found Center yesterday?

319
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,708
Hello.

320
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,710
We got our bags mixed up, right?

321
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,756
Yes. When do you have
time to exchange bags?

322
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:03,014
I'm sorry for taking the wrong bag.
I'm so clumsy.

323
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,058
Do you have time
tomorrow in the afternoon?

324
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,898
SOUNDS FINE

325
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,045
What time can you meet?

326
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,585
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

327
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,172
My father, who is the chairman
of the Asung Academy

328
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,215
enjoyed this hobby and now I do too.

329
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:20,884
Here you are.

330
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,096
Thank you.

331
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,018
Will you also teach calculus

332
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,021
at our school?

333
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,606
I'm planning to.

334
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,485
I wonder if you could teach it
to this group of students.

335
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,238
STUDENT RECORD
SUNG YE-LIN

336
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,283
They're high-achieving students.

337
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,703
STUDENT RECORD
JANG HYE-WON, JANG GYU-YOUNG

338
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,292
I would like to test them.

339
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,130
To determine their level?

340
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,091
Of course. You should select the best.

341
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:11,100
You heard that we'll be reorganized
as a school for the gifted, haven't you?

342
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:14,479
I think you'll be very excited about that.

343
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,651
STEAM education is important these days.

344
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:25,406
So we're trying to develop skills
in math, arts, and creativity.

345
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:30,078
Isn't that similar
to the curriculum you teach?

346
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,955
It's similar to my method,

347
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,834
but it's not compatible
with our current education system.

348
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,337
We can't keep letting students fail math.

349
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,341
I have high hopes for you
to bring positive change.

350
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,886
Thank you for the tea.

351
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,888
Bye then.

352
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,210
Why aren't you answering?

353
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,922
I'm sorry. I just saw your text.

354
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,884
How about 5:00 p.m.?

355
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,218
Where do you live?

356
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,679
Hangok-dong.

357
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,017
I live there too.

358
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,645
How about we meet
at Hangok Art Hall at 5:00 p.m.?

359
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,063
Okay.

360

SCHOOL CLUB APPLICATION

363
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:04,380
How could the math club be more popular
than our dance club?

364
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:08,760
Wait a minute. But you know…
I practiced dancing a lot, right?

365
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:12,764
So isn't it my duty to spread
my passion to the freshmen class?

366
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,060
Okay?

367
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:21,105
I'm not going to study math
as a school club activity.

368
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,317
I'm going to join the dance club.

369
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,402
Let's be in the same club.

370
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,196
PAIK SEUNG-YOO

371

CALCULUS - MATH

375
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,474
2017 MATH CLUB
CALCULUS APPLICATION TEST

376
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,229
Teacher, these are the math problems
for the math club application.

377
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,231
Please solve them for me after school.

378
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,025
Ye-lin.

379
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,113
-Hello, Mr. Han.
-Oh, gosh. Ye-lin.

380
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,532
You have to study
and do school president duties.

381
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,201
-It's tough, isn't it?
-It's not tough.

382
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:19,580
But you didn't sign up
for my math class this semester.

383
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,208
Okay. See you.

384
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,546
All the best students have left

385
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,924
and I'm stuck teaching the laggards.

386
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,760
I couldn't get into
the advanced math class this semester.

387
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,513
-So I have to get into the math club.
-Get lost.

388
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,182
"Prove that Ab, bcca are
perpendicular to each other

389
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,685
when the new vector ABC
which is not a non-zero vector

390
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,104
satisfies the absolute value XA
plus YB plus ZC,

391
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,482
which is greater than
or equal to the absolute value XA

392
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,819
plus the absolute value YB
for all real numbers XYZ."

393
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,487
What does this even mean?

394
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,448
Are you in the hip-hop club?

395
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,324
-You can rap pretty well.
-This is calculus.

396
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,410
Stop talking about calculus.
You're making me vomit.

397
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,494
You can't even dance.

398
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,934
What is it?

399
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,858
What is that?

400
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,447
-Hi.
-Hello, ma'am.

401
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,157
Ma'am, what are those paintings?

402
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,160
I wonder what they are.

403
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,704
How are they related to math?

404
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,708
Let's figure that out together.

405
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,270
My name is Ji Yoon-su.
Nice to meet you all.

406
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,397
And also thank you

407
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,359
for signing up for the fearsome
advanced math class.

408
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,862
Ms. Ji, I finished solving
the math club test.

409
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,698
-Can I submit my answers now?
-What? You finished it already?

410
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,158
What? Seriously?

411
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,201
Really?

412
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,208
SOLVE THE PROBLEM BELOW TO JOIN CALCULUS
QUESTION:

413
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,305
-All right. Let's begin, okay?
-Yes.

414
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,432
Turn to page six.

415
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,892
-Okay.
-Okay.

416
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:51,065
You learned how to determine convergence
or divergence in a sequence, right?

417
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,525
-What are those pictures?
-Yes.

418
00:35:55,903 --> 00:36:00,074
Therefore, the dot product
of vectors a, c and vectors b, c is 0.

419
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,286
Likewise, the dot product
of vectors a, b becomes 0.

420
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,038
So vectors a, b, c
are perpendicular to each other.

421
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,582
That's how you get the answer.

422
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,709
Did you understand it?

423
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,793
-Yes.
-Okay.

424
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,588
-Ask me if you have any questions.
-Okay.

425
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,683
Don't be bothered by the noise.
They do that a lot.

426
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,901
You proposed to the school board

427
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,322
to create an advanced
math class, didn't you?

428
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,032
Yes.

429
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,118
Why did you do that?

430
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,704
You know that Ye-lin lags in math.

431
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,749
So that she'll get

432
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,752
a presidential award.

433
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:56,047
What? A presidential award?

434
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,844
What did you say?
What is this presidential award about?

435
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,430
-Help me lift this.
-Oh, okay.

436
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,145
Tell me more.
What is this presidential award?

437
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,524
Be patient. I, Senator Sung Min-joon,

438
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:20,238
will make Ye-lin a recipient
of a presidential award.

439
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,782
A presidential award.

440
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,660
Please…

441
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,288
No, I'll get it.

442
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,792
What are you calling about?

443
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,212
Did you arrive there?

444
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,506
Okay, I'll join you soon.

445
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,132
Okay.

446
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,021
How is the Mathematician Olympics
coming along?

447
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,858
The committee is positive about
hosting a high school math competition.

448
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,362
It'll be co-hosted by the Math Council
and the Ministry of Education.

449
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,950
What's your impression
of the new math teacher?

450
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,618
Do you think she'll cooperate?

451
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,829
I'm not sure. I don't think she will.

452
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,414
Why not?

453
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:16,961
-You said we needed her.
-Get the competition organized first.

454
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,132
I'll take care of the next step.

455
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,312
MATH CLASSROOM

456
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,827
You all worked hard on the math problem.

457
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,621
But…

458
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,875
nobody got the answer right.

459
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,461
My answer was wrong too?
I'm sure I solved it.

460
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,129
No one among the entire junior students

461
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,506
including this advanced math class
got the correct answer.

462
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,134
-What?
-That's impossible.

463
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,387
-Seriously?
-But that's not possible.

464
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,140
So I'm thinking about
giving you another chance.

465
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:15,394
You'll have until tomorrow 8:30 a.m.
to resubmit your answers.

466
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,395
Any questions?

467
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,524
-Could you give us a hint?
-A hint?

468
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,248
In a plane,
given a line and a point not on it,

469
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,835
at most one line parallel to the given
line can be drawn through the point.

470
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,756
For over 2000 years,
mathematicians believed

471
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,175
Euclid's fifth postulate to be inevitable.

472
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:49,553
But in the 19th century,
a young man questioned

473
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,890
whether it was obvious.

474
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,312
The man's dad dissuaded him
from proving Euclid's parallel postulate,

475
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,730
but he wrote to his dad,

476
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:06,821
"Dad, I have discovered
such wonderful things that I was amazed.

477
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,615
Out of nothing I have created
a strange new universe."

478
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,911
His name was János Bolyai.

479
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,665
That is how non-Euclidean geometry began.

480
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,749
NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY:
GEOMETRIES THAT DIFFER FROM,

481
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,834
BUT ARE VERY CLOSE TO EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY

482
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,962
So go back to the beginning.

483
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,340
Look at all possibilities.

484
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,634
That's my hint.

485
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,180
Let's start class.

486
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,850
-Hey, look.
-What's this?

487
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,643
Hey, look at this.

488
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:38,978
-What is it?
-Look at this.

489
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,106
Ye-lin, look at that.

490
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,277
-There's no explanation to his answer.
-Ms. Ji.

491
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,237
-Yes?
-Look at that.

492
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,995
Who solved this?

493
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,247
It's not me.

494
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,582
Not me.

495
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,959
Hey, you were the first
to leave the classroom.

496
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,712
It wasn't me. It was already there.

497
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,297
For real.

498
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,424
Who is playing a prank then?

499
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,594
THE PROPOSITION IS WRONG

500
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,847
THE MARGIN IS TOO SMALL
TO INCLUDE THE PROOF

501
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,058
This is amazing.

502
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,186
You mean…

503
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,189
Yes, that's the correct answer.

504
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,317
-What?
-The proposition is wrong?

505
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,111
-Yes.
-But I solved it.

506
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:32,281
If you solved it, it means
you misunderstood the proposition.

507
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,825
Remember the hint I gave you earlier?

508
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,455
But who solved this?

509
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,832
None of you did this?

510
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,795
-Not us.
-Nobody saw the poster?

511
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:47,963
I didn't see anyone.

512
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,299
-You didn't see who did it?
-No.

513
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,510
Did anyone notice
when it was pinned there?

514
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,017
What's going on?

515
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,394
-Hello, Mr. Han.
-Hello.

516
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,146
Sir, is that the correct answer?

517
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,440
What's the math problem?

518
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,528
THE PROPOSITION IS WRONG

519
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,919
Nobody is showing up there, Teacher.

520
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,213
Okay.

521
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,385
Oh, have a seat.

522
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,434
Is this the correct answer, Ms. Ji?

523
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,894
Yes, that's the answer.

524
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,107
The proposition is wrong?
That's the answer.

525
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,069
You played a little joke, I see.

526
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,779
A joke?

527
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:57,116
You gave the students a problem
that was too obvious.

528
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:00,035
Since you're new here,
you don't seem to know.

529
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,998
But the students at Asung High
are serious and pure.

530
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,500
Why did you play a joke like this?

531
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,128
Is this amusing to you?

532
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,922
Does this help them
improve their math skills?

533
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,095
I'll excuse myself.

534
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,180
I'll leave you two
to discuss this further.

535
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,272
Give them a different problem.

536
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,816
This problem isn't appropriate
for Asung High students.

537
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,359
How is it not appropriate?

538
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,530
The answer is "the proposition is wrong."

539
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,283
That's a rejection of the question itself.

540
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,745
Asung High students
don't give answers like that.

541
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:46,123
The students are already good
at finding the right answer.

542
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:49,543
Sometimes they need to experience

543
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,671
a problem without an answer
or one with the wrong proposition.

544
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,927
Do the students need to know

545
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,306
that there is a theorem

546
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,351
that cannot be proven?

547
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,186
What?

548
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:11,565
Our students don't have time
for such problems and it's unnecessary.

549
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,108
You'll understand that…

550
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,988
over time.

551
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,577
Aren't you curious to know
who answered it correctly?

552
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,414
How can we be sure it's correct?

553
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,751
Whoever wrote it could be bluffing.

554
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,462
-Bluffing?
-Take a look.

555
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,216
The student didn't offer
any proof or explanation.

556
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,095
Thank you, Director.

557
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,514
Thanks to you,
I think I can find the student.

558
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,984
Paik Seung-yoo! Is it you?

559
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,114
Did you write down that
the proposition was wrong?

560
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,617
It's you, right?

561
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,788
Why did you apply to the math club?

562
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,376
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-What about this then?

563
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,004
You didn't see this?
I think it was meant for you to read.

564
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,631
IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT
THE SOLVER IS BLUFFING

565
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:18,799
HE OR SHE QUOTED FERMAT

566
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,469
"Bluffing"?

567
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,814
What did she write?

568
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,732
Well, you see…

569
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:39,361
So it's a reference to
Fermat's Last Theorem, which is famous.

570
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,030
Fermat proposed many arithmetic theorems,

571
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,366
but there are few records of his proof.

572
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,784
He left a note saying,

573
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:49,079
"The margin is too small
to include the proof."

574
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:53,500
His Last Theorem
was proven 350 years later.

575
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,171
So people questioned
whether Fermat could have known the proof.

576
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:00,090
Many mathematicians doubt he did.

577
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:05,846
Fermat's Last Theorem was proven
using 20th-century techniques.

578
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,434
Experts doubt that Fermat knew the proof
as he lived in the 17th century.

579
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,145
Thus, it is very likely that
the solver is bluffing

580
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,982
and does not actually know
the mistake in the proposition

581
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,443
as he or she quoted Fermat.

584

-Hello, Ms. Ji.
-Hello.

585
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,369
Bye!

586
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,580
Goodbye, Ms. Ji.

587
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:33,684
…THUS, THE PROPOSITION IS WRONG

588
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,128
…THUS, THE PROPOSITION IS WRONG

589
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,550
Did you solve it?

590
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,555
Great work.

591
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,059
That's the proof.

592
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,437
You did well.

593
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,991
It's you, Ye-lin. Sung Ye-lin.

594
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,957
Why didn't you say it earlier
that it was you?

595
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:42,919
Well…

596
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,971
I thought I shouldn't.

597
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,100
Because it didn't seem right

598
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:01,355
to point out something wrong
in a problem you gave us.

599
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,819
I see. That makes sense.

600
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:12,616
But you can write down
an answer like that anytime.

601
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,493
I welcome it.

602
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,245
Okay, Ms. Ji.

603
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,956
I'll go home now.

604
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,197
I'm almost there. Hangok Art Hall.

605
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,078
Oh, I forgot.

606
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,029
What?

607
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,495
You're wearing that number. 1729.

608
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,248
Last time, it was on your cap.

609
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,214
It's the smallest number

610
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,468
expressible as the sum of two cubes

611
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:56,845
in two different ways.

612
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,140
It's what Ramanujan told Hardy

613
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,516
when he remarked that 1729
seemed like a dull number.

614
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,727
G. H. HARDY: BRITISH MATHEMATICIAN
SRINIVASA RAMANUJAN: INDIAN MATHEMATICIAN

615
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:08,732
If you look at it that way,
all numbers look meaningless, don't they?

616
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,196
Here's your bag.

617
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:25,540
I looked through the camera to find
any clues to track you down.

618
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,585
You took interesting photos.

619
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,798
Do you like math?

620
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:37,385
No, I don't.

621
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,309
Thanks.

622
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:49,147
Did you see a button? It was right here.

623
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,066
This small.

624
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:53,610
-No, I didn't see it.
-Okay.

625
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:56,780
Bye.

626
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,299
Wait.

627
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,010
It's wonderful proof.

628
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:51,895
Hello?

629
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,397
It was raining earlier.
Did you get home safely?

630
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,566
What? Oh, yes.

631
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,234
And you got your bag back?

632
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,404
Yes, I gave his back and I got mine.

633
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,573
-But you know what?
-What?

634
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,284
I think there's a Ramanujan at our school.

635
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,243
Who?

636
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,748
Yoon-su, I'm sorry,
but I just arrived at my destination.

637
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,291
I'll call you after.

638
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:17,128
Thanks to you, the MoE will be a part of
the International Mathematician Olympics

00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,631
that will be held in Korea
for the first time.

640
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,592
In the Olympics,

641
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,303
the high school competition
will get a lot of media attention.

642
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,430
I'm sure Asung High
has received state funding

643
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,850
after being chosen as a school
under the high school credit system.

644
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,854
I was told that Asung High

645
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,732
was selected after
a rigorous screening process.

646
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:39,859
Is that not the case?

647
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:43,571
What? The school
qualified fairly, of course.

648
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:47,367
As an education committee member,
I cannot be seen as using my influence.

649
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,577
When it comes

650
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,288
to the education of children,

651
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:55,417
I try to be
as transparent and fair as possible.

652
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,543
You sure

653
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,421
take after your father a lot.

654
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,842
He was a man of principle
when he served in the Blue House.

655
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,845
Your guest has arrived.

656
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,597
Thank you.

657
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:15,103
I'm sorry for being late,
Vice Minister and Senator Sung.

658
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,041
…THUS, THE PROPOSITION IS WRONG

659
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,506
My little princess.

660
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:46,718
Have a snack.

661
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,179
I want a new math tutor.

662
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,222
What? Why?

663
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,058
She's not that good.

664
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,893
She isn't?

665
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,896
All right. I'll find you a new tutor.

666
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,904
Well, you know…

667
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,240
Gosh, your dad told me not to tell you.

668
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,829
You might receive a presidential award.

669
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,166
You know that competition…

670
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,752
The Mathematician World Cup
that'll be held next month.

671
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,378
It's not called the World Cup.
It's Olympics.

672
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,631
They're both the same.

673
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,050
What is the award for?

674
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:49,864
Did you call for me?

675
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,118
Was it you?

676
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,203
Yes?

677
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,792
Was it you?

678
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,254
Did you get the correct answer
in the math club test?

679
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,091
Well…

680
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,385
It has to be you.

681
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,266
Ms. Ji, the new math teacher,

682
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,726
is different from Mr. Han.

683
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:23,314
She won't give you preferential
treatment or be lenient.

684
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,734
So you have to perform well

685
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,362
in order for her to like you.

686
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,406
I'll try my best.

687
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,034
Ye-lin.

688
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,834
You're pretty and get good grades.

689
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,004
But why do you lack confidence?

690
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,593
Lift your chin. Stand straight.

691
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,971
Otherwise, they'll find out

692
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:59,934
that you didn't earn
your standings in school.

693
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,191
You're dismissed.

694
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,834
What is it?

695
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,838
You fooled everyone.

696
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,798
You said it wasn't you.

697
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,426
You said you couldn't go back
to being the person you used to be.

698
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,554
Tell me what you're thinking!

699
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,140
-Why are you getting upset?
-You have to ask?

700
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,893
I'm asking you if you're my competition.

701
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,686
That won't happen.

702
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,940
Then why did you do that?

703
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,739
Why did you write down the proof?

704
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,122
-I don't know.
-What?

705
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:10,588
Tell me.

706
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:15,677
What?

707
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,096
How did you prove it?

708
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,599
Please.

709
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,289
What happened at MIT?

710
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:48,251
After you came back, you became stupid.

711
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,796
Why are you pretending to be dumb
when you can solve a problem like that?

712
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:55,550
Do you want to know
the proof or my story?

713
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,971
It must have been amusing, right?

714
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:04,434
A problem like this is a cinch for you.

715
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:07,562
You must have felt superior
when you saw us studying

716
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,815
and competing so hard.

717
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,901
I wonder why you became like that.

718
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,112
You don't remember?

719
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:21,409
When I was little, my parents
scolded me and compared me to you.

720
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,203
I tried so hard to get
better grades than you.

721
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,748
But then you'd outscore me.

722
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:31,169
I wanted to give up.

723
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,422
-You're blaming me for that?
-Yes, it's your fault.

724
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,424
I wasn't doing badly.

725
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,968
You were exceptionally good.

726
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,597
You're special.

727
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,850
You're exceptional.

728
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,316
Where are you going? Hey, Paik Seung-yoo!

729
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:28,643
Hello.

730
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,895
-Hello, Ms. Ji.
-Hello, Ms. Ji.

731
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,569
Let's talk about the math club first.

732
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:44,117
As you all know, the answer
to the problem was, "Wrong proposition."

733
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,328
I know that you're not used

734
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,414
to solving problems
without an exact answer.

735
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,375
But it's like our lives.

736
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,378
Life is full of wrongs.

737
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:59,006
There are life problems which you
can't resolve or quite understand.

738
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:02,301
Are you going to give another problem
like that for the math club test?

739
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,511
I haven't decided yet.

740
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:07,432
By the way, a student
in this class got the answer.

741
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:09,809
Really?

742
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,896
Ye-lin.

743
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,067
Can you explain the proof to everyone?

744
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,695
Why is the proposition wrong?

745
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,740
Wow, Ye-lin.

746
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,325
-Really?
-Amazing.

747
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,288
-That's amazing.
-Awesome, Ye-lin.

748
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:04,257
Ye-lin.

749
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,011
You don't remember it well, I see.

750
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,515
No.

751
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,771
I'm sorry. I suddenly forgot.

752
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,317
Go back to your seat.

753
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:33,995
I'll explain the proof to you.

754
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,357
What's going on?

755
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,070
Ye-lin.

756
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,073
I have

757
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:13,284
never been told

758
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,078
that I did well.

759
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:23,044
I grew up being told that
my answer was wrong a lot more.

760
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:25,338
Ever since I started learning math.

761
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,720
I'm sorry for lying to you.

762
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:49,111
Who solved this?

763
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,200
Hey!

764
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,414
All right. Tension.

765
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:01,499
-Okay.
-Eye contact.

766
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:03,000
Hey!

767
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:11,717
-Double, Double flip!
-Flip!

768
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:13,886
One.

769
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:17,348
What? Ms. Ji, What's up!

770
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,225
Ms. Ji!

771
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,851
-Hello.
-Hello!

772
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,813
Our group is called Project D.

773
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:25,523
Since you appear in the video,

774
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:28,359
you've automatically become
a member of Project D.

775
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:29,360
Congratulations!

776
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,488
Ms. Ji, do you want to see our video?

777
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:36,617
This dance is more
about the vibe than technique.

778
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,744
Look at our expressions.

779
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:39,662
Okay.

780
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:42,081
He looks alive.

781
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,208
We're preparing
for an upcoming creator contest.

782
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:46,544
-So we're always practicing.
-Show you a different one.

783
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:56,554
Wait a minute.

784
01:06:57,888 --> 01:07:00,516
When did you take this video?

785
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,022
What did you choose
for your extracurricular activities?

786
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,064
Why are you asking?

787
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,025
I don't want to be in the ones you're in.

788
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:12,445
I'm not in the math camp so don't worry.

789
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,698
You didn't solve that problem, right?

790
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,368
You couldn't have with your skills.

791
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:25,916
Then who solved it?

792
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:37,303
-Ms. Ji is watching our video intently.
-Because we look cool in it.

793
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:39,805
You're wearing that number. 1729.

794
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:43,726
Do you like math?

795
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,523
Ms. Ji, please fill out
the club application.

796
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,669
All right. Stretch. One, two, three, four.

797
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,514
-Hello, Ms. Ji.
-Hello, Ms. Ji.

798
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,877
Paik Seung-yoo.

799
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:35,629
Paik Seung-yoo.

800
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:39,633
Paik Seung-yoo!

801
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,565
I found you.

802
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:55,918
Paik Seung-yoo?

803
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,504
Can I see his student record
from the last semester?

804
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:02,675
But you still have to try your best.
Otherwise, I'll drop you.

805
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,927
We're adding a high school category

806
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:07,721
to the International
Mathematician Olympics.

807
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:11,225
Ms. Ji spent the night with that student.

808
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:14,186
-No. I'm not going there!
-Fill this with trophies again!

809
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,689
Until you do as I say,
you can't do whatever you want.

810
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,357
You know how it feels and so do I.

811
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,776
There's nothingness in that moment.

812
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:27,283
