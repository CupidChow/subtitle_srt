00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:21,604
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATION
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,296
We meet again.

3
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,554
-Good night.
-Bye.

4
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:55,889
-See you.
-Bye.

5
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:03,980
What?

6
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,824
Wait here for a moment.

7
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,754
Hello! We're locked inside.

8
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,173
Open the door!

9
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,305
All the doors are locked.

10
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,308
Hold on a minute.

11
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,065
Yes, hello? I'm in the library's
natural science section.

12
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,358
We've been locked inside.

13
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,819
Thank you.

14
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,783
-Someone is coming.
-I see.

15
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,125
It's just like that day.

16
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,754
The day we came here for the first time.

17
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,593
Melencolia?

18
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,428
That's the name of this painting.

19
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,106
Are you holding that book?

20
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,903
Are you teaching Choi Shi-an?

21
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,739
You are, right? At a cram school?

22
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,032
I have a favor to ask.

23
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,535
Don’t talk about me to Shi-an.

24
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,164
You probably won't, but just in case.

25
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,583
Your advice was spot-on.

26
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,463
You told me not to fall in love
with a problem, remember?

27
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,508
If you fall in love with it,

28
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,888
you lose your objectivity
and get swayed by emotions.

29
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,142
I won't make the same mistake twice.

30
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:09,230
I won't fall in love with a problem,

31
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,736
-even if I find it irresistible.
-Why are you suddenly bringing that up?

32
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,537
-I'm sorry. I thought everyone had left.
-It's all right.

33
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,800
Aren't you going to give me any advice?

34
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,266
-I became a math teacher.
-Why did you choose that school?

35
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,103
I might be overstepping,

36
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,939
but if you have another purpose
for teaching there…

37
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,358
-And if I do?
-…then don't do it.

38
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,070
-Why?
-Don't you have better things to do?

39
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,780
You think I should aim higher?

40
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,574
No, try something new.

41
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,246
It's none of my business
what you do with your life.

42
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,924
RAMANUJAN, INDIA'S MATHEMATICAL GENIUS

43
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,738
-Who?
-Andy Carter.

44
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,782
He's an Ivy League admissions consultant.

45
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,742
I heard you worked with him.

46
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,121
I wish I could be a colleague of his.

47
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,539
He's a star in the industry.

48
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,915
Really?

49
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,795
You returned to Korea around the time

50
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,632
he was embroiled
in an admissions scandal two years ago.

51
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,925
I did return at that time.

52
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,178
It's when I quit working as
an Ivy League admissions consultant.

53
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,390
-But it's purely coincidental.
-Really?

54
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,310
I'm very disappointed to hear that.

55
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,394
Because

56
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,024
I'm trying to hire
an admissions consultant

57
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,985
who could do what Andy Carter did.

58
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,823
Forgive me for asking to see you
on such short notice.

59
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,701
I thought I wouldn't get
a chance unless I hurried.

60
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,370
How about we set up
another meeting? I'll be in touch.

61
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,334
I also heard
you run a very special clinic.

62
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,503
It seems like you hired
a very capable instructor.

63
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,507
We're lucky that she agreed
to join our staff.

64
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,218
Really?

65
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,639
To get a differentiation
at the intersection of two functions,

66
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,391
it has to connect smoothly.

67
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,893
-Understand?
-Yes.

68
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,606
All right. That's all for tonight.
Solve the remaining problems for homework.

69
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,523
Okay.

70
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,153
Yes, Ye-lin?

71
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,571
Oh, the class just ended.

72
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,364
Yes, okay.

73
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,785
-Was that your sister?
-Yes.

74
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,162
-She's here, so I'll go home with her.
-Okay.

75
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,706
Hey, Ye-lin.

76
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,252
-What do you think? Is he a good tutor?
-Not bad.

77
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,755
Hey, I'm a highly-sought out math tutor.

78
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,382
And I did better than you
in math in high school.

79
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,968
Ye-lin, I'm going to see
my friends at an Internet cafe.

80
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,096
-Don't tell Mom, okay?
-Hey.

81
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,850
-You bought a car?
-I told you I'm a star tutor.

82
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,145
-Looks like you really are.
-Get in. I'll give you a ride home.

83
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,730
-Give me your key.
-Why?

84
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,191
-You want to drive my car?
-What? Nervous?

85
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,068
Why would I be nervous?

86
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,704
Hey, Ye-lin.

87
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,790
Your car is really fast.

88
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,084
Of course, it is.
I paid a lot of money for it.

89
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,469
Hey, slow down.

90
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,689
Hey, slow down. You're going too fast!

91
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,065
Watch out! There's a car!

92
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,704
Hey!

93
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,501
Excuse me. Come out of the car for a sec!

94
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,670
Hey! Come out!

95
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,130
We didn't collide with that car.
Let's just go.

96
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,841
I was already in the lane
but this car came out of nowhere.

97
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,551
Come out for a second!

98
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,893
Seung-yoo?

99
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,482
What's going on?

100
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,358
Hey, you ride a motorcycle?

101
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,780
See you later.

102
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,134
Principal Noh Jung-ah
of the Asung Academy came to see me.

103
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,346
-For what?
-It's obvious why she came.

104
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,515
Because your math clinic is so famous,

105
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,601
the principal of Asung Academy
personally paid me a visit.

106
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,771
So did you mention me?

107
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,023
Of course, not. I didn't say a word.

108
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:48,402
Don't worry. The fact that
you're teaching here is top-secret.

109
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,949
But Principal Noh Jung-ah
is like any other parent.

110
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,166
KIM JI-NA

111
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,672
HOBBY: MEDITATION

112
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,020
Thank you for finding the book.

113
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,647
I'll study hard.

114
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,694
We meet again.

115
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,977
I came to return this.

116
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,608
NATURAL SCIENCE

117
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,827
RAMANUJAN, INDIA'S MATHEMATICAL GENIUS

118
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,535
DID YOU SLEEP WELL?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

119
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,458
It's me, Paik Seung-yoo.

120
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,884
MS. JI YOON-SU

121
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,223
How did you get my number?

122
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,363
Hello?

123
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,697
Come out for a minute.

124
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,324
What?

125
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,952
I want to talk
and there's also something I need to do.

126
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,245
Just come out.

127
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,585
Welcome.

128
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,879
Over here.

129
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,554
You didn't have lunch, did you?

130
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,724
-What would you like to order?
-I didn't come here to eat lunch with you.

131
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,185
Listen carefully.

132
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,313
Delete my number and never call me again.

133
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,817
I came to tell you that.

134
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,365
-Sorry, I'll come some other time.
-Bye.

135
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,202
How about we take a walk then?

136
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,747
Looks like you need to have
a nice lunch and a pleasant stroll

137
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,750
-on a nice day like this.
-Did you not hear what I just said?

138
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,045
You might be glad to see me but I'm not.

139
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,256
Don't call me again.

140
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,516
This is the agenda
for the G20 Ministerial Meeting this week.

141
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,394
I included a blueprint for a transition

142
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,022
to the education of the future,
a robust educational platform,

143
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,900
-and establishing smart schools.
-Great.

144
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,568
Good job.

145
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,278
SENIOR OFFICER RYU SUNG-JAE

146
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,084
PAIK SEUNG-YOO, WINNER OF LUCIFER PRIZE,
TO TEACH AT ASUNG ACADEMY

147
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,677
I requested the Office of Education
to conduct an audit.

148
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,056
I pressed charges and went to the press.

149
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,185
They were all denied.

150
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,312
Rampant bribery at Asung High School…

151
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:39,401
There was no investigation.
Instead, I was pilloried in the press.

152
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,740
I saw the articles.

153
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,284
They even attacked you…

154
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,744
You didn't see it coming?

155
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,038
I warned you.

156
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,833
If you try to fight them,
they'll play dirty.

157
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,669
But I'm not going to give up.

158
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,672
I've got nothing to lose now.

159
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,007
I can't stop.

160
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,225
Go ahead. Say what you want. I'm okay.

161
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:14,979
You're okay?

162
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,399
How is this okay?

163
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,239
How is that possible?

164
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,118
What do you expect me to say?

165
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,413
How could you be fine?

166
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,795
Why didn't you listen to me?
If you did, we could have been fine.

167
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,384
None of this would have happened
if you had quit your job,

168
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,679
moved somewhere else, and forgotten
about the whole bribery case.

169
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,347
Let's…

170
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:56,437
not break up after blaming each other.

171
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,446
It's entirely my fault.

172
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,701
I shouldn't have allowed you
to take that job.

173
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,705
If I had…

174
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,042
Don't say that.

175
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:23,589
Sung-jae, you got hurt the most
because of what transpired.

176
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:47,112
ALLEGATIONS OF INAPPROPRIATE
RELATIONSHIP WITH MALE STUDENT

177
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:00,334
TEACHER INVOLVED IN SCANDAL WITH STUDENT
WAS ENGAGED TO A MOE OFFICER

178
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,314
Nice to meet you. I'm Cho Yoon-ah.

179
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,316
Nice to meet you.

180
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,944
These are the files I mentioned.

181
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,781
Just use them as reference material.
You don't have permission to publish it.

182
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,282
I understand.

183
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:36,120
If I were to do that, then the school
would know there's a whistleblower.

184
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,164
-Yes. So please keep it a secret.
-But…

185
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,460
why are you sharing
such sensitive material with me?

186
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,129
I'd like to know.

187
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,839
Can I take your order?

188
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,424
-I'll have coffee.
-Two Americanos, please.

189
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,466
Okay.

190
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,969
I would like to make a deal.

191
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:52,970
A deal?

192
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:57,057
You did a piece about allegations
that Senator Sung Min-joon rigged

193
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:01,061
the Mathematician Olympics
in 2017 to let his daughter win.

194
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,526
We'll practice the Pranayama technique
to relieve stress.

195
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,028
Let's begin.

196
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,114
Tighten your stomach muscles.
Push in your chin.

197
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,741
Straighten your back.

198
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,745
Have your palms facing upwards to the sky.

199
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,913
Now focus on the area
between your eyebrows

200
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,207
or close your eyes and breathe.

201
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,170
Inhale deeply through your nose.

202
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,633
Now exhale through your nose.

203
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,935
-Please fill out that form.
-Okay.

204
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,439
Excuse me! My watch is missing!

205
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,690
Oh, my gosh. My watch.

206
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,984
-You lost it in the locker room?
-Yes. Just now.

207
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,570
Call the police.
That's a 30 million won watch.

208
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,948
Oh, my goodness. I can't believe it.

209
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,784
-Just a minute.
-Okay.

210
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,181
YEONAN TOP MATH ACADEMY

211
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:23,102
INTRODUCING THE TOP INSTRUCTORS
OF YEONAN TOP MATH ACADEMY

212
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,953
Top Math Academy.

213
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:45,624
Is there an instructor called
Ji Yoon-su working at your academy?

214
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,669
She quit a long time ago.

215
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,129
She did?

216
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:56,844
Did she move to a different cram school?

217
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,806
PAIK SEUNG-YOO, WINNER OF LUCIFER PRIZE,
TO TEACH AT ASUNG ACADEMY

218
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,476
Gosh! That damn kid!

219
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,020
What now? What is it?

220
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,314
He never listens to what I say!

221
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,191
How could he not discuss this with me?

222
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,152
Why would he choose to teach
at a high school

223
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,487
when so many universities
offered him a position?

224
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,698
I'm going to drag him out
of that school if I have to!

225
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,575
Don’t even think about it!

226
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,036
Don't touch a hair on his head or else!

227
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,998
I'll file for divorce if you do that.
Understand?

228
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,171
And why would he discuss this with you?

229
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,965
Why would he discuss with you
when he has cut you off?

230
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,842
He's doing fine on his own.

231
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,052
You've been nagging him to
go to this university or that institute.

232
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,055
Look at what he did to spite you.

233
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,726
That hot temper of yours… Jeez.

234
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:50,439
G. H. Hardy recognized the brilliant mind
of Srinivasa Ramanujan

235
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,649
and invited him
to the University of Cambridge.

236
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,861
There's someone like
G. H. Hardy in my life too.

237
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,573
A teacher who recognizes my talent,
acknowledges me, and encourages me.

238
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,706
ASSIGNMENT:
ESSAY ON THE MAN WHO KNEW INFINITY

239
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,082
TEACHER: PAIK SEUNG-YOO
NAME: CHOI SHI-AN

240
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,500
-Have a good day.
-Welcome…

241
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:14,254
-Oh, my. Hello.
-Hi there.

242
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,090
Long time no see.
This place hasn't changed.

243
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,426
I'd like to order a dessert.

244
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,261
I'll have a muffin with coffee.

245
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,222
I'll brew the coffee, Honey.

246
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,435
Your son will be teaching math
to my son, Yoo-chan.

247
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,354
Could you put in a good word for me?

248
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,607
Oh, I forgot.

249
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,485
You hardly get to see your son, right?

250
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,073
You made me jump.

251
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,204
I wonder why he chose to teach
at Asung Academy

252
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,122
when he won a Nobel Prize.

253
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,376
I mean, it's good
for our school though, right?

254
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,003
Don't you think so?

255
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,131
Henri Poincaré Prize?

256
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,968
What? You're going to give
all of that to me?

257
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,636
We're closing for today.

258
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,473
If we get a crappy customer,
our sales go down.

259
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,435
It's pointless to stay open in that case.

260
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,146
Crappy customer?

261
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,524
Oh, my! My heels!

262
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,402
-Why are you pushing me?
-And enjoy these desserts.

263
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,654
Don't come here again.

264
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,824
It's not called the Nobel Prize.
He won the Lucifer Prize.

265
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,741
Gosh.

266
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,661
It's the same thing, isn't it? Jeez.

267
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,620
-Hey.
-Honey.

268
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,254
Did you call for me?

269
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,298
Have a seat.

270
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,011
The Man Who Knew Infinity.

271
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,472
Ms. Ji found the book for you, didn't she?

272
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,311
I read your essay.

273
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,272
It was quite good.

274
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,069
I'm going to write a paper.

275
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,615
And I'm thinking about picking
a few students to work together on it.

276
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,703
Oh, my god. For real.

277
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,374
What do you want?

278
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,420
If it has anything to do
with Ms. Ji, I can't…

279
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,047
It doesn't involve her.

280
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,384
I'm curious about you.

281
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,888
What kind of education did you have
and how did you come to like math?

282
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,474
As well as how you met Ms. Ji.

283
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,310
I met her while playing Janggi for money.

284
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,728
Janggi?

285
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,567
Check.

286
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,159
She's good at it.

287
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,245
Three wins.

288
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,122
-Oh, my.
-I'll take that.

289
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,209
That girl is very clever, isn't she?

290
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,711
She's winning all the money.

291
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,588
-Let's play one more game.
-How much will you bet?

292
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,590
-How much would you like?
-Let's bet 50,000 each.

293
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,592
-That's a lot.
-It's only fun when the stakes are high.

294
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,803
-I'll lend you money.
-Okay. Deal.

295
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,681
You're really good.

296
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,101
That's it.

297
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,602
-Come on.
-Just do it.

298
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,688
Geez, I'm all done now.

299
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,948
-Wait. The cops are here.
-What?

300
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,450
-The cops are coming!
-Hurry!

301
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,453
-Stop running! Stop!
-Damn it. I was winning.

302
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,165
What? It's a kid.

303
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,129
You bet money on Janggi?

304
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,381
-Where are your parents?
-They're not around.

305
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,174
I don't have any parents, okay?

306
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,552
Who's your legal guardian then?
Call your guardian.

307
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,928
Did you not hear me?

308
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,555
I can't release you
unless your guardian comes.

309
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,641
Take a look around. Everyone gets
to go home with their guardians.

310
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:59,146
-Don't you want to go home?
-Ms. Ji became my guardian that day.

311
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,983
She became my math teacher
and also a friend.

312
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,946
So you're a really strong Janggi player?

313
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,866
I also play Go and chess pretty well.

314
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,118
Nobody has ever beat me.

315
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,328
You plan on becoming a chess player
when you grow up?

316
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,288
No.

317
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,958
I want to become a mathematician like you.

318
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,501
Like me?

319
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,963
Wow. You dream big.

320
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,298
I'll really become one.

321
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,009
When I win the Lucifer Prize one day,

322
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,136
I'm going to give the medal to Ms. Ji.

323
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,064
-What are you doing after school?
-Cram school.

324
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,026
There's somewhere we need to go.

325
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,116
I invited you all

326
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,535
to this meeting to discuss
a special gifted class

327
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,456
that I plan on starting
at Asung Academy of Mathematics and Arts.

328
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:09,549
We recently hired
Lucifer Prize winner, Paik Seung-yoo.

329
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:13,511
And he'll pick a few students
to assist him with his next paper.

330
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,306
Our kids' names will appear
as contributors in his paper?

331
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,807
That's right.

332
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,688
I was going to mention this later,

333
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,734
but we're in the process
of hiring a star admissions consultant.

334
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,902
I knew it.

335
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:34,407
It won't be easy to accomplish this
on our school budget, but we'll try.

336
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,493
Well, you're working
so hard for the school,

337
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,245
so we must pitch in too.

338
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,748
We'll hold a fundraiser to cover
the operational costs.

339
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,875
-Does everyone agree?
-Of course.

340
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,088
I brought this for you.

341
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,425
It's a cosmetic brand
that I'm a spokeswoman for.

342
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,927
Please try it.

343
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,305
Of course, you don't have any wrinkles,
but it won't hurt

344
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,057
to start using anti-wrinkle creams.

345
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,229
If you need more, please tell me.

346
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,524
It's nice. Thank you.

347
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,625
KIM JI-NA'S PROFILE

348
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,465
Yes, Principal?

349
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,217
Call Mr. Paik to my office.

350
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,011
MIND-BODY CONNECTIONS THROUGH MATH,
KOREA'S MATHEMATIKUM

351
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,554
"Mathematikum."

352
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,099
Isn't this the name
of a math museum in Germany?

353
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:45,270
I was thinking it would be nice
to have such a museum in Korea as well.

354
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,564
I think it's also
a realistic goal to achieve.

355
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:49,482
I like it.

356
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,109
There's one condition.

357
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,347

DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL CALCULUS 1
LEE YU-JUN

359
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:25,518
Lee Yu-jun understands the problems,
but needs to expand his way of thinking.

360
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,813
He needs more practice
in how to connect what he learned.

361
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,814
Okay.

362
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,193
Kim Won-hee and Lee Seul-ah
have gaps in their logic.

363
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,904
At this rate, they'll lose points
in the written math test,

364
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,616
so they need extra help in organizing
the steps when solving a problem.

365
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,160
All right. I'll tell the instructors that.

366
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,661
Good.

367
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,664
Shi-an hasn't called yet?

368
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,707
No, she hasn't.

369
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,959
Okay.

370
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,678
Hello?

371
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,932
The police station?

372
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:09,771
She's the only student who aced
the math section in the admission test.

373
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,149
Currently, she's staying
at a child welfare facility.

374
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,734
What else did you find?

375
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,694
Nothing much.

376
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,906
But this was in her locker.

DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL CALCULUS 1

378
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:33,336
Why is Mr. Paik paying
special attention to this student?

379
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,214
We'll have to find out.

380
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,183
-Hello?
-Are you Kim Ji-na's mother?

381
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,435
Yes, I am.

382
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,103
This is a photo of the missing watch.

383
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,355
We're investigating all the members

384
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,983
who were using
the women's locker room at the time.

385
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,695
But cameras are not allowed
inside the locker room.

386
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,280
How will you carry out an investigation?

387
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,575
And are you sure it was stolen?
It could have been misplaced.

388
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,286
We're relying on eyewitnesses
to catch the perpetrator.

389
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,621
If you need to contact us,

390
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,957
please call that number.

391
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,208
PRINCIPAL NOH JUNG-AH

392
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,212
I don't want any of this to distract
my daughter from school.

393
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,737
Hello? Mr. Jang?

394
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,655
Did I catch you at the wrong time?

395
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,784
Okay.

396
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,827
Yes?

397
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,038
She still hasn't come?

398
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,374
She's very good.

399
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,377
That's western Janggi.

400
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,753
She's good.

401
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,801
I'll counter that like this.

402
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,351
How about this?

403
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,027
TEACHER S

404
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,784
Hello?

405
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,413
Seung-yoo?

406
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,873
Yes, it's me.

407
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,375
Shi-an is with me right now.

408
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,044
Where is she?

409
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,295
At a nursing home.

410
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,130
What?

411
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:09,469
All right. That's all for today.
Let's adjourn. Okay?

412
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,638
Why? We haven't finished playing.

413
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,641
Do you know what time it is?
The professor has to rest.

414
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,060
How will we finish the game then?

415
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,479
I'll take a picture of the board.

416
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,731
-So you can continue next time.
-Okay.

417
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,067
Now shake hands.

418
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,735
It was a good game, Professor.

419
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,320
I hope to see you soon.

420
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,420
Ms. Ji.

421
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,506
I'm sorry.

422
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,466
I lost track of time while playing chess.

423
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,176
Chess?

424
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,888
There's a really strong chess player here.

425
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,807
The strongest I've ever played.

426
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,183
Go ahead to my car.

427
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,102
Okay.

428
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,816
He's sleeping.

429
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,693
I took him to his room.

430
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,653
Why did you bring her
here without telling me?

431
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,113
I told you not to tell her
anything about me.

432
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,699
I didn't.

433
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,285
They just played chess.

434
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,037
And the professor liked it.

435
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,141
Aren't you hungry?

436
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,475
I am but…

437
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,311
Then let's grab dinner.
You didn't have anything to eat.

438
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,362
All right. Let's eat.

439
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,572
Looks delicious.

440
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,370
-Mr. Paik.
-What?

441
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,664
But who is the professor?

442
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,004
He's the teacher of my mentor.

443
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:11,257
He wrote a very interesting paper
on mathematics.

444
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,426
I'll tell you the title.
You should look it up.

445
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,594
I will.

446
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,390
You're not going to eat?

447
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,517
Hurry up and eat. You're late.

448
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:25,188
This fried rice roll
is so crispy, isn't it?

449
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,653
-Mr. Ji.
-What?

450
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,531
Mr. Paik will include me
in his next project.

451
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,325
What kind of project?

452
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,452
A project to build a national math museum.

453
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,870
Isn't it exciting?

454
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,874
I heard that you taught math to Mr. Paik.

455
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,337
You're an amazing teacher.
You taught such a brilliant mathematician.

456
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,798
-I didn't teach him anything.
-That's not true.

457
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,008
Mr. Paik said that he was able
to hone his talent,

458
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,136
thanks to you and the professor
at the nursing home.

459
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,099
When I told him I wanted to become
a mathematician like him,

460
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,559
he said I needed to meet someone.

461
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,439
If I become a mathematician,
I'll present you with a medal one day.

462
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,463
-Hello?
-Where are you, Seung-yoo?

463
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,022
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

464
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,274
Asung High!

465
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,404
What's the big occasion?
This is the first time you invited me.

466
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,406
In high school, we weren't friends.

467
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,449
But we're in the same college now
and best friends.

468
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,201
We're not best friends.
We just go to the same school.

469
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,663
I thought I could do anything I want
and have fun once I got into college.

470
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,707
But how come college is tougher?

471
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,251
Tell me about it. There's no time to date.

472
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,087
-You don't have a boyfriend?
-I recently broke up with my ex.

473
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,589
-Nice.
-Must be hard.

474
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,299
-What about you?
-What?

475
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,383
No boyfriend?

476
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:20,636
-What's going on here?
-You two…

477
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,471
-Over here, Seung-yoo.
-Hey.

478
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,558
-Seung-yoo.
-Everyone is here?

479
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:28,436
So how is everything,
Math Teacher Paik Seung-yoo?

480
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,897
-How is what?
-Do you have a girlfriend?

481
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,399
How could he have one?
He spent years working on his paper.

482
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:37,486
So? Don't tell me you're married
to mathematics, okay?

483
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,947
-Please don't say you are.
-Enough.

484
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,407
How's teaching? Is it fun to teach them?

485
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,243
Teaching is a tough profession.
Kids, these days.

486
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,703
We misbehaved too.

487
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,123
-Are you pointing a finger at me?
-You were a problem kid.

488
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,793
But Seung-yoo,
did you always want to be a teacher?

489
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,170
No.

490
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,341
Then why did you take the job?
You dropped out of high school, after all.

491
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,933
Excuse me.

492
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,392
-What the?
-Are you leaving?

493
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,810
-Where are you going?
-You're going?

494
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,063
-He does have a girlfriend. Seung-yoo.
-That's ridiculous.

495
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:16,859
There is no way. I'll bet my life that
he doesn't have a girlfriend.

496
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,820
Thank you for taking me there.

497
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,405
I'd like to go again.

498
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,619
CHOI SHI-AN

499
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,040
Hello?

500
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,708
Yes, did you get home?

501
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,964
And Ms. Ji?

502
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,050
She didn't say anything?

503
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,720
All right. Sleep tight. See you tomorrow.

504
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,434
Everyone is surprised at your choice.

505
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,228
But I think you're just being you.

506
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,315
But don't pick a fight there.

507
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,404
Only the school's name has changed.
Everything else is the same.

508
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,200
Who said I'm picking a fight?

509
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,202
You said you'd share your gift with them.

510
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,290
In that school,
sharing is not a part of their culture.

511
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,210
You have to take what you can to survive.

512
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,378
So?

513
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,047
Are you happy?

514
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,467
You took a lot for yourself.

515
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,970
What are you talking about?

516
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,807
I'm kidding.

517
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,726
I can't even joke around?

518
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,229
You have a new number, don't you?
Give me your digits.

519
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,742
I'll see you around.

520
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,243
So unless there's an eyewitness
who comes forward,

521
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,621
there is no way
the police can identify a suspect

522
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:37,500
who stole the watch in the locker room?

523
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,921
Yes, I agree.

524
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,507
Thank you, Mr. Jang.

525
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:57,937
Hey, Min-hyung.

526
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,230
Hi, Seo-jun, Ji-hye.

527
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,357
-I'm here.
-Hi.

528
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,651
-What the?
-Isn't that Shi-an?

529
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,361
What is she doing here?

530
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,113
I don't know.

531
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,326
Shi-an is taking this class with us?

532
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,704
I can't believe it.
What kind of connections does she have?

533
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,884
-Hi.
-Good morning!

534
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,762
All of you have been picked
to join my new project.

535
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,098
The National Math Museum project.

536
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,438
So here's your first assignment.

537
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,273
Each of you will come up
with an exhibition idea

538
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,401
and present it to the class.
Have your ideas ready by next week.

539
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,819
-Okay.
-Okay.

540
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,070
Shall we start now?

541
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,124
-Are you preparing your presentation?
-Yes, I'm finding material.

542
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,627
What about you? Are you making progress?

543
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,838
No, I haven't even started.

544
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,676
I'm sorry. I have to go.

545
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,345
I have to go to an Internet cafe
after I make copies of this.

546
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,182
-An Internet cafe? What for?
-To work on a computer.

547
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,644
You can use my laptop.

548
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,605
I'll lend it to you.

549
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,613
Your laptop? But why?

550
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,989
I don't know.

551
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,116
Because we're friends.

552
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:35,868
Friends?

553
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,206
-You don't want to borrow it?
-Of course, I do.

554
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,042
Thanks, Ji-na.

555
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,681
It's a perfect studio
for tutoring students.

556
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,309
School parents like it here
because it's quiet.

557
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,477
I like it.

558
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,853
-Show me a few more.
-Sure.

559
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,482
Whenever there's a listing,
they're snatched up so quickly.

560
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,652
You're quick.

561
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,072
Doors are closing.

562
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,011
Ms. Ji Yoon-su?

563
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,237
Ms. Ji.

564
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,657
We got our first assignment
for Mr. Paik's project.

565
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,868
We have to come up
with ideas for a math museum.

566
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,120
It's so exciting.

567
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,373
What ideas did you have in mind?

568
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,251
I was thinking
about using my special talent.

569
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,087
And we have to give a presentation.

570
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,716
-Like a speech?
-Yes, a speech about math.

571
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,259
Isn't that cool?

572
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,769
LEE HYUN-JAE

573
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,314
-Hello?
-I've got amazing news.

574
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:31,400
-What?
-Gyu-young said he saw Ms. Ji.

575
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,860
Where did he see her?

576
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,942
You come this late?

577
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,612
How did you know I live here?

578
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,947
Gyu-young saw you.

579
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,951
If it doesn't matter to you
then that's fine.

580
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,703
But be careful
if you don't want to bump into him.

581
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:43,222
You let Shi-an join your project.

582
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,643
Why are you treating her so nicely?

583
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,522
She's good at math

584
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,857
and she likes it.

585
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,527
More importantly,

586
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,822
she wants to become
a mathematician like me.

587
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:01,657
That's why.

588
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:12,042
I know that expression.

589
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,004
The world looks so gloomy.

590
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,675
It feels like
you're in a long dark tunnel.

591
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:22,845
You don't want to see or talk to anyone.

592
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,099
I want to make you smile.

593
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,436
Through Shi-an if possible.

594
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,481
That's all.

595
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,093
Call me.

596
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,848
If you would like to discuss
Shi-an's progress

597
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,183
or any other matter.

598
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,649
ASUNG ACADEMY OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTS
PAIK SEUNG-YOO

599
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:22,237
You can also call me on a rainy day
like this or when you get home late.

600
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,658
Good night.

601
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,874
ASUNG ACADEMY OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTS
PAIK SEUNG-YOO

602
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,930
An open classroom?

603
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:34,226
A lot of people will be interested
in your Math Museum project.

604
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,230
You also need publicity
to realize a project like this.

605
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,859
We could broadcast
your lecture in real-time

606
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,445
on our school's official channel.

607
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,407
Let's invite officers from
the Office of Education as guests

608
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,367
and students studying math education.

609
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:53,912
Sure.

610
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,957
I'll have the school make preparations.

611
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,793
I've got big hopes for your project.

612
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,129
Okay.

613
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:11,805
Hello.

614
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,141
-Here's Principal Noh.
-Nice to meet you.

615
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,058
Hi.

616
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,102
-Hello.
-Hello.

617
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,604
Let's all sit down now.

618
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,027
Go!

619
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,658
Your daughter grew so tall.

620
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,535
Why is that student there?

621
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,288
Oh, I heard the principal put her in.

622
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,790
You know, noblesse obligation.

623
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,960
Noblesse oblige?

624
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:53,305
I thank all of you
for coming to this open class

625
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:55,182
related to my math museum project.

626
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,476
I'm Paik Seung-yoo,
the teacher of this class.

627
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,275
We'll now hear presentations

628
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,861
given by students involved
in the math museum project.

629
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,619
It just started. I'm nervous.

630
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,539
You'll do great. Good luck.

631
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:29,007
The first presenter is Kyung Soo-young.

632
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,928
That is the end of my speech.

633
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,429
Thank you.

634
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,478
We've heard a lot of great ideas today.

635
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,981
Next is Kim Ji-na.

636
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,656
I'll begin my presentation.

637
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:59,162
My idea is to use board games
to learn about the number of cases.

638
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,542
There is an Enigma Cafe at the National
Museum of Mathematics in New York.

639
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:06,962
You can learn math principles
through games at this place.

640
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:11,133
So I would like to create a board game
that is based on a mathematical approach

641
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:14,428
where you can learn about
the number of cases and shortest path

642
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,972
probability by incorporating
traditional Korean games.

643
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,851
That's a good idea.

644
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,187
Then you'll need to come up
with game rules too.

645
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,981
Can you show us any examples?

646
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,567
The basic gameplay will be taken
from the Yut game.

647
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,904
I'd also like to create strategic rules
that exist in Go and Janggi.

648
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,866
I can't wait to see your final paper.
Good job.

649
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,659
Thank you.

650
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:50,297
Now our last presenter is

651
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,799
Choi Shi-an.

652
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,596
-What the?
-She didn't prepare her speech?

653
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:00,766
Shi-an?

654
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,937
Hurry up.

655
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,405
Begin.

656
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:24,831
I'm Choi Shi-an
and I'll be giving my speech.

657
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:31,087
My presentation is using board games
to learn math principles.

658
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,798
BOARD GAMES BASED ON MATHEMATICS
CHOI SHI-AN

659
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,593
BOARD GAMES BASED ON MATHEMATICS
CHOI SHI-AN

660
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,012
-That's the same speech.
-Seriously?

661
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,475
Actually, my presentation is

662
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:46,311
almost identical
to the presentation given by Kim Ji-na.

663
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,815
She's got some nerve.

664
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,320
Should I still give my speech?

665
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,325
What an embarrassment for the school.

666
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,246
What is going on?

667
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,213
Explain this.

668
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,215
Kim Ji-na stole my presentation.

669
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,177
I did? How?

670
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,513
You lent me your laptop.

671
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:25,475
My presentation was saved on your laptop.

672
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,395
Didn't you steal my presentation
that I had on my laptop?

673
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,940
What? You said you hadn't even
started writing yours.

674
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,484
When did I say that? Prove it.

675
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,695
That's enough.

676
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:41,825
If one of you copied
the other person's presentation

677
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,203
then come clean now.

678
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,082
This isn't a project
that's so important that you need to lie.

679
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,419
-I didn't copy hers.
-Neither did I.

680
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,588
Hey, Ji-na! Tell the truth.

681
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,633
I thought you were being nice
when you lent me your laptop,

682
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,553
-but you lent it to me to copy my speech.
-Be quiet!

683
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,058
How about we do this?

684
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:10,562
We'll let the students explain
their actions before us next Monday.

685
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:13,398
They can present
whatever evidence they have.

686
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,195
We'll judge who is lying

687
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,450
and have that student
taken off the project.

688
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,952
I'll make that decision.

689
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,831
Let's discuss how we’ll handle this.

690
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,405
I didn't do it.

691
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,412
You stole a 30 million won luxury watch

692
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,123
and now you steal someone's presentation?

693
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,670
-What are you talking about?
-You really have to ask?

694
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:20,799
The Meditation Class. I had to give
a statement at the police station.

695
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,097
Meditation Class? What about it?

696
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,808
I have no idea what you're talking about.

697
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,477
Shut that mouth of yours!

698
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:40,068
I can turn a blind eye
for stealing a watch

699
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,487
or lying about a presentation.

700
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,989
But this is my school.

701
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,825
I won't allow anyone

702
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,620
to harm the reputation and dignity
of this school. Understand?

703
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,833
-Mom, you're…
-Call me Principal!

704
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,792
Yes.

705
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,169
Principal.

706
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,507
Are you really

707
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:07,721
protecting the reputation
and dignity of this school?

708
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:10,181
What?

709
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:17,022
I didn't steal the watch
nor the presentation.

710
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:34,873
Have you shown your presentation
to anyone else besides Ji-na?

711
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,375
I asked Ms. Ji to review my presentation.

712
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,671
Anyway, you didn't copy it, did you?

713
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,006
No, I didn't.

714
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,508
I'm going to prove it somehow.

715
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:52,057
Tell me the exact time, date, and location
where Ji-na lent her laptop to you.

716
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,534
Really?

717
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,412
I'll meet with her.
Arrange an orientation.

718
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,373
I'll contact her.

719
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,541
And…

720
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,461
I'd like to meet the student's mother.

721
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,421
Directly?

722
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,340
Yes.

723
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,217
All right.

724
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:43,316
STUDENT: KIM JI-NA
PARENT: NOH JUNG-AH

725
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:12,470
Hello?

726
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,889
I scheduled a round
at Western Cape Country Club.

727
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:20,145
And Senator Sung Min-joon recently met
with the Head of the Gangnam District.

728
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,313
For what?

729
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,481
I don't know.

730
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,359
What I do know is that
after he met with him,

731
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:30,447
he put in a request to withdraw revisions
for a development project.

732
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,323
I'll see what I can find.

733
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,659
-You're not home?
-No.

734
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,830
Talk later.

735
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,912
Yoon-su.

736
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,382
It's been a long time.

737
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,219
How have you been?

738
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,972
Were you following me?

739
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:20,932
Yes.

740
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,434
Sorry I had to follow you.

741
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,311
Surprised, right?

742
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,524
Can we talk for a minute?

743
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,235
I don't have anything to say.

744
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,612
I do.

745
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,781
I don't know how you found me,

746
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:38,992
but don't follow me

747
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,536
or do any background checks.

748
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,196
What are you thinking?

749
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,866
It's going to be a landmark
in my educational business.

750
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,577
Oh my goodness.
Principal Noh with Senator Sung?

751
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,662
I no longer solve math problems.

752
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,539
A mathematician
who doesn't face such struggles

753
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,541
cannot go on and solve the next problem.

754
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:32,045
You can be dropped anytime.

755
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,963
So don't act so cocky.

756
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,507
-An audit?
-We've got a serious problem.

757
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,801
I just got a call
from the Office of Education.

758
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,887
Can't you tell me what you intend to do?

759
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,388
I'll fix this my way.

760
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:47,727
