1
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:21,354
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATION
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,708
I want to see the CCTV footage
inside of the library on September 14th

3
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,710
from 4:20 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.

4
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,170
Give us a minute.

5
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,471
It's me. Ji Yoon-su.

6
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,890
Can we meet right now?

7
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,708
Yoon-su.

8
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,178
It's been a long time.

9
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,015
How have you been?

10
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,768
Were you following me?

11
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:43,853
Yes.

12
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,231
Sorry I had to follow you.

13
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,108
Surprised, right?

14
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,320
Can we talk for a minute?

15
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,031
I don't have anything to say.

16
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,492
I do.

17
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,162
Yoon-su, wait.

18
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,123
I…

19
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,336
She says she doesn't have anything to say.

20
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,097
You came to see him?

21
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,766
Have you been talking to him?

22
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,434
Since when?

23
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,938
Recently? Or for a while?

24
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,815
What are you trying to do?

25
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,695
Go inside.

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,947
Go inside first.

27
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,879
What do you need to say?

28
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:51,838
I forgot.

29
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,467
I totally forgot what I was about to say.

30
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,097
What are you thinking?

31
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,850
How could you be with him?

32
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,728
Do I have to explain myself?

33
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,897
Do I have to explain why I'm asking?

34
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,649
Did you forget what he did to your life?

35
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,985
What about my life?

36
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,781
Anyway, none of that
matters to you anymore.

37
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,577
I don't know how you found me,

38
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,121
but don't follow me

39
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,332
or do any background checks.

40
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,836
Don't you…

41
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,839
have any shame?

42
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,969
I see you for the first time in four years
and this is what I see. Unbelievable!

43
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,766
You're not even explaining yourself.

44
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,352
I know it's none of my business.

45
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,896
But you'll need to be careful how you act.

46
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,484
If you had been careful back then,
none of this would've happened.

47
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:50,915
Are you okay?

48
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,000
I saw Shi-an…

49
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,752
give her presentation.

50
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,964
What did the school decide to do?

51
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,133
No decision has been made yet.

52
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,720
Shi-an and Ji-na are accusing each other
of plagiarizing their speech.

53
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,179
We're looking into
who's telling the truth.

54
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,473
Do you know
when Ji-na lent her laptop to Shi-an?

55
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,350
On the 14th. A Tuesday.

56
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,186
Shi-an showed me her draft
a day before it was due.

57
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,398
Don't worry too much.
I'll straighten this out.

58
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,774
How will you?

59
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,028
Do you have a plan?

60
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,407
If you don't have one,
I'll fix this my way.

61
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,701
-Your way?
-Don't tell Shi-an that we met.

62
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,913
Can't you tell me what your plan is
and what you intend to do?

63
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,219
I'll handle this.

64
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,220
You don't trust me?

65
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,973
Why should I trust you?

66
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,288
You scared me.

67
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,707
What is it, Ji-na?

68
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,298
-Where should I stab you?
-What?

69
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,469
When someone gets
on your nerves, you stab them, right?

70
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,970
I'm going to do the same.

71
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,390
You're insane.

72
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,396
-Are you afraid of me?
-Yes, you frighten me.

73
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,315
That's not right.

74
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,692
You should be thanking me.

75
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:46,072
The other kids don't see you
as competition and look down on you.

76
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,784
But I, at least,
consider you as competition.

77
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,249
Aren't you grateful?

78
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,757
Don't get on my nerves, okay?

79
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:39,041
Are you really protecting
the reputation and dignity of this school?

80
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,543
What?

81
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,295
I didn't steal the watch

82
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,714
nor the presentation.

83
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,239
Yes, Mr. Lim?

84
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,992
An orientation?

85
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,994
Yes, we'd like to interview her.

86
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,787
By the way,

87
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:22,126
our instructor rarely does this,
but she would like to meet you first.

88
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,212
I'd be happy to meet her.

89
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,713
How is lunch tomorrow?

90
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,840
Noon is fine.

91
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,176
I'll text you the name of the restaurant.

92
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,680
And I'm positively considering
the offer you made.

93
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:39,143
Then I think we should have
another discussion soon.

94
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,687
I'll be in touch.

95
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,545
Principal Noh Jung-ah. At noon.

96
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,421
This is the address.

97
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,726
Do I have to explain why I'm asking?

98
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,729
Did you forget what he did to your life?

99
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:04,103
You got off scot-free after that scandal

100
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,355
because you were a minor.

101
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,858
Not because
you were a hotshot mathematician.

102
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,236
If you keep this up with Yoon-su,
you'll get yourself in hot water.

103
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,447
Are you giving me advice?

104
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,573
No.

105
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,491
This is a warning.

106
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,911
Don't go anywhere near Yoon-su.

107
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,665
Just stay out of her life, please.

108
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,834
You're not her fiance.

109
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,797
Even when you were, you didn't
do anything. Now, you're nothing.

110
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,549
And…

111
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,053
I don't care what you say to me.

112
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,096
But don't say upsetting things to Yoon-su.

113
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,391
To Yoon-su?

114
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,019
It's the same with you too.

115
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,812
You weren't her boyfriend then

116
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,398
and neither are you now.

117
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,859
Well, like you said,
I was a minor back then.

118
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,070
But not anymore.

119
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,721
MYEONYEOK SAUNA

120
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,225
It's toasty in here. I love it.

121
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,728
Ye-lin, you're losing your complexion.

122
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,524
So sweat a lot here. Okay?

123
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,405
It's nice.

124
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,074
-Share some.
-No.

125
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,786
-Mom, just a minute.
-Okay.

126
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,746
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

127
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,582
-Get closer. My face looks bigger.
-No, it doesn't.

128
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,126
-So-jung and Hyung-do?
-Geez.

129
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,419
Oh my.

130
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,712
Hi, Ye-lin.

131
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,132
What's going on here? You two are dating?

132
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,221
You got us. We're in a relationship.

133
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:08,769
But Ye-lin, could you not tell the guys?

134
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,605
Yes, So-jung isn't ready to tell
the guys that we're dating.

135
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,566
-Please.
-Sure.

136
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,945
I finished moving.
Who's coming to my housewarming party?

137
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,906
Gyu-young has his own place.
He's inviting us to his place.

138
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,075
-Should we go?
-Of course, we should go.

139
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,243
Ye-lin, you're coming too, right?

140
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,120
-Should we also call Seung-yoo?
-Yes, call him.

141
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,288
-I should?
-Yes.

142
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:30,124
You have a new number, don't you?
Give me your digits.

143
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,170
I'll see you around.

144
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,255
Ye-lin, you're coming, right?

145
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,882
Come on. You should come.

146
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,341
Sure.

147
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,218
Welcome.

148
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,970
This way, please.

149
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,420
DIRECTOR LIM HYUNG-BIN

150
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,307
This way please.

151
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,230
I'm so sorry.

152
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,693
You came alone?

153
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,070
I just got a call from the instructor.

154
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,989
She couldn't make it here.

155
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,211
Choi Shi-an?

156
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,963
The instructor

157
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,507
-has her back?
-Yes.

158
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,928
I heard Shi-an was involved
in an unfortunate matter at school.

159
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,723
The instructor is upset
after she heard what happened.

160
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,685
What a coincidence.

161
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,314
We're looking into the matter.

162
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,524
It'd be great
if you could resolve it fairly.

163
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,360
If you personally take Shi-an's side,

164
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:08,198
then our instructor will be happy
to take on Ji-na as a new student.

165
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,080
Since we're here, shall we talk business?

166
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,519
Ms. Ji.

167
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,355
I brought you some snacks.

168
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,523
Gosh, thank you
for always bringing snacks.

169
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,318
You came right on time. Terrific timing.

170
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,616
Mr. Paik.

171
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,247
-What brings you here?
-I would like to ask you that.

172
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:01,210
Mr. Paik brought
these math puzzles for the kids.

173
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,545
And he's also teaching math.

174
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,840
Hey kids. Snack time.

175
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,802
Enjoy.

176
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,388
I'm doing volunteer work.

177
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,183
Did you get home without
any trouble yesterday?

178
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,852
-Shi-an, I'll get going.
-So soon?

179
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,940
I'll be back.

180
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,318
Why are you leaving so soon?

181
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,488
-Do I make it uncomfortable for you?
-Yes, very.

182
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,116
Let me be clear.

183
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,492
Go on and live your life.

184
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,413
Don't mind with what I do with mine.
Stop showing up at places I go to.

185
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,331
When I shut myself off from the world

186
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,875
and couldn't admit that
I still liked math,

187
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,794
you changed me.

188
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,465
I'd like to do what you did for me.

189
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,512
I almost forgot.
I have something for you. Just a minute.

190
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:04,148
I was going to give it to you
when I saw you again. And here you are.

191
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,571
Don't your feet kill you
when you wear high heels?

192
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,616
You used to wear
comfortable shoes, didn't you?

193
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,828
Take care.

194
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,165
Let's snack together, kids.

195
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,543
Don't eat them all. Leave some for me!

196
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,016
DESTINATION

197
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,809
NO RECORD FOUND

198
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,984
RECENT LOCATIONS

HUSBAND

202
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,834
Yes, Honey.

203
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,961
I'm on my way to the center.

204
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,799
Sure. Don't worry. Okay.

205
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,265
NO MEMORY

206
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,606
Sung Min-joon.

207
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,235
So you're having an affair.

208
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,284
A Math Museum?

209
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,663
Can you get it built
under Paik Seung-yoo's name?

210
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,541
I could do it.

211
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,335
It'll take a lot of work.

212
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,338
It's going to be a landmark
in my educational business.

213
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,756
A national math museum.

214
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,967
You always think big.

215
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,594
I'll talk to the Minister of Education
and get it off the ground.

216
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,557
Isn't Ryu Sung-jae his aide?

217
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,392
Yes. I see Sung-jae now and then.

218
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,978
When I play golf
with the minister, he comes along.

219
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,313
-Is he married?
-I don't think he is.

220
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,150
Because he can't forget Ji Yoon-su?

221
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,653
That was four years ago. Come on.

222
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:19,032
Let me see.
I'll set up an appointment now.

223
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,306
Can you reserve a group of three
at Western Cape Country Club?

224
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,226
-With who?
-Minister Shin

225
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,479
and Senator Sung Min-joon.

226
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,398
-I'll take care of it.
-Thanks.

227
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,161
Here are the first-choice colleges

228
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,622
picked by the students
in the global class.

229
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,417
Please form a relationship
with the admissions officer in advance.

230
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,753
There's something
I need to tell you first.

231
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:13,837
Go ahead.

232
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,466
Due the Ivy League college
admissions bribery scandal,

233
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,843
it has gotten harder
to bribe admissions officers.

234
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,930
So the commission fee will be quite high.

235
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,432
You don't have to worry about the fees.

236
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,394
There is also the matter
of how to send the money.

237
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,938
It'll have to be done secretly.

238
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,399
I'll explain to you
how we can move the money.

239
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,860
Just follow this method.

240
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,404
First, set up a foundation.

241
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:44,243
A non-profit organization
that helps needy students.

242
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,494
You mean a scholarship fund?

243
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,956
I'll make sure that the MOE
will approve your non-profit.

244
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,667
So just prepare the necessary papers.

245
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,793
NOH JUNG-AH 4

246
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,379
The non-profit will launder
the consulting fee payments.

247
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,923
The school parents will make donations.

248
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:02,970
That'll be used to bribe admissions
officers in the form of a donation.

249
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,682
-Good morning.
-Hi.

250
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:13,021
Mr. Paik, the principal
would like to see you.

251
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,982
-Yes, I was just about to…
-No,

252
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,025
alone.

253
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,237
Okay.

254
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,740
Is this about the open classroom incident?

255
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,326
Did you hear how it'll be taken care of?

256
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,541
The principal will make her decision.
So mind your own business.

257
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,752
How can I not care about it
when Mr. Paik is a teacher

258
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,337
in our math department?

259
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,423
If you care so much,

260
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:43,135
then why didn't you prevent this
from happening in the first place?

261
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,473
Is this my fault?
Did I cause this problem?

262
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:54,604
Hello? This is the Asung Academy
of Mathematics and Arts.

263
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,065
What?

264
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,804
Ji-na confessed to plagiarizing

265
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,601
Shi-an's speech and asked for forgiveness.

266
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,857
As her mother,

267
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,276
I'm very sorry this happened.

268
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,656
She got excited
about being involved in your project.

269
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,366
And her enthusiasm got out of hand.

270
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,369
Since the assignment wasn't going
to be included in their grades,

271
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,915
I hope you could forgive her.

272
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,708
I will drop Ji-na from my project.

273
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,587
The project involves
the next paper I'm preparing.

274
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,132
So I choose who will assist me on it.

275
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,718
If you disagree,

276
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,554
then I'll have to pursue

277
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,307
the math museum on my own.

278
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,976
I'll leave the school
and the students too.

279
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,272
I'm so shortsighted.

280
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,817
Yes, it's your decision to make. However…

281
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,614
To make amends, we'll use all our
resources to support your project.

282
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,286
We'll be establishing a math museum
launch committee this week. You've heard?

283
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,957
-Yes.
-We're counting on you, Mr. Paik.

284
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,097
We've got a serious problem.

285
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,559
I just got a call
from the Office of Education.

286
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,018
-Office of Education?
-Yes.

287
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,522
I think it's because of this.

288
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,442

JUNG-AH

292
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,681
-Hello?
-Hey! Why did you do this?

293
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,057
It's not me.

294
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,394
Think about it. Why would I talk to her?
That would look so obvious.

295
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:42,355
-Then who's behind this?
-You're asking me who did this?

296
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,864
SENATOR SUNG MIN-JOON

297
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,492
-Yes?
-I saw the article.

298
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,077
I just talked with someone
at the Office of Education.

299
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,204
What did they say?

300
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,334
They said they'll audit the academy.

301
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:07,505
Find out who'll be participating
in the audit and how many they'll send.

302
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,272
-Did you call for me?
-Sit down.

303
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,279
Kim Ji-na admitted to plagiarizing.
I dropped her from the project.

304
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,906
Really?

305
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,325
How did you do it?

306
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,036
You don't need to know.

307
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,081
Mr. Paik.

308
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,586
Thank you for taking my side.

309
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,630
I wasn't taking your side.

310
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,175
I checked the library CCTV
and took disciplinary action accordingly.

311
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,929
But I'm still grateful.
Because I feel like you believed me.

312
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,607
So you're kicked off the project
while Shi-an is staying on?

313
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,776
Did you really plagiarize her speech?

314
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:11,778
That damn girl. Shi-an.

315
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,905
Move it!

316
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,996
What's going on between you and Seung-yoo?

317
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,206
Why is he taking your side?

318
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,709
Don't call him by his first name.
It's Mr. Paik.

319
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,545
You don't show any respect or manners.

320
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,213
Don't lecture me.

321
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,132
-Hey.
-Shi-an.

322
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,385
Hey!

323
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,513
I know you don't like me,
but I don't cause trouble to anyone

324
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:41,308
and I surely didn't plagiarize
someone else's speech.

325
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,686
You saw what happens if you mess with me.

326
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,855
So watch out.

327
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,699
Allegedly, certain students
were given relatively easier questions

328
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,160
to answer in the admissions process
at Asung Academy.

329
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,038
There is evidence
supporting this allegation.

330
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,664
An audit?

331
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,417
What on earth is happening?

332
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,419
It'll be such a headache.

333
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,671
We'll have to hand over files
to the auditors.

334
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,300
Teachers involved in the admissions
process will have a tough time.

335
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,968
The officers will pepper them
with questions.

336
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,178
It'll be chaotic.

337
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,348
Director Han, didn't you also work
on the admissions process?

338
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,724
-What's it to you?
-Well…

339
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,393
It looks like you'll be busy.

340
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,688
Because you're talking about it
in whispered tones,

341
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,358
you're bringing down morale.

342
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:35,779
Don't let the audit affect you.
Just work as usual.

343
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,238
As usual!

344
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,707
Now, the Office of Education
will conduct a special audit.

345
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,044
However, the parents of the students
who were given special treatment

346
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,296
are high-ranking officials,
and this is creating an uproar.

347
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,785
-What happened?
-I resolved the matter involving Shi-an.

348
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,081
Principal Noh acknowledged rather easily
and admitted Ji-na lied.

349
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,541
How did you pull it off?

350
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,418
I want to know what you did first.

351
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,336
Are you the whistleblower?

352
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,256
I'm going to reveal all their wrongdoings.

353
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,218
Eventually, the truth behind the incident
four years ago will surface too.

354
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,013
-And who was behind it…
-You think you can uncover the truth?

355
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,474
If it were that easy,
why couldn't I do it?

356
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,936
Then tell me what you're trying to do.

357
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,940
Tell me now.
It's driving me crazy. I have to know.

358
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,277
I'm going to expose them.

359
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,906
Not what they did in the past,
but what they're currently doing.

360
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,368
I'm going to do to them
what they did to me.

361
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,288
Let's work together then.

362
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,208
I told you to go on living your life
and forget the past.

363
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,710
How can I forget what happened?

364
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,006
I haven't forgotten any of it.

365
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,468
The more I think about it,
the more helpless I feel.

366
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,219
Why didn't I do anything?

367
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,804
Why couldn't I protect you?

368
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,474
I'll do what has to be done.

369
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,769
I'll confront the people
who need to be dealt with.

370
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,813
I'm not working together with you.

371
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,734
In my plan, I didn't factor in
that you would return.

372
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,698
So you might ruin it.

373
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,399
-Welcome…
-Welcome…

374
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,574
I thought I told you not to come here.

375
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,159
I didn't want to come actually.

376
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,079
But my son likes the macarons you sell.

377
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,706
Please.

378
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,294
-How many?
-Twelve macarons. Please.

379
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,637
Mr. Paik Seung-yoo

380
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,723
is building a museum, you know.

381
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,892
A museum?

382
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,435
What kind of museum?

383
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,104
A National Math Museum.

384
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,566
-You've seen him?
-What?

385
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,860
-My son.
-Oh, yes.

386
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,528
I saw him.

387
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,073
He looked radiant.
Quite a young gentleman.

388
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,342
-Mr. Paik Min-shik.
-Yes, that'll be me.

389
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,052
Okay.

390
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,388
TO: PAIK MIN-SHIK

391
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,639
FROM: ASUNG ACADEMY
OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTS

392
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,142
Asung Academy of Mathematics and Arts.

393
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,693
What is it?

394
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,487
Honey, Seung-yoo sent…

395
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,114
Seung-yoo sent what?

396
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,867
He sent us his paper.

397
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,456
Look at this.

398
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,480
Hey, Dad.

399
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,121
That's not it.

400
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,166
Okay. I won't touch it.

401
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,337
Would you like to go outside?

402
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,465
Dad.

403
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:53,638
You played chess with Shi-an and had fun.

404
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:58,226
And you're chatty around Seung-yoo too.

405
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,603
But why are you so cold towards me?

406
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,400
Because I held a grudge against you?

407
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,905
You're right. I did.

408
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,451
You missed my middle school
and high school graduations.

409
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,747
You didn't even show up
on my first day of college.

410
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,292
You were always home

411
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,129
and busy working on the math proof.

412
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,468
Even when mom passed away.

413
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,521
Sorry, Dad. I don't know why I said that.

414
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,399
I don't feel resentful anymore.

415
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,495
You still work on problems every day.

416
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,497
So math is still fun?

417
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,588
What proof are you working on?

418
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,634
What are you working on?

419
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,347
Dad, I…

420
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:27,356
no longer solve math problems.

421
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,655
I used to like problems

422
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:38,117
that were unsolvable.

423
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,873
But I don't get excited anymore
when I see a problem.

424
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,709
It's no longer interesting.

425
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,213
I don't even have the urge to work on it.

426
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,592
I stopped

427
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,220
being a mathematician.

428
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,473
Everyone goes through that.

429
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,479
You stop getting excited over a problem.

430
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,858
It's not fun
and you don't want to tackle it.

431
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,735
That happens.

432
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,950
All mathematicians go through that.

433
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,036
A mathematician
who doesn't face such struggles

434
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,997
cannot go on and solve the next problem.

435
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,661
Will you come to Gyu-young's
housewarming party?

436
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,080
LEE HYUN-JAE

437
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,401
MS. JI YOON-SU

438
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,163
-That's cute.
-So-jung, you always look cute.

439
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,123
-Really?
-What the? Get out of the frame.

440
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,125
Could you guys stop it?

441
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,628
I'll show you pictures of us at the sauna.

442
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,671
-Need any help?
-That made me shudder.

443
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,091
-Hyung-do, I'm not your friend anymore.
-Okay. At last. Thanks a lot. Yes!

444
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,052
-Let me see.
-Here.

445
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,679
-You two are inseparable.
-If you're envious, find a girlfriend.

446
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,514
Here's the bread.

447
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,975
Hey, let's take a selfie together.

448
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,645
With you? No way.
Someone might get the wrong idea.

449
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,772
Wrong idea? Who is that someone?

450
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,649
It's Seung-yoo!

451
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,526
What took you so long?

452
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,946
Hey, come on. Hurry.

453
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,697
Since he's here, let's eat.

454
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,243
-Hi.
-Hey.

455
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,161
Sit with us.

456
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,957
How long have you been dating?

457
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,084
-About 30 days?
-About that long.

458
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,336
What attracted you to him?

459
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,005
-We finished this bottle already.
-Are you okay? You're drunk?

460
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,674
-No, I'm not drunk.
-Who am I?

461
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,592
I'll go to the store and buy some more.

462
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,843
Need anything else?

463
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,637
-You're going with her?
-Yes, why not?

464
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,223
-Wine and ice cream.
-I'll be back. Keep eating.

465
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,183
-Get back soon.
-Hurry.

466
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,477
Could you guys hurry?

467
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,319
Let me.

468
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,869
Let's sit on the bench for a minute.

469
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,136
Is it awkward to be around me?

470
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,179
What?

471
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,515
I'd like to get along with you.

472
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:50,161
-Get along? What do you mean by that?
-I'd like to be your friend.

473
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,122
And forget the past.

474
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,125
What past?

475
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,672
The photo taken at Jeju Airport.

476
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,091
You took it, right?

477
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,636
You were in Jeju, attending a symposium.

478
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,478
Then,

479
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,857
why would you want to be my friend?

480
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,736
Don't you hate me for it?

481
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,156
You had a crush on Ms. Ji.

482
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,035
-And she had to quit because--
-You probably had your reasons.

483
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,664
I don't think you did it
without a good reason.

484
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,174
Actually…

485
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,510
At the time…

486
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,979
Why are you crying?

487
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,025
Let's go.

488
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,166
Do you like Ye-lin now?

489
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:20,960
Does it matter to you?

490
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,132
No,

491
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,009
it doesn't.

492
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,771
Coming?

493
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,150
I have to make a call. Go ahead.

494
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,586
Gyu-young is having a housewarming party
and he invited me.

495
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,380
Why were you waiting in your car?

496
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,634
-You don't want to be around me?
-That's not the reason.

497
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:15,139
I don't want my plan to be ruined
by having my identity exposed. That's all.

498
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,972
-And you?
-How did you do this?

499
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:00,226
-Ye-lin and Seung-yoo bought this.
-Really?

500
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,395
Where is my brilliant friend, Seung-yoo?

501
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,022
He said he had to make a call.

502
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,068
Why did you leave first?

503
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,071
Who was Seung-yoo with a moment ago?

504
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,405
With whom?

505
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,366
I didn't see anyone.

506
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,912
What were you talking
about with Seung-yoo?

507
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,414
It's nothing.

508
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,460
I saw you crying.

509
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,337
Why would you cry if it's nothing?

510
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,465
It doesn't matter to you.

511
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,592
Gyu-young!

512
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,761
Didn't you tell me
that you saw Ms. Ji Yoon-su?

513
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,430
You saw her? Where?

514
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,810
-Sorry.
-My friend is back. Seung-yoo.

515
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,270
-Dig in.
-Okay.

516
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,942
You're single, right?
You want to go on a blind date?

517
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,945
There are a lot of girls
who would like to meet you.

518
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,197
-What about me?
-Wait. Me first.

519
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,199
Would you like to meet a few?

520
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,869
I like someone.

521
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,997
-Oh, my.
-Since when?

522
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,915
Without telling us? Who?

523
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,792
Someone.

524
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:20,180
I like her even more
after not seeing her for a long time.

525
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,557
What the?

526
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,017
Wait.

527
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,644
Do we also know her?

528
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,898
So you were reunited with her
after a long time passed?

529
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,276
It can't be…

530
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,447
Is it me?

531
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:38,991
Hey.

532
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,826
It's not you, okay?

533
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,663
I'm just kidding, man.
It was for the laughs.

534
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,624
Cute joke.

535
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,666
PAIK SEUNG-YOO

536
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,168
A 3-sphere?

537
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,380
A 3-sphere.

538
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,675
People might assume you wrote the paper.

539
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,511
Can you understand it
by looking up the terms?

540
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,930
I couldn't understand any of it.

541
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,939
During the audit,
Senior officer Shim Sang-wook

542
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,484
will be the person you'll want to talk to.

543
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,196
He especially likes this wine.

544
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,657
I'll make sure he gets this.

545
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,952
I have all the documents prepared.
We removed the original copies, of course.

546
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,788
Good job.

547
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,499
Give them all the documentation
they request.

548
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,376
It'll be best to cooperate with them.

549
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,710
All right.

550
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,431
-Thank you.
-Have a good day.

551
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:51,855
How is the approval coming along
for the non-profit foundation?

552
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,191
It'll be approved soon.

553
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,653
Have the foundation prepare
a small scholarship ceremony.

554
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,863
I've already chosen
a student to receive it.

555
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,827
Aren't you taking on too much work?

556
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:08,205
The museum project
itself is a big project.

557
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:11,250
Senator, you need to think big.

558
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,420
You'll become the majority leader
of the party soon.

559
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,381
And you have your sights
on the highest office in the nation.

560
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,092
See you.

561
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,928
After the audit is finished,
let's enjoy some wine too.

562
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:29,601
Oh my goodness.
Principal Noh with Senator Sung?

563
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,187
What is going on?

564
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,858
Why did she touch his jacket like that?

565
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,075
Yes, Mr. Lim?

566
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,411
Ji-na will have her orientation
at 6 p.m. today.

567
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:50,247
I'll make sure she won't be late.

568
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:54,501
And thanks to you
submitting the forms promptly,

569
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,961
the non-profit will be approved soon.

570
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,714
That's great.
You must be preoccupied with the audit.

571
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,550
Don't worry about that.
It's just a small matter.

572
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,011
Yes.

573
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,138
Bye.

574
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,813
Call Choi Shi-an to my office.

575
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,530
I haven't had this in a long time.

576
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,823
Tteokbokki is so good.

577
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:28,368
Your mom won't let you have it
because it'll make you fat, right?

578
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,078
-So enjoy.
-Sure.

579
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,337
-What's the situation like at school?
-It's not good because of the audit.

580
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,589
The teachers try not to show it,
but it's tense.

581
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,554
Your orientation is at 6 p.m.
Don't be late.

582
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,933
I have to go, Aunt.
Can you give me a ride to cram school?

583
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,523
-Thanks for the ride, Aunt.
-Sure. Do well.

584
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,815
Okay.

585
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,720
I've been meaning to see you.

586
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,640
But I was caught up
with so many things to do.

587
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,518
-Why me?
-You'll be awarded a scholarship.

588
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,812
It'll cover your school fees.

589
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,649
You're already on a full scholarship.
This is another one.

590
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,900
It's so sudden.

591
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,361
How long have you been
going to the math clinic?

592
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,574
How did you get to know the instructor?

593
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,535
I don't know…

594
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,538
That cram school is very exclusive

595
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,708
and it's difficult to get into
no matter how much money they offer.

596
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:03,338
I'm curious how someone
like you cozied up to the instructor.

597
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,050
You're not in any relationship, are you?

598
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,927
The instructor is a woman.

599
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,766
She's single

600
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,395
and doesn't have any kids.
So she showers you with attention?

601
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,106
If you're done speaking, I think I'll go.

602
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:24,693
She makes a crazy amount of money
but has no time to spend it.

603
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:29,948
To fill the void in her heart,
she chose you as her pet project.

604
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,200
Do you know this?

605
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:36,747
Students like you are a dime a dozen.

606
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,373
So?

607
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,584
So you can be dropped anytime.

608
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,963
Don't trust her too much
and don't act so cocky.

609
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,562
You have to leave
all your belongings outside.

610
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,773
You can only use this pen and notepad.

611
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,608
Why?

612
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,861
We don't allow taking videos, photos,
and voice recording.

613
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,822
Read this non-disclosure agreement.

614
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,784
After you're done reading it,
sign your name.

615
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,702
The instructor will be with you shortly.

616
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:21,833
This is really strict.

617
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,043
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

618
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,294
MUST NOT DISCLOSE TO A 3RD PARTY THAT
YOU ARE ATTENDING THIS MATH ACADEMY

619
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,587
MUST NOT LEND OR SHARE
MATH ACADEMY'S TEXTBOOKS

620
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,605
Hi there.

621
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,694
You look prettier in person.

622
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:54,157
I saw an interesting video
and you were in it.

623
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:55,784
A video?

624
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,593
How did you get this?

625
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,138
Are you a member of
the meditation clinic too?

626
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,016
Why did you show that to me?
What do you want?

627
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,852
Why would you ask that?

628
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,856
-Does it look like I'm threatening you?
-Then why are you doing this?

629
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,077
Don't be scared.

630
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,371
I'm not a scary person.

631
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:48,587
I want to know why a pretty girl like you,
who is no different

632
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,089
from other teenage girls,
would behave this way.

633
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,427
Could you open up
about your problems to me?

634
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:01,016
In return,
I'll keep this a secret forever.

635
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,311
Even from my mom?

636
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,147
Of course.

637
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,696
We're prepared for the audit.

638
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,114
What should we do
about the original copies?

639
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,449
Have them destroyed.

640
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,409
Yes, ma'am.

ALLEGATIONS OF BRIBERY CONNECTED
TO COLLEGE ADMISSIONS

643
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:15,841
Are you busy?

644
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,679
-I have time.
-How did it go with Ji-na?

645
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,723
She's smart and learns quickly.

646
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,475
Surprisingly, she has a soft side.

647
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,687
She's Principal Noh's daughter.
Please pay special attention to her.

648
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,356
I will.

649
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,149
Do you have time for dinner?

650
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,068
I'd like to discuss something with you.

651
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:36,987
Sure.

652
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,323
I'm going to find out what I can
about reporter Cho Yoon-ah.

653
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,951
Unless she had hard evidence,

654
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:46,037
the Office of Education
wouldn't have taken such quick action.

655
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,832
I'm not sure about Paik Seung-yoo.

656
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,044
We should get rid of him
after we get what we want.

657
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,547
You're going to the event, right?

658
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,133
Of course. It's the first
official event I'm attending.

659
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,885
You're not attending?

660
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,178
I want to play it safe.

661
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:05,557
Then join us later at the dinner.

662
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,183
The minister will be there.

663
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,894
Okay. See you then.

664
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,568
Let's pull it on the count of three.

665
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:17,736
-Okay.
-Sure.

666
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:21,072
-All right. One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

667
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:24,034
NATIONAL MATH MUSEUM
PROMOTION COMMITTEE CEREMONY

668
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,412
Great job.

669
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,747
Thank you.

670
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:29,664
One, two, three.

671
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,207
-Go!
-Go!

672
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,428
This way.

673
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,313
-Welcome.
-How come you don't age at all?

674
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,023
I'm flattered.

675
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,234
-It's great that the ceremony went well.
-Sure.

676
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,071
If there's any assistance you need,
feel free to call me.

677
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,364
Thank you.

678
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:05,241
A lot of reporters came
to cover the ceremony today

679
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,952
to launch the Math Museum project.

680
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,892
Welcome.

681
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:34,020
The senator and his guests
have already arrived.

682
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,313
I see.

683
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:39,734
The director you had dinner with
before is also in another room.

684
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,404
-Mr. Lim?
-Yes.

685
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,127
-You're here.
-It's been a long time.

686
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,378
How have you been?

687
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,130
I heard you've been appointed
the committee chair.

688
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,757
Yes, it's quite a big responsibility.

689
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,760
The minister will be arriving soon.

690
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,262
Where is Mr. Paik Seung-yoo?

691
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,689
We didn't order this.

692
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:21,234
Principal Noh told us
to serve you this dish

693
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:24,571
-if you were to come here again.
-Really? Thank you.

694
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,742
I had dinner here
with Principal Noh before.

695
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,619
The food was very good,
so I thought I'd treat you here too.

696
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,830
Seems like she had this prepared.

697
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:35,874
Let's eat.

698
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,336
Are you at the Michaena restaurant?

699
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,840
How is Ye-lin?

700
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:44,924
She's fine.

701
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:48,053
She's busy studying lately.

702
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:52,140
Professor Kim in the computer science
department is a friend of mine. I could…

703
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:55,977
Thank you for this delicious dish.
I'm here with the math clinic instructor.

704
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,980
I told her that this was your treat.

705
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,486
ARE YOU AT THE MICHAENA RESTAURANT?

706
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:08,698
Yes.

707
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,180
Enjoy the food.

708
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,768
Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

709
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,486
I'm setting up a scholarship fund.

710
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,115
It'll be a non-profit foundation
that will give student aid

711
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,950
to needy students who are gifted.

712
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,410
-I have to take this call.
-Sure.

713
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,291
-Hello?
-Come out.

714
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,417
What?

715
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,086
Now.

716
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,806
What?

717
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,521
Once the math museum is built,

718
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,732
it'll raise the position of Korea's
education system in the world.

719
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,234
I agree with that.

720
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:34,117
I'll make sure we cover everything.
We'll consult with mathematicians…

721
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,075
What's going on?

722
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,287
I'm having dinner with Principal Noh here.
Senator Sung is also here.

723
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,458
The principal somehow knew
and she was going to your room.

724
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:52,195
Stay still for a moment.

725
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:01,180
Apologize for everything you did.

726
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,098
Isn't that Han Myung-jin?

727
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,601
What if he talks to the authorities
and tells them everything?

728
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:08,146
-Ms. Ji Yoon-su has returned.
-That's how you always handle a matter.

729
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:12,275
You never get your own hands dirty
and make someone else get what you want.

730
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:14,319
You can't get the problem out of your head

731
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,112
and you see it
even if you try hard not to.

732
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,739
Just because your life was destroyed,

733
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:21,200
doesn't give you the right
to ruin Seung-yoo's.

734
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:25,038
The circumstances will drastically change,
now that you've said that.

735
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:30,585
