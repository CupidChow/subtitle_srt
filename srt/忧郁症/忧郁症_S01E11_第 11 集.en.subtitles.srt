1
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:21,396
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,232
You didn't solve it? You couldn’t?

3
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,360
No, I couldn't.

4
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,445
So?

5
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,365
Do I have to work on a problem like this?
What's the point?

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,492
Why are you so angry?

7
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,372
Are you embarrassed that
you couldn't solve a problem like that?

8
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,750
I don't feel those emotions anymore.

9
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,920
What does not solving a problem
have to do with my life?

10
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,047
Does it change anything?

11
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,675
It's just trivial math.

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,470
You wanted to solve it!

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,723
You worked on it for hours

14
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,225
and then came to the library
to find the answer.

15
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,273
You can't get the problem out of your head

16
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,027
and you see it
even if you try hard not to.

17
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,780
Your hand scribbles

18
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,283
possible solutions without even thinking.

19
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,536
We stayed up all night at school once

20
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,705
to solve a problem. It was pure joy.

21
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,367
You don't have to hide your feelings.

22
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,662
You said these words to me.

23
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,708
"Don't shut yourself to others.
Don't hide who you are."

24
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,677
Wait here.

25
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,299
-Are you going?
-Yes.

26
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,177
Let's go together.

27
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,680
Shi-an says she's with the professor.

28
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,601
-Let's pick her up together.
-Go ahead.

29
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,687
Drive safely.

30
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,933
There was another private eye
besides me taking pictures.

31
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,829
-Is this all you have?
-Yes.

32
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,374
Our guy followed them into the library,

33
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,295
but he retreated
when he sensed they noticed him.

34
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,134
You're dismissed.

35
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,762
-What?
-I said you're dismissed!

36
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,890
Okay.

37
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,701
I also heard
you run a very special clinic.

38
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,120
It seems like you hired
a very capable instructor.

39
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,750
Then our instructor will be happy
to take on Ji-na as a new student.

40
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,005
She would like to meet you first.

41
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,799
I'd be happy to meet her.

42
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,884
I'm so sorry.

43
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,221
You came alone?

44
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,974
I just got a call from the instructor.
She couldn't make it here.

45
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,996
I told you that the professor helped me

46
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,541
solve the problem you gave us
and I came up with a brilliant solution.

47
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,959
Would you like to see it?

48
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,711
That's a school assignment.

49
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,213
You can't show it to me before it's due.

50
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,339
That's right.

51
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,383
I'm sorry. I was just excited.

52
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,181
-Say bye.
-Professor, I had a lot of fun today.

53
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,765
Good night.

54
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,185
Wait outside for a while.

55
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,536
MATH INSIDE

56
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,218
Professor.

57
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,263
I won't make excuses
if you get angry with me.

58
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,310
But I like your daughter very much.

59
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,689
I know

60
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,735
you don't think I'm reliable.

61
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,280
But please believe what I say next.

62
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,741
My love for her…

63
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,161
is true.

64
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,457
No margin of error.

65
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,169
No contradictions.

66
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,920
Are you okay?

67
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,964
Let's get out of here.

68
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,531
You're supposed to apologize

69
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,492
after doing something wrong

70
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,411
that destroyed a person's life.

71
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,290
You should admit you were wrong.

72
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,587
If I hadn't used that photo,
what would have happened to you?

73
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,133
I like someone.

74
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,261
I like her even more
after not seeing her for a long time.

75
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,889
The circumstances will drastically change.

76
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,976
I had excluded you until now, you know.

77
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,787
Did you tell Seung-yoo everything?

78
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,705
No.

79
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,415
Why?

80
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,751
Aren't you mad?

81
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,796
He lied to you and used you.

82
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,838
So what?

83
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,175
I once did the same to him.
I lied and used him.

84
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,427
I feel like

85
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,640
he and I are even now.
It's better this way.

86
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:28,354
I wanted to damage his life before.

87
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,774
To bring him down

88
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,652
to my level by scarring him.

89
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,404
That way,

90
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,657
I wouldn't look so pathetic

91
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,662
and insignificant compared to him.

92
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,041
Hey, Ye-lin.

93
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,509
What should I do now?

94
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,012
Where did it all go wrong?

95
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,770
I don't know what to do.

96
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,741
Yes, it's trivial math. It's just math.

97
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,374
-Prepare it right away.
-Okay.

98
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,534
I came, Dad.

99
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,036
Hi.

100
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,454
Turn.

101
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,876
-Dad, you've gotten better.
-I have?

102
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,670
Seems like you practiced.

103
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,888
This seafood was flown here
from Jeju this morning.

104
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,641
I know that white wine goes with seafood.

105
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,144
But I enjoy drinking red wine.

106
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,231
It's perfect to have dry-aged steak.

107
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,732
-Okay.
-Here.

108
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,236
-Try it.
-Sure.

109
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:38,711
You're aware that
there's an empty board seat, right?

110
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,506
The board will decide
which of you to appoint

111
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,884
as a new board member.

112
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,260
That's how it'll be handled.

113
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,429
-Okay, Dad.
-Okay.

114
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,107
How is it going with your boyfriend?

115
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,778
Since you're my precious sister,

116
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,448
I have to keep tabs on your personal life.

117
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:12,036
Does it worry you that Sung-jae
doesn't like you?

118
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,913
I'm worried that he'll use you.

119
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,041
Why do you have to date him?

120
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:21,712
Do you feel like a winner if you marry
a guy who almost married Yoon-su?

121
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,132
You seemed to consider
Yoon-su as competition.

122
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,802
Isn't it you
who finds Yoon-su threatening?

123
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,180
You know she's back, don’t you?

124
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,098
I'll enjoy the spectacle.

125
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,192
Senator, you need to think big.

126
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,903
You'll become the majority leader
of the party soon.

127
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,905
And you have your sights
on the highest office in the nation.

128
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,951
That's clearly Principal Noh's voice.

129
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,828
Why is she being flirty?

130
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,289
See you.

131
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,417
After the audit is finished,
let's enjoy some wine too.

132
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,463
He's talking so sweetly to her.

133
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,679
Are they having an affair?

134
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,145
-What are you doing?
-Oh…

135
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,648
I dropped my lipstick
in your car last time.

136
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,942
I'm in a hurry. Can you come out quickly?

137
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,318
You're going out?

138
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,570
You came home late last night.

139
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,659
Did you know that Ye-lin likes Seung-yoo?

140
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,327
What? Seung-yoo?

141
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,787
Pay more attention to her.

142
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,042
Why does she have to like Seung-yoo?

143
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,378
Wait a minute.

144
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,964
Seung-yoo is a good catch.

145
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,385
He's smart, good-looking,
and has a bright future.

146
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:56,849
What? You saw Senator Sung
with Principal Noh?

147
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,059
Yes, they were together.

148
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,438
They were acting so familiar.

149
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,316
So sweetly.

150
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,361
-Hello, Yoo Hye-mi.
-Hello.

151
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,031
Don't tell anyone.
Gossiping about it could hurt people.

152
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,992
Where should I put this?

153
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,077
You can put it down anywhere.

154
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,787
Here?

155
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,251
-What's it for?
-I thought I'd get one for you too.

156
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,502
Enjoy it.

157
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,548
What? I mean…

158
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,843
-What's the occasion?
-My gosh.

159
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:38,599
My son is coming over for dinner today.
I could treat him to this.

160
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,184
That's nice.

161
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,186
I picked the fresh and big ones.

162
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,687
Enjoy it, Hee-sung.

163
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:50,027
What did you just say? Hee-sung?

164
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:56,950
I should have treated you nicer before.

165
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,952
Better late than never, Hee-sung.

166
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,874
Let's be friends now, Hee-sung.

167
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,959
Well. That's nice.

168
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:13,008
Anyway, thanks for the fruit basket,

169
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,885
Hye-mi.

170
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:26,271
So they were plotting behind our backs.

171
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,026
Let's drop the plan.

172
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,820
Fire Paik Seung-yoo first.

173
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,322
Drive Yoon-su out of Hangok-dong
so that she'll never come back.

174
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,199
-What about the math museum?
-Scrap it.

175
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,493
We have no choice.

176
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,788
There's an empty board seat
in our foundation.

177
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,248
My father will decide

178
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:48,127
whether to appoint me or Yeon-woo
to the board at the next board meeting.

179
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,631
So whoever he picks
will later become his successor?

180
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:57,177
I need Paik Seung-yoo to boost my chances.

181
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,932
VICE-PRINCIPAL CHOI SUNG-HAN

182
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,398
-Yes?
-There's something you need to see.

183
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,317
Choi Shi-an did what?

184
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,528
Okay.

185
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,199
MATH INSIDE, SHARING A PROBLEM
THAT TOOK A WEEK TO SOLVE

186
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,117
CHOI SHI-AN

187
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,996
RESPECT
ARE YOU A MATH MAJOR?

188
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,747
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD
ELEGANT SOLUTION

189
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,125
KEEP SHARING OTHER PROBLEMS YOU'VE SOLVED

190
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,923
I'd like to meet Yoon-su.

191
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,886
Shouldn't I see her at least once?

192
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,222
After that,

193
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,808
I'll think about a way…

194
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,686
to break the two apart.

195
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,829
PAIK SEUNG-YOO

196
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,003
Did you sleep well?

197
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,717
Yes.

198
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,226
You?

199
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,354
Would you like to come to my book signing?

200
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,733

You're so handsome.

206
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,169
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

207
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,421
Nice to meet you. I'm a big fan.

208
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,631
Thank you.

209
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,844
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

210
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,013
-Hello.

212
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,832
I dedicate this book to J,
my math teacher.

213
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,020
-Congratulations.
-When did you get here?

214
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,441
Can you sign this?

215
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,617
Thanks for coming.

216
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,664
Could I get a photo of you together?
It's for the event.

217
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,709
I'm sorry,
but could you delete that photo?

218
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,836
Sure. I'm sorry.

219
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,388
Do you have to leave now?

220
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,892
Why don't you have lunch with me?

221
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,478
You gave me flowers,
so let me treat you to lunch.

222
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,191
-I'll have your order ready soon.
-Sure.

223
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,741
TIME TO PROVE

224
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,662
It's a nice book title.

225
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,333
"Do you like math?"

226
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,044
"No, I don't."

227
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,921
"Try to solve this problem."

228
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,047
"Why should I?"

229
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,592
Here I am today
publishing a book and winning prizes.

230
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,511
I've come a long way.

231
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,930
I knew you'd accomplish something.

232
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,850
Although you said you didn't like math,

233
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,728
you didn't hide that talent of yours.

234
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,439
It's not talent.

235
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,776
Anyone can accomplish

236
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,779
what they want in life if they have

237
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:29,699
one person who believes in them
and gives encouragement.

238
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,040
You'll keep working on proofs, right?

239
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,375
To win another prize?

240
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,336
I hope you'll keep up what you're doing.

241
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,547
Rather than dwell on the past.

242
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,847
Take a photo for me.

243
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,599
Get a shot.

244
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,865
Let's see it.

245
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,709
What are you doing?

246
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,962
Can't you take a selfie together?

247
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,715
I wrote the book
and dedicated it to you, after all.

248
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,467
All right. One, two, three.

249
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:32,888
Another one.

250
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,723
Try to smile.

251
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,893
-Come on.
-Just once.

252
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,398
All right. One, two, three.

253
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,794
Do you still love Yoon-su?

254
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,883
I love who?

255
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,219
What's love?

256
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:16,306
For you and me,
love is more like a conquest.

257
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,725
What are you talking about?

258
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,855
I saw Yoon-su in Hangok-dong.

259
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,150
You already knew, didn't you?

260
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,736
Have you met her?

261
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,491
Do I have to answer that?

262
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,995
Can you give me her number?

263
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,832
In the upcoming board meeting,

264
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,377
my dad will pick either me
or Jung-ah for a board seat.

265
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,672
If Yoon-su is back to settle
a score with Jung-ah,

266
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,092
then I'd like to help her.

267
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,774
Are those shoes comfy?

268
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,278
Yes, they are.

269
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,029
They look good on you.

270
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,241
-Ride safely.
-Thank you for coming.

271
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,368
Me too.

272
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,871
Thanks for the shoes, I mean.

273
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,005
Driving your sports car
gets me out of my funky mood.

274
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,172
I'm glad I can help.

275
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,843
Want to go for a beer?

276
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,011
Sure.

277
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,437
Unbelievable.

278
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,565
You're not getting out?

279
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,118
-Good night.
-Bye.

280
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,953
Hi, Ms. Ji.

281
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,830
Hello.

282
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,207
It's been a long time.

283
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,879
Yes, it has. How have you been?

284
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,964
Good. I also live here.

285
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:17,135
But you two still hang out a lot.

286
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,263
Have you gotten closer
in the last four years?

287
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,807
You haven't changed a bit.

288
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,392
You still speak without thinking.

289
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,813
It was nice seeing you, Gyu-young.
See you around.

290
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,948
Bye.

291
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,766
He's here.

292
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,310
Is it you, Seung-yoo?

293
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,488
Honey.

294
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,494
Welcome.

295
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,332
Mom.

296
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,129
Hi.

297
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,389
Come in.

298
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,309
-You must be hungry.
-Yes.

299
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,064
What is this?

300
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,194
Oh my. It's cheonggukjang.

301
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,905
You like it.

302
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,365
Let me prepare it for you.

303
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:36,274
You know how to cook?
You're all grown up now.

304
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,780
-Have it while it's hot.
-Okay.

305
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,158
Looks delicious. Let's see how it tastes.

306
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,707
Oh, my goodness.

307
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,418
It doesn't give off a strong smell.
It's really good.

308
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,170
It is.

309
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:01,674
Eat a lot. Your mom cooked
all of your favorite dishes.

310
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,551
Here.

311
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:09,933
It's like my birthday.

312
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,020
You could say it is.

313
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,316
I'm as happy as the day you were born.

314
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,736
So come visit us more often, okay?

315
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,698
-I will.
-All right. Let's eat.

316
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,581
Have some dessert.

317
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,417
Macarons? Why did you buy these?

318
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,378
I got them from that cafe. You like them.

319
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,713
Mr. Paik's mother made them herself.

320
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,882
-Mr. Paik's parents own a cafe?
-Yes.

321
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,844
I'm a regular there.
I'm good friends with them.

322
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:52,016
You have to study math hard,
so that you don't embarrass yourself.

323
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,143
Why are we talking about that?

324
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,436
Why you!

325
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,146
Hurry up!

326
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:02,944
Seung-yoo.

327
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:08,032
Ms. Yoo bought these fruits for us.
They're very fresh and sweet.

328
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,743
You can't accept gifts
from school parents, Mom.

329
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:14,873
Well. You see…
She's not exactly a school parent.

330
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,001
We're friends now.

331
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,087
But I'll be more careful in the future.

332
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,340
How long are you going to teach
high school math there?

333
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,801
You're not thinking about
doing it for long, are you?

334
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,889
-Son, I think…
-Gosh. This is sweet.

335
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,559
Honey, try this. Take a bite. Taste it.

336
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,770
Seung-yoo. Have one too.

337
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,939
I'll go peel some more.

338
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,671
Yes, I'm here. I'm on the second floor.

339
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,476
This is a surprise.

340
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,939
You calling me first.
You blew me off last time.

341
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,733
-You're being investigated, right?
-Yes.

342
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,070
Why do you ask? You know of a good lawyer?

343
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,490
Why would I help you?

344
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,827
This investigation
could be damaging to you.

345
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,829
Are you threatening me?

346
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,999
Ye-lin, I was your teacher.

347
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:44,671
-You're very disrespectful.
-Excuse me. Listen carefully.

348
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:49,008
Wagging your tongue about the past
will only get you in hot water.

349
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:53,096
So accept whatever sentence they give you

350
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,181
and don't ever return to the school.

351
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,934
All right.

352
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,020
Let's say I tell them everything.

353
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,274
You think you'll get off scot-free
because you were a minor?

354
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:09,278
You, your dad, your mom, and Principal Noh

355
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,531
are all guilty.

356
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,785
You think I'll go down all by myself?

357
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,287
Just because we're involved,
doesn't mean we're as guilty as you.

358
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,957
-Ye-lin.
-Don't create bigger problems.

359
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,834
I made myself clear.

360
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,879
Are you behind this?

361
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:31,843
Did you tip off the authorities
because I'm a loose end

362
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,303
who knows about
what you did in the past? Is it you?

363
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,722
You still don't get it.

364
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,142
I didn't fire you. Principal Noh did.

365
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,526
TIME TO PROVE

366
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,546
You look good in the photos.

367
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,605
Good night.

368
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,734
Sweet dreams.

369
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,375
It's me, Noh Yeon-woo.
Call me at this number.

370
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,798
I have something to talk
about concerning Principal Noh.

371
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,478
REPORTER CHO YOON-AH

372
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:10,942
Hello?

373
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,778
I'm sorry for calling at this hour.
I found her.

374
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,656
She wouldn't take my calls

375
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,783
but after she read about
Mr. Han Myung-jin's arrest,

376
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,535
she changed her mind.

377
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,287
She agreed to meet. What should we do?

378
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,790
I'll meet with her then.

379
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,834
Thank you for all your hard work.

380
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,427
-I can't believe it.
-Is she crazy?

381
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,637
I'm going to get her.

382
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,223
She claims I plagiarized her work.

383
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,225
There she is.

384
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,768
Hey, Shi-an.

385
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,356
You're such a hypocrite.

386
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:55,194
You accused me of plagiarizing
your assignment. So why did you do it?

387
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,446
What are you talking about?
I have no idea.

388
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,367
You did this, right?

389
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,580
IT'S THE SAME PROOF

390
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,251
IT'S THE SAME PROOF

391
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,639
THEREFORE, K IS THE PERFECT SQUARE NUMBER

392
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,559
CHOI SHI-AN

393
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,731
What is this?

394
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,691
I think they're talking about our school.

395
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,611
A student from our school
posted an assignment

396
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,237
on an online math community.

397
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,408
Mr. Paik, you need to take a look at this.

398
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,412
What?

399
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,874
SPECIALIZED HIGH SCHOOL
STUDENT PLAGIARIZES THESIS?

400
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,172
What? My dad's paper?

401
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,174
I really didn't know.

402
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:02,345
The professor didn't mention his paper.
He just helped me out.

403
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:05,723
Right. If you had known,
you wouldn't have posted it.

404
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,101
Did you talk with Mr. Paik?

405
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,604
-Not yet.
-Choi Shi-an!

406
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,107
The principal would like to see you.

407
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,653
Ms. Ji, let me call you back.

408
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,905
Hurry up!

409
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,754
SHARING A PROBLEM
THAT TOOK A WEEK TO SOLVE

410
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,179
I think I've seen this proof before
in a thesis paper.

411
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,059
It's plagiarized.

412
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,228
The key solution is similar
so it's plagiarism.

413
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,521
Is this plagiarism?

414
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,153
You admit that a professor assisted you
in solving the problem,

415
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,407
but you weren't aware that your solution
was identical to his paper's?

416
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,742
No, I swear I didn't know.

417
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,202
That's your defense.

418
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,329
Can anyone back you up?

419
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,872
Back me up?

420
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,001
The professor is staying at
a nursing home. He can't travel.

421
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:18,212
So the name of this professor is

422
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,423
Ji Hyeon-wook, isn't it?

423
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,551
-Yes.
-And his daughter is Ji Yoon-su.

424
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,804
She's a math instructor
at your cram school

425
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,431
and also your benefactor, right?

426
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,978
She could probably prove
you're telling the truth.

427
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:38,399
Because she's aware
of her dad's frail condition

428
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,276
and your relationship with him.

429
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,945
-But that's…
-You'll have to plead your case.

430
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,697
Otherwise…

431
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,453
Using my authority as the principal,

432
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,998
I might have to take disciplinary
action if it turns out that

433
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,042
you have harmed
the reputation of Asung Academy

434
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,669
by committing plagiarism,
which would entail withdrawing

435
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,340
your scholarship in addition
to being suspended or expelled.

436
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,011
Hello?

437
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,721
I heard what happened to Shi-an.

438
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,973
I'm on my way
to see the principal right now.

439
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,267
I knew that the professor helped her,
but I didn't foresee this.

440
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,812
Neither Shi-an nor my dad could've known
that people would accuse her like this.

441
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:17,730
Accuse her?

442
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:21,984
I have a feeling
that Principal Noh knows everything.

443
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,613
She knows I'm back in Hangok-dong
and teaching Shi-an.

444
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,032
That's why she's making
this into a big deal.

445
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,700
I'll talk to her.

446
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,125
Let's go.

447
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,922
She's expecting you.

448
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,687
Shi-an didn't intentionally copy
the thesis paper,

449
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,024
but I'll give her an F
for not disclosing her source material.

450
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,485
Do as you please.

451
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,404
Is that all?

452
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,492
What else do you want?

453
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,667
You have a class to teach, don't you?

454
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,710
PAIK SEUNG-YOO

455
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,798
I told the principal
I would give Shi-an an F.

456
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,883
I'll call you if anything else comes up.

457
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,388
I'm really sorry to ask you this.

458
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,058
But can you come to my school right now?

459
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,712
Welcome, Ms. Ji.

460
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,510
Have a seat.

461
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,016
It's been a long time.

462
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,186
How have you been?

463
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,527
Wow.

464
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,156
I never imagined
we'd meet again like this.

465
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,951
You heard the requirement?

466
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:21,330
You asked for a doctor's note
from the nursing home as proof

467
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:26,126
that my dad, Professor Ji Hyeon-wook,
can't come in person to defend Shi-an.

468
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,128
-Did you bring it?
-No.

469
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,341
You already made your decision.

470
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:36,220
Even if I brought the doctor's note,
you would still frame her as being guilty.

471
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,604
So you know me very well, Ms. Ji.

472
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,276
Why did you do it then?

473
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,696
You shouldn't have brought
my daughter into this.

474
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:59,994
How awkward is this
after not seeing each other for so long.

475
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,707
But there is one good outcome.

476
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:06,959
I guess

477
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:11,088
you haven't changed at all
in how you react.

478
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:16,010
You came straight here
when Shi-an told you she was in trouble.

479
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,636
You're quite predictable.

480
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,932
If you came back to settle a score,

481
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,603
you shouldn't have kept it close.

482
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,481
Someone precious that you want to protect.

483
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,358
Like Shi-an

484
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,445
and Paik Seung-yoo.

485
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:42,202
It's quite fortunate for me
that they're precious to you.

486
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,214
I thought I was the only one scared.

487
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:57,801
You seem…

488
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,473
to be scared too.

489
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:09,063
Your feeble attempts to threaten me
by bringing up Shi-an and Seung-yoo.

490
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,982
I'm amused.

491
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,740
Do you know your daughter well?

492
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,037
She needs better
parental guidance, you know.

493
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,581
I mean her kleptomania.

494
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,211
Ms. Ji Yoon-su came to the school.

495
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,380
Ms. Ji? Really?

496
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,091
Yes, I saw her in the hallway.

497
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,677
-The math teacher from four years ago?
-What's going on?

498
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,013
Even if Ji-na doesn't sign up
for my math clinic,

499
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,392
I'm planning to keep an eye on her.

500
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:53,357
There's no guarantee
that she won't turn out like Ye-lin.

501
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,277
By the way,

502
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,906
there's one more thing
that's precious to you like Ji-na.

503
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,536
It's Asung Academy.

504
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,792
This place

505
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,838
has become palatial and very grand.

506
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,052
I'll see you around then.

507
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,569
You have no intentions
of apologizing, do you?

508
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,494
I will.

509
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,519
If my apology can alleviate

510
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,899
the pain and anguish
you suffered for four years,

511
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,028
which were like hell for you,

512
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,908
then I'll apologize
and do anything else you ask.

513
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,210
But it's meaningless, though.

514
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,718
You act like you're superior
and different from me.

515
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,221
But we're not different, after all.

516
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,765
But…

517
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,757
When did you get here?
Did you meet with Principal Noh?

518
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,844
Why did you come without telling me?

519
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,138
Can't you just trust me
and let me handle this?

520
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,558
I did the right thing by coming here.

521
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,478
It was very stimulating.

522
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,709
NATIONAL MATH MUSEUM LAUNCH COMMITTEE
AND ASUNG ACADEMY OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTS

523
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,377
Prepare a speech.

524
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,381
We're having a signing ceremony with the
National Math Museum launch committee,

525
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,216
and it has to go well.

526
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,595
If that's the reason you're working
as a teacher at our school.

527
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,477
Sure.

528
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,730
I'll try my best.

529
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:24,568
You're controlling yourself quite well.
Even though you must have a lot to say.

530
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,321
Does it look like I'm controlling myself?

531
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,826
I'll see you at the ceremony.

532
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:12,407
You can't go in without an appointment.

533
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,455
It's fine. You can go.

534
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,051
Why didn't you call ahead?

535
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,719
You can't come like this.

536
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,976
Did you meet Principal Noh earlier?

537
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,688
What damning evidence do you have?

538
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,192
Show me everything you've got.

539
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,487
She drove to
the international middle school?

540
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,406
Yes. She went straight there.

541
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,535
Bring me the accounting report

542
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,287
for Asung Academy
that we'll present to the board.

543
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,747
I need to check it again.

544
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,332
Yes, ma'am.

545
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:14,928
I've collected a lot of dirt
on my sister over the past four years.

546
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,347
Evidence of bribery and so on.

547
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,642
But my dad will not consider it bribery

548
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,728
if it was done
to grow the Asung Foundation

549
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,563
So?

550
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,773
If I attack her with it,
it'll bring shame to the family.

551
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,859
And my dad would turn against me.

552
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:34,239
But there is one matter
that could sway my dad to fire her.

553
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,617
It's my dad's money.

554
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:42,080
If she took any money or moved
any funds secretly, that'll be serious.

555
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,211
I heard that my sister
and the director of your cram school

556
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,589
created a scholarship fund together.

557
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,550
How did you know that?

558
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,137
Sung-jae told me.

559
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,808
They submitted an application
to the MOE for approval.

560
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,104
Did he give you my number?

561
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,231
I didn't know you knew him.

562
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,819
After you two broke up,
we've been seeing each other.

563
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,157
Sung-jae and I share the same goal.

564
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,994
He wants to get revenge against
Jung-ah for wrecking his wedding.

565
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,662
So

566
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:25,791
what do you want from me?

567
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,090
-Hello?
-Hi, Ms. Ji.

568
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:39,471
I'm so sorry.
I put you in a difficult spot, didn't I?

569
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,308
-Where are you? At the cram school?
-No.

570
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,395
I went in,

571
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,650
but they told me to never come back.

572
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:56,947
They said they won't waive my fees
because of the trouble I caused.

573
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,115
What?

574
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,870
Ms. Ji Yoon-su was plotting?

575
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,832
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.

576
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:10,210
So she planned this all along?

577
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,545
Yes, that's right.

578
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:15,882
She was using you to deal a blow to me.

579
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,427
Come in.

580
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,054
Hello, Director.

581
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,765
Hello, Ms. Ji.

582
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,768
You've talked to Principal Noh, I presume.

583
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:31,982
Looks like she told you a lot about me.

584
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:33,900
It's true

585
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,988
that I dislike her greatly.

586
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,868
I can see your discomfort
in continuing to have me around here.

587
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,495
That's why I came to tell you this.

588
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,958
Always be wary about
whatever deals you do with Principal Noh.

589
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,420
She always takes steps

590
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:56,298
to make her business partner take
the fall if things go south.

591
00:52:58,216 --> 00:52:59,968
So I advise you to have a backup plan.

592
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:04,347
And I can be of help
in providing you with backup.

593
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,351
Think about it and give me a call.

594
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:30,415
Hello. Are you Ms. Park Hye-young?

595
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,375
Yes.

596
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,962
I merely followed
Mr. Han Myung-jin's orders.

597
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,173
-Ms. Park.
-Yes?

598
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,427
Could you put these answer sheets
in the right envelopes?

599
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,595
Sure.

600
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,473
2017 MIDTERM EXAM FOR THE 2ND TERM
11TH GRADE MATH ANSWER SHEET

601
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,058
I was fired unfairly.

602
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,437
Mr. Han fired me because he thought
I could be a liability to him.

603
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,734
I want one thing.

604
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:01,738
And that's to take
Asung Academy away from her.

605
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,822
Me, too.

606
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,574
Though there's no guarantee
I'll replace her.

607
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,159
I'm not interested in that.

608
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,870
I'll call you after I think about it.

609
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,957
So you've changed.

610
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,126
When we went to high school together,

611
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:19,172
you didn't back down
from your principles, like I did.

612
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:24,928
It makes you quite uncomfortable
when there's someone in your class

613
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,305
who has steadfast beliefs.

614
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,307
Like a splinter lodged in your foot.

615
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,811
I suppose Sung-jae felt
that way around you too.

616
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,941
Why do I matter
in your relationship with him?

617
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,245
Did you wait long?

618
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,455
It's okay.

619
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,958
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

620
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,376
What will you have?

621
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,795
Can I take your order?

622
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,923
-Two bowls of sundubu-jjigae.
-Okay.

623
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,637
It was a tough day today, wasn't it?

624
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:23,987
Shi-an.

625
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,574
Promise me one thing.

626
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:33,163
School might get tough from here on out.

627
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,916
Don't tolerate it.

628
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,377
Don't try to deal with it alone.

629
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,797
You have to come and tell me, okay?

630
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,424
Okay, Ms. Ji.

631
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:49,512
Instead of coming to the cram school,
let's do our lessons somewhere else.

632
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:51,848
Okay.

633
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:08,740
We need to talk.

634
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,283
Go ahead.

635
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:12,952
Hand over all the evidence
you've collected concerning that day.

636
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,079
No.

637
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,915
Give me whatever you have. Everything.

638
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,044
I'm going to find another way
without your help.

639
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:21,961
Another way?

640
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,172
Principal Noh knows what we're doing.

641
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,216
She's going to keep an eye on us.
So teaming up won't help.

642
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:29,010
Can't you see that's exactly
what they want us to do?

643
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,013
They want us to go separate ways.

644
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,974
I'll give them what they want then.

645
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,185
What's wrong?
Are you already getting weak?

646
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,978
Or are you afraid?

647
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,147
Something became clear
after I talked to Principal Noh.

648
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,857
I'm not handing over what I've got.

649
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,193
And I'm going to handle this myself.

650
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:15,056
You act like you're superior
and different from me.

651
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,017
But we're not different, after all.

652
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,686
But…

653
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,232
Paik Seung-yoo is a different matter.

654
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,986
Wouldn't it be a waste to ruin
his reputation now?

655
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,450
Why do you look so shocked?

656
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:37,454
You've seen it before.
The photo of you two at the airport.

657
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,675
NATIONAL MATH MUSEUM LAUNCH COMMITTEE
AND ASUNG ACADEMY OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTS

658
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:51,926
MOU SIGNING CEREMONY

659
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:09,903
-Who's going to the ceremony tonight?
-All the mentors are supposed to be there.

660
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,905
I'll be attending after I finish tutoring.

661
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,495
Me too.

662
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,717
I heard about the plan.

663
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,804
Are you serious about it?

664
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,391
I'm contemplating it.

665
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,106
In my life,

666
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:32,819
that was the first time that
someone did serious damage to me.

667
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,906
It wasn't a mistake on my part.

668
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:40,410
I couldn't recover

669
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,496
after someone inflicted that wound on me.

670
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,959
For a while, time just froze.

671
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:52,463
I think I'll have to resolve this
for me to stop dwelling in the past.

672
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,924
I hope that'll happen.

673
00:59:57,468 --> 01:00:00,013
There's one condition
before we work together as a team.

674
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,557
Say it.

675
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,478
Seung-yoo stays out of this.

676
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,695
Now I'm curious.

677
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,907
What does Seung-yoo mean to you?

678
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,620
Is he a love interest?

679
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,498
He wasn't before, but now he is?

680
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:30,543
-If we're done talking…
-I'm asking you a question.

681
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,094
- Minister.
-How have you been?

682
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,347
Very good. Senator Sung is here.

683
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,140
-Oh, my. It's been a while, hasn't it?
-Senator Sung.

684
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,308
Minister.

685
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,353
-Hello.
- gosh. Nice to see you.

686
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:49,979
Ms. Yoo.

687
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,775
-Hello.
-You came early.

688
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:54,901
I'm not early.

689
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,698
-Welcome.
-Why isn't Seung-yoo here yet?

690
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,742
I know. He's one of the speakers.

691
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,202
Welcome.

692
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:07,080
I came to attend the ceremony
so why am I doing this work?

693
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,374
It's because they're not doing their jobs.

694
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,833
Hey, Ye-lin.

695
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,377
-Hi.
-You came?

696
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,545
Ye-lin, you look fabulous.

697
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,255
You're getting prettier.

698
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,091
-Wow.
-What?

699
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,468
What? She looks like a celebrity.

700
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,308
The principal is here.

701
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,518
Hello.

702
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,520
Welcome, Minister.

703
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,271
-She looks so glamorous.
-You look beautiful.

704
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,648
Thank you.

705
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,204
Is working with him your "other way"?

706
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:51,916
Now you're teaming up with him?

707
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:54,836
You trust him

708
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,422
more than you trust me?

709
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:06,222
Do you know who worries me
the most right now?

710
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:08,725
It's you.

711
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,062
You drive me crazy, Seung-yoo.

712
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,443
So,

713
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,905
stay out of this and stop worrying me.

714
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,574
Why do I worry you?

715
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,952
What about me drives you crazy?

716
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,038
It's the same with me.

717
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:34,041
Because of you, I got worried sick
and was going crazy.

718
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:37,587
But I knew why it hurt.

719
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:40,923
Search for the reason.

720
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:44,469
What is it that causes you pain
and makes you worry?

721
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:49,724
I went through this four years ago
so I know the reason.

722
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,281
-Hello.
-Hello.

723
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:06,824
Welcome, Minister.

724
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,160
You look so radiant tonight.

725
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:10,745
Thank you. Please be seated.

726
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:13,206
-Minister.
- Senator.

727
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,707
This way.

728
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,334
-Hello.
-Hello.

729
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,253
Seung-yoo isn't here yet.

730
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,339
Do you think he changed his mind?

731
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,466
Let's begin to stay on schedule.

732
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:33,684
I express my sincere thanks
to everyone here at this event

733
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,686
to commemorate the signing
of a cooperative agreement

734
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,730
between the National Math Museum
launch committee

735
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,483
and Asung Academy of Mathematics and Arts.

736
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:44,070
I am Noh Jung-ah, the principal
of Asung Academy.

737
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:56,624
To start off today's ceremony,
we planned to have

738
01:03:56,707 --> 01:04:00,211
math teacher and Lucifer Prize
winner Paik Seung-yoo

739
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:03,923
to explain the purpose of the museum.

740
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,387
There he is.

741
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,314
I'm sorry for being late.

742
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:21,858
You can begin.

743
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,080
Hello, everyone.

744
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:38,791
I'm Paik Seung-yoo,
and I teach math at Asung Academy.

745
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:43,170
I express my sincere gratitude
to the people who have supported

746
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:45,673
establishing the National Math Museum.

747
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:14,493
A math proof is either true or false.
Those are the only two things that matter.

748
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,330
You can't call a math proof
true if it's not.

749
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:20,583
Nor can you call a proof false
when it's true.

750
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,002
Mathematicians cannot lie.

751
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:36,057
What does Seung-yoo mean to you?

752
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,310
Is he a love interest?

753
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,817
However, in the messy world we live in,

754
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,986
sometimes what's false
is considered to be true

755
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:52,615
while what is true
is considered to be false.

756
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,451
That's exactly

757
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,788
what happened here at Asung High,

758
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:01,290
the predecessor of Asung Academy,
four years ago.

759
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,754
There was a rumor about a teacher

760
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:09,632
having an inappropriate relationship
with a student.

761
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,719
This so-called scandal rocked Hangok-dong

762
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,472
and it was sensationalized.

763
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,850
The truth was buried by false claims.

764
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,645
And a false narrative became the truth.

765
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,731
I was at the center

766
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:29,360
of the teacher-student scandal.

767
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,154
I was the high school student.

768
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,716
Search for the reason.

769
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:55,094
What is it that causes you pain
and makes you worry?

770
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:09,043
Why did you have to do this
while putting your reputation on the line?

771
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:11,837
I told you I made up my mind.
I know why I have to do this.

772
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,631
You're picking a fight with me,
aren't you?

773
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:16,050
Principal Noh, prepare yourself
for a fight.

774
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,718
If she's not using you, then what is it?

775
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:19,970
-Did she say she loves you?
-I'm in love with her.

776
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,972
You brought me something very useful.

777
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:23,307
Just wait a little longer.

778
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,476
It'll just be the two of us.

779
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:29,105
Why cannot it appear false
when, in fact, it is true?

780
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,397
I'm scared.

781
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,650
Because I feel like
I'm falling in love with the problem.

782
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:38,197
