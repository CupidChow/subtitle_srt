AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

HANGOK POLICE STATION

3
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,906
-The witness is here.
-Bring him in.

4
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,399
There must have been a mistake.
Mr. Han Myung-jin is our witness.

5
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,450
Mr. Han.

6
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,536
Mr. Han Myung-jin?

7
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,332
Yes. I came to give my witness statement
regarding the cheating scandal

8
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,418
involving Sung Ye-lin.

2017 ACADEMIC AFFAIRS NOTES

10
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,530
Ye-lin's mother asked me
for the answer sheet to the math test.

11
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,825
But I told Noh, who was a director
at the time, that I turned her down

12
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,286
to which she told me to give it to her.

13
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,039
-Give her the answer sheet.
-But Director…

14
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,082
But…

15
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:10,255
leave me out of this.
I didn't see nor hear anything.

16
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:14,717
The solution that Sung Ye-lin gave
for problem no. 4 on the math test

17
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,471
was identical to the wrong answer on
the answer sheet before it was corrected.

18
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,390
I raised this matter with the school,

19
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,725
and a school committee
opened a hearing afterward.

20
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,519
But…

21
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,233
First of all,

22
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,444
I would like to apologize.

23
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:37,699
Noh Jung-ah ordered me to look
at every math problem with a fine comb

24
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,327
to find any minor errors
in order to invalidate the entire exam

25
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,871
so that it could be retaken.

26
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,248
But the school didn't re-administer
the exam.

27
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,041
Because a student found a solution

28
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,587
to the "flawed" math problem
that the school flagged

29
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,423
by using a novel method.

30
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:59,012
The minutes of the school committee
hearing are in this notebook.

31
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,514
Details about the exam are all in there.

32
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,185
The school director ordered the exam
and answer sheets to be shredded.

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,897
Who wrote down these minutes?

34
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,356
Did you do it yourself?

35
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,816
No.

36
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,318
Then where did you get this?

37
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,322
2017 ACADEMIC AFFAIRS NOTES

38
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,671
-Hello?
-This is Ji Yoon-su.

39
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,523
How have you been, Mr. Choi?

40
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,319
Why did you want to see me?

41
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:01,616
Paik Seung-yoo told me something
about what you do.

42
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,835
Seung-yoo said he suspects that
you collect Asung school records.

43
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,255
Are you trying to blackmail me?

44
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,300
If I don't hand over those records,
you'll report me?

45
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,388
I don't know
what is in those school records.

46
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,722
Only you would know.

47
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,936
I do believe you were worried
about what you were doing though.

48
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,940
Isn't that's why you kept records
without telling Principal Noh?

49
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,986
You are worried if the school was exposed.

50
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:42,240
In that case, you probably feared
you'd be fired like Mr. Han.

51
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,161
How dare you think of becoming
the principal of this academy!

52
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,540
Your job is doing my errands
for some chump change.

53
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,045
What do you want?

54
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,215
If you have any school records

55
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,176
that can reveal the truth,
please give them to me.

56
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:07,015
Then you don't need to come forward
as a witness. I'll do it instead.

57
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,270
I can't reveal my source.

58
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,689
How can we trust the evidence
when the source is anonymous?

59
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,732
Exactly.

60
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,901
Will that even be allowed
as evidence in court?

61
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,738
Senator Sung knew the answer sheet
was leaked to his daughter.

62
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,615
His wife, Yoo Hye-mi, came
and told me her husband found out

63
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,409
and that she had to cover it up.

64
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,453
I knew nothing about it!

65
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:32,040
I didn't hear or know anything about
the answer sheet being leaked.

66
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,460
The senator and principal pulled a stunt
at Ms. Ji's wedding to frame her

67
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,047
for having an inappropriate relationship
with her student

68
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,341
to cover up the school cheating scandal.

69
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,428
I understand.
Since new evidence has surfaced,

70
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,473
we'll schedule another questioning
after we analyze the notebook.

71
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,946
So is this the beginning?

72
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,324
I would say we're nearing the end.

73
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,287
Last time we met, you said that
we were no different from each other.

74
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,623
Yes. So what?

75
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,167
That lingered in my mind.

76
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,920
You're right.

77
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,756
I was going to do exactly
what you did to me.

78
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,635
If your intent is to destroy
someone's life, then live like that.

79
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,096
Use any means necessary like you did…

80
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,389
However,

81
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:37,021
if you have something to protect,
then you shouldn't act like that.

82
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:44,737
So you think
you can do things differently?

83
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,410
I'm more curious
about how this will end for you.

84
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,914
Will you be able to protect
what matters to you?

85
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,438
Thank you for coming, Mr. Han.

86
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,442
Principal Noh came to see me yesterday.

87
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:26,154
Right after meeting her,
my mother's condition deteriorated.

88
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,574
The doctor told me to prepare myself.

89
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,327
When I heard those words,

90
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,665
I asked myself what I was doing this for.

91
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,544
Did I need to keep lying

92
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,922
when my mother was dying?

93
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,552
I know it took a lot of courage
to do what you did.

94
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,096
And you'll need to stay brave.

95
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,557
Thank you.

96
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,103
Mr. Han, follow me.

97
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,002
What? Ji Yoon-su appeared as the witness?

98
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,670
What did she say?

99
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,756
I'll tell you when I get home.
How's Ye-lin?

100
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,092
She's been acting strange.
She's been in her room since morning.

101
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,470
See what she's doing.

102
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,476
MATH CONTEST, SUNG YE-LIN

103
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,855
Ye-lin.

104
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,857
Ye-lin.

105
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,403
Ye-lin, why did you take these out?

106
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,321
Mom.

107
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,282
Do you remember the day
I got this Presidential Award?

108
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,618
What?

109
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,247
Honestly, I wasn't happy at all
when I received this.

110
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,460
It wasn't worth it.
It's just a piece of paper.

111
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,965
Wait! Why are you ripping it up?

112
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,424
-Let go.
-It's a special award.

113
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,468
-Let go!
-Ye-lin.

114
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,263
-Mom, try it. It's fun.
-Ye-lin, what's the matter with you?

115
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,806
Stop acting like that.

116
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,226
Ye-lin, please don't do this to me.

117
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,435
I'm about to go crazy.

118
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,896
-Why are you doing this?
-Mom.

119
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,483
-Ye-lin. Please.
-Mom.

120
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,444
Please don't be like this.

121
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,824
Why did you leave without saying anything?

122
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,036
And why are you here?

123
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,748
-I came to submit evidence.
-Evidence?

124
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,834
I met with Vice Principal Choi Sung-han.

125
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,919
As you suspected,
he kept the school records.

126
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,464
I was going to approach him
when the timing was right.

127
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,217
Why didn't you discuss this with me first?

128
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,969
Your job is done here, Seung-yoo.

129
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,931
Follow your own path and forget this case.

130
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,226
Whether you continue teaching math
or become a mathematician again,

131
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,145
choose whatever you like.

132
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,481
I'll always be rooting for you.

133
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,651
What are you saying?

134
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,864
There's still a lot left to do.

135
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,784
They haven't apologized to you yet.
And they haven't reinstated you, either.

136
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,997
I promised to bring your smile back.
I haven't accomplished those things yet.

137
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,168
You've brought back my smile.

138
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,837
It's thanks to you, Seung-yoo.

139
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,633
So don't worry about me.

140
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,636
I'll go back to being a school teacher.

141
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,888
And I'll teach students again.

142
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:48,022
You're mature and strong enough
to solve any problem without getting hurt.

143
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,361
I told you this before.
That one day, you'd get to that point.

144
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,032
So you keep going on proving.

145
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,246
Not about us, but something
more beautiful and worthwhile.

146
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,377
You can do it.

147
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,726
What did you say?

148
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,687
It's over. I'm not marrying you.

149
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,898
Why don't you want to marry me?

150
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,650
Tell me why you want to marry me.

151
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,528
In the beginning,
we had a mutual partnership.

152
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,447
But I started developing feelings
for you. Is that wrong?

153
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,990
Do you really love me?

154
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,452
You don't just want to show off
to Yoon-su that you have me?

155
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,998
That's true. I do want that.
Is there anything wrong with that?

156
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,918
You think marrying me will prove
anything to Yoon-su?

157
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,088
You really don't get it?

158
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,798
The more you act like this,

159
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,217
the more the both of us
look foolish to her.

160
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,679
Why couldn't you just focus
on the partnership we had?

161
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,392
If you had, we wouldn't be in
this awkward situation.

162
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,028
Did you have dinner?

163
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,158
What? When did you get here?

164
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,953
I'm hungry.

165
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,456
Let's eat together.

166
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,215
I thought you couldn't eat raw fish.

167
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,177
What are you talking about?
It's delicious.

168
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,763
Did you just get dumped?

169
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,349
You're still young.

170
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,644
Arguing with men
and getting dumped after he used you.

171
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,858
Sung-jae was using you all along
to get payback from me

172
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,110
and then reunite with Yoon-su.

173
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,155
You're so naive. So clueless.

174
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,533
You even handed over Asung school
records to Yoon-su for him.

175
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,077
What school records?

176
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,747
It wasn’t you? The academic affairs notes?

177
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,502
-What academic affairs notes?
-You planted a spy.

178
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,754
The former principal, Oh Jin-taek.

179
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,844
Well, you're aware that stealing documents

180
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,555
and breaching privacy laws
is a felony, right?

181
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,934
-Jung-ah.
-What will it be?

182
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,853
Shall we go down to the police station
after we eat this sushi?

183
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,355
That was a long time ago.

184
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,566
I don't know what Principal Oh Jin-taek
is doing or where he is.

185
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,153
What academic affairs notes?
I'm hearing this for the first time.

186
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,703
Then…

187
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,665
how about this?

188
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,792
Tell Dad that the agenda you raised

189
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,419
at the board meeting
was a misunderstanding.

190
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,797
Then,

191
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,261
I'll drop the matter
involving Oh Jin-taek.

192
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,596
What do you say?

193
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,605
Mr. Paik, your book is a good read.

194
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,109
I just finished reading it.
Ms. Ji gave it to me as a present.

195
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,782
You dedicated the book to her, right?
You're both great people.

196
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:33,789
I DEDICATE THIS BOOK TO J, MY MATH TEACHER

197
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,764
HANGOK ART HALL

198
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,316
HANGOK ART HALL

199
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,526
HANGOK POLICE STATION

200
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,944
-Step on it.
-Yes, sir.

201
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,121
We're from Hangok Police Station.

202
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,457
-What are you doing here?
-We have a search warrant.

203
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,958
SEARCH WARRANT

204
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,836
-You brought a search warrant?
-Ms. Yoo, you're a defendant in this case.

205
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,423
-Please cooperate with our investigation.
-What? Me?

206
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,842
-Hold on.
-Oh, my.

207
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,802
-What is she accused of?
-Mr. Han's testimony

208
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,555
contains allegations of bribery
committed by Ms. Yoo.

209
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,391
Let go of me.
Are you arresting me right now?

210
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,268
We're asking for
your voluntary compliance.

211
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,104
If not, we'll bring an arrest warrant
next time. Please comply.

212
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,815
No. Let go of me!

213
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,359
-Honey! Ye-lin!
-Mom.

214
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,694
-What's going to happen?
-Don’t say anything.

215
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,656
-I'll be there soon with a lawyer, okay?
-Let go of me!

216
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,629
-What now, Ye-lin?
-Where's Dad?

217
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,422
He went out to meet the lawyer.

218
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,216
Gosh.

219
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,844
-Are you going to be arrested too?
-Be quiet. Go to your room.

220
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:17,017
It's so nice that you made up
with Yeon-woo.

221
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,772
I'll have the termination matter dropped.

222
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,774
So focus on school operations.

223
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,109
I will, Dad.

224
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,112
What's happening
with the charges against you?

225
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,155
There's nothing to worry about.

226
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,324
-The matter will be over soon.
- I see.

227
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,495
Then I'll need to appoint
a new board member soon.

228
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,622
In the next board meeting,

229
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,251
we'll decide who to appoint to the board.

230
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:43,961
Okay, Dad.

231
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:47,715
It'll be great if Yeon-woo's marriage
to former Minister Ryu's son goes well.

232
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,509
That'd be great, but…

233
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,222
Yeon-woo didn't tell you?

234
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,307
You broke up with Sung-jae?

235
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,564
I don't want to break up with him,
but I have to accept it.

236
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,357
This can't happen.

237
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,736
How could he say such things?

238
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,821
He'd rather marry Yoon-su?

239
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,531
It hurts, Mother.

240
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,118
But what can I do about it?
He can't forget her.

241
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,703
Don't worry.

242
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,122
Sung-jae can't make a decision
like that by himself.

243
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,499
After that incident happened
four years ago,

244
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,752
my husband said he would disown him

245
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,962
if he were to choose any girl
for his wife.

246
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,173
I'll talk to Sung-jae.

247
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,509
So don't worry. Okay?

248
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,095
Okay, Mother.

249
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,638
-It's actress Yoo Hye-mi!
-Hye-mi!

250
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,307
-How are you feeling?
-Yoo Hye-mi!

251
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,060
-Please say something!
-Yoo Hye-mi!

252
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,604
Please tell us how you'll handle
this police investigation.

253
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,230
Did you bribe a teacher?

254
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:49,026
-What is your husband's reaction?
-Please answer the question!

255
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,277
Ms. Yoo!

256
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,873
Ji Yoon-su.

257
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,792
Ji Yoon-su…

258
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,769
SENATOR SUNG MIN-JOON

259
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,149
Why weren't you answering your phone?

260
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,192
What is it?

261
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,155
A search warrant?

262
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,407
Han Myung-jin testified that
my wife bribed him.

263
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,038
And his testimony was corroborated
by the academic affairs notes.

264
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,001
It's better this way.

265
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,294
What?

266
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,548
Now that the bribery scandal has broken,
someone has to take the fall.

267
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,216
You mean my wife should take the fall?

268
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,427
Would you rather have
Ye-lin go to jail then? Think hard.

269
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,223
Don't forget that this scandal

270
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:06,311
is more damaging to Ye-lin
than it is to you or me.

271
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,021
You want me to plead guilty?

272
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,149
The judge will give you
a lighter sentence.

273
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,442
You might even get
a suspended sentence if you're lucky.

274
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,863
You're asking me to
take the blame for everyone?

275
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,948
Do you want Ye-lin to get arrested too?

276
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,702
If you keep denying the allegations
when more evidence surfaces,

277
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,745
it'll put you in a worse situation.

278
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,915
If we limit the scope of the case to you

279
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,751
-and Mr. Han, that will work best.
-What about Principal Noh?

280
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,296
She's behind all of this!

281
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,507
If we implicate Noh Jung-ah,
do you think she won't tattle

282
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,217
on me and Ye-lin?

283
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,886
Gosh.

284
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,349
ACTRESS YOO HYE-MI'S HOUSE IS SEARCHED

285
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,274
ACTRESS YOO HYE-MI'S HOUSE IS SEARCHED

286
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,497
ACTRESS YOO HYE-MI ACCUSED,
SEARCH WARRANT AND INVESTIGATION ENSUE

287
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,013
PAIK SEUNG-YOO'S CLAIM OF CHEATING
AT ASUNG COULD BE TRUE

288
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,609
Damn it.

289
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,277
SUNG YE-LIN

290
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,161
Excuse me.

291
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,916
I'm really sorry about what happened
to you and Seung-yoo back then.

292
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,794
But that happened a while ago.
Do you have to bring it up now?

293
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,170
A while ago?

294
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,299
In 2017, you were also
a student at Asung High.

295
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,219
You think you had nothing to do with it?

296
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:06,932
You didn't care at all
what happened at the school back then?

297
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,857
Damn.

298
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,319
ACTRESS YOO HYE-MI UNDER INVESTIGATION
IN ASUNG HIGH CHEATING SCANDAL

299
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,446
-Honey!
-What?

300
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,909
-Hye-mi was arrested.
-What?

301
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,788
It's finally over.
People will learn the truth.

302
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,331
But I wonder

303
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,419
why Seung-yoo isn't calling us lately.

304
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,421
He hasn't come over either.

305
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,507
Actually, I met Ms. Ji a few days ago.

306
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,177
Ms. Ji?

307
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,014
You called her first?

308
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,849
Yes.

309
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,227
In hindsight,
I didn't need to talk to her.

310
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,980
She had already made up
her mind to stop seeing Seung-yoo.

311
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,191
What is Seung-yoo up to right now?

312
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,360
What did you tell her?

313
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,364
What did you tell her, Dad?

314
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,658
I told her I wanted you
to have an ordinary life.

315
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,828
-Was it wrong to say that?
-You want an ordinary life for me?

316
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,497
-At this point?
-That's right!

317
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,374
I hope you can have that now, at least.

318
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,793
You always do that!

319
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,505
You've always told me to live
whatever life you want me to.

320
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,051
Why don't you ever ask me what I want?

321
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,429
I didn't know what I wanted in my life.

322
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,223
I tried to ignore math. I rejected it.

323
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,767
I had no direction.

324
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,854
But she helped me realize what I wanted,
which you never even helped me with.

325
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,981
And what did you do? You pressed charges.

326
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,942
You insulted her.

327
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,487
You didn't even apologize
for what you did.

328
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,573
Now you won't get an opportunity
to make things right.

329
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,912
Wait. Seung-yoo!

330
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,278
Hello?

331
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,696
Why weren't you answering?

332
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,323
Where are you?

333
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,285
-You're home, right? I'm on my way over.
-Don't come.

334
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,913
You're coming to see this circus,
aren't you? Don't come!

335
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,266
Have a good look.

336
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,226
You earned the right.

337
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,728
How do I look to you?

338
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,900
I didn't intend to put you
in a bad situation.

339
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,819
You're lying.

340
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,989
My life is over.

341
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,034
We're still in our twenties.
It's not too late.

342
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,661
It's too late.

343
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,038
I've gone too far.

344
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,082
That's what you're telling yourself.

345
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,209
Because making things right
seems too difficult for you.

346
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,046
You can set things right.
Starting with your mom.

347
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,049
But how?

348
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,720
Noh Jung-ah is someone capable of putting
all the blame on one person, your mom.

349
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,140
Only you can stop that from happening.

350
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:38,727
If you'll do what is right,
I'll help. Think about it.

351
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,601
ACTRESS YOO HYE-MI UNDER INVESTIGATION
IN ASUNG HIGH CHEATING SCANDAL

352
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,819
You're making my mom take the fall, right?

353
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,118
This is chamomile tea.

354
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,080
Have some. It'll calm you down.

355
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,960
I'm going to talk to the authorities.

356
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,753
I'm not going to let you
get away with this.

357
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,964
It's unfortunate about your mom.

358
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,966
-However…
-"It's unfortunate"?

359
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,677
Your mom is willing to make
sacrifices for you.

360
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,470
You need protection.

361
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,597
I don't need parental protection.

362
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,105
Then why did you come to see me?

363
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,484
You can go ahead
and talk to the authorities.

364
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,028
Instead of coming here,
you should go to the police.

365
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,283
You're afraid, aren't you?

366
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,208
You want me…

367
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,087
to comfort you, right?

368
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,467
You want to be like me but hate the idea.

369
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,971
You despise me,

370
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,433
but you're also scared, right?

371
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,398
Don't be afraid anymore.

372
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,610
Like you told me before,
we're in this together.

373
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,071
You're like me…

374
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,450
and I'm like you.

375
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,168
-Hey! Over here!
-Hey!

376
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,587
Hey, why are you so late?

377
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,047
How have you been?

378
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,673
How do you feel?

379
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,801
Your case is nearing the end, it seems.

380
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,220
It's not over yet.

381
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,557
I read the articles
and there were so many shocking details.

382
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,641
I agree.

383
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:27,187
It was because of Ye-lin
that we almost had to retake the test.

384
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,271
I know.

385
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,149
What Ms. Ji said to us
back then was correct.

386
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,779
I'll try harder to handle
such school matters

387
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,697
that can sometimes be outrageous.

388
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,951
How is Ms. Ji doing?

389
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:16,861
TIME TO PROVE

390
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:23,988
CHOI SHI-AN

391
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:28,284
I invite you to our Donors' Evening Party.
Please come.

392
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,563
I requested the Office of Education
to conduct an audit

393
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,107
and I pressed charges
and went to the press.

394
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,403
But they were all denied.

395
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,904
But I'm not going to give up.

396
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,991
I've got nothing to lose now.

397
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,451
I can't stop.

398
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,206
This involves Senator Sung,
Minister of Education Shin, Professor Cha,

399
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,916
and the principal of Asung Academy.

400
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,419
This is a big story.

401
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,838
Can you pull it off?

402
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,425
Won't your ministry come under fire
if they conduct an audit?

403
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,260
And Minister Shin is your boss.

404
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:30,471
Doesn't matter.
Just make it into a big story.

405
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,767
I chose you among our friends
because I trust you the most.

406
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,269
Okay.

407
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,023
Who is the inside source who gave you
the Asung school records?

408
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,984
He's a trusted source.

409
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,111
Don't worry about that.

410
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,240
What are you saying, Dad?

411
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:53,119
I heard that the wedding
has been called off.

412
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,332
How can you run the foundation
if you can't even hold onto your man?

413
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,251
How many chances have I given you?

414
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,295
You're mistaken, Dad.
It's a misunderstanding.

415
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,463
A misunderstanding?

416
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,550
Then arrange a meeting
with his family over lunch.

417
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,093
Before the board meeting.

418
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,012
Okay.

419
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,978
Sung-jae, I have one last favor to ask.

420
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,126
What is it?

421
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,004
Fine. I accept that
you don't want to marry me.

422
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,840
But at least pretend to be my fiance.

423
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,886
If we end our relationship like this,
won't your parents be mad?

424
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,554
Don't bring my parents into this.

425
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,474
Tell me why I have to pretend
to be your fiance.

426
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,351
There will be a board meeting soon.

427
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:02,021
If we break up now,
it'll put me at a big disadvantage.

428
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,987
If that's your reason,
you don't need me to play along.

429
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,949
You'll get a second chance.

430
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,493
What do you mean?

431
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,619
I'm…

432
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,207
going to expose everything
your sister did.

433
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,179
Thank you.

434
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,600
Order a glass of mulled wine.
Just 1,000 won per glass.

435
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,311
-You're selling alcohol?
-You came, Mr. Paik.

436
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,022
This is a non-alcoholic drink.

437
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,107
-Then I'll have one.
-Thank you.

438
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,859
Have a look around the party.

439
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,360
Sure.

440
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,281
Have a glass of mulled wine.

441
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,890
-How have you been?
-Fine.

442
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,518
-Shi-an invited me to the party.
-I was invited too.

443
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,604
We're lucky that we both know Shi-an.

444
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,275
Not because
she brought us together like this.

445
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,862
But I feel like an adult around her

446
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,532
as I watch her grow.

447
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,743
It's very gratifying.

448
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:44,707
Shi-an probably sees me
as her legal guardian and depends on me,

449
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,921
but she's actually the one that gives me
the strength to go on.

450
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,257
You look comfortable with yourself.

451
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,594
You're back to wearing
the style you used to wear.

452
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,972
How do I look? Do I still look good?

453
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,891
Yes. You look nice.

454
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,852
You too.

455
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,480
You look a lot more relaxed.

456
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,941
Let's take a photo together.

457
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,400
-A photo?
-Look that way.

458
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,319
I'll take your photo.

459
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,822
One, two, three.

460
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,784
Wait.

461
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,370
I have to go to school tomorrow
to attend a disciplinary hearing.

462
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,455
Are you going to resume teaching there?

463
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,833
-I haven't decided yet.
-I see.

464
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,460
When Shi-an becomes
a famous mathematician later on,

465
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,505
let's congratulate her together.

466
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,258
The both of us.

467
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,927
Let's do that.

468
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,972
Good night.

469
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,730
Here.

470
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,148
You made this yourself?

471
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,233
Yes. It's to prepare you
for your midterms.

472
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,572
How come you have that textbook?

473
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,824
Where did you get yours?
What's that textbook?

474
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,077
You don't need to know.

475
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,266
Everything has been fine, right?

476
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,103
There's a disciplinary hearing
regarding Mr. Paik's actions today.

477
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,980
Were all the midterm exams graded?

478
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,649
Yes.

479
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,944
The global gifted class
performed very well.

480
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:21,447
And Kim Ji-na did especially well.
She got a perfect score on the math test.

481
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,241
She did?

482
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,450
Call Mr. Ahn.

483
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,202
I called him already.

484
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,253
Good morning, Principal.

485
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:39,966
You did a great job in coming up
with challenging math problems

486
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,301
on the midterm exams.
I'm very satisfied with your work.

487
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,511
Thank you.

488
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,597
To show my gratitude,
I'll set up an appointment soon.

489
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,640
Okay.

490
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,936
Vice-principal.

491
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,148
Yes?

492
00:37:56,857 --> 00:38:00,319
One of Asung High's academic affairs notes
was submitted

493
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,154
as evidence to the police.

494
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,950
Do you know anything about it?

495
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,828
No. I had no idea.

496
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,999
The notes were written in great detail.

497
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,586
Do you know who could be behind it?

498
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,589
I don't know. I'll look into it.

499
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,009
A few days ago,

500
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,848
I acted rudely, didn't I?

501
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,313
There will be an Asung
board meeting this afternoon.

502
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,023
If I become the chairwoman one day,

503
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,861
you'll be the principal.

504
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,657
I'll make sure that'll happen.

505
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,971
It's Seung-yoo.

506
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,265
Hey, let's go talk to him.

507
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:15,227
-What are you doing here?
-I thought you were fired by the school.

508
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,229
We don't want you to be our math teacher.

509
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,230
Why's that?

510
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,484
You're the reason
Yoo-chan's mom is in jail.

511
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:26,072
You don't even like us or our school,
so why would you want to teach here?

512
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,536
Thanks.

513
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,747
Je-ni, Ji-na, and Soo-young.

514
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,000
I was searching for a reason
to come back to this school

515
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,169
and I think I found it through you.

516
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,046
What are you talking about?

517
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,091
I'm glad to hear
that you think I don't like you.

518
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,093
To me, it sounds like

519
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,804
I need to pay more attention to you
as my students.

520
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,723
I know how things are
chaotic at school right now.

521
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,141
Let's clear the air later on.

522
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,520
We can have a discussion about
what's bothering you.

523
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,774
Thanks.

524
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,735
What's wrong with him?

525
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,406
-He's so annoying.
-What was that?

526
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,951
Mr. Paik.

527
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,619
Hi, Shi-an.

528
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,704
Are you going to start teaching again?

529
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,541
I'll have to talk to the school
about that.

530
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,126
I'm rooting for you!

531
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:22,795
Thanks.

532
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:27,133
Call me after your meeting ends.
I have something I'd like to talk about.

533
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,385
Sure. I'll call you after.

534
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,691
I need to talk to you.

535
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,919
MEETING ROOM

536
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,797
I'm sorry for bringing up
my personal matter

537
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,175
at the school ceremony.

538
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,176
But…

539
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,971
I do not think my conduct
was inappropriate as a teacher.

540
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:18,851
I believe my students learned a lesson
when I took a stand

541
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,353
against unfairness and special privileges.

542
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,982
If the committee decides
to terminate my employment

543
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,487
despite hearing my defense,
I'll file a complaint

544
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,655
to the authorities.

545
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,463

CHOI SHI-AN

547
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,062
Ms. Ji.

548
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:06,065
You haven't made any new
math textbooks recently, have you?

549
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,150
No, I haven't. What are these pictures?

550
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,152
Aren't the math problems similar
to the ones you made before?

551
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,905
This textbook came from that cram school.

552
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,324
And the global gifted class students
all had a copy.

553
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,159
And so?

554
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:20,496
But there's something wrong
with this textbook.

555
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,164
What is it?

556
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,041
Hey, Shi-an.

557
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,088
Let me call you back.

561
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,450
We shall begin
the fifth Asung Board Meeting.

562
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,539
Today's agenda is selecting
a new board member.

563
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,749
There are two candidates for this seat.

564
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,668
Will the two candidates please stand?

565
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:15,050
In accordance
with the board meeting rules,

566
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,137
I ask the two candidates to wait outside
as the board casts their votes.

567
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,809
We shall begin the voting process.

568
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,400
Why isn't she answering?
She asked me to call her.

569
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:39,325
CHOI SHI-AN

570
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,038
-What's going on?
-Isn't she dead?

571
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,164
-Blood…
-Choi Shi-an.

572
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,707
Choi Shi-an.

573
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,753
-Get a teacher!
-Shi-an! Oh, no!

574
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,429
Shi-an!

575
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,015
Shi-an.

576
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,059
Shi-an, are you okay?

577
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,940
Oh, no!

578
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:12,941
Gosh!

579
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,109
Ms. Kim. Call 911.

580
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,653
-Okay.
-Shi-an.

581
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,197
-Shi-an.
-This is Asung Academy.

582
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,741
-Shi-an, wake up.
-A student is injured. Please hurry.

583
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,204
Do you recognize this textbook?

584
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,542
It's nearly identical to the textbook
I made a while ago.

585
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,962
-It came from your academy, isn't it?
-It's not ours.

586
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,591
But where did you get that picture?

587
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,598
Shi-an.

588
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,892
Hey, Shi-an. Open your eyes.

589
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,231
-Oh, no. Shi-an…
-I'll go with her.

590
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,590
PAIK SEUNG-YOO

591
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,508
DECLINE

592
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:26,265
The global gifted class at Asung Academy
all had a copy of this.

593
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,142
So?

594
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:32,813
I'm aware that you're consulting students
in gaining admissions to US colleges.

595
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,899
But you've never seen this textbook?

596
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,026
No.

597
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,946
I see.

598
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:48,203
I'm exposing Principal Noh's corrupt acts
that go back to her days at Asung High.

599
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,206
During the investigation,

600
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:55,127
your dealings with Asung Academy
will be scrutinized too.

601
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,503
What dealings?

602
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,589
That's an overstatement.

603
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:03,218
If you need my help,
feel free to call me anytime.

604
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,940
PAIK SEUNG-YOO

605
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,609
Shi-an is injured.

606
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,652
I'm taking her to the hospital.

607
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,241
-The votes have been tallied.
-Okay.

608
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,620
Okay.

609
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,182
Shi-an!

610
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,433
Over here.

611
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:52,976
What happened to her?

612
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,436
I found her lying on the floor
in the art room.

613
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,688
-Is she seriously injured?
-She's unconscious.

614
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,943
Please step aside.

615
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,945
-Shi-an!
-She needs emergency surgery.

616
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,447
-Are you her guardian?
-Yes, I am.

617
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,282
Please sign the consent form.

618
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:12,079
I shall announce the results
for the new board member vote.

619
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:18,418
Out of the 16 board members,
13 have chosen this candidate.

620
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,273
Wait here.

621
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,832
The chosen candidate

622
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,799
for the new board member is

623
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,845
Principal Noh Jung-ah of Asung Academy.

624
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:33,827
Drink this.

625
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:40,876
Shi-an is still young and healthy.
She'll get through this.

626
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,463
She has to.

627
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,091
When did you find out she was injured?

628
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,553
After the disciplinary hearing,
I was in the hallway and heard a scream.

629
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:59,144
I saw Shi-an lying
on the floor of the art room.

630
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,105
A shattered plaster bust was next to her.

631
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,149
A plaster bust?

632
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,318
It was obvious
that it hit her on the head.

633
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,446
It couldn't have fallen by itself.

634
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,532
I think something happened
in the art room.

635
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,410
What time was this?

636
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,496
Around 12:10 p.m.

637
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,379
She called me around that time.

638
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,714
-She called you?
-Yes.

639
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:32,260
She was about to tell me something
but then she had to hang up.

640
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,096
But in that moment…

641
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,389
Hey, Shi-an.

642
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,684
I heard someone call her name.

643
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:42,688
That means someone was with her
when it happened.

644
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,150
Who could it be?

645
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,952
We're police officers.
Are you the legal guardian of Choi Shi-an?

646
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,412
Yes.

647
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,832
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

648
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,667
Congratulations on joining the board.

649
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,753
-Thank you so much.
-Congratulations, Director.

650
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,881
-Let's have lunch.
-Sure.

651
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,135
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

652
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,344
Congratulations.

653
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,932
I didn't expect you to congratulate me.
Kind of underwhelming.

654
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:23,103
Enjoy this moment. It won't last.

655
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,857
Thanks for congratulating me.

656
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:39,077
-Yes?
-We have a serious problem.

657
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,954
There was an accident at the school.

658
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,414
An accident?

659
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,424
Who was the first person
who found Choi Shi-an?

660
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,885
-The three of us.
-Us.

661
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,304
-She was already unconscious?
-Yes.

662
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,223
Did you see anyone else in the art room
besides Choi Shi-an?

663
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,267
-No, I didn't.
-You didn't see anyone else?

664
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,102
-No, I don't think so.
-No, I didn't.

665
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,437
So we have no witnesses.

666
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,815
Choi Shi-an got injured?
How serious are her injuries?

667
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,278
She suffered a head injury
and is having brain surgery.

668
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:16,114
-The police are investigating the scene.
-The police?

669
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,202
All right. Keep me informed.

670
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:23,330
Did you visit the scene?
Have you checked the security footage?

671
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,415
Another team is investigating the scene.

672
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:29,294
We think she was with someone
before she got injured.

673
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,796
Please look into that first.

674
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,297
She was with someone, you say?

675
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,008
I was on the phone with her
and I heard someone calling her name.

676
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,052
It might not be just an accident.

677
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,887
We'll check that lead.

678
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,932
Oh, do you have her phone?

679
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,475
No.

680
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:45,977
I don't have it.

681
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,688
Hold on.

682
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:55,111
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

683
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,489
Her phone has been turned off.

684
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:00,075
I think we need to look
for her missing phone first.

685
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,498
She sent me this photo right
before the accident.

686
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:13,421
Ji-na.

687
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,967
Let's celebrate today. I have great news.

688
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,472
Ji-na.

689
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,559
-Mom.
-Yes.

690
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:29,479
-What should I do?
-What's wrong?

691
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,815
Mom, what should I do?

692
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,901
Ji-na, what's the matter? Where are you?

693
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,862
We'll call you after we follow the leads.

694
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,952
Will you be all right by yourself?

695
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,038
I'm going back to school.

696
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,541
She might have dropped her phone
in the art room.

697
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:50,959
Okay. Go check on that.

698
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,502
Call me if you find anything.

699
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,087
Okay.

700
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,216
Don't worry too much about her.

701
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:00,969
Seung-yoo.

702
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:05,974
Thank you for helping Shi-an.

703
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,726
She's my student too.

704
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,228
Who else would look after her besides me?

705
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:12,480
I'll call you.

706
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:29,122
If I become a mathematician,
I'll present you with a medal one day.

707
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,333
Wow. Thank you, Ms. Ji.

708
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,959
The new textbook is awesome.

709
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,377
These are so pretty.

710
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,630
Thank you, Ms. Ji. I love these sneakers.

711
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,299
I'm fine. I'm worried about you.

712
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,666
Okay.

713
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,251
I understand.

714
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:35,271
ART ROOM

715
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,247
The art room has no CCTVs.

716
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,666
I saved footage taken
from the CCTVs in the hallway.

717
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,712
-We'll call you after we analyze this.
-Okay.

718
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,061
Ms. Kim Jin-hee.

719
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,354
Oh, Mr. Paik.

720
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,440
-Did they find anything?
-Not yet.

721
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,401
The police left
with the security camera footage.

722
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:24,446
How is Shi-an? Is her surgery over?

723
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,655
No, not yet.

724
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:30,618
-Did you see Shi-an's phone by any chance?
-No, I didn't see it.

725
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,203
It wasn't in the art room either.

726
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:37,834
But her surgery is taking so long.
Oh, my goodness.

727
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,213
I'm going crazy.

728
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,382
What's wrong? Do you know something?

729
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:50,305
If you've seen anything suspicious,
please tell me. Please.

730
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,906
Ji-na!

731
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,367
Ji-na…

732
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,369
Mom.

733
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:16,790
You see…

734
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,585
Tell me everything that happened.

735
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,879
Don't leave out a single detail.

736
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:28,593
Are you certain?

737
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,678
What should we do?

738
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,973
What can we do now?

739
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,647
Mom.

740
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:45,443
What happens if she dies?

741
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,903
Shut up!

742
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,116
Don't say a word.

743
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,120
Don't make matters worse.

744
00:56:56,704 --> 00:57:00,166
If you make things worse,
I won't tolerate it.

745
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:06,005
Even though you’re my daughter.

746
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:07,924
Understand?

747
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,400
-Is it over?
-Yes. We finished the surgery.

748
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,944
We'll have to monitor
her condition until she wakes up.

749
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,136
Hello?

750
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,513
Yes.

751
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,725
The surgery is over.
She's in the ICU right now.

752
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,435
She's still unconscious?

753
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,437
Now don't be shocked by
what I'm about to tell you.

754
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,869
Passcode.

755
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,997
Unlocked.

756
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,624
The door is open.

757
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,923
The door is closed.

758
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,358
Are you on your way, Mr. Jang?

759
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,070
Please come here quickly. Okay.

760
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:27,939
VICE-PRINCIPAL CHOI SUNG-HAN

761
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,484
Yes, Principal?

762
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:35,697
Bring me all the security footage
in the school

763
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,866
and report to me about the police
investigation over this accident.

764
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,785
Okay. But…

765
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,206
Is that you, Mr. Jang?

766
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:53,548
Choi Shi-an's legal guardian
wishes to see you, Principal.

767
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:37,592
Did you analyze the footage taken
from Asung Academy?

768
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:40,053
How can you worry about her right now?

769
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,055
Don't make that dumb expression.
Now listen carefully.

770
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:45,308
Shi-an said all the global gifted class
students had this textbook.

771
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:48,061
-I don't know anything.
-Seung-yoo.

772
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,772
Can you send me
the photo of that textbook?

773
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,441
Mom, you didn't believe me.
How is that a bad thing?

774
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,443
I sent a press release to the media.

775
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:57,528
-It'll be in the papers soon.
-What are you doing here?

776
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,280
I'm going to go see
Principal Noh right now.

777
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,532
I'll go with you. I need to meet her too.

778
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:08,039
