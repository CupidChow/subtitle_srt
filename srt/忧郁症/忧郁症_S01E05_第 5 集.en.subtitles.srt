1
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,354
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,818
The stars in this painting that were drawn
by Vincent van Gogh in 1889

3
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:30,780
impressed people even after 100 years

4
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,199
and will continue to do so,
even 1,000 years from now.

5
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,661
Although he lived a finite life,

6
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,540
his works contain an infinite quality.

7
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,604
It's our job to imbue
imagination and creativity

8
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,481
into AI.

9
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,735
Like Cantor, who created the set theory
based on the principles of infinity

10
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:12,072
and solved complex problems
and made dazzling progress in his field,

11
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,240
we can dream with no bounds.

12
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,701
And it can also
free the boundaries of our thinking.

13
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,913
Infinity…

14
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,832
is not in the far future.

15
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,376
It's within us…

16
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,422
right now.

17
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,349
Thank you.

18
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,380
What a moving speech.

19
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,966
I'm so proud of him.

20
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,218
Wonder it will be enough though.

21
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,055
His speech was very different
from all the others.

22
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,267
So we just heard the last speech.

23
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,770
That's the end of the Youth Mathematics
Speech Competition.

24
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:30,191
We'll have the results soon
and hold an award ceremony.

25
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,699
Paik Seung-yoo? Good speech.

26
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,120
Does this throw a wrench in your plans?

27
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,666
Of course, not.
Seung-yoo is a very special student to me.

28
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,252
He's a student that
Asung High probably needs.

29
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,629
Bye.

30
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,469
Long time no see.

31
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,848
-Do you remember me? I'm Noh Yeon-woo.
-Oh, hi.

32
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,101
How have you been?

33
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,270
Did you prepare Seung-yoo
for the competition?

34
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,148
-Yes.
-I liked his speech.

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,991
-Hello.
-Oh, hello there.

36
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,119
You need to look good
in the group photo, my princess.

37
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,079
Not now. We don't know the results yet.

38
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,206
You're a shoo-in for that award.

39
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,168
Seung-yoo's speech
was so abstract and philosophical.

40
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,420
It brought down
the quality of the competition.

41
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,387
Good job.

42
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,389
How are you feeling now?

43
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,142
Well, I'm better.

44
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,023
Ye-lin, you did really well.

45
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,402
I didn't know you were going
to give it in English. I was surprised.

46
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,820
It must have been hard.

47
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,823
We'll announce the results.
Please be seated.

48
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:31,980
We shall announce the results of
the Youth Mathematics Speech Competition

49
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,857
of the 2017 International
Mathematician Olympics.

50
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,109
Don't be nervous.

51
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:37,944
You did well.

52
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,571
What if I don't get
an award despite doing well?

53
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,824
Please come to the stage.

54
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,326
-Jung Won-bin of Myunghyun High.
-Yes!

55
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,705
Ahn Jin-hee of Chian High.

56
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,039
Me?

57
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,626
And…

58
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,587
Please come up to the stage.
Sung Ye-lin of Asung High.

59
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,476
Congratulations.

60
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,690
We'll announce one more winner.

61
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,570
Honey.

62
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,156
Paik Seung-yoo of Asung High.

63
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,242
-Please come up to the stage.
-Oh, my goodness!

64
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,749
Why did they call Paik Seung-yoo?

65
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,752
Your school has two winners.
You must be proud.

66
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,753
Thank you.

67
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,925
Minister of Education, Jung Il-young,
will present the awards.

68
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,224
The Prime Minister's Award goes

69
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,936
to Jung Won-bin of Myunghyun High School.

70
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,362
We will now announce

71
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,449
the winner of the Presidential Award.

72
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,243
Minister, please announce it.

73
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,542
The Presidential Award

74
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,545
in the Youth Mathematics
Speech Competition

75
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,090
of the 2017 IMO goes to…

76
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,975
Asung High School's…

77
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,608
Sung Ye-lin.

78
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,496
Congratulations.

79
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,916
Congratulations.

80
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,171
And we have one more winner.

81
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,050
What the? They're joint winners?

82
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,719
That's nonsense.
There's only one Presidential Award.

83
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,347
As you know,

84
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,767
this competition was
supposed to have three winners.

85
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,229
A fourth award was added
during the judging.

86
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,606
Paik Seung-yoo of Asung High?

87
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,861
His speech was more philosophical
than based on science.

88
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,379
And this Special Jury Award

89
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,259
goes to Paik Seung-yoo of Asung High.

90
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,098
All right. One, two, three.

91
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,808
Ye-lin looks the prettiest.

92
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,186
Okay. One, two, three.

93
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,357
We'll take a photo of the winners only.
Everyone else, please step down.

94
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,652
Wait right there.

95
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,696
Stand still. One, two, three.

96
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,989
Wait there.

97
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,407
Mom's over here.

98
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,875
Okay. One, two, three.

99
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,961
We're all done.

100
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,089
Ye-lin. Come here.

101
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,549
Seung-yoo.

102
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,509
You did so well.

103
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,136
-Let's see your award.
-Let's take a photo too.

104
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,389
Mom, just a minute. I need a little break.

105
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,848
-A break?
-Yes.

106
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,185
Where is he going?

107
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,937
Honey, let me see the award too.

108
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,440
Gosh, it's so loud.

109
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,569
Congrats, Ms. Ji Yoon-su.

110
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,073
-Thanks.
-You did great. Two winners.

111
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,992
Good job.

112
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,911
I didn't expect it. I'm surprised myself.

113
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,413
The Minister

114
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,916
and Vice Minister
would like us to join them for dinner.

115
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,460
-Dinner?
-Just a second.

116
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,215
Yes, sir? Yes.

117
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,592
I'll call you later.

118
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,926
Yes.

119
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,015
Ms. Ji.

120
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,101
-Hey, Seung-yoo.
-Do you have a minute?

121
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,775
Hello. I'm Sung Ye-lin
and from Asung High School.

122
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,696
I'm so happy to have won
such a big award today.

123
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,785
I couldn't breathe earlier.

124
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,371
But I could breathe again
after seeing that sequence.

125
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,707
I was nauseous and had blurry vision.

126
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,295
Then I saw the symmetry in this sequence.

127
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,757
Everything sounded muffled
and I couldn't hear anything,

128
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,800
but then I heard your voice.

129
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,930
That's how I was able to find this proof.

130
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,600
Seung-yoo.

131
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,063
Can you tell me

132
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:52,360
why you couldn't breathe nor hear
and also suffered from blurry vision?

133
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,040
Where did he go?

134
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,583
Honey, call him.

135
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,587
Jin-ho…

136
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,007
was my only friend.

137
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,718
I couldn't speak English well.

138
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,514
But he was the only person who helped me.

139
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,808
8 YEARS AGO, MIT

140
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,190
That's a present.

141
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,447
I'm Yoo Jin-ho. I'm Korean too.

142
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,728
How did you solve this?

143
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,857
Like always…

144
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,569
You're so special.

145
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,614
Can I count on you next time too?

146
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,618
I thought he meant that.

147
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,872
I was so dumb.

148
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,735
I didn't have a clue…

149
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,113
that my solution

150
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:06,577
would invalidate his thesis,
which he had worked on for years.

151
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,909
Jin-ho!

152
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,496
Jin-ho!

153
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,959
Jin-ho…

154
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,028
The number you have dialed cannot…

155
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,541
I know you're exhausted.

156
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,295
But you can't miss cram school.
It can't be helped.

157
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,171
I'll go to class.

158
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,008
You did great today. Understand?

159
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,759
-I'll pick you up later.
-Okay.

160
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,844
Manager.

161
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,143
Well, thank you so much for today.

162
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,479
And this is a small token
of my appreciation.

163
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,775
Oh, my gosh.
This is a rare bottle of wine.

164
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,362
I'll cherish this bottle.

165
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,822
Oh, it's not that special.

166
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,829
-Shall we get the party started?
-Okay.

167
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,123
-Did you send her off?
-Yes, she left.

168
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:19,043
Director, let me pour you a drink.

169
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,547
I saw you giving an interview
to the public broadcast network.

170
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,590
Oh, right.

171
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,760
Our school is applying
for special status, you know.

172
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,639
The network wants to do a piece
on our special math classes.

173
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,140
-I see.
-My gosh!

174
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,643
That's marvelous.

175
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,810
Let's have a toast.

176
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,397
-Good job.
-Great work.

177
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,032
Jin-ho probably went through a lot

178
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,452
while working on his thesis.

179
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:58,958
Wrestling with numbers, time,
and his own resolution.

180
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:07,549
It's a lonely and intense struggle

181
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,636
that he had to go through alone.

182
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,890
Nobody can help you,

183
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,643
and others can't get in your way.

184
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,897
I don't think

185
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,943
Jin-ho hated you, Seung-yoo.

186
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,239
He just fell in love

187
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,741
with his proof.

188
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,828
With all his heart.

189
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,059
What are you doing here?

190
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,397
-Why weren't you answering your phone?
-My phone?

191
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,861
-I didn't see it.
-While doing what?

192
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,617
As you can see,
I was talking to my student.

193
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,369
Is your discussion over?

194
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,374
Congratulations on winning an award.

195
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,461
-Can I take the teacher with me now?
-Sung-jae.

196
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,504
You should go.

197
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,591
You were under a lot of stress today
because of me.

198
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,183
Good night.

199
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,367
I made an excuse

200
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,787
to wriggle out of the dinner.

201
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,997
I thought you'd be uncomfortable.

202
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,584
Sorry for being like that.

203
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,129
I think I overreacted.

204
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,383
-But you really can't tell?
-Tell what?

205
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,718
He has a crush on you.

206
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:20,682
Teenage crushes, I understand that.
It's typical at that age.

207
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,476
Don't say it like that.

208
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,396
-You don't know Seung-yoo well.
-Do I need to?

209
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,360
I don't know him,
but I know you very well.

210
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,280
He's gifted in math
and you can't resist liking him.

211
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,907
I understand that.

212
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,619
But you can't hide your feelings.

213
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,454
It's so obvious.

214
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,416
You need to be careful
especially after that incident.

215
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,794
If the rumors keep spreading,
people will believe them.

216
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,671
And when coincidences keep happening,

217
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,049
-then it's no longer a coincidence.
-All right.

218
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,926
I'll be careful.

219
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,388
-Let me serve you your food.
-Okay.

220
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,151
PRESIDENTIAL AWARD
SUNG YE-LIN, ASUNG HIGH SCHOOL

221
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,328
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

222
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,205
-Let's go.
-How many did you get wrong?

223
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,082
I got 95 points.

224
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,503
You can go home only after you solve
all the problems you got wrong. Okay?

225
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,474
You can't solve it like that.

226
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,935
I used the formula.

227
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,270
Don't use the formula.

228
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,355
Look at the equation.

229
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,492
Since the order of N is smaller,

230
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,078
you list the numbers based on N.

231
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,122
Then this is the invariable number.

232
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,938
MOVE TO SECURE FOLDER

233
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,233
SECURE FOLDER
ENTER PASSCODE

234
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,909
Calculus.

235
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,453
Yes. That pebble.

236
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,290
This small pebble is
the foundation of numbers.

237
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,835
If you get nervous, hold that tight.

238
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,371
But you can't hide your feelings.

239
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,665
It's so obvious.

240
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,726
Come to school a little earlier
than usual.

241
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,562
The public broadcasting network
will interview you.

242
00:21:55,314 --> 00:22:00,110
Asung High School had two winners
in the Mathematics Speech Competition.

243
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,654
And the winners are…

244
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,989
The winners are…

245
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,868
Sung Ye-lin and Paik Seung-yoo.
A round of applause, please!

246
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,245
There's Seung-yoo!

247
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,206
-Paik Seung-yoo!
-Go!

248
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,834
-Paik Seung-yoo!
-Go!

249
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,127
-Paik Seung-yoo!
-Go!

250
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,880
Paik Seung-yoo!

251
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,631
-Paik Seung-yoo!
-Go!

252
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,051
-Paik Seung-yoo!
-Go!

253
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,762
-Paik Seung-yoo!
-Go!

254
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,513
-Paik Seung-yoo!
-Go!

255
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,973
Applause!

256
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,769
Are you Ms. Ji Yoon-su?

257
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,729
Congratulations.

258
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:39,566
Two Asung High students received awards
at the Mathematician Olympics yesterday.

259
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,777
You supervised them, right?

260
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:47,199
-Are you writing a news article about us?
-It's not about that. I'm just curious.

261
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,868
I heard that you supervised students
from a public school,

262
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,370
and they won at Math Olympiads,
didn't they?

263
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,331
You're an amazing teacher.

264
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,124
What's your secret?

265
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,210
I'm sorry. I have to go.

266
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,796
Oh, please don't go.
Could you let me in on your secret?

267
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,925
Could you tell me how you prepared
your students for the competition?

268
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,636
I'm sorry. I have nothing to say.

269
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:12,641
Why? Under your training,
your student won the Presidential Award.

270
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:17,354
The Calculus math club at Asung High

271
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:21,691
uses a multidisciplinary approach
in teaching math

272
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,319
by combining elements from the humanities.

273
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,113
As a result of this approach,

274
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:30,033
Paik Seung-yoo's speech won
a special jury award.

275
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,745
What is that picture?

276
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,707
This photo shows
the math club activities led by Ms. Ji.

277
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:41,545
She finds mathematical solutions
to daily problems that students have.

278
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,132
Let's have Ms. Ji tell us more about that.

279
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,679
Thank you, producer. Please let me preview
the final cut before it airs.

280
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,930
Sure. I'll be in touch.

281
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,773
SENATOR SUNG MIN-JOON

282
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,318
-Yes.
-We've got a big problem.

283
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,404
What kind of problem?

284
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,823
I just got off the phone
with the Math Council chairman.

285
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,075
He said a reporter visited
him this morning.

286
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,786
-From which media outlet?
-She's an MBS news correspondent.

287
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,373
She was asking how the youth category
was added in the IMO.

288
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,209
They're going to air the story
on the evening news. What now?

289
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,588
I'll call Professor Cha
and ask if he was also approached.

290
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,089
You should check with the MoE.

291
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,299
Okay.

292
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,970
You didn't tell anyone that Ye-lin
was supervised

293
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,222
by Professor Cha, did you?

294
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,225
Of course not.
It would be dumb to tell anyone.

295
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,435
ALLEGATIONS THAT SENATOR SUNG
RIGGED DAUGHTER'S COMPETITION

296
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,438
The allegations surfaced
due to this photo.

297
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,774
The student shown in the photo
won the Presidential Award

298
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:48,820
at 2017 IMO
Youth Mathematics Speech Competition.

299
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,489
She's been identified as
the daughter of Senator Sung Min-joon.

300
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,074
Did she win the award unfairly?

301
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:57,078
Before the competition,
she interned at an academic conference.

302
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,748
She was involved in AI research led

303
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,125
by Professor Cha,
head of the AI Research Center.

304
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,379
The speech she gave
at the competition shared

305
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,881
striking similarities with a study about

306
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,384
AI facial recognition technology
developed by Professor Cha's team.

307
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,222
The fact that Professor Cha
was also one of the judges

308
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,099
in the competition raises questions.

309
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,268
So the judges were influenced?

310
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,021
It would be hard
for the professor to be impartial.

311
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,190
To quell any accusations,
the student stated

312
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,359
that she prepared for the competition

313
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,778
at school under the supervision
of her math teacher.

314
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,239
But in our investigation,
we found this to be untrue.

315
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,783
Gosh, how could they know that?

316
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,078
Could you tell me how you prepared
your students for the competition?

317
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,122
I'm sorry. I have nothing to say.

318
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,126
Under your training,
your student won the Presidential Award.

319
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,590
As you can see, the teacher
refused to answer the question.

320
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,009
The senator and his teenage daughter…

321
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,553
When did Ji Yoon-su give that interview?

322
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,805
Has she gone crazy?

323
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,728
-You didn't know she was interviewing you?
-No, I had no idea.

324
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,731
I think you need to issue a rebuttal.

325
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,483
For what?

326
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,569
You're asking me to lie
and say I supervised her?

327
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,029
You have to.

328
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,200
-I'll call Senator Sung right now.
-No, don't talk to him.

329
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,122
You think giving a false statement
will benefit Ye-lin?

330
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,543
She probably feels the worst right now.

331
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,923
I need to figure out
what I can do that will really help her.

332
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,644
-Is the news story true?
-Your dad influenced the judges?

333
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,105
-OMG! Great to have a senator dad.
-Revoke the award.

334
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,028
I knew something was up.

335
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,280
Hye-mi is such a sneaky person.

336
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,158
Like the saying,
"The husband leads and the wife follows."

337
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,785
She has always been so snobby.
That tells you a lot.

338
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,955
If the news is true,
then she can't keep the award.

339
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,125
Oh, my. Honey, will Seung-yoo receive
the Presidential Award instead?

340
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,544
Oh, gosh. Let's see. Where is the award?

341
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,552
TAKE AWAY THE AWARD

342
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,470
TOTALLY RIGGED

343
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,221
SENATORS CAN REALLY GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING

344
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,270
PAIK SEUNG-YOO

345
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,732
Did you see the news?
I'm worried about it.

346
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,572
Seung-yoo, could I ask you for a favor?

347
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:40,658
SEUNG-YOO, COULD I ASK YOU A FAVOR?

348
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,082
It doesn't look good.

349
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,250
Ye-lin, skip school today.

350
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,669
I can't. I have to give a presentation.

351
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,838
Why don't I go with you?

352
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,591
If you were to do that,
that would make things worse!

353
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,719
Why she!

354
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:04,099
-It's Sung Ye-lin!
-Are you Sung Ye-lin?

355
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,768
How did you get the internship
at the AI Research Center?

356
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,020
Did you prepare for the Olympics
at school like you claim?

357
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,605
Did Prof. Cha Seong-won…

358
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,218
Ms. Ji would like to talk to you.

359
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,309
I knew how you prepared
for the competition.

360
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:52,021
I didn't agree with the method
and I believed it was unfair.

361
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,485
I didn't intentionally say
those things to the reporter.

362
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,820
But I didn't lie either.

363
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,366
So what? What are you trying to tell me?

364
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,833
In life, there are many paths.

365
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:16,171
You can take a shortcut
and go faster than others.

366
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,758
But if you cross the line
and drive on the shoulder,

367
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,177
you could hurt others.

368
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,804
Most importantly, you will hurt yourself.

369
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,765
Are you trying to scare me?

370
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:30,101
I'm giving you a warning.
Don't take the wrong path.

371
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,772
Ye-lin.

372
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,358
You are smart
and can get good grades on your own.

373
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,861
But if you think that's not enough,

374
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,864
then let's sort that out.
I'm willing to help.

375
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,575
What did I do wrong?

376
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,661
I don't feel like

377
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,998
I did anything wrong.

378
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,461
They're accusing me of preparing
for the competition in advance.

379
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:59,631
And I had resources that weren't available
to the other contestants.

380
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,884
How is that my fault?

381
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,104
-Are you feeling okay?
-I don't owe you an apology.

382
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,401
You were born with a special privilege.
Your brains.

383
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,677
SENATOR SUNG DENIES ALLEGATIONS
OF RIGGING DAUGHTER'S COMPETITION

384
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:50,181
SENATOR SUNG MIN-JOON

385
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,644
-Did you see my rebuttal?
-It's not bad.

386
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,189
Avoid talking to the media
and don't appear at public functions.

387
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,026
What are you going to do about Ms. Ji?

388
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,571
I'll reprimand her,
so that this doesn't happen again.

389
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,073
Did you look into that reporter?

390
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,491
I did.

391
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,161
But I never crossed paths with her before.

392
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,622
All right. I have to go.

393
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,124
Wait a minute.

394
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:21,337
About the upcoming midterm exams…

395
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,463
What about it?

396
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,550
Will you help Ye-lin as usual?

397
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,552
What kind of help?

398
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,138
Like you usually did.

399
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,142
-Please give her the expected questions.
-Senator.

400
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,477
Yes?

401
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,648
I'm holding my temper.

402
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,401
Oh, yes. I know.

403
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:49,032
DIRECTOR NOH JUNG-AH

404
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,914
I came to tell you something.

405
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,711
-Ye-lin, is it true?
-Hi. Great dad.

406
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,339
I'm so jealous of you.
Your dad is a senator.

407
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,924
Ye-lin.

408
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,425
You looked good on TV.

409
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,052
Gosh, your dad is so great.

410
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,640
-You want to talk to her parents?
-Yes.

411
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,601
I'd like to discuss Ye-lin
with her parents.

412
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,145
Is there a problem with Ye-lin?

413
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,317
Ye-lin said she doesn't know
what she did wrong.

414
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,112
I think that's a serious problem.

415
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,035
Ms. Ji, it seems like
you want to make this into a big issue.

416
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,663
I want to make things right.

417
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,666
Before this gets out of hand.

418
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,334
Make things right, you say?

419
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,295
And where would you begin?

420
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:49,008
Most of the students at Asung High
went to the same kindergarten,

421
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,302
elementary, and middle school.

422
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:55,473
They share similar upbringings
and received a similar education.

423
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:59,644
They'll go on to elite universities,
and either inherit their family's business

424
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,813
or follow in their parents' footsteps
in choosing a career

425
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,524
and become the ruling class
of this country.

426
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,361
Their careers have been determined
the day they were born.

427
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,780
So I'm very curious about

428
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,408
how you'll make things right for Ye-lin.

429
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,496
I have no intentions
of interfering in your style of teaching.

430
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:23,292
Even the school parents do not question
your unconventional teaching methods.

431
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,381
Likewise, you shouldn't interfere
with how parents raise their kids.

432
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:33,428
So I'm giving you this stern warning

433
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,013
before things get out of hand.

434
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,639
If you cross the line,

435
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,059
you'll leave me with no choice.

436
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,042
Getting a kick out of this?

437
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,628
It's fun to see me on the news, is it?

438
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,757
I told to beat Seung-yoo.
Did you forget that?

439
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,885
Doesn't matter how you did it. You won.

440
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,475
Oh, right. But you know…

441
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,270
Is that how you always came out
on top in the school exams though?

442
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,065
What are you talking about?
Of course, not.

443
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,233
Really? I sure hope not.

444
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,909
How can you believe them? It's so obvious.

445
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,161
They used the AI Research Center
to rig the competition.

446
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,998
Right. How would a high schooler get
an internship there on their own?

447
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,418
Ms. Yoo is very sly if you think about it.

448
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,421
She never tells us about the special
lessons that Ye-lin takes.

449
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,256
-I know.
-Exactly.

450
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,925
Why isn't Ms. Yoo with you?

451
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:58,304
I don't think she'd feel like having tea.
It's hard to see her lately.

452
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,099
Her daughter's award
isn't going to be taken back?

453
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,851
It's nice to have a senator as a dad.

454
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,021
Seung-yoo must feel bad.

455
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,108
If Ye-lin hadn't cheated to win,
Seung-yoo might have won that award.

456
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,943
-That's right.
-I know.

457
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:12,985
Tell me about it.

458
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:16,823
Hee-sung, sit with us for a minute.
Right here.

459
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,120
How does Seung-yoo study math?

460
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,205
Please share his study tips with us.

461
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,332
But Gyu-young is the top in math.

462
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,042
Does he need any help?

463
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,169
I'm sorry for not realizing
how smart your son is.

464
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,798
How does he study?
Which cram school does he go to?

465
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:37,385
Cram school?
Well, I'm looking at a few right now.

466
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,347
How about having our kids study together?

467
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,349
Oh my. Great idea.

468
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,476
Let's do that.

469
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,479
Well, maybe we can do that.

470
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,816
-What's the matter, Ye-lin?
-What? What's going on?

471
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,026
I don’t know. She's screaming,
but the door won't open.

472
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,654
-Open it. Hurry.
-What? Ye-lin.

473
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,197
Ye-lin!

474
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,157
Hey, Ye-lin.

475
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,117
Oh my.

476
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,703
My goodness, Ye-lin!

477
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,539
What did you do to your hair?

478
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,875
Hey, you need to focus on school.

479
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,711
Your midterms are coming up.

480
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,423
Did you get the list
of expected questions?

481
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,592
I don't think that's possible this time.

482
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,928
-Instead, I'll hire a special tutor then.
-What do you mean?

483
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,681
She won't give me the list of questions?

484
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,308
What will I do then?

485
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,310
I have to get the top score
in the midterms.

486
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,020
What will I do if my score falls?

487
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,354
Ye-lin.

488
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,772
Mom, you have to fix this!

489
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,525
All this is your fault!
You have to handle it.

490
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,700
Honey, can you ask
Director Noh Jung-ah again?

491
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,035
It won't work.

492
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:48,206
I might anger her if I were to ask again.
That will make things worse.

493
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,125
What will we do then?

494
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,377
This could ruin her!

495
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,714
Why did your fiancée say that on TV?

496
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,800
She should be careful about
what she says before the wedding.

497
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,636
It's not Yoon-su's fault, Mom.

498
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,970
Mark my words.

499
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,349
You're going to fight
a lot in your marriage.

500
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:12,230
Marriage is hard
even between like-minded people.

501
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:16,943
But her upbringing and habits
are different from yours.

502
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,402
That's why I like Yoon-su.

503
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,447
What? Oh my gosh.

504
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,077
GROOM RYU SUNG-JAE, BRIDE JI YOON-SU

505
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,745
This is our wedding invitation.

506
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,123
Enjoy looking at it all you want.

507
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,126
Wipe that smile off your face and listen.

508
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,089
You'll have to keep her under control
after you marry her.

509
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,215
Okay.

510
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,053
-Ms. Ji!
-Oh, good morning.

511
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,137
I'm exhausted.

512
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,974
There's a lot going on in school,
isn't there?

513
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,936
I thought I'd be happy that two students
from my class got an award.

514
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,980
But it's a headache.

515
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,819
YOUR WEDDING INVITATION IS READY

516
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,529
Oh, my, Ms. Ji!

517
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,157
-You're getting married?
-Yes.

518
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,702
Oh, my!

519
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,037
Why didn't you tell me?

520
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,581
Congratulations.

521
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,542
Thank you.

522
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,297
How is Ye-lin, by the way?

523
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,550
Well, she'll be fine.

524
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,552
Don't worry about her.

525
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,239
Did you call for me?

526
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:49,368
Ye-lin, it's been
very stressful lately, right?

527
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,708
It's very unfortunate
since you worked so hard.

528
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,085
Well…

529
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,755
It's not your fault though.

530
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,007
It's your parents' fault.

531
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,427
But what about Ms. Ji?

532
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,934
Isn't she at fault too?

533
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,313
That's it, Ye-lin.

534
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,523
That's the spirit.

535
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,362
You have the spirit.

536
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,821
I like it.

537
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,616
You should have acted like that all along.

538
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,786
The midterms

539
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,455
will be a vital opportunity.

540
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,378
I believe that you'll do well.

541
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,756
Yes, I will.

542
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:53,933
Sorry.

543
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,312
-Ms. Ji!
-Seung-yoo.

544
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,483
-Let me carry that.
-What? It's okay.

545
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,026
Let me.

546
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,946
Thanks.

547
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,292
Hey. Are you going to study after class?

548
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,628
No, I have to go to cram school.

549
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,797
I just heard from the homeroom teacher

550
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,716
that Ms. Ji is getting married.
She saw her wedding invitation.

551
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,387
The Calculus club is thinking about
preparing a little party for her.

552
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,765
But we've got midterms,
so there's no time.

553
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,268
Will you go to her wedding?

554
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,356
Who's here to see me?

555
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,819
Ye-lin's mother, Ms. Yoo Hye-mi,
is here to see you.

556
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,696
Should I let her in?

557
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,698
Tell her I'm busy.

558
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,867
What?

559
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,287
I'm not going to meet with parents
for a while. You understand, right?

560
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,038
Yes, Director.

561
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,714
Hello, Vice-principal.
Can I go in to see her?

562
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:10,426
-She's busy with work.
-What?

563
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,971
I think you'll have to
meet her some other day.

564
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,516
Sir, don't be like this.

565
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,854
She's very busy lately. Take care now.

566
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,482
Then could you at least give her these?

567
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,026
I made this ginseng snack myself.

568
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,778
She told me not to
accept any gifts. Off you go.

569
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,364
-Goodbye, then.
-Wait.

570
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,278
Ms. Ji!

571
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,698
-What? Ms. Ji!
-Oh, no.

572
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,952
Ms. Ji.

573
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,371
Are you okay?

574
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,459
I hurt my foot.

575
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,634
-Seung-yoo.
-I'll carry you on my back.

576
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,901
What was that?

577
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,991
I'll put your foot in cast now.
Tell me if it hurts.

578
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,117
Okay.

579
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,914
Where is Ms. Ji Yoon-su's family?

580
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,709
Are you her family?

581
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,877
-No, I'm just…
-I'm her guardian.

582
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,255
Please fill this out.

583
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,678
-What happened to her?
-She fell down while riding her bicycle.

584
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,639
-How's the patient?
-She's being treated.

585
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,725
Here you are.

586
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,269
This way, please.

587
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,146
You can go now.

588
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,442
Come in.

589
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:32,693
Yoon-su.

590
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,362
What happened?

591
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,616
-How is her foot?
-Fortunately, she didn't get a fracture.

592
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,242
She has a sprained ankle.

593
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,871
Are you okay?

594
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,081
I'm sorry. You were startled, right?

595
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,505
Seung-yoo.

596
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,842
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay now.

597
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,308
The brake line on your bike was damaged.

598
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,940
If someone cut it on purpose,
we need to find who did it.

599
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,194
Send that picture to her phone.

600
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:16,862
Now you should go.

601
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,492
I'll take care of her from here.

602
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,536
Thanks, Seung-yoo.

603
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,497
It's late. You should hurry home.

604
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,665
Let's go.

605
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,258
Ye-lin, what are you doing?

606
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,510
Goodness.

607
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:44,515
-Oh, my gosh. What are you doing?
-I can't focus because of the mess.

608
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:47,309
Goodness! How long are you
going to keep this up?

609
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,229
What is this for?

610
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:54,525
That's Ritalin for ADHD patients, right?
Where did you get this?

611
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,527
-Leave me alone.
-Give it to me!

612
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,570
-No! Let go!
-Really!

613
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,075
Oh, my goodness!
Why are you being like this?

614
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,827
It's your fault, Mom!

615
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,287
I wouldn't need to take meds
to concentrate

616
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,998
if you'd given me a better brain!

617
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,750
I wouldn't have to worry about

618
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,336
not getting the top score
whenever there's an exam!

619
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,756
Who said you're not smart?

620
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,175
And we're supporting you all the time.

621
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:24,555
Your dad and I are doing everything we can
so that you'll get the best score.

622
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,265
Get the list of expected questions!

623
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:29,184
Help me get the top score this time
through any means possible!

624
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:33,355
Otherwise, just leave me alone.
I'll take the meds if I need to.

625
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,657
How's your foot?

626
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,160
It's okay.

627
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,793
I think we should report this
to the police.

628
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,420
Report this?

629
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,089
The damage done
to the brake line was intentional.

630
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,134
What if a student from my school did it?

631
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,054
I can't file a police report yet.

632
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,932
I need to find out who did it first.

633
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,478
I'll check the security cameras.
It was near the parking lot, right?

634
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,438
I'll be back. Stay here.

635
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,399
It's dark now,
so you won't be able to see much.

636
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,028
Even if you could,
the school isn't open at this hour.

637
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,613
I'll check it tomorrow morning.

638
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:28,577
You must check it.
You can't just let it slide.

639
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,163
Okay.

640
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,875
That kiddo was caring too much.

641
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,713
-Who?
-Paik Seung-yoo. That kid.

642
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,301
I told him to go, but he didn't leave.
He was very worried.

643
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,889
I'll carry you on my back.

644
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,440
I really enjoyed that.

645
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:12,037
The man on the left was
a former news bureau chief at MBS.

646
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,749
Currently, he teaches journalism
at Sangcheon University.

647
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,461
Sangcheon University?

648
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,436
Who are you?

649
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,605
What the?

650
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,358
Time to pop the champagne, right?

651
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,528
Congratulations.
You sure dealt me a stinging punch.

652
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,073
Your uncle,

653
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:52,244
the professor of Sangcheon University
with help from the president there.

654
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,289
He used to be a bureau chief at MBS,
and he tipped off the reporter, didn't he?

655
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,832
It was well planned.

656
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,626
Come at me.

657
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,421
I'm not afraid of getting my hands dirty.

658
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,715
You think that's all I dug up?

659
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,968
The admission bribes,
influence peddling to win special status

660
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,887
for Asung High and the donations
you rake in from dirty donors…

661
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,515
Why didn't you go public with it?

662
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,268
Because it would ruin both of us, right?

663
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:19,229
That's right. That's why
I only fired a warning shot.

664
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,315
I see. A warning shot?

665
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,568
If you don't heed my warning,
I don't know what I have to do next.

666
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,738
Don't be so greedy, okay?

667
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,240
I won't tolerate the way
you peddle the Asung name

668
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,908
to fatten your bank account.

669
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,411
Since when did you grow a moral compass?

670
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,789
You think I don't know your intentions?
You can't bring in donations like I do,

671
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,626
so you'd rather screw it all up
so that nobody can make money.

672
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:43,712
Yeon-woo.

673
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,466
What are you so afraid of?

674
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:51,345
You're dad's successor. Because unlike me,
you weren't born out of wedlock.

675
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,265
So why didn't you work harder?

676
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:59,353
Your incompetence is
why Dad had to bring me in.

677
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,459
YOUTH MATHEMATICS SPEECH COMPETITION
SPECIAL JURY AWARD, PAIK SEUNG-YOO

678
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,298
What's the bicycle for?

679
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,384
I need it.

680
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:36,306
The midterms are coming up, right?
Are you studying for it?

681
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,391
I'm going now.

682
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,691
Isn't it heavy? Do you need any help?

683
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,950
Gosh, Your wedding is happening soon,
so this is so unlucky for you.

684
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,328
I'm sorry for bothering you like this.

685
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,622
The parking lot didn't have
any security cameras.

686
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:25,040
Oh, it's fine.

687
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,877
It's lucky that my car's dashcam
was recording the parking lot.

688
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,839
Let's check footage
taken in the afternoon.

689
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,299
There it is.

690
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,365
Hey, go ahead first.

691
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,368
Hey.

692
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,788
Ms. Ji wants to see you
at the counseling office.

693
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:06,790
Did you get into trouble?

694
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:24,015
I found out you knew Ye-lin
way back when you were little.

695
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:29,187
If I were Ye-lin, I'd feel like
I'd been stabbed in the back by you.

696
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,897
You're so pathetic.

697
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,277
And you still can't stop it, right?

698
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,320
You like Ms. Ji that much?

699
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,616
-Watch what you say.
-It was entertaining.

700
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,869
Carrying her on your back
and running like that.

701
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,083
COUNSELING OFFICE

702
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,594
Come in.

703
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,976
Sit down.

704
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,695
What is this?

705
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,282
It's a questionnaire for
measuring learning anxiety levels.

706
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,869
I screened the questions
for math-related ones.

707
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,873
Let's see which ones you find difficult.

SCHOOL ANXIETY LEVEL QUESTIONNAIRE

709
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:37,047
I'll analyze the results
and help you with your weak areas.

710
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,634
Tell me when you're done.

711
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,678
Are you testing me?

712
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,932
You knew it before calling me, right?

713
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,225
Know what?

714
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,560
What I did.

715
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:56,232
I know you didn't say those things
to the reporter out of spite.

716
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,527
I didn't do that
because I had nothing against you.

717
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,071
I know.

718
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:07,452
You're under extreme stress and anxiety.
That made you do it.

719
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,497
So let's figure this out.

720
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,583
What is the source of
your anxiety and stress?

721
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,922
Don't you want to know
what is bothering you?

722
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,941
Did you find who did it?

723
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,152
Yes.

724
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:43,822
Who did it?

725
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:52,247
The student we suspected.

726
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,806
SCHOOL ANXIETY LEVEL QUESTIONNAIRE

727
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:14,310
VERY MUCH

728
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:45,341
-Oh, my. Really?
-He carried her. It was quite a sight.

729
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,886
Seung-yoo likes that teacher that much?

730
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,513
Then Gyu-young's hunch
was right all along.

731
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,391
He told me they had
a special relationship.

732
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,519
Teenagers have crushes all the time,
but what about that teacher?

733
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,520
I know.

734
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,980
What are you talking about?

735
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,316
Who does Seung-yoo have a crush on?

736
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,326
Are you okay?

737
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:13,912
Ms. Ji!

738
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,551
I cut the teacher's brake line.

739
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,763
You suspected me, didn't you?

740
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,601
Why didn't you say anything?

741
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:38,895
Why are you telling me this?

742
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,565
Because you're the reason I did it.

743
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:55,370
After Ms. Ji came to our school,
you began to change.

744
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,914
I didn't have a problem before that.

745
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,670
Did you have to do this to me?

746
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,632
Do you have to stress me out like this?

747
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,385
Like I told you before,

748
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,887
I'm not trying to beat you.

749
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,431
Neither am I trying to hurt you.

750
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,394
You're absolving yourself of any blame?

751
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,063
Don't punish yourself over me.

752
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,733
Don't get stuck in anxiety and stress.

753
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,069
You're only hurting yourself.

754
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,866
I wish you'd stop it.

755
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,119
Then back out.

756
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,581
You said you wouldn't compete against me.

757
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,249
Keep your promise!

758
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,253
I'm sorry,

759
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,214
but I can't keep that promise anymore.

760
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,386
Not because I want to beat you.

761
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,641
But rather, I want to improve myself.

762
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,438
Because of Ms. Ji?

763
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,504
TRADITIONAL PHOTO STUDIO

764
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,214
Here are your photos.

765
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,300
Did you take the photos?
They were quite good.

766
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:33,968
Thank you.

767
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,804
Wait a minute. Looks like it'll rain.

768
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,353
Ms. Ji, can you come out for a second?

769
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,356
I'll meet you on the first floor.
I'll wait there.

770
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,321

DATE: OCTOBER 28, 2017, SAT

775

PAIK SEUNG-YOO

776
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,486
INVITATION TO RYU SUNG-JAE
AND JI YOON-SU'S WEDDING

777
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,578
When I went to the academic conference
with Professor Cha,

778
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,166
I saw them at the airport.

779
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:43,890
Seung-yoo.

780
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,190
Why did you get all wet?

781
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:55,985
What's wrong?

782
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,698
-Seung-yoo.
-You told me

783
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,661
not to fall in love.

784
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,958
What can I do

785
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,628
if I can't control those feelings?

786
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:27,558
So why are you showing me this photo?

787
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,854
I'll let you have it.

788
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,694
I think you'll find it useful.

789
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:42,365
Under one condition.

790
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:48,996
Seung-yoo.

791
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,541
I'm not following…

792
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,418
What can I do?

793
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:59,590
If there's an irresistible problem,

794
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,388
which I can't hold myself back
from solving…

795
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,199
What's happening between us?

796
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,117
It feels like our relationship
is going through a lot of bumps.

797
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:11,204
-Special lessons?
-There's a strange rumor going around.

798
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:15,124
I thought about what you said.

799
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,210
Please let her off.

800
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,796
Please cover up this matter
for Ye-lin's sake.

801
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:22,173
You're totally
out of your mind, aren't you?

802
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,383
So it's true about
the relationship you two have.

803
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,053
Creating a heaven where
everyone is happy is meaningless.

804
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,679
Don't cause any problems for Ms. Ji.

805
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,474
I'll make sure nobody can harm her.

806
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:38,856
