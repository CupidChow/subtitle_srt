00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,354
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,816
ASUNG HIGH SCHOOL MATH CONTEST

3
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,778
We don't know who among you

4
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,198
will compete in the International
Mathematician Olympics.

5
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,827
It's a rare opportunity,
so pour all your energy into it.

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,122
I hope you'll do your best,
Asung High students. Shall we begin?

7
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,457
There's…

8
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,209
still some time left.

9
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,549
All right. We have to follow the schedule.

10
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,844
How about we pass out
the blank answer sheets first?

11
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:53,762
Let's begin.

12
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,060
Pass out the blank sheets.

13
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,488
Shall we close the door now?

14
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,926
I solved it.

15
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,178
I solved

16
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,514
the problem.

17
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,935
What's taking so long?

18
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,731
Tell me about it after the contest.

19
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,696
Paik Seung-yoo, a junior in Class No. 8,

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,491
is here to compete
in the contest, Director.

21
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,211
I'm so nervous
over the school math contest.

22
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,921
-I know.
-Wait a minute.

23
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,799
-I had a lucky dream last night.
-What kind of dream?

24
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,635
In my dream,
Ye-lin was on top of a pretty elephant.

25
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,679
-Is that a lucky dream?
-It sure is.

26
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:21,391
The elephant is the symbol of fame,
academics, and awards.

27
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,811
Seems like Ye-lin
will win the contest today.

28
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,856
-The results aren't in yet.
-That's true.

29
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,442
While Ye-lin studies a lot,
she put in extra effort for this contest.

30
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,319
It's a very special contest.

31
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,657
The winner will compete
at the Mathematician Olympics.

32
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,827
-We didn't order the madeleines.
-It's free.

33
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,953
Why so generous?

34
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,498
-Oh, I'm having a good day.
-What kind of good news?

35
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,583
Oh, gosh.

36
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,503
I really didn't want to tell
anyone about this…

37
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,757
-Seung-yoo is transferring to--
-Honey!

38
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,509
Did Seung-yoo come here?

39
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,177
Why would he come to the cafe?

40
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,180
He missed the interview.

41
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,268
He's not answering his phone.
Where the heck is he?

42
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,688
Thanks for the cakes.

43
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,607
Thanks.

44
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,692
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

45
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,907
Why are you here?

46
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,920
SUNG YE-LIN

47
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,763
There are no multiple-choice questions?

48
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:45,183
Well, she eliminated those
because we have to judge

49
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,603
their critical thinking skills
rather than how many they get correct.

50
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,897
-Ms. Ji said this?
-Yes.

51
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,899
Actually, I agree with her.

52
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,069
But for students who don't have
a good grasp of math…

53
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,195
Prep her for the contest.

54
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,660
STUDYING

55
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:08,289
MEETING IN SESSION

56
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,292
What? Mr. Han.

57
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,754
The problems will be picked
from this list. Memorize them all.

58
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:18,800
The answers have to include solutions.
So memorize it.

59
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,646
We'll start grading the answers.

60
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,733
The scores for each answer
will be determined by a point system.

61
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,319
We'll be very meticulous
and work together.

62
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,738
Have it done by today.

63
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,947
Okay.

64
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,384
So you want to compete
at the Mathematician Olympics?

65
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,805
What a liar.

66
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,974
-I'm not doing it to beat you.
-Then why do you want to enter it?

67
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,853
So tell me why you want to enter.

68
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,397
Do you even like math?

69
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,275
I…

70
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,569
have to excel.

71
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,322
That's my reason.

72
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,076
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

73
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,494
It's not sudden.

74
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,331
-What?
-I've always liked math.

75
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,348
Hello?

76
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,982
-Did you call for me?
-Hey, Ye-lin.

77
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,943
We graded all the answers but…

78
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,528
I didn't make any mistakes.

79
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,779
I memorized all of it.

80
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,866
Oh, sure. You did great.

81
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,410
You did a good job, but…

82
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,046
Come in.

83
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,054
You were terrific.

84
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,432
And I'm glad you came back.

85
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,727
-Someone else got a perfect score too?
-Yes.

86
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,479
You and Seung-yoo.

87
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,982
He's the worst student at our school

88
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,526
but it turns out he's Paik Min-jae,
the math genius.

89
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,654
So what will happen?
Who'll represent the school?

90
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,240
Regardless of who goes on
to compete at the Olympics,

91
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,035
I want to tell you

92
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,579
that I'm so happy that you came back.

93
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,624
I didn't come back because of you.

94
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,211
You said you solved that problem, right?

95
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,047
-Is that the solution?
-Well…

96
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,551
-Why?
-That's not the solution.

97
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,347
I made a wrong assumption halfway into it.

98
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,681
Oh, really?

99
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,059
That happens.

100
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,939
By the way, what did you tell your dad?

101
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,150
You didn't just…

102
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,950
-Give me your dad's number.
-I'll tell him myself.

103
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,953
Will you really stay?

104
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,289
Will you learn math here with me?

105
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,376
Yes.

106
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,880
Oh, there was a misunderstanding.

107
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:09,966
About what?

108
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,135
I thought you told my dad
I should transfer to a science school.

109
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,476
Come to the office.
The director wishes to speak to you.

110
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,357
Seung-yoo, could you tell me
what you were told?

111
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:31,737
I think Ye-lin should represent
our school at the Olympics.

112
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,156
I've taught her
since she was in 10th grade.

113
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,077
She can memorize
the whole equation and solution.

114
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,830
You have to give her points for that.

115
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,583
You don't solve math problems
through memorization.

116
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,542
Oh boy. So conceited.

117
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,004
Seung-yoo's solutions were
the most brilliant I've ever seen.

118
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,757
He used various techniques
to solve a problem.

119
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,634
And they were all correct.

120
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,846
Only one student can represent our school.
How will we decide this?

121
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,515
-How about we let them take another test?
-What?

122
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,435
Let them take a second test.

123
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,979
We'll pick whoever scores higher
than the other.

124
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,776
How did this happen?
How can we have two perfect scores?

125
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,280
If you had raised the difficulty level,
this wouldn't have happened.

126
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,406
I agree.

127
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,533
If I had known we would have such a tie,

128
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,411
I would have given a high-level problem.

129
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,543
I understand. You can go now.

130
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,045
SENATOR SUNG MIN-JOON

131
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,087
Okay.

132
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,139
Do you have something to say?

133
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,061
What? Why is she still in there?

134
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,150
I heard you were trying to transfer
Seung-yoo to a science school.

135
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,986
Yes, I did.

136
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,615
A few days ago, I told you that
a student who got the correct answer

137
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,660
for the math club question
would show great potential.

138
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,411
Well, that's Seung-yoo.

139
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,580
I know that. So?

140
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,082
He's got a very rare gift.

141
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,376
I'd go so far as to say that

142
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,296
he may become one of the greatest
mathematicians in our country.

143
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:17,259
Won't it be a proud achievement for you
if he were to graduate

144
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,889
from Asung High
and go on to do great things?

145
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,684
I'll excuse myself.

146
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,821
SENATOR SUNG MIN-JOON

147
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,337
Hello, Vice-principal.

148
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,380
-Hello.
-Okay.

149
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,799
Seung-yoo is here? At school?

150
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,300
This way.

151
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,556
Mr. Paik, you've heard
of the Mathematician Olympics, right?

152
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,559
Yes, it'll be held in Korea next month.

153
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,687
It seems that Seung-yoo wants to enter it.

154
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,906
I asked both of you to come
to tell you something important.

155
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,825
Please have a seat.

156
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,413
Seung-yoo got a perfect score?

157
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,250
Then who will represent the school?
You can only choose one student.

158
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,626
So I have an idea.

159
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:39,008
Senator, can you ask the organizers
if they can make an exception?

160
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,219
All right. Thank you.

161
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,610
One school is not sending a contestant,
so there's an opening.

162
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,613
The organizer said
they could give us their slot.

163
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,448
Then that's solved. Joint contestants.

164
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,492
Are we really going to do that?

165
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,620
Or we could have them take
a second test and eliminate one.

166
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,332
I support sending two contestants.

167
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:18,214
Mr. Paik, I'll contact you later
about the Olympics schedule.

168
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,965
Sure. All right.

169
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,885
Thank you.

170
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,686
Professor Cha? It's me, Noh Jung-ah.

171
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,523
About that student.
Her name is Sung Ye-lin.

172
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,193
She'll be available to participate
in your research project.

173
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:50,579
ASUNG HIGH SCHOOL MATH CONTEST

174
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,417
In the middle of the admission exam,
an idea popped in my head.

175
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,632
There was this problem
that Ms. Ji gave me.

176
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,509
I thought I could solve it.

177
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,264
I mean, I thought I had the solution.

178
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,474
I'll have to rework the answer.

179
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,063
Do you like math that much?

180
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,151
It's the first time in years that

181
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,612
you said more than one sentence to me.

182
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,366
Do you like math a lot?

183
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,376
All the mathematicians
you look up to are coming.

184
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,713
Go and see them.

185
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,345
AI technology research institute?

186
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,472
I'll have Ye-lin work there as an intern.

187
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,183
You set it all up?

188
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,479
The professor will also
help Ye-lin prepare for the Olympics.

189
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,733
She will have to do well there.

190
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,280
I didn't want to get upset earlier,
but I was dismayed by the outcome.

191
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,908
I couldn't let that kid
reap the benefits of my effort.

192
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,541
But you know…

193
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,504
I wonder about the promise you made me.

194
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,256
What promise?

195
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,843
In return for getting Asung High
accredited as a school for gifted,

196
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,056
you were supposed to get
Seung-yoo out of my daughter's way.

197
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,558
If you don't keep your promise…

198
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,187
Now listen.

199
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,815
If Asung High is designated
as a school for gifted,

200
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,109
it's not only good for me.

201
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,861
What?

202
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,864
Ye-lin's brother will
enroll in our school in a few years,

203
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,451
and it will become an Academy
of Mathematics and Arts by then.

204
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:58,207
My ultimate goal is not obtaining
special status from the city.

205
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,542
My dream is…

206
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,296
to make Asung Schools

207
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,424
the Eton College of Korea.

208
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,928
Without any public funding
from the Ministry,

209
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,597
I'd like to run the school
on donations and tuition alone.

210
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,810
An independent school not influenced
by any new educational policies.

211
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,436
In ten years,

212
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:24,566
most judges and politicians
will be graduates of Asung High.

213
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,946
And 15 years down the road
their kids will enroll in our school.

214
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,449
So that graduates of Asung schools

215
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,995
will be running this country.

216
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:41,500
So what's more important than
the reputation of Asung High?

217
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:46,422
We have a gifted student who is choosing
our school over a science school.

218
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,800
It always makes me happy
when we have a student

219
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,720
who can raise our school's profile.

220
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,431
2017 IMO JOINT CONTESTANTS
SUNG YE-LIN, PAIK SEUNG-YOO

221
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,559
That's crazy.
Why is Seung-yoo's name there?

222
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,270
I overheard the math teachers
talking about him.

223
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,148
Seung-yoo had a different name before.
Paik Min-jae?

224
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,025
-Yes, that was his name.
-Paik Min-jae?

225
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,776
-Did you know?
-He changed his name?

226
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,195
The math genius who enrolled
at MIT when he was ten?

227
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,489
Hey, Hyun-jae, Hyung-do! Did you know?

228
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,033
-They didn't know either.
-No way.

229
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,659
-Seriously?
-Wow.

230
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,620
Joint contestants?

231
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,458
We barely got approval for this,
so I hope you'll prepare them well.

232
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,211
I'll do my best. Thank you.

233
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:30,466
And I want weekly reports on the progress
of their preparations for the Olympics.

234
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,261
If your prediction

235
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,265
turns out to be right
and he becomes a brilliant mathematician,

236
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,685
then it's important that we keep a journal

237
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,063
of what he learned here.

238
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,566
Sure. I feel a great responsibility.

239
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,075
Yes.

240
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,284
PRINCIPAL OH JIN-TAEK

241
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,162
There was an opening, so we were able
to send two contestants.

242
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,082
They're Sung Ye-lin and Paik Seung-yoo.

243
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,168
Who will prepare them?

244
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,586
Math teacher Ji Yoon-su.

245
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,925
I want to know everything
about their preparations.

246
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,427
Especially Sung Ye-lin.

247
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,936
Congratulations, Ye-lin and Seung-yoo.

248
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,900
Now let's begin preparing
for the Mathematician Olympics.

249
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,611
IMO 2017

250
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,488
Mathematics Speech Competition?

251
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,033
Yes, you'll talk about
a subject using math terminology.

252
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,202
And it has to be done in three minutes.

253
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,588
Yes, Hone. How did it go?

254
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,883
What? Joint contestants?

255
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,552
Oh, my!

256
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,346
Oh, my gosh.

257
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,766
He came in first place
in the math contest?

258
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:07,437
Hold on. What about the science school?

259
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,150
-It's actress Yoo Hye-mi!
-Hello.

260
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,778
He's going to enter
the Mathematician Olympics?

261
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,990
Knock, knock. What did you pull off?

262
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,327
Let's talk later, Honey.

263
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,622
What do you mean?

264
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,794
How could your son get a perfect score
in math unless he cheated?

265
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,421
Now look here, Ms. Yoo.

266
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,382
Do you have Alzheimer's?
You don't remember?

267
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:39,845
When Seung-yoo went
to the same math academy with Ye-lin,

268
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,513
he outscored her by a huge margin.

269
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,683
-What?
-Don't act so arrogant.

270
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,852
As a parent, you get used to it.

271
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:52,524
Your kid can't always be first,
nor will they always be the worst.

272
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,526
And…

273
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,780
you're getting on my nerves.
What's with the attitude?

274
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,241
I'm two years older than you, after all.

275
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,828
Show some respect

276
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,289
from now on.

277
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,708
-My gosh.
-Move it.

278
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,752
My goodness.

279
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,378
Pick up your bag.

280
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,505
Seriously?

281
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,549
Very disrespectful of you.

282
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,052
Why you…

283
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,768
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.

284
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,856
These books will help you
choose your topic.

285
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,733
Take the ones you like.

286
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,401
Okay.

287
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,116
Come straight home after school is over.
I have to tell you something.

288
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,077
Ms. Ji, can I go now?

289
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,703
What?

290
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,872
I have to go to cram school.

291
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,124
All right.

292
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:55,212
Then choose a topic for your speech.
We'll discuss it next time we meet.

293
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,672
Okay.

294
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,307
-Did you pick a book?
-Yes.

295
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,938
Geometry and the Imagination,

296
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,940
Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy.

297
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,984
GEOMETRY AND THE IMAGINATION

298
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,127
Ye-lin.

299
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,629
Ye-lin. Come on.

300
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,381
Open your door.

301
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:40,882
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi.

302
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,009
Ye-lin!

303
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,885
What? What's wrong with Ye-lin?

304
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,014
She won't come out of her room
after coming home.

305
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,724
She hasn't had dinner either.

306
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,559
-Ye-lin.
-Jeez.

307
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,561
She's really upset.

308
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,480
How did that kid also get to enter
that important competition?

309
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,150
Why did you screw this up?

310
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,277
You should have done something.

311
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,741
Don't worry about Paik Seung-yoo.
He's not the competition.

312
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,994
You told me that you have
to be born with the skills to win.

313
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,498
How can I beat him
when he was born a genius?

314
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,418
You're different from the others too.
You've got a head start.

315
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,757
Because I'm your dad.

316
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,347
AI TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH

317
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,855
Yes! I got into the math club. Calculus!

318
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,482
PAIK SEUNG-YOO, SUNG YE-LIN

319
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,525
Yes!

320
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,197
I got in too!

321
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,448
He got in too?

322
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,949
Hey, Seung-yoo.

323
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,451
We're in the same club. Did you know that?

324
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,995
I put down your name on the application.
So you should thank me.

325
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,164
Didn't you get an 87 on the math contest?

326
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,208
-An 87?
-Yes, I did.

327
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,959
Then why didn't I get in? I got a 93.

328
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,503
Gyu-young didn't get in, either.

329
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,712
Even Gyu-young?

330
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,632
Hey, let's go!

331
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,217
Go where?

332
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,510
To talk to the teacher.

333
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,512
This doesn't make any sense.

334
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,180
All right. Let's go!

335
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,517
-But what should we say?
-We'll mount a protest.

336
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:17,354
Either she does a do-over
or we'll shut the club down.

337
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,189
-Hey, let's go!
-Let's go!

338
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,482
Let's go!

339
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,319
MATH CLASSROOM

340
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,243
Ms. Ji, wait a minute.

341
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,494
Why?

342
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,496
What?

343
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,713
What's wrong, Seung-yoo?

344
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,591
I have to prepare for the math club.

345
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,760
The students are angry about the club.

346
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,555
Is that so?

347
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,350
The students at this school are weird.

348
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,102
They get very angry about scores.

349
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,231
You might get insulted
if you confront them.

350
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,692
They might use physical force.

351
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,153
Don't worry. I won't let that happen.

352
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,954
-She's here.
-Ms. Ji.

353
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,747
Oh, Ms. Ji!

354
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,209
What are the criteria
for getting into the math club?

355
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,461
You said you'd base it on
the math contest scores,

356
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,546
but that's not the case.

357
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,715
That's correct.
It's not based on the scores.

358
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,632
Then what is it?

359
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,969
I scored them separately.
Creative solutions got extra points.

360
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,012
What's the purpose
of telling our scores then?

361
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,264
Could you reveal your scoring system?

362
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,807
Sure. Of course.

363
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,018
But guys.

364
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,562
Why do you want to join the math club?

365
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,772
To include it in my college application.

366
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,733
-That's it.
-That's why.

367
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,569
If that's your reason,
then there's no need to be upset.

368
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,987
Even if you're not part of the math club,

369
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,489
I'll let you all participate
in math activities.

370
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,492
I'm not interested in that.
Any dumb kid can do that.

371
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,246
Watch what you say, Gyu-young.
Show some respect.

372
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,459
Come during lunch tomorrow
if you want to know what it is.

373
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,169
Tomorrow? At lunchtime?

374
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,503
How can every student
participate in the math club?

375
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,172
Hey, tell your mom about this.

376
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,678
Pythagoras once said

377
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,348
"Numbers are the substance of all things.

378
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,601
Numbers rule the universe."

379
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,144
TEAM 6, SET THEORY AND LOGIC

380
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,689
I'll have the Calculus members
set up a booth during lunchtime.

381
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,860
Bring me a tough matter
you're dealing with.

382
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,280
When I go to cram school after school,
I'm always late because of traffic.

383
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,200
How to get to point B in the least
amount of time. I can solve that.

384
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,993
I need to plan a study schedule.

385
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,996
We can use an algorithm
to plan that. You're on Team 2.

386
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,206
What's your problem?

387
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,667
My head is big.

388
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,545
Go to the geometry team.

389
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,678
Everyone is participating
and getting credits except us.

390
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,932
I'll go check it out.

391
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,692
CALCULUS CLUB MEMBER LIST

392
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,611
PAIK SEUNG-YOO, SUNG YE-LIN, LEE HYUN-JAE

393
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,822
Gosh.

394
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,909
How is it possible that my son
didn't get into the math club?

395
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,620
Even the worst student got in.
Paik Seung-yoo!

396
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:24,624
I heard that he's actually a math genius.
Ms. Min was telling the truth.

397
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,210
-I know.
-He's no genius.

398
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,546
That's not the issue.

399
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,257
This is invalid!

400
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,722
Why did you rip it up?
Ye-lin's name is on it.

401
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,559
You don't have a problem with it
because Ye-lin got in.

402
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,436
You always do that to us.

403
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,062
What? Do what?

404
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,232
Will you stop glaring at me?

405
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,526
I'm going to take this up with the school.

406
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,361
I'll ask that math teacher
to be reassigned.

407
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,946
I support that.

408
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,906
-Me too.
-I support it.

409
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:12,714
Don't you think Ms. Ji Yoon-su
is quite unconventional?

410
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,342
Right. She created a math club

411
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,720
and then allowed the whole school
to participate in it. Isn't that weird?

412
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,015
You have nothing to worry about that.

413
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:27,228
I'm planning to talk to Ms. Ji
about the math club.

414
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,691
Please do a do-over.

415
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,693
You told us the math club

416
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,446
would be for the best students.
For our kids.

417
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,989
That's what you said.

418
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,326
Looks like Ms. Ji is not cooperating
with the school.

419
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,162
I really don't like her style.

420
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,791
Even if you don't like her,
please tolerate her.

421
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,961
I would never do anything
to harm the students

422
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,797
and parents of our school.

423
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,466
We hired her because we needed her.

424
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,636
You might thank me later.

425
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,395
SENATOR SUNG MIN-JOON

426
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,687
And instead of coming as a group,

427
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,274
please pick one person
to bring any issues to my attention.

428
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,610
I'll excuse myself.

429
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,196
Well…

430
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,329
She's acting so self-important by the day.

431
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,709
You're not answering.
How about we have dinner later?

432
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,378
Excuse me, Ms. Noh.

433
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,842
Was that my husband
calling you by any chance?

434
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,261
Yes, we have a dinner appointment.

435
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,054
You're having dinner?

436
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,433
He said he'd like to discuss
Ye-lin's preparations for the Olympics.

437
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,642
Oh, Ye-lin.

438
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,895
I see. Please support her.

439
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,314
-Bye then.
-Take care.

440
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,907
Congratulations on entering
the Mathematician Olympics.

441
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,119
But it's not a good feeling, is it?

442
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,080
To be a joint contestant
with the worst student.

443
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,085
You should be worried.

444
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,047
You might never
get the top score in math again.

445
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,136
Seung-yoo is on a different level.

446
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,973
You and I rely on hard work
and that's not enough to beat him.

447
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,528
Did you call for me?

448
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,156
It's important to prune
dead and wilting leaves quickly.

449
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:47,494
That way, it won't steal nutrients
away for the healthy ones.

450
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,832
I see the math club started
holding activities.

451
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:54,751
Yes.

452
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:58,296
Will you keep allowing all students
to participate in the math club?

453
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,591
That's my plan.

454
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,384
I see.

455
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,639
To make it fair to everyone, I see.

456
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:15,647
It used to be that power came in numbers.

457
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,149
But that's not true anymore.

458
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:24,239
Now it's the few who wield all the power.
The first percenters. The winners.

459
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,326
Your idea of fairness
could be stealing the rewards

460
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,496
from those who think
they deserve it for their hard work.

461
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,833
You understand that, don't you?

462
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,919
I don't really understand.

463
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,631
I'm not good with numbers actually.

464
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,596
I have a class to teach so I should go.

465
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,767
Ms. Ji.

466
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:00,984
Here.

467
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,069
This is a present.

468
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,737
Try to take care of it.

469
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,741
I wonder how this will grow

470
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,160
under your stubborn personality.

471
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,725
You came.

472
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,607
Did you choose a topic for your speech?

473
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,027
I'm going to visit an AI research
institute to get ideas.

474
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,528
Oh, I see.

475
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,698
I'll tell you my topic
after my visit and get good ideas.

476
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,367
If you need help or have any questions,
ask me anytime.

477
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,536
Okay.

478
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,746
And you, Seung-yoo?

479
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,122
Not yet.

480
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,668
I finished reading this book but…

481
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,178
This is the book I recommend.

482
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,971
A MATHEMATICIAN'S APOLOGY
BY G.H.HARDY

483
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,766
-Have you read this book?
-No.

484
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,768
It's an old book.

485
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,687
It was written by Godfrey Harold Hardy,

486
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,900
a 20th-century British mathematician.
It's his memoir.

487
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,234
G. H. HARDY IS KNOWN
FOR HIS ACHIEVEMENTS IN NUMBER THEORY

488
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,410
"I am interested in mathematics

489
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:38,831
only as a creative art."

490
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,837
"A mathematician,

491
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,632
like a painter or poet,

492
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,386
is a maker of patterns."

493
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,734
-There, you have your solution.
-Wow. I see.

494
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,027
This is too hard.

495
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,278
-You understand now?
-It's clear now.

496
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,407
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

497
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,607
Ms. Ji.

498
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:51,029
Did you write this down?

499
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,994
No. Why are you asking?

500
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:01,164
I found it in the book
I borrowed last time,

501
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,790
so I searched it on the internet.

502
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,294
And I found a paper
about a vector equation pattern

503
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,838
according to the Knight's movement
in an n-by-n matrix.

504
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,089
Really?

505
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,092
-Did you read the paper?
-Yes.

506
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,137
I had a lot of questions about it.

507
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,390
Would you like to go somewhere
with me after school?

508
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,725
Where?

509
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,519
To meet the person
who can answer your questions.

510
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:55,218
SALESIO SANATORIUM

511
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,971
Let's go in.

512
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:07,980
SALESIO SANATORIUM

513
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,235
-Wait here.
-Okay.

514
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,011
How many?

515
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,805
Three.

516
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,931
Good.

517
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,892
The least number of moves
for the Knight to checkmate the King.

518
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,817
I couldn't find my dad in his room.
Did he go out for a walk?

519
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,529
No, he was taking a nap a minute ago.

520
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,116
I'll look for him.

521
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,709
There you are.

522
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,962
Do you know him?

523
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,923
Seung-yoo, do you play chess?

524
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,759
I'm learning how to play right now.

525
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,139
Is he the person?

526
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:28,936
Yes, he wrote the paper
about the vector equation pattern

527
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,981
according to the Knight's movements
in an n-by-n matrix.

528
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,741
It's time for my walk.

529
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,082
Let's follow him.

530
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,084
Oh, okay.

531
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,593
Did you ask him your questions?

532
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,303
Not yet.

533
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,973
But how do you know him?

534
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,434
Ask him your question first.

535
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,568
I have a question.

536
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:25,201
It's a fascinating pattern.

537
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,661
I'm curious.

538
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:31,791
Is there a formula you can generally use
when the starting point is different?

539
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,753
And there are identical numbers
across here.

540
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:40,591
Patterns are not only in there.

541
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,053
You can see them there.

542
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,314
Do you see it?

543
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,404
Fractals.

544
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:07,868
Infinitely complex patterns that are
self-similar across different scales.

545
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:12,581
You can see them everywhere
in the world we live in.

546
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,758
The infinite within the finite.

547
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,554
It's beautiful.

548
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,205
It's gone! It's missing.

549
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,124
What's missing?

550
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,919
Where did it go?

551
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,256
He took it. That bastard.

552
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,591
Dad!

553
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,177
Let go of me! I have to find it!

554
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,471
It's a very important piece.

555
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,222
Could you call someone? I'm sorry.

556
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,266
-Okay.
-Wait!

557
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,895
-Teacher!
-I'm okay. Hurry!

558
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,063
In here!

559
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,814
We'll take it from here! Leave, now!

560
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,983
-Wait.
-Sir, what's the matter?

561
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,486
-My student…
-Please calm down.

562
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,530
-Hold him tight.
-That bastard took the key!

563
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,050
Ms. Ji, show me your arm.

564
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,302
It's all right.

565
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,227
I'll do it myself.

566
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,743
You were surprised, weren't you?

567
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,997
He's been here for ten years.

568
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:24,630
Sometimes, he'll be fine and be like
the math professor he used to be.

569
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,591
I guess he wasn't feeling well today.

570
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,850
He doesn't recognize you?

571
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,521
Sometimes, he does.

572
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,648
Once in a while.

573
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,613
Let's come here again.

574
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,242
I'd like to talk to the professor more.

575
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,955
Sure. Let's come again.

576
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,962
Thanks to the professor,

577
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,466
I have a topic idea.

578
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,010
You do? What is it?

579
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,432
Not yet.

580
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,852
I'll tell you after I put it all together.

581
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,355
All right. I'll be patient.

582
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:24,940
Okay.

583
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,777
-Let's go. It's late.
-Okay.

584
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,462
You don't like my topic?

585
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,717
Can you handle it? It won't be easy.

586
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,470
But there are mathematicians
who proved it.

587
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,480
Roman Opalka, Maurits Escher,

588
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,649
Yayoi Kusama, and Van Gogh.

589
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,567
ROMAN OPALKA: POLISH PAINTER
MAURITS ESCHER: DUTCH GRAPHIC ARTIST

590
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,111
They're relevant to your topic.

591
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,948
YAYOI KUSAMA: JAPANESE INSTALLATION ARTIST
VINCENT VAN GOGH: DUTCH PAINTER

592
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,325
Did I pass?

593
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:19,119
Yes. It's an excellent topic.

594
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:25,209
But I don't know how to connect it
to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

595
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,168
I see.

596
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,796
Don't worry about that. I'll help you.

597
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,800
EXHIBITION

598
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,594
There are quite a few related exhibitions
opening right now.

599
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,055
Oh, it would be nice
if we could go there too.

600
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,349
-Go where?
-Jeju Island.

601
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,727
The exhibition there is
a place you must visit. Too bad.

602
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,480
But let's start with visiting these.

603
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,193
A PAINTER WHO DRAWS TIME

604
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,589
Ye-lin.

605
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,385
Would you like to go
to this exhibition together?

606
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,554
We're going there
to prepare for the speech.

607
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,890
We're going
to the research institute later.

608
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,350
Oh, you do?

609
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,812
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

610
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,223
Roman Opalka painted this in 1965

611
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,851
and started with drawing the number one.

612
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:07,936
For how long?

613
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,731
Until 2011 when he died.

614
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,360
This is one of his serial works.

615
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,988
"The idea of time was already present,

616
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,202
but it was a reversible time, similar
to an hour-glass or clock:

617
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,871
an atomization, as the repetitive
spatialization of reversible time."

618
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:32,670
"All my work is a single thing,
the description from one to infinity."

619
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,589
"A single thing,

620
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,550
a single life."

621
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,854
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

622
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,486
You're not preparing for the Olympics?

623
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:01,281
I saw Seung-yoo leave
with the math teacher after school.

624
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,408
What's it to you?

625
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,201
Beat him.

626
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,371
Beat Seung-yoo.

627
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,581
If he wins the Olympics,

628
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,292
that would be a hit to my pride
more than you winning it.

629
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:24,555
Infinite is the unknowable number
that will come last.

630
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:29,059
However, there will always be
an end and that's finite.

631
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,018
I see.

632
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:33,689
So it's both infinite and finite.

633
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:34,815
Right.

634
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:40,446
There's no exhibition
of Escher's works so that's too bad.

635
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,991
I know where we can find his works.

636
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,914
MATHEMATICIAN VISITING AN ART MUSEUM

637
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,963
You go up and down the stairs,
but there's no end.

638
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,799
It's like a Mobius strip.

639
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,509
Right.

640
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:07,264
The Penrose triangle is
an impossible object.

641
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:09,808
Do you know this painting?

642
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,604
Melencolia?

643
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,481
Yes.

644
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,566
That's the name of this painting.

645
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,943
Isn't it referring to depression?

646
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,111
That's right.

647
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,908
Well, depression refers to

648
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:31,997
feeling down and lethargic.

649
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,834
But when you keep spiraling downward,

650
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,629
you'll hit rock bottom.

651
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,382
You reach a state of nothingness.

652
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,593
When there's absolutely nothing,

653
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,679
you start hoping for a new beginning.

654
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,473
Is that why…

655
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,393
there's a ray of light shining here.

656
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,229
You're right.

657
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,232
He must have discovered something new.

658
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,400
Before the light vanishes.

659
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,539
You helped me decide my topic.

660
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:14,915
That's good to hear.

661
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,210
Gosh, it's pretty late.

662
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,181
Actually, I was hungry earlier.

663
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,684
I'm ready to dig in.

664
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,409
Seung-yoo, you make
a peculiar face when you focus.

665
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,663
When you're solving
a math problem, you do it.

666
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,332
And before when you were looking
at the art.

667
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,334
I like it.

668
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,670
-Here is your food.
-Thanks.

669
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,007
-Enjoy your food.
-Thank you.

670
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,926
Wow. It looks delicious. Let's eat.

671
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,178
Thanks.

672
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,225
Let's get home. It's really late.

673
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,310
Okay.

674
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,956
-Oh, my gosh.
-What?

675
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,249
Look at this.

676
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,835
What is this?

677
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,796
Isn't that Ms. Ji and Seung-yoo?

678
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,132
Who posted this face swap?

679
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,219
Gosh, I'm so impressed.

680
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,722
-Where did you find this photo?
-Hey Gyu-young!

681
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,225
I'll see you later.

682
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,063
I think you went too far.

683
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,023
I did? What did I do?

684
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,692
I saw what you posted. It's not cool.

685
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,070
Do you know who I saw last night?

686
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,780
Who did you see?

687
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,783
Ms. Ji and Seung-yoo were on a date.

688
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:13,950
A date?

689
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,704
It was a really late hour when I saw them.
It looked like they were dating.

690
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,500
They went to an exhibition yesterday
to prepare for the Olympics.

691
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,751
You're probably wrong.

692
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,295
Even if I'm wrong, I'll twist the facts.

693
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:27,756
What are you talking about?

694
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,008
Just wait and see.

695
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,804
I'll get Seung-yoo disqualified
from entering the Olympics.

696
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,109
PROF. JI PROVES THE FARRELL-JONES
CONJECTURE, IS HIS PROOF WRONG?

697
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,826
-This is amazing.
-Hey, it's high res.

698
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,953
-They're so into each other.
-What is it?

699
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,914
-Hey, what is this?
-What are they looking at?

700
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,582
Look at their pose.

701
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,043
Come on. My eyes.

702
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,211
-This is amazing.
-Hey.

703
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,171
She looks hot in a bikini.

704
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,507
-That's hot.
-Wow.

705
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,469
I saw Seung-yoo walking
behind Ms. Ji once.

706
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,596
He looked like he was tailing her.

707
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,973
-I knew it.
-Really?

708
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,182
You don't believe me? I really saw it.

709
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,893
-Why didn't you check it?
-You're insane.

710
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,605
-Yes, you should have gone up to him.
-He's right.

711
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,364
What's going on?

712
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,242
Hey Seung-yoo.

713
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,661
-What is it?
-What's the matter?

714
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,043
Delete it.

715
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,672
You piece of shit.

716
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:54,551
-Hey!
-Guys, please stop!

717
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,386
Stop it, Gyu-young.

718
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,804
You need to stop too.

719
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,306
Somebody hold him!

720
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,476
-Ms. Ji!
-Seung-yoo, that's enough. Break it up.

721
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,770
Seung-yoo and Gyu-young got into a fight?

722
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,355
Yes, they got into a physical altercation.

723
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:11,359
I think it was over this photo.

724
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,748
Why did you fight?

725
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,042
Gyu-young, speak up.

726
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,631
Answer me! Why did you fight?

727
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,095
Seung-yoo, tell me why you fought.

728
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,850
What's wrong with you guys?

729
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,186
Why aren't they saying anything?

730
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,362
Did you call for me?

731
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,158
-Did you see this too?
-Yes.

732
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,411
I heard that Gyu-young posted this.

733
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:07,290
Do you know why he did this?

734
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:15,257
So you know but it's difficult to tell me.

735
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,635
I didn't witness it myself.

736
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,222
Ye-lin, you're such a nice person.

737
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,474
Look at Gyu-young.

738
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,478
He responds quickly
because he sees Seung-yoo as a threat.

739
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,064
But you're hesitating
to say something about Seung-yoo.

740
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,945
This is why I can't trust you.

741
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,822
You're dismissed.

742
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,659
Gyu-young said
he saw Ms. Ji with Seung-yoo

743
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,870
walking together late at night.

744
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,123
-Gyu-young saw them?
-Yes.

745
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,042
He said they seemed very close.

746
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,711
Very close?

747
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,255
How so?

748
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,590
Speak up!

749
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,927
You want to take this
to the disciplinary board?

750
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:05,140
If you're suspended for bullying,
it'll be a permanent blemish.

751
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:11,021
If you're suspended,
you can't represent the school.

752
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,981
You don't care?

753
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,279
Ms. Kim.

754
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,241
Let me talk to them.

755
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,410
Will you do that?

756
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,247
Jang Gyu-young, Paik Seung-yoo.

757
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,249
Student Affairs will handle this.

758
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,168
Follow us.

759
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,427
They are in trouble now.

760
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:50,352
-Hello?
-Are you on your way?

761
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,353
What?

762
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,814
We're supposed to look
at wedding dresses at 6 p.m. today.

763
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,567
Oh, right. I'll hurry.

764
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,487
Come quickly. My mother is with me.

765
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,074
All right.

766
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:09,663
Ms. Kim, I have to go right now.

767
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:13,124
Could you tell me what will happen
to Seung-yoo and Gyu-young later?

768
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,335
Sure. I'll contact you.

769
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,463
Why didn't she say anything about
the apartment and furniture?

770
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:23,301
She appreciated it so much, of course.
She liked it very much.

771
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,638
I was going to tell you but I forgot.

772
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,891
Oh, you're such a dimwit.

773
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,728
She might think we bought the furniture
because we adore her so much.

774
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,107
I did it because I was afraid
she would have bad taste.

775
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:41,611
Mom, can't you warm up to her?
You approved of our marriage.

776
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,239
I didn't approve. We made a deal.

777
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,409
Don't forget your promise.

778
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:50,203
I gave my approval for this marriage

779
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,248
on the condition you follow
in your dad's footsteps.

780
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,626
Okay.

781
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,547
So Ms. Ji favors Seung-yoo.

782
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:04,426
And she's using the Olympics
as cover to be close to him?

783
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,636
That's how it goes?

784
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:08,388
Yes.

785
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,557
All right. You're dismissed.

786
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,184
What will happen to Seung-yoo?

787
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,269
Why do you ask?

788
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,355
You want him to be disqualified?

789
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,608
Mind your own business.

790
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,611
Focus on the Olympics instead.

791
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,572
And remember this.

792
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:30,785
I favor you much more

793
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:36,082
than Ms. Ji could ever favor Seung-yoo.

794
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,171
So I hope you'll repay me

795
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,715
for all I've done for you.

796
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,135
Yes, Director.

797
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:04,486
Student Affairs is counseling
Seung-yoo and Gyu-young.

798
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:05,612
Where is Ms. Ji?

799
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,863
She had to leave.

800
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:10,825
-She left?
-She had to tend to a personal matter.

801
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:15,789
She asked Ms. Kim to tell her
what will happen to the two boys.

802
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,042
Would you like to see the two?

803
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,169
No. Let's let them cool off.

804
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,755
-Ms. Ji was with Seung-yoo?
-Yes!

805
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,090
Gyu-young saw them.

806
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:28,051
It was past 10 p.m.
and they were walking together.

807
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,013
Just the two of them?
Late at night? Where?

808
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,431
I don't know.

809
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:37,936
Gyu-young said it looked
like they had a special relationship.

810
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,439
-That's insane!
-Hye-mi.

811
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,774
Mr. Han told me

812
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:47,445
that Ms. Ji pays special attention
to Seung-yoo.

813
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,656
-Special attention?
-Yes!

814
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:53,243
She insisted that Seung-yoo
had to enter the Olympics.

815
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,370
But they have a special relationship?

816
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:56,830
We can't allow this!

817
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,790
-Of course, not.
-Of course, not!

818
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:03,211
That teacher just joined the school
but she's acting weird.

819
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,254
Really.

820
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,132
It's Gyu-young's homeroom teacher.

821
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,844
Hello, Ms. Kim.

822
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,471
What?

823
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,433
Gyu-young got into a fight? Why?

824
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:29,946
You came?

825
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,906
I'm sorry for being late, Mother.

826
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,201
-Begin the fitting.
-Yes, ma'am.

827
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,828
-This way, please.
-Okay.

828
00:57:55,763 --> 00:58:01,603
MS. KIM JIN-HEE

829
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:04,481
MS. KIM JIN-HEE: PHOTO SENT

830
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,608
The bride-to-be is here.

831
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,575
That's perfect.

832
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,285
What do you think, Mom?

833
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,838
Could you take a look at who it is?

834
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,965
A teacher called Kim Jin-hee is calling.

835
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,135
-Hand it to me.
-Now?

836
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,053
Yes.

837
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,183
Yes, Ms. Kim?

838
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:42,894
You sent a text?

839
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,230
No, I'll check it now.

840
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:58,034
-Is something wrong?
-I have to hurry back to school.

841
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,620
I'm so sorry, Mother.

842
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,789
Something important came up. I need to go.

843
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,332
-I'm very sorry.
-Gosh.

844
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,252
Wait…

845
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,212
Mom!

846
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:13,091
-What's going on?
-I'm sorry. I'll tell you later.

847
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:16,844
Tell me now. You're not a homeroom teacher
so why do you need to go?

848
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,764
I'll explain everything later.
It's really important.

849
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,349
It's important?

850
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,143
More important than
our wedding preparations?

851
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,812
Let's go now.

852
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:28,648
Explain everything to me later.

853
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,359
It better be really important.

854
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:57,844
I'd like to see

855
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:01,931
Seung-yoo and talk to him.

856
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,057
Where is he?

857
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,977
That's not possible.
Student Affairs is counseling them.

858
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,186
Counseling?

859
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,815
Gyu-young got punched first.
Why should he be receiving counseling?

860
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:12,108
Please calm down.

861
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:20,783
-Are you the math teacher?
-Yes, I am.

862
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,829
Why did you create this problem?

863
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:29,083
The math club has been
very controversial. Did you know that?

864
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,921
You dropped students who had
higher scores. That was unfair.

865
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:37,050
And it's come to this now. I'm so furious.

866
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,177
Regardless of Ms. Ji's actions,

867
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:42,597
Gyu-young owes Ms. Ji an apology.

868
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:45,308
How could a student do such a thing?

869
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:48,102
Well, Ms. Ji must have
behaved unprofessionally.

870
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,606
Teachers have to be careful
about how they behave.

871
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,942
I don't have time for this.

872
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,488
I want to see my son and Seung-yoo.

873
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,031
And call his parents too.

874
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:03,201
I want an apology and disciplinary action.

875
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:06,954
My husband is
the news bureau chief at TJN.

876
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,667
If you don't want this
to be on the news, do as I say.

877
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,877
Right now.

878
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,755
-But…
-I said right now!

879
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:19,467
I see, so Gyu-young's dad
is a news bureau chief.

880
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,052
Then…

881
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:24,931
Can I report this to him?

882
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:33,064
-Gyu-young posted that?
-Yes.

883
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:35,900
-He's gone insane.
-Disseminating deep fake photos

884
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:38,277
without consent
is punishable under the law.

885
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,738
Since your husband is in the news bureau,

886
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,949
he probably knows how serious this is.

887
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:48,204
And this is a sexually derogatory image.

888
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:53,084
I could ask the Teacher's Rights Committee
to discipline the student.

889
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,168
Oh, no…

890
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,421
Ms. Ji.

891
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:59,924
The disciplinary action
may include demerits,

892
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:02,468
volunteer work, suspension,
or school transfer.

893
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,763
I see you're very angry. What now?

894
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,891
It's totally understandable.

895
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:13,688
I'll tell Gyu-young to apologize to you…

896
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:16,482
Seung-yoo is also a victim
in this incident.

897
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,110
I request a sincere apology
for both Seung-yoo and me

898
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:21,320
as well as a promise
that this won't happen again.

899
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:25,116
If that is not possible,
then I'll take this to the committee.

900
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,743
No, he'll apologize!

901
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:29,746
Of course, I agree.
He owes you an apology.

902
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:30,955
Don't you think so?

903
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:34,041
Where is Seung-yoo?

904
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:38,171
Gyu-young needs to say he's sorry.

905
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,758
Where is Seung-yoo, Ms. Kim?

906
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,929
WECLASS COUNSELING OFFICE

907
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,477
He wouldn't tell us anything.

908
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,855
He wouldn't explain why he hit him
nor would he write an apology.

909
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:32,183
Using violence is wrong
under any circumstances.

910
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:36,979
But…

911
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,482
You were right to be angry.

912
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,363
You have to get angry over this.

913
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,576
I'm glad…

914
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:56,040
to see you get angry and also smile.

915
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:03,714
So don't shut yourself off to others.

916
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:10,096
Don't hide who you are.

917
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,353
LETTER OF APOLOGY

918
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,947
Why didn't you tell the teachers?

919
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,158
That I posted the deep fake photo?
Why not tell them?

920
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:38,916
By any chance,

921
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,168
do you like Ms. Ji?

922
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,786
Really?

923
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,376
Can I really show you…

924
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,297
everything about me?

925
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,181
Isn't he that student? The umbrella kid.

926
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:18,849
Does Paik Seung-yoo like math teacher?

927
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:21,394
That crazy bastard.
I'm going to get him someday.

928
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,688
You can do well, right?

929
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,231
Let's try this together.

930
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,567
Ms. Ji Yoon-su can be very useful.

931
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,735
Remember that.

932
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:34,240
I envy him. I liked math,
but I was not gifted like Seung-yoo.

933
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:35,866
Then you probably know how I feel.

934
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:39,537
How it feels to compete against him.

935
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,248
I'm sorry. I don't think I can do this.

936
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:47,795
