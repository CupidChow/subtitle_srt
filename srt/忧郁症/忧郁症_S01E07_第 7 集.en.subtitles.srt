1
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,521
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,606
There she is! Ji Yoon-su!

3
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,358
How dare you!

4
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,987
FIRE TEACHER GUILTY OF IMMORAL ACTS

5
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:36,244
A female teacher
at a well-known private school in Gangnam

6
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,997
has been accused of having
an inappropriate relationship

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,290
with one of her students.

8
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,670
Pictures of her and her student
while on a trip together were shown

9
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,839
at her wedding,
stunning the wedding guests.

10
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,967
Everyone in the school knew about them.

11
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,804
You can't allow a teacher like that
to teach at any school.

12
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,556
The teacher was quickly fired

13
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,684
and the police are investigating
her involvement with the student.

14
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,561
TEACHER IS FIRED,
POLICE INVESTIGATION UNDERWAY

15
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:08,359
4 YEARS LATER

16
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,783
The mood on the set
is very different today.

17
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,576
I'm quite excited.

18
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,955
It's because of the special guest
we'll be having in a short moment.

19
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:05,542
That's right.
Our next guest has an impressive resume.

20
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,336
When he was ten,
he was invited to take courses at MIT.

21
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:12,674
He got his GED at the age of 18,
and went to Hankook University.

22
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,969
In 2020, he won the Henri Poincaré Prize
European Math Society Prize,

23
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,514
Ramanujan Prize, and other prizes
in the world of mathematics.

24
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:23,685
And he participated in the International
Mathematician Olympics in 2021.

25
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,436
So what were his results?

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,149
He's the first Korean
and the youngest person over to enter

27
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,317
the 2021 IMO
which was held in St. Petersburg

28
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,362
where he became the recipient
of the Lucifer Prize,

29
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,447
the Nobel Prize of Mathematics.

30
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:40,910
We introduce you to Paik Seung-yoo,
our guest of honor.

31
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,207
PAIK SEUNG-YOO, LUCIFER PRIZE WINNER,
APPEARED ON KIM SANG-WOOK'S PEOPLE REPORT

32
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,677
Ye-lin, we're ready when you are.

33
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,470
Okay. I'm coming.

34
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,850
"One goes into the first room,
and it's dark, completely dark."

35
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,853
"And finally, after six months or so,
you find the light switch."

36
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,104
"You turn it on, and suddenly,
it’s all illuminated."

37
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,357
"You can see exactly where you were."

38
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,153
That's a quote by Andrew Wiles
who spent seven years

39
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,864
to finally prove Fermata's Last Theorem.

40
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,991
So can you relate to what Wiles said?

41
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,870
Yes, partially.

42
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,289
How did you endure the dark mansion?

43
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,375
I waited for a particular moment.

44
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,005
The moment when the answer would find me

45
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,883
instead of having to look for the answer.

46
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,178
Just like how the problem found me

47
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,848
before I set out to find
a problem to solve.

48
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,063
You dropped out of high school,
got your GED,

49
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,231
and entered university at the age of 17.

50
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,816
While pursuing a bachelor's
and master's simultaneously,

51
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,528
you published a paper on a random Poincaré
conjecture inside a 3-sphere.

52
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,697
For that paper,
you received the Lucifer Prize.

53
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,908
You've accomplished so much so quickly.

54
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,576
Yes.

55
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,162
I wanted to hurry up
and become a grown-up.

56
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,247
A grown-up?

57
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,373
Yes. So that

58
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:12,794
I could make an impact
through my work and be known in my field.

59
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,254
And also…

60
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,050
so that someone would hear
about what I achieved.

61
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,679
That's the kind of adult
I wanted to become.

62
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,723
What would you like to accomplish next?

63
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,686
I wish…

64
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,067
I'm Sung Ye-lin, the school ambassador
for Hankook University.

65
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,278
I'll work hard for my university.

66
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,445
INVITATION TO HANKOOK UNIVERSITY

67
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:56,296
I'm at the TNN studio,
where a live show is being recorded.

68
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,425
Everyone, Seung-yoo,
who is the first Korean

69
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:04,095
and the youngest recipient
of the Lucifer Award, is my best friend.

70
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,473
Now you believe it?

71
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,809
That's all for today. Bye.

72
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,936
-Are you shooting a Vlog?
-Yes.

73
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,230
I hope you'll let me keep shooting.

74
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,566
We're going to get a lot of views.

75
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,319
I almost forgot. You got a letter.

76
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,948
"Congratulations on your achievement
made possible through hard work."

77
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,076
"Principal Noh Jung-ah
of Asung Academy of Mathematics and Arts."

78
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,453
Noh Jung-ah?

79
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,707
You're the most famous person
to have gone to Asung High.

80
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,000
So it's natural that she sent you this.

81
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,710
It says she's looking forward
to seeing you.

82
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,919
Do you have plans to meet her?

83
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,172
-Yes.
-Noh Jung-ah? Why would you meet her?

84
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,508
My daughter was in tears.

85
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:46,888
All of her friends go to
Asung Academy of Mathematics and Arts.

86
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,516
Except her…

87
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,028
Thank you.

88
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,624
What took you so long to meet me?

89
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,043
I'll do anything if you'll admit her.

90
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,921
How much would it take?

91
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,008
Mr. Kyung.

92
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,179
If you wanted my friendship,

93
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,307
I would treat your daughter like my own.

94
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,978
That would have made her the envy
of all the students in Hangok-dong.

95
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,110
Please, Principal.

96
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,282
Thank you, Principal.

97
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,754
Handle the transfer papers
for Kyung Soo-young.

98
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,548
She's the daughter of Minister Kyung.

99
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,424
-Hello.
-Hello.

100
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,261
Hey.

101
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,263
Ms. Yoo, sit here.

102
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,686
-You're late.
-Guess why I'm late?

103
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,188
I reserved that handbag.

104
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,606
It'll arrive next week.

105
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,192
And it's in
your favorite color, turquoise.

106
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,861
Thank you, Ms. Yoo.

107
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,363
Getting you
on the waiting list is no problem

108
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,283
if Yoo-chan can get into that clinic
with your daughter.

109
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,953
All right. I'll ask them to put Yoo-chan
on the top of the waiting list.

110
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,874
Thank you so much. I'll never forget this.

111
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,214
Have a seat.

112
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,427
Applause.

113
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,053
Happy Birthday to you.

114
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,560
Next on your schedule is giving
a lecture about your paper

115
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,688
to the Advanced Math Institute.

116
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,649
Oh, and you're not serious
about the wish you mentioned, right?

117
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,734
-I'm serious.
-You're crazy.

118
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,278
Lots of universities want you.
Why dream small?

119
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,529
Small?

120
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,323
Did you forget my field?

121
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,829
Let's begin with a Q and A session
with Paik Seung-yoo

122
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,500
regarding his paper that won him
the Lucifer Prize at the 2021 IMO.

123
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,508
We took a few questions
before the lecture.

124
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:32,595
"I came for your lecture because
I'm interested in Euclidean space."

125
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,641
"Could you recommend a book that
could help with my studies?"

126
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,061
Adolph Mueller
at the University of Bonn in Germany

127
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,689
wrote a well-written research paper
about Euclidean space.

128
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,691
I think reading
that paper will help a lot.

129
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,444
We have another question
from someone called "Calculus."

130
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,612
Could "Calculus" raise your hand?

131
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,075
I see. I think it's a lady.

132
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,879
What's going on?

133
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,137
What is it?

134
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,100
-Bye.
-Bye.

135
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,726
Good job.

136
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,645
I've been trying to contact
that person you asked about.

137
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,854
Yes, Professor.

138
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,815
But I'm not making any progress.

139
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,901
Please tell me if you hear anything.

140
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,861
But why is he that important to you?

141
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,573
He was my teacher.

142
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,242
Anyway, congratulations
on winning the prize. See you.

143
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,577
Take care.

144
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,081
-Could I have your autograph?
-Nobody has asked for my autograph before.

145
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,125
Just write down your name.

146
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,254
My name is Choi Shi-an.

147
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,882
-Why do you go by Calculus?
-My nickname?

148
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,051
A pebble.

149
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,262
It's the foundation of numbers.

150
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,059
Do you like that number? 1729?

151
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,228
It's the smallest number expressible

152
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,230
as the sum of two cubes

153
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,440
in two different ways.

154
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,941
It's what Ramanujan told Hardy

155
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,110
when he remarked that 1729
seemed like a dull number.

156
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,530
Can we take a selfie?

157
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,744
Thank you.

158
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,538
Hey, do you know that girl?

159
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,707
-No.
-Why did you act funny?

160
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,419
Hey, did Calculus remind you
of the math club?

161
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,462
Let's go.

162
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,091
-It was a pleasure.
-Take care.

163
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,470
Thank you. The new semester will begin,
so I'll see you at school soon.

164
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,722
-Happy Birthday to you.
-Take care.

165
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,099
-Take care.
-Please take care.

166
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,977
-See you.
-Bye.

167
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,690
Yes?

168
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,984
What did you say?

169
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,487
-Hey Kim Ji-na! Come out here!
-Soo-young.

170
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,822
-Soo-young!
-Hey Kim Ji-na! I said come out!

171
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,115
Come and look at my hair.

172
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,825
-Let go of me! Hey!
-Soo-young.

173
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,370
Come on! Really!

174
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,997
Kim Ji-na did this to me. Ji-na!

175
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,707
-Soo-young.
-Let go of me!

176
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,709
-Hello.
-Where is Ji-na?

177
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,378
-This way, please.
-Hey, come out!

178
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,840
I'm going to sue Ji-na!

179
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,635
For assault.

180
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,304
Get ready to hire a lawyer.

181
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,308
-You know who my dad is, don't you?
-Yes, of course.

182
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,019
He came to see me earlier

183
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,730
and asked for a special favor.

184
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,110
He wished that I would look after you.

185
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:03,055
Soo-young got the top score
on the test today.

186
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,391
So the instructor asked her
what she wanted.

187
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,852
She said she wanted a ticket

188
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,479
to the meet and greet with the Xboys.

189
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,607
She didn't want anything else.
She wanted my ticket.

190
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,444
That wench.

191
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,663
Is this room…

192
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,541
soundproof?

193
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,220
Mom, put down the scissors.

194
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,638
Tell me.

195
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,183
What do you want?

196
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,103
Do you want to go live with your dad?

197
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,440
Do you?

198
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,484
I divorced your dad because of his debts.

199
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,777
I don't know where he is.
Will you go to him?

200
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,821
No, I don't want to live with him.

201
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,781
Are you going to act like this again?

202
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,577
Do you want to see me kill myself?

203
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,663
I won't ever do it again, Mom.

204
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,708
Mom.

205
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,286
-You guys dance well.
-So do you.

206
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,122
I think I'll break my back. Hey Hyun-jae!

207
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,834
-Where's Seung-yoo?
-What?

208
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,087
-Is Seung-yoo coming?
-No, he's not coming.

209
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,548
He was on TV today.

210
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,925
Now that he's famous,
he doesn't have time for us.

211
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,344
Hey, is it true that
he'll become a teacher?

212
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,638
-A teacher?
-He said so in his TV interview.

213
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,723
He said his dream is to become a teacher.

214
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,269
Hey, since we're all here,
let's have a toast.

215
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,728
-Sure.
-One, two, three.

216
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,938
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

217
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,608
Let's dance!

218
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,910
That girl posted the selfie
she took with you.

223
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,262
#BOOK RECOMMENDATION

224
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,939
This is the book I recommend.

225
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,001
You'll press charges?

226
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,128
Why would you do that?
She didn't do anything wrong!

227
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,755
You really don't know?

228
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,299
Drop the charges immediately.

229
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,552
Right. You're at fault.

230
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,099
You thought I didn't know
you had a crush on her.

231
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,226
Honey, that's not the point.

232
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,394
Yes, I admit it.

233
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,438
I had a crush on her.

234
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,149
It's my fault. She's just…

235
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,027
a victim in all of this.

236
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:31,031
So don't press charges against her!

237
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,327
She's the victim?

238
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,997
She's the perpetrator
and you're the victim.

239
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,458
Get your head on straight, son!

240
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,212
Ms. Ji!

241
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,717
I'll prove it.

242
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,095
I'll prove it myself.

243
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,057
Ms. Ji!

244
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,727
Could you excuse us? Passing through.

245
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,187
Ms. Ji…

246
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,151
Where is Ms. Ji?

247
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,363
She moved out of her apartment.
Where did she go?

248
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,615
-She's not answering her phone too.
-What is it?

249
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,909
You have to see her?

250
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,830
Do you think she would want to see you?

251
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,917
You think you're the victim, don't you?

252
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,545
I strongly disagree.

253
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,547
You caused this to her.

254
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,301
You're the reason this happened.

255
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,265
Please don't hurt her more.

256
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,060
Please protect her…

257
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,354
from harm.

258
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,066
Please.

259
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,571
I have a little favor too.

260
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,491
Get lost!

261
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:00,329
And don't ever show your face here
again or go anywhere near Yoon-su.

262
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,916
If you weren't a minor,

263
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,919
I would have beaten you up already.

264
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,784
WHERE ARE YOU, MS. JI?
PLEASE CALL ME BACK.

265
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,288
MS. JI YOON-SU

266
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,709
The number you have dialed does not exist.

267
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,754
Please check the number again.

This isn't a library stamp, is it?

274
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,173
No, those books were donated.

275
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,591
Donated?

276
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,344
-Who donated them and when?
-Just a moment.

277
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,015
It was an anonymous donor.
We don't know the donor.

278
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,799
Do you know this painting?

00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,848

280
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,565
Hello.

281
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,080
How have you been?

282
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,224
You haven't changed, Professor.

283
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,856
Could you read this paper?

284
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:03,293
It's such beautiful proof
that's worth more than this prize.

00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,393
I used this fountain pen
to write the proof.

287
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,110
Can I make a copy of this?

288
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,113
I'd like to spend more time
to go through it.

289
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,990
I brought that copy for you, Professor.

290
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,493
Because I worked on that proof
because of you.

291
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,497
I see.

292
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,124
What problem will you work on next?

293
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,172
Did you have a nice stroll?

294
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,216
-Yes, I'll take him back to his room.
-Okay.

295
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,678
You're having a great day, aren't you?
Your daughter also came, Professor.

296
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,513
-His daughter?
-Yes, she came.

297
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,101
You didn't see her?

298
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,311
No.

299
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,105
How often does she come by?

300
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,065
Usually twice a month.

301
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,872
I guess I'm not leaving today.

302
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,374
I'll wait for her until she shows up.

303
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:13,131
Maybe she won't come if I wait here.

304
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,594
She's so stubborn.

305
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,889
She's really stubborn. Isn't she?

306
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,522
I'll have to give up.

307
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,817
Because you can't miss
a visit from her due to me.

308
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,780
I'll come again, Professor.

309
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,196
It's been a long time.

310
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,414
How have you been?

311
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,337
Which school do you teach at?

312
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,506
I'm no longer a teacher.

313
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,220
Then what kind of work do you do?

314
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,596
How did you find this nursing home?

315
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,600
I asked the professor's
former colleagues if they knew.

316
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,646
I wanted to show him my paper.

317
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,024
Thanks.

318
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,570
And congratulations.

319
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,991
I wish you won't come here anymore.

320
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,037
That's it?

321
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,041
I won the Lucifer Prize.

00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,420
If I were you, I'd give a compliment,

323
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,717
a pat on the back or say I'm proud.

324
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,560
I won't ask you where you live
or what kind of work you do,

325
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,731
even though I'm curious.

326
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,275
But instead,

327
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,862
I'll come here again.

328
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,948
I made a promise to the professor.

329
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,244
I'll see you again.

330
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,394
Sorry for being late.
Something came up on my way.

331
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,438
It's been such a long time.

332
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,361
I saw the interview you gave on TV…

333
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,488
-I'd like an Americano.
-Yes, sir.

334
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,700
What were you saying?

335
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,705
Did you find it uncomfortable
when I called you?

336
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:05,423
I wasn't sure if you would be willing
to take a meeting with me.

337
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,635
Please go on. Why did you wish to see me?

338
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,011
Excuse me.

339
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,850
Thank you.

340
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,813
I’d like to make you an offer.

341
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:27,904
The freshman class of Asung Academy
of Mathematics and Arts

342
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,156
have no upperclassmen.

343
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,912
I'm starting a mentoring program
drawn from graduates of Asung High

344
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,748
to help students with their studies
and give career advice.

345
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,501
What do you think?

346
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,045
I don't know.

347
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,130
I'm not interested.

348
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,346
I'd like to propose a different offer.

349
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,103
An administrative officer
will call you soon.

350
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,771
Okay.

351
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,935
Hello, everyone.

352
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,187
I'm Principal Noh Jung-ah

353
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,522
of the Asung Academy
of Mathematics and Arts.

354
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:55,283
It's been 200 days
since Asung Academy has opened,

355
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,702
and we are now heading
into the second semester.

356
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,121
We have very special guests here today

357
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,623
as we begin the new semester.

358
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,961
They are graduates of Asung High,
which precedes Asung Academy.

359
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,221
Talented graduates of Asung High

360
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,015
will join our school as mentors.

361
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:24,145
Now I would also like to introduce to you

362
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,022
a very special teacher.

363
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,402
-My goodness!
-No way!

364
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,782
Is that really Paik Seung-yoo?

365
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,867
-Paik Seung-yoo?
-The winner of the Lucifer Prize?

366
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,244
-Yes.
-Paik Seung-yoo?

367
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,593
Nice to meet you. I'm Paik Seung-yoo.

368
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,146
When I went to Asung High,
which is the predecessor of Asung Academy,

369
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,606
Principal Noh,

370
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:12,276
who was a director back then,

371
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,530
said luck trumps effort.

372
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,952
I agree with that statement.

373
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,455
Because I was able to come this far
thanks to luck.

374
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,416
I was lucky to be born with a gift.

375
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:34,006
I am standing here before you
to share my gift which I lucked into.

376
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,969
I will share it with you all,
so make use of it as much as you wish.

377
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,731
You hired Paik Seung-yoo
to teach math at the academy?

378
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,066
Are you scared?

379
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,236
I don't think it's a good idea.

380
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,738
Do you really think

381
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:01,492
he wouldn't know
who outed Ms. Ji that led to her firing?

382
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:05,037
Is there any evidence
that could prove Ye-lin cheated?

383
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,165
No.

384
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,293
Ms. Ji sued the school, alleging that
we were involved in cheating,

385
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,128
but the court dismissed the charges.

386
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:15,089
Even if he were to bring it up again,
the case will go nowhere.

387
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,134
Everyone in Hangok-dong
knows about the affair.

388
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,845
What if parents dislike him as a teacher?

389
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:24,056
We're talking about Paik Seung-yoo.
Who would dare?

390
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,102
Seung-yoo is unbelievable.

391
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,522
He was offered jobs at famous colleges,
but he chose a random high school?

392
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,648
A random high school?

393
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,610
Hey, he majored in Math Education.
You don't know what you're talking about.

394
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,652
It's crazy.

395
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,530
Isn't it? If I were him,
I'd teach in the US or the UK.

396
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,282
-Hey, guys!
-Hey, you came.

397
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,492
-Hey, I heard Seung-yoo is here.
-Yes.

398
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,536
That teacher seems different, right?

399
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,289
Mr. Paik. Why didn't you call me?

400
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,749
Seung-yoo, long time no see.

401
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,751
-How have you all been?
-I saw you on TV.

402
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,753
You're a celebrity now.

403
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,463
I'm thirsty. Let's go to a cafe.

404
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,506
-I have a class to teach right now.
-I see.

405
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,634
Let's get together
for dinner or something.

406
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,012
-Yes. You'll treat us, right?
-I'd like to treat you to my fist.

407
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,973
Jeez. Why do you always
mooch off of other people?

408
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,893
-Come on.
-Buddy.

409
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,979
-It's been a while, hasn't it?
-What? Yes.

410
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,856
What is an independent life then?

411
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,941
I'll see you around.

412
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,610
Don't pretend you're considering it.

413
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,861
Hey, Hyun-jae should treat us today.

414
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,697
-And you?
-What?

415
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,076
-Do you have to go too?
-No. Let's go have some coffee.

416
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,912
-Let's go.
-Okay.

417
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,372
Boss. Let's go.

418
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,831
So it'll be your treat then?

419
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,668
I'm telling you it's correct.

420
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,132
Ji-na, what are you doing later today?

421
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,218
-I don't know.
-Let's go to a study cafe.

422
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,054
-I'll think about it.
-Why? Do you have any plans?

423
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,108
Where did you get this book?

424
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,859
At a used bookstore.

425
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,028
RIGHT PATH OF MATH

426
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,906
Old books are good teachers.

427
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,582
Since we're on the topic,
I'll talk about a book.

428
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,919
The Man Who Knew Infinity.

429
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:21,674
It's a collection of notes written by
Indian mathematician, Srinivasa Ramanujan.

430
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,926
That book is no longer published.

431
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,344
It's not available.

432
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,929
That's right. I had to borrow this copy.

433
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:31,267
You can easily find this book
at the library or used bookstore.

434
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,769
I want you to write a book report
by next week after reading this book.

435
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,272
You can write as many pages as you want.

436
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,190
-Understand?
-Okay.

437
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,817
Then let's start class.

438
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,405
Choi Shi-an.

439
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,745
What's going on?

440
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,288
Does she know Mr. Paik?

441
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,498
I wonder how he knows her name.

442
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,084
We meet again.

443
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,504
-It’s a small world.
-I saw your academic records.

444
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:05,009
You won quite a few math meets
and your grades are good.

445
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,136
How do you study math?

446
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,473
-I study by myself.
-By yourself?

447
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,059
You don't go to any cram schools?

448
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,978
Well, you saw my academic records.

449
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,190
I'm here on a scholarship since my family
couldn't afford the tuition.

450
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,026
-We have no money for cram schools.
-There's something I want to ask you.

451
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,239
So that I could make an impact

452
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,742
and that someone would
hear about what I achieved.

453
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,660
That's the kind of
adult I wanted to become.

454
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,832
-Ji Yoon-su.
-What?

455
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,545
Mom, did you hear anything about Ms. Ji?

456
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,965
Why are you bringing up her name?

457
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,425
That was a long time ago.

458
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:50,513
Nobody has seen her
after she was fired from the school

459
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,515
and her fiance called off their wedding.

460
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,810
-Yes, I know that but--
-Ye-lin.

461
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,520
Is this about Seung-yoo?

462
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:58,854
Don't think about it.

463
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:03,359
Would Seung-yoo still be in love
with Ms. Ji after four years have passed?

464
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,903
I'm not going to talk about her.

465
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:09,198
Since he's a famous mathematician,
he'll probably be a good teacher.

466
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,992
If he can help Yoo-chan
get better at math,

467
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,744
then I'm fine with that.

468
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,912
Understand?

469
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,465
Ma'am, Paik Seung-yoo is
our new math teacher.

470
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,677
And he asked me if I knew you.

471
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,185
I told him I didn't know you.
I'll never tell him.

472
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,479
And Ma'am…

473
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,858
Do you know this book called,
The Man Who Knew Infinity?

474
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,776
I have to write an essay about it.

475
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,283
I have that book.

476
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:55,536
Amazing. I knew you'd have it.

477
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,039
I know. I don't know what to do.

478
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,709
Choi Shi-an.

479
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,545
Are you here on a scholarship?

480
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,257
We had to study so hard
since elementary school to get in.

481
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:13,762
-But you got on through luck.
-So you don't pay any tuition, right?

482
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:18,017
That means my parents
are subsidizing your scholarship.

483
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,060
-Should I stab you?
-What?

484
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,271
What did you say?

485
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,774
In the middle school I went to,

486
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,153
I'd stab a kid with this pencil
if they got on my nerves.

487
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:32,823
What's going on?

488
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,493
Ji-na, she's here on a scholarship.

489
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,957
So what? You're privileged but she's not?

490
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,544
-Then how did you get transferred?
-What?

491
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,048
-What do you mean?
-You…

492
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,051
look better with short hair.

493
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:55,888
Hey.

494
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,973
Do you have another one of those?

495
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,893
So I can stab someone I don't like, too.

496
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,155
She's not at our level
just because we go to the same school.

497
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,740
She can't compete.

498
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,034
Let's not bother with her.

499
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,456
I'd like to thank you again
for choosing our school when you had

500
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,832
so many better offers.

501
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,710
The honor is mine.

502
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:30,381
Thank you for accepting me
without any prejudice.

503
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:36,929
I'm sorry about that shameful incident.

504
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:42,142
You had to drop out of Asung High
despite being so talented.

505
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,855
It seems like
a lot of time has passed, indeed.

506
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,441
I see your memory of it is fuzzy.

507
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,779
The school tried very hard to keep me
from dropping out.

508
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,905
I mean…

509
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,201
For the sake of my future…

510
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,164
It was my decision to drop out.

511
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,874
The school didn't dismiss me.

512
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,920
We have a global class

513
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,840
for the gifted, and they prepare
for international admissions.

514
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:17,219
I was wondering if you could have them
participate in a research paper with you.

515
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:20,514
They're the top students at our school.

516
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:25,102
Sounds good. I was going to pick
a research team anyway.

517
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:28,564
-I already chose a research topic.
-You have? What is the topic?

518
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,692
I'll tell you once it's finalized.

519
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,830
He's different from her.

520
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,167
PAIK SEUNG-YOO, WINNER OF LUCIFER PRIZE,
CHOOSES UNEXPECTED TEACHING JOB

521
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,210
HIRED AS MATH TEACHER
AT ASUNG ACADEMY OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTS

522
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,694
Where did that book go?

523
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,071
RAMANUJAN, INDIA'S MATHEMATICAL GENIUS

524
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,656
See you tomorrow.

525
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,574
-Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

526
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,451
All right. Mr. Paik Seung-yoo.

527
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,911
-What?
-Let's take a selfie together.

528
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,537
-Yes?
-All right.

529
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:28,457
One, two, three. Smile.

530
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,084
See you.

531
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,377
Bye.

532
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,003
Goodness.

533
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:34,672
Gosh, Teacher.

534
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:38,133
I never imagined I'd be reunited
with a student of mine like this.

535
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,427
You used to… I meant Mr. Paik.

536
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,054
Were you always in a hurry?

537
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,932
-How have you been?
-I'm getting older.

538
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,725
-Aren't you heading home?
- I will.

539
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,103
Don't overwork yourself, Mr. Paik.

540
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,980
I'm totally exhausted after work.

541
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,900
These are vitamins I take. Try one.

542
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:58,654
It's in a jelly form. Very tasty.

543
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,409
-It's delicious.
-You can have this.

544
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,868
By the way, Ms. Kim,

545
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,580
can I see the student records
from the last semester?

546
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,290
Here they are.

547
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,295
You're working hard. Don't work too late.

548
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,463
See you tomorrow.

549
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,427
2021 APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION

550
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,055
What problem will you work on next?

551
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:31,186
I'm thinking about working
on a proof I failed to prove before.

552
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,312
You'll try again?

553
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,731
I just have to be careful about one issue.

554
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,983
What is

555
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,818
that one issue?

556
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,196
Not to make the same mistake twice.

557
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,120
2021 APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION

558
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,333

2021 APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION

562
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:10,934
You didn't leave yet?

563
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,769
I had something to take care of.

564
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:13,896
Okay. See you.

565
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,190
Seung-yoo.

566
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:18,859
What?

567
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:20,736
Are you happy to see me?

568
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,196
What?

569
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,116
Did you mean it
when you said it was nice to see me?

570
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,412
Of course.
It's been four years, after all.

571
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,664
Why would I not be glad to see you?

572
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,294
I'll see you around. Bye.

573
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,762
You didn't go?

574
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,181
I came to ask you something.

575
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,228
PRINCIPAL NOH JUNG-AH

576
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,854
"You'll get your cover blown."

577
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,774
That's what you told me before.

578
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,985
You told me to hide it
or else people would find out.

579
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,487
Are you afraid?

580
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,822
I'm not the only one who should be.

581
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:10,494
After that day four years ago,
we're on the same boat.

582
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,163
-Same boat?
-You disagree?

583
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,749
Now look at you.

584
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:18,544
You hired Seung-yoo
because you have a counter plan, right?

585
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,420
I trust you do.

586
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,548
You still have trouble sleeping?

587
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,343
I heard you've been
seeing a doctor due to insomnia.

588
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,595
You need to be braver.

589
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,390
And accept reality.

590
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,018
Seung-yoo is a famous mathematician,
and I need him on our faculty.

591
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,689
I sleep well these days.

592
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,150
Don't worry about me.
Keep an eye on Seung-yoo.

593
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,043
-What is it?
-I need you to look into something.

594
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,129
Like what?

595
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:05,757
A cram school. It's called Sammoo Academy.

596
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,178
I can't find any signage,
billboards, or who teaches there.

597
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,308
It operates a secret membership.

598
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,727
But their lessons aren't special.

599
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,105
It's the clinic they have that is special.

600
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,940
The director would like to see you.

601
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,822
Jenny's mother called to say thank you.

602
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:30,115
And…

603
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:35,078
she was asking if you could include
this student on the waiting list?

604
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,127
APPLICANT: SUNG YOO-CHAN,
PARENT: YOO HYE-MI

605
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:50,802
Really? Then Yoo-chan
can get into the clinic?

606
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,388
Oh, I know that, of course.

607
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:56,016
I know how hard it is
to get on the waiting list.

608
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,770
Hey, I really appreciate this.
I'll treat you to a fancy dinner.

609
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,481
Yes. Yoo-chan is here. Bye.

610
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,610
Yoo-chan.

611
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,946
I got you into that famous clinic.

612
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,658
-That math clinic?
-Yes, that one.

613
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,785
Mom,

614
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,954
I'm really tired.
Can I skip tutoring and just go home?

615
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,915
No, you can't.

616
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,376
Gyu-young always got
the top score in math.

617
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,878
It's your first day of tutoring,
so you can't miss it.

618
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,755
But I just finished cram school.

619
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,507
How can I handle another class?

620
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,093
Don't pout! Get ready to go. Really.

621
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,512
I have to go to a shoot right now.
My agent is waiting for me.

622
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:36,598
I have so many things to do in a day.
Don't you see how hard I'm working?

623
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,183
-Jeez.
-Okay. Let's go.

624
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,559
Let's go.

625
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,353
You're going.

626
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,905
PAIK SEUNG-YOO TO TEACH MATH
AT ASUNG ACADEMY

627
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,743
There's really nothing going on?

628
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,581
You're being framed? It's a vendetta?

629
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,168
Are you suspecting me
or trying to confirm?

630
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,671
Does it matter how I pose the question?

631
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,131
My answer is the same.

632
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,343
I'm being framed.
I think it's a vendetta against me.

633
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,388
-Seung-yoo and I…
-That name!

634
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,391
Don't say his name.

635
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,604
I told you to be careful
and never give him any ideas.

636
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,023
But what are those pictures
of you and him?

637
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,494
Now listen to what I'm going to say.

638
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,207
This is just a small incident.

639
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:45,959
It's nothing.

640
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:51,006
It happens all the time.
A student's crush on his teacher.

641
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,302
That's what you tell the police.

642
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:59,139
Your student had a crush
and crossed the line.

643
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,058
You're a victim in this case. Understand?

644
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,228
I can't say that.

645
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,814
Why not?

646
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,652
But it's the truth. He had a crush on you.

647
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,906
So why can't you say that? Why?

648
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,701
I don't want to

649
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,913
blame Seung-yoo for everything

650
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,916
and turn a blind eye

651
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,168
to what transpired.

652
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,213
Even if

653
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,632
you will risk

654
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,051
our relationship…

655
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,137
and our future?

656
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,076
You're working out too hard, I think.

657
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,058
You heard about Paik Seung-yoo?

658
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,811
He's a math teacher at Asung Academy now.

659
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,480
-I wonder why he chose that job.
-Whatever he's thinking,

660
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,024
I hope he's not going
to interfere with our work.

661
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,488
Who made the first move?

662
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,408
Was it Seung-yoo
who chose to teach at Asung

663
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,160
or did Noh Jung-ah approach him?

664
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,162
It could be both.

665
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,332
My half-sister would partner

666
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,002
with my parent's sworn enemy
if it would benefit her.

667
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,797
Do you think Yoon-su knows?

668
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:57,841
That Seung-yoo is back?

669
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:03,680
Did you hear anything from her?

670
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,643
No.

671
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,152
PRINCIPAL NOH JUNG-AH

672
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,703
-Yes?
-I dug up some info about that academy.

673
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,747
Don't be surprised with what I tell you.

674
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,124
It's for real.

675
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,084
This is solid information.

676
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,129
Sure, then take care of that. Okay, bye.

677

AIDE KIM

678
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,092
You're going to exercise?

679
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,178
-Yes.
-I need to take a shower.

680
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,304
Sure.

681
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,643
Honey. Your watch…

682
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:56,399
What? Send the address?

683
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,443
Who is it?

684
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:01,071
SEND ME THE ADDRESS

685
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,822
HANGOK-DONG 24, SUNSTONE CITY

686
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,576
My watch.

687
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,543
You left your watch here.

688
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,128
Yes.

689
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,763
THE MAN WHO KNEW INFINITY

690
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,432
OUT OF STOCK

691
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,602
Did someone clear out the stock?
They're out of stock.

692
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,774
What now? If I hadn't told you
I had the book,

693
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,401
you could have found it by now.

694
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,443
It's all right.

695
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:45,198
I don't think I can keep up
with all the assignments anyway.

696
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,159
-I can't find it.
-What do you mean?

697
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:53,415
Well, you know the students at Asung
have a privileged background.

698
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:55,875
Don't worry.

699
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,086
I'm not going to
act like a loser at school.

700
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:03,925
I'll get going.

701
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,430
I almost forgot.

702
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,641
The new textbook is really good.

703
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:12,767
Study hard.

704
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,687
And Ma'am, do you know Paik Seung-you,

705
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,314
-by any chance--
-Shi-an.

706
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,317
Remember the promise you made, right?

707
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:26,489
That promise was the condition
for waiving your cram school fees.

708
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:30,243
I'm not supposed to tell anyone your name.

709
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,996
Keep that promise.

710
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,414
I will.

711
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,338

Eighth floor.

715
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,290
Nice to meet you. I'm Noh Jung-ah.

716
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:02,127
I've heard a lot of good things
about you, Ms. Noh.

717
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,378
Please have a seat.

718
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,090
What brings you here?

719
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,925
I'm sorry for coming so late.

720
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,218
I've wanted to meet you.

721
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,553
I just heard

722
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:16,891
something very surprising, you see.

723
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,106
Now I would also like to

724
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:26,860
introduce to you a very special teacher.

725
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:42,500
Amazing. They posted her photo.

726
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,710
You're so pretty.

727
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,753
You're pretty and go to Hankook Uni.
You have it all.

728
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:46,963
Is this a "girlfriend-like photo", right?

729
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,969
Are you crazy?

730
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,139
What?

731
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,186
It was you. Ye-lin.

732
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:02,896
Are you okay?

733
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,900
You didn't say hi to me at school.

734
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,611
I haven't seen you
since you graduated, you know.

735
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,280
Satisfied?

736
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,782
I wish you won't act like you know me.

737
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,164
What's gotten into her?

738

It's closing time.
Please get your things in order.

741
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:37,991
We meet again.

742
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:46,708
-Good night.
-Bye.

743
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,251
-See you.
-Bye.

744
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,509
What?

745
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,203
Why did you choose that school?

746
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,373
If you have another purpose
for teaching there, then don't do it.

747
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,209
Principal Noh Jung-ah
of the Asung Academy came to see me.

748
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,211
I'm going to write a paper.

749
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,214
And I'm thinking about picking
a few students to work together on it.

750
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,466
What do you want?

751
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,176
The police station?

752
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:42,138
Why is Mr. Paik paying
special attention to this student?

753
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,974
We'll have to find out.

754
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,143
I know that expression.

755
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,687
I want to make you smile.

756
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:55,151
