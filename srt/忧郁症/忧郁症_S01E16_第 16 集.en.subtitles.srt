00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:21,354
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,491
For any integer n is three or more,

3
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:37,537
the equation xn plus yn equals to zn

4
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,082
has no positive integer solutions.

5
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,377
It's a simple theorem, isn't it?

6
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,921
You probably think
you can prove it easily.

7
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:51,843
But no one could solve it
for over 350 years.

8
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,847
Finally, a British mathematician
solved it after seven years.

9
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,098
For seven years?

10
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,101
He spent seven years trying
to solve one problem?

11
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,978
That's correct. To prove this theorem…

12
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:08,193
After he provided proof for the theorem
after seven long years,

13
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,778
he said,

14
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,697
"The first seven years
I worked on this problem,

15
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,992
I loved every minute of it."

16
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,541
-Ms. Ji.
-Yes?

17
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,084
I finished reading this book.

18
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,044
A MATHEMATICIAN'S APOLOGY
BY G.H.HARDY

19
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,338
You did? How did you like it?

20
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:32,217
I found out there was
beauty and ugly in mathematics.

21
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,595
What do you think
is beautiful mathematics?

22
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,263
Math that is like a constellation.

23
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,224
A constellation?

24
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,017
He says so in the book.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,271
"A mathematical proof should resemble
a simple and clear-cut constellation."

26
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,439
That's right.

27
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,983
You read the book thoroughly.

28
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,111
Would you like me to
recommend another book?

29
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,028
Sure.

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,867
Here.

31
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,371
What is this book about?

32
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,665
It's a story about a mathematician.

33
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,584
Despite facing errors and unfairness,

34
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,380
he forged on resolutely.

35
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,675
It's a story about his proof.

36
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:20,598
TIME TO PROVE

37
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,225
AUTHOR: PAIK SEUNG-YOO

38
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,315
NATIONAL MATH MUSEUM AND
ASUNG ACADEMY OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTS MOU

39
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,735
After we look through the evidence
obtained from the seizure of documents,

40
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,156
we may press more charges
on top of your illegal conduct

41
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,325
which includes lobbying
for the math museum project,

42
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,036
influencing hiring of personnel,
and misappropriation of a state grant.

43
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,793
Who could have done this?

44
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,588
Let's begin with the allegations
surrounding the grant.

45
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,590
Do you admit to embezzling committee funds

46
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,175
by leveraging the MOU that was signed
with the launch committee?

47
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,596
How can you accuse me of embezzlement
for some pocket change?

48
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,598
You find it unfair?

49
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,019
It was all because of money?

50
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,731
Is there any other reason then?

51
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,066
You appointed Professor Cha
as the committee head

52
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,819
so that you could embezzle
the committee funds, didn't you?

53
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,697
I'm warning you.
Don't even think about hurting Yoo-chan.

54
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,867
So insolent.

55
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,327
What did you say?

56
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:27,290
Mr. Yoo, if you look
at the allocation of the fund…

57
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,928
Look here, Ms. Noh!
Are you even listening to me?

58
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:49,354
Since a portion of the launch
committee funds were allocated

59
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:53,775
to promoting the math museum,
it wasn't improper

60
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,777
to spend it on Asung academy students.

61
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,279
It is true that
I recommended Professor Cha,

62
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,698
but I didn't exert influence
to have him hired.

63
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,575
As an educator, I was trying to build

64
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,161
a national museum
to raise interest in math education

65
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,414
to foster bright and talented people.

66
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,792
I'm very dismayed that you are accusing me

67
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,836
of giving bribes and lobbying

68
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,464
for my own personal gain.

69
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,551
Mr. Shin Seung-jae,
do you admit to the charges?

70
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:25,139
I was never interested
in the Math Museum in the first place.

71
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,934
It's Principal Noh's idea
and she planned to build it.

72
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,270
You're saying
that a private school principal

73
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,107
was able to secure state funds
for a museum project all by herself?

74
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,945
She deceived me by portraying the project
as being beneficial to math and academia.

75
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,739
Senator Sung Min-joon vouched for her,

76
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,576
but it turned out they were doing it
for their own personal benefit.

77
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,746
If there was any illegal conduct
in the launch of the museum project,

78
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,292
wouldn't Education Minister Shin
who oversaw the task force team,

79
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,920
and Professor Cha,
who chaired the committee

80
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,506
be the ones behind it?

81
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,842
Didn't Minister Shin
and Principal Noh lobby you

82
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,720
to pass the budget for the museum project?

83
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,762
Now look here.

84
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,097
I merely set up a meeting

85
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,310
between the minister and principal
to help my district.

86
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,270
Why do you think I am cooperating despite

87
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,064
having legislative immunity
as a sitting senator?

88
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,900
I'm here because I've got nothing to hide.

89
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,236
I am completely innocent.

90
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,032
Didn't you gain from inside information
you had as the committee chair?

91
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,200
I'm a professor.

92
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,954
I only focus on research and nothing else.

93
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,166
Your wife, Kim Young-sun,
recently purchased a plot of land

94
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:37,211
that had been chosen
to be the site of the museum.

95
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,171
Well…

96
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,091
Unlike me,
my wife is very financially savvy.

97
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,761
However, I didn't provide her
with any inside information.

98
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,429
And I don't have the money
to buy such land.

99
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,513
INSPECTING ROOM

100
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,477
Why you, Senator Sung!
I've been waiting for this day!

101
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,479
-Look here! You bastard!
-Minister…

102
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,939
Don't be a disgrace!
What do you think you're doing?

103
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,776
A disgrace? You're the one
pretending to be innocent!

104
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,153
How dare you try to slip
out of this like a weasel?

105
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,906
Why didn't you stop
your aide from talking?

106
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,076
I found out the whistleblower
is your aide, Ryu Sung-jae.

107
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,245
How could he betray you like that?

108
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,290
Are you saying this is my fault?
You bastard!

109
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,709
-Let go of me.
-Please.

110
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,170
Get out of my way!
I'll give you a piece of my mind!

111
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,547
-Let go!
-Senator! Restrain yourself!

112
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,694
-What is this?
-What?

113
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,156
You need to see this.

114
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,623
Je-ni, did you see this?

115
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,542
-Hey, what is this?
-They're the same test questions.

116
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,794
-What is it?
-How could the questions be the same?

117
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,379
-This is so wrong.
-Did someone leak the test?

118
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,132
-Hey, did you see this?
-What is this? This textbook?

119
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,802
-Somebody in our school had this textbook.
-I can't believe it.

120
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,221
-This is so dirty.
-They're identical.

121
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,682
PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOL MIDTERM MATH TEST

122
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,475
TEST QUESTIONS LEAKED?
100% LEAKED

123
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,354
-They're exactly the same.
-What the hell?

124
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,814
What the!

125
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:23,443
How can the test questions be the same
as the ones in this textbook?

126
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,820
You didn't know about this
when we made the test?

127
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,657
Actually, Mr. Ahn prepared
the math questions.

128
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,750
This is serious.

129
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,629
Online photos of a cram school textbook
created a big scandal,

130
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,716
as the questions are identical
to Asung Academy's exam questions.

131
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,718
Photos of the textbook are everywhere.

132
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,011
How did it get leaked?

133
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,637
But we returned all the textbooks
to Principal Noh.

134
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,265
What will happen if we're exposed?

135
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,522
My goodness. Yoo-chan used this textbook.

136
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,608
How did this get leaked?

137
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,276
Oh, my…

138
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,241
Meanwhile, reporters are camped
outside the Office of Education

139
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,912
as the whistleblower
is planning to show up.

140
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,600
-What? Is that him?
-It's the whistleblower!

141
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,603
Are you Mr. Paik Seung-yoo?
Are you the whistleblower?

142
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,063
What evidence have you brought with you?

143
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,858
Did you post pictures of the textbook
and test online, Mr. Paik?

144
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,568
Let's not submit it
to the Office of Education right away.

145
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,778
Then when?

146
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:53,032
I used that approach four years ago.
And you know what the result was, right?

147
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,034
I want to do it differently this time.

148
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,625
I'm Paik Seung-yoo,
a teacher at Asung Academy.

149
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,835
I've been relieved of my duties.

150
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,631
I would like to make a statement
before I submit the evidence

151
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,883
I've collected to the Office of Education.

152
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,929
Asung Academy has
a foreign admissions prep class

153
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,472
called the global gifted class.

154
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,599
Children of high-ranking people
in society,

155
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:22,103
such as senators, ministers,
corporate CEOs, professors, and such,

156
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,481
are in this class.

157
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,697
I'm holding a textbook that was only given

158
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,158
to students in the global gifted class.

159
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,206
How did he get it?

160
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,125
MATHEMATICIAN PAIK SEUNG-YOO
EXPOSES ASUNG ACADEMY SCANDAL

161
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,673
-How will we do it differently?
-We'll go public with the evidence

162
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,717
before we submit it to the authorities.

163
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,096
The math questions in this textbook
are identical to the questions

164
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,849
on the midterm math exam administered
by Asung Academy.

165
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,396
Are you claiming that only the children of
high-ranking officials had that textbook

166
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,565
which contained
the same questions as the test?

167
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,774
That's correct.

168
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,861
In addition, Asung Academy's Principal Noh

169
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:16,073
took large bribes from the parents
of the global gifted class students

170
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,618
under the guise
of donations to the school.

171
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,458
In this USB drive,
you'll find records showing that

172
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,336
Principal Noh knowingly took bribes
and lobbied the ministry.

173
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,463
I plan to also submit this
to the authorities.

174
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,845
REPORTER JUNG

175
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:39,972
REPORTER CHOI

176
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,768
MR. PAIK, SUBMITTING THE EVIDENCE
OF CORRUPTION TO THE AUTHORITIES

177
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,106
DAD

178
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,676
The Education Ministry
will hold a hearing?

179
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,930
And then what?

180
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,765
The entire board could be dismantled

181
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,393
if they find irregularities
in the foundation's finances?

182
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,271
You emptied out my safe, didn't you?

183
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,608
I warned you not to get greedy, didn’t I?

184
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,527
You've ruined the reputation
of Asung, dad, and me!

185
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,280
How could you be so dirty?
How dare you dishonor my grandfather?

186
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,741
Get out! You're going down!

187
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,161
You have no place in this family
or in the foundation!

188
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,997
Dad should have kicked you out sooner.

189
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,130
I made allegations that

190
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:58,634
there was a previous cheating scandal
at Asung High School in 2017.

191
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,637
The court will soon
announce their judgment

192
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,806
after the parent pleaded guilty
to bribing a teacher.

193
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,558
With us today is the person

194
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,602
who has agreed to testify
that the allegations

195
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,397
against Principal Noh
and Senator Sung are true.

196
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,735
Testify? Who's the witness?

197
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,362
It has to be Ji Yoon-su.

198
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,197
This is terrible news.

199
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,164
Oh, my.

200
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,708
VICE-PRINCIPAL CHOI SUNG-HAN

201
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,293
Where is Vice-principal Choi?

202
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,795
Well…

203
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,010
What's going on?

204
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,470
Gosh.

205
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,158
Dear Principal,

206
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,577
I've watered all the plants
in your office.

207
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,955
I will probably receive
a sentence for the crimes I committed

208
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:14,710
since Asung Academy's scandal
has now been exposed.

209
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:20,007
If I plead guilty and cooperate,
the judge might show leniency.

210
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,178
So I have decided to admit my guilt

211
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:28,349
and reveal the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

212
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,975
From Choi Sung-han.

213
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,938
Reveal what? Why reveal it?

214
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,149
I didn't do anything wrong!

215
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,656
This place has

216
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,034
become palatial and very grand.

217
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,995
I'm more curious
about how this will end for you.

218
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,248
Will you be able to protect
what matters to you?

219
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,250
Enough! No more!

220
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,960
Enough!

221
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,254
I'm being framed! Stop the lies!

222
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,381
Stop! They're all lies!

223
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,509
Enough! No more!

224
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,642
Ji-na.

225
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,435
Right on time. Let's go.

226
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,939
We can't let them run all over us.

227
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,442
Don't worry. I can resolve this.

228
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,911
Remember? I told you to uphold

229
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,415
the school's reputation and dignity.

230
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,085
But you always tried to hide it
and tried not to get caught.

231
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,212
Why didn't you protect the school instead?

232
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,591
You thought nobody would find out?

233
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,137
You…

234
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,389
But alas…

235
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,560
I found out about your dirty secrets

236
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,480
that you kept locked in your safe.

237
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,318
You…

238
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,529
No, you didn't…

239
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,657
But it's a relief that
I discovered it first.

240
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,869
You no longer have to hide it.

241
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,773
Don't be so upset, Mom.

242
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,318
I'm not trying to trap you.

243
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,783
I'm helping you escape
from your bad habits.

244
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,203
No!

245
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,121
This can't be true!

246
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,543
No!

247
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,184
Is your witness the teacher who was
involved in the scandal issue with you?

248
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,853
Where is she? Is she the math teacher?

249
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,525
Are you ready?

250
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,162
The witness

251
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:41,000
is the person who was
at the center of the cheating scandal.

252
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,960
This is a scoop, I think.

253
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,422
-It's Sung Ye-lin!
-What? That's Sung Ye-lin!

254
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,386
Oh, my! Ye-lin.

255
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,514
Wait. What is Ye-lin doing there?

256
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,391
What the hell is she doing there?

257
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,271
SENATOR SUNG'S DAUGHTER TESTIFIES
IN ASUNG HIGH'S CHEATING SCANDAL

258
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,493
You were right.

259
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,038
Unlike me,

260
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,750
Yoo-chan regretted
what he did and was scared.

261
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,378
When I was his age, I didn't care.

262
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,131
So what would you like to do?

263
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,508
I want to put an end to this.

264
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,554
Before it gets to the point of no return.

265
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,975
You said you could
fix things in small steps, right?

266
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,228
And you promised to help me, didn't you?

267
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,397
Tell me what I need to do.

268
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,649
Please.

269
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,695
You only have to do one thing.

270
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,948
Just be brave.

271
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,080
In 2017,

272
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:05,584
I had three high school teachers.

273
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,712
One teacher leaked the answer sheet to me.

274
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,381
Another teacher covered up the cheating.

275
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,549
But the third teacher

276
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,345
caught me cheating.

277
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,516
So I treated her like an enemy.

278
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,063
Yet, whenever I faced obstacles in life,

279
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,358
her words kept ringing in my ears.

280
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:33,654
She said I had to realize
what I did was wrong.

281
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,200
And that I should confess to what I did.

282
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,827
Those words stayed with me.

283
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,539
What made you decide
to confess to everything?

284
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,126
I told a terrible lie.

285
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,462
And I benefited from it.

286
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,965
I also framed my teacher.

287
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:55,884
But…

288
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:01,473
I never admitted to any wrongdoing
or apologized to the people I hurt.

289
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,566
I apologize for what I did.

290
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,027
I'm very sorry, Ms. Ji Yoon-su.

291
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,543
-What's going on?
-What?

292
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:33,172
-It's Ji Yoon-su.
-She's here.

293
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,925
Let's go now.

294
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,469
All right. Let's go.

295
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,181
You were a math teacher
at Asung High, weren't you?

296
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,599
Please comment about this development.

297
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,685
Ye-lin just confessed to framing you.
Could you comment about that?

298
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,020
Please say a word.

299
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,569
The student

300
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,573
who was framed along
with me four years ago…

301
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,826
I'll prove it.

302
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,163
I'll prove it myself.

303
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,833
…promised to expose the truth.

304
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,421
I'm very happy he succeeded
in what he set out

305
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,423
to prove.

306
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,600
-Just a minute.
-Any further comments?

307
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,273
What do you mean by "succeeded"?

308
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,360
We'll play the audio recording.

309
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,656
It'll have to be done secretly.

310
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,284
I'll explain to you how we can move
the money. Just follow this method.

311
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,828
First, set up a foundation.

312
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:51,333
A non-profit organization
that helps needy students.

313
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,961
The school parents will make donations

314
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,588
and that'll be used to bribe
admissions officers

315
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,507
and we'll claim it as a tax write-off.

316
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,676
It'll sort of be like money laundering.

317
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,886
And one more thing.

318
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,974
Why are you showing this to me?

319
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,476
Because a third party
secretly recorded it,

320
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,520
the court won't permit it as evidence.

321
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,647
If you submit it and claim
you recorded it,

322
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,400
then Principal Noh will be found guilty
of the charges.

323
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,361
I'd like the foundation
to purchase stocks.

324
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,364
Do you admit to everything
said in the audio recording?

325
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,827
Principal Noh gave all the orders
and I merely followed them.

326
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,329
She also said this.

327
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,293
Since the parents of the global gifted
class are high-ranking people,

328
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,169
they can protect me from any scandal.

329
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,132
Since they guaranteed to protect us,
there was no need to worry.

330
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,844
Violation of the Improper Solicitation
and Graft Act,

331
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:49,683
breach of trust, forgery of documents,
and embezzlement…

332
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,810
Gosh.

333
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,230
Do you admit your guilt to the charges?

334
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,401
This is unfair.

335
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,444
How is it unfair?

336
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,157
Sir, do you have any children?

337
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,159
-Yes, I do.
-Which school do they go to?

338
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,161
They go to public schools.

339
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,581
A prosecutor like you with honor
and high status

340
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,000
would do anything for your children,
wouldn't you?

341
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,294
Don't all parents want

342
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,339
their kids to get ahead

343
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,591
and make things easier for them?

344
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,676
I guess so.

345
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,598
All the school parents I've met so far
wanted their children

346
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:34,811
to be put ahead of other students.

347
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,522
When I showed them how they could do that…

348
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,024
Please let her off.

349
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,527
Please cover up this matter
for Ye-lin's sake.

350
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,113
…they would kneel before me or bow deeply.

351
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,908
-Director, Happy Birthday to you.
-Happy Birthday to you.

352
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,827
They treated me like a queen.

353
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,706
They promised they would do anything

354
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,250
if showed them how their kids
could take the easy path.

355
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,880
How dare they treat me like a criminal
who ruined their kids' lives?

356
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,757
What did I do wrong?

357
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,635
Ye-lin said she doesn't know
what she did wrong.

358
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,845
I think that's a serious problem.

359
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,515
I want to make things right.

360
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,643
Before this gets out of hand.

361
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,269
She didn't make things right.

362
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,772
She shook up the system. She shattered it!

363
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,150
A beautiful system that I carefully built.

364
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,238
A mere teacher at that!

365
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,745
Look here, Ms. Noh.

366
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,050
ASUNG ACADEMY PRINCIPAL, FOUND GUILTY
FOR HELPING HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS…

367
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,806
What do you think
it'll be like when we have kids?

368
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:57,185
Wouldn't you want to do everything
you can for them?

369
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,647
Loving your child and providing them
with whatever they need is different

370
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,401
from cheating to get your child
ahead of other kids who worked hard.

371
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,031
Hi.

372
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,909
-It's been a long time.
-Yes. How have you been?

373
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,328
Good. Let's sit.

374
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,542
Did you see the news?

375
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:24,129
I heard you were
the whistleblower. Thanks.

376
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,465
I was thinking about
a conversation we once had.

377
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,342
What conversation?

378
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,720
About what it would be like
if we had kids.

379
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,056
And we disagreed with each other.

380
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,642
I remember that.

381
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,520
I disregarded what you said.

382
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,193
I thought everything would be fine
if I turned a blind eye.

383
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,446
You've changed your mind now?

384
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,323
Yes.

385
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,368
After going through that experience,

386
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,622
I've changed and found courage.

387
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,791
That's how I feel now.

388
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,960
I'm glad to hear that.

389
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,798
But there's something different
about you now.

390
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,927
-Really?
-Yes. In a positive way.

391
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,553
A positive way?

392
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,558
How is Seung-yoo doing?

393
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,941
He somehow got them to apologize.

394
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,862
I didn't think it would be possible
to make them say sorry.

395
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,033
You pulled it off.

396
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,078
You and Seung-yoo.

397
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:51,132
Seung-yoo told me he wanted
to make them apologize to you.

398
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,262
I felt he meant it when he said that

399
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,182
more so than when he promised
he'd make you happy.

400
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,109
Mr. Han, how is teaching at a cram school?

401
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:12,195
It's different from teaching
at a school, of course.

402
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,324
But thanks to your recommendation,
I'm doing fine there.

403
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,328
My class has grown
after I got positive reviews.

404
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,581
That's great. You have to work hard.
I'm going to be watching you.

405
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,667
Of course, I'll try my best.

406
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,046
But nobody believes it
when I tell them that

407
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,423
I was your math teacher.

408
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,343
-If you could do me a favor…
-I'll take a selfie with you.

409
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,803
That's what I need.

410
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:42,517
I'm taking a selfie with Mr. Paik.

411
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,519
All right. Look at the camera.

412
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,439
One, two, three!

413
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,482
Nice.

414
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,361
Thanks.

415
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,947
For not forgetting about me.

416
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,574
I'm indebted to you.

417
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,160
You helped me a lot in this case
and were a key witness.

418
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,494
That's how we made it here.

419
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,664
-Let's drink.
-Sure.

420
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:09,461
Let's drink all night long.

421
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,965
Excuse me.

422
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,218
-What? How can I help you?
-I'm a friend of Ji Yoon-su.

423
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,095
She's in the dressing room.

424
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,015
I'm ready, so you can join
her when she comes out.

425
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,308
Okay.

426
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,187
You're done. Take a look at yourself.

427
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,192
Professor, you look so handsome.

428
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,694
Tada.

429
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,112
How do I look?

430
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,032
-Hi Mr. Paik, you came.
-Hi.

431
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,034
The photographer says he's ready.

432
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,829
Who do we have here?

433
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,208
I didn't realize it was you at first.
You're so good-looking.

434
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,919
-Mr. Paik, how do I look?
-Take the wig off.

435
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,672
-I'm the star today.
-What? You're the star?

436
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,467
We all came here
to celebrate your recovery.

437
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,260
And the professor took a long drive here.

438
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,513
-We're very busy people you know.
-Sure, Mr. Paik.

439
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,972
Let's go out now.

440
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,974
Dad, let's go.

441
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,476
Let's go, Professor.

442
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,982
All right. Could you hold
your grandfather's hand?

443
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,778
-Like this?
-Yes, perfect.

444
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,614
Could you tilt your head
slightly towards your granddaughter?

445
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,700
Just a little. Great.

446
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:26,788
Now could you two in the back
stand closer to each other?

447
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:33,294
Please lean in more so that
your faces are closer.

448
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,964
Just a little more. Lean in more.

449
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,549
Very good.

450
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:41,177
Now everyone, smile. One, two, three.

451
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,807
I'll take another shot. Now smile broadly.

452
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,727
Grandpa, smile.

453
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,355
All right. One, two, three.

454
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,986
The university expelled Ye-lin?

455
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,988
Yes. Her dad also resigned.

456
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,366
Her dad is no longer a senator.

457
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,743
Her life is over.

458
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,411
Justice prevails, after all.

459
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,125
-Ye-lin.
-When did you come?

460
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,251
Just now.

461
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,639
Let's go.

462
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,812
Hey, don't be self-conscious.
You can start over again.

463
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,356
Who said I was self-conscious?
I'm going to study hard.

464
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,150
That's the spirit, Ye-lin.

465
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,402
-I'll tutor you in math.
-You will?

466
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,113
I was better in math than you
in high school, remember?

467
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,656
You're so conceited.

468
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,618
How much do you charge?
I have to find a part-time job.

469
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,036
A part-time job? Don't do it.

470
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,246
-Why do you care?
-Of course, I care.

471
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,123
I don't want you to do hard labor.

472
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,875
You're getting too personal.

473
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,128
-What kind of job? I'll do it too.
-You will?

474
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,298
But I don't know if you could handle it.
You've never had any hardships.

475
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,592
Look who's talking. That's totally you.

476
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,968
Jeez.

477
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,976
Will it be a bed for her?

478
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,021
Then I recommend this one.

479
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,774
Shi-an, see how comfy it is.

480
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,239
-You think you'll get good sleep?
-Yes, it's terrific.

481
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,450
I'm sure she'll like it.
It's made from a memory foam material.

482
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,704
-So you'll be able to sleep comfortably.
-Really? Then let's buy this one.

483
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,916
Is it okay though?
It looks expensive to me.

484
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,544
We're buying it for you
to celebrate your recovery.

485
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,920
Don't worry about the price.

486
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,422
Thank you. I love it.

487
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,509
-I'll go pay for it.
-I'll go with you.

488
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,509
What's on your mind?

489
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,887
Cassiopeia.

490
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,440
Even insignificant stars

491
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:45,737
occupy their own world amidst
these celestial bodies.

492
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:51,159
If you follow the connected stars,

493
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,953
you can arrive at a beautiful conclusion

494
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:58,458
while you journey through them.

495
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,452
Professor, I'll come to play chess
on the weekend.

496
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,870
Okay.

497
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,665
Get some rest. We'll be going now.

498
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,334
Yoon-su.

499
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,215
Thanks.

500
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,431
You never held a grudge against me.

501
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,643
You understood me.

502
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,066
All my life, I loved numbers.

503
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,028
But you showed me…

504
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,701
there were more things to love.

505
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:27,046
Professor, I love you too.
You do know that?

506
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:31,592
Of course, he knows.
The professor knows everything.

507
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,762
He knows about the hardships you faced.

508
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,268
-Sleep tight, Professor.
-Sure.

509
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,728
I'll come again, Dad.

510
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,063
Okay.

511
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,566
Let's go.

512
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,769
I want to become a mathematician
as soon as I can.

513
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:26,314
-To be like the professor, and like you.
-You dream big, don't you?

514
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,609
So which proof will you work on?

515
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,612
I've been seriously thinking
about a particular field.

516
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,780
Thinking about what?

517
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,407
-Quantum cryptography.
-Quantum cryptography?

518
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,911
-That's a tough field.
-Why would you choose that?

519
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,287
Because it's cool.

520
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,124
Princeton is offering math scholarships.
I think I'll apply.

521
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,418
You've really been thinking
about it, I see.

522
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,711
I know.

523
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,297
Let me know if you need any help.
Recommendation letter, anything.

524
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,715
Sure, Mr. Paik.

525
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,514
Hello?

526
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:18,825
Dad.

527
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,992
Professor.

528
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:26,791
Professor. Wake up.

529
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,086
Professor. Please, professor…

530
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:51,983
Dad.

531
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,321
Professor…

532
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,491
Dad…

533
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,372
How many?

534
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,402
Seung-yoo.

535
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,239
Come and say goodbye to the professor.

536
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,126
Professor.

537
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,422
Thank you…

538
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,010
for being my teacher for all those years.

539
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,139
Thank you so much.

540
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,412
JI HYEON-WOOK
MARCH 16, 1954 - JANUARY 17, 2022

541
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,958
MATHEMATICIAN JI HYEON-WOOK WHO SEARCHED
FOR "INFINITY WITHIN THE FINITE"

542
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,550
Thanks.

543
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:46,764
I never expected that my dad
would have two students like you.

544
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,850
The professor was a teacher, friend,

545
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,103
and family to me.

546
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,818
For me, too.
I really felt like I had a grandfather.

547
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,864
My dad was also happy
to have met you, Shi-an.

548
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,701
Let's keep his memory alive.

549
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,036
Yes, I will.

550
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,732
Yoo-chan, let's hurry up.

551
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,358
Nobody awarded you
sole custody of Yoo-chan.

552
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,901
We haven't settled that yet
in divorce court.

553
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,903
-That's expensive. Be careful.
-Okay, sir.

554
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,615
After you stepped down, you're jobless
and nobody takes your calls.

555
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,326
You have money to support the kids?

556
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,620
You're on probation
and lost all your TV roles.

557
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,205
We're in the same boat, you know.

558
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,542
You're worried about my career?

559
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:00,296
I can revive my career after staying out
of the spotlight for a while.

560
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:03,883
Worry about yourself.
You don't have any friends anymore.

561
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,760
-What?
-Yoo-chan.

562
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,970
-You don't get to say that.
-Stop following me.

563
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,097
You made the wrong decisions.
Don't blame me!

564
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,682
-I'm not done talking!
-Yoo-chan.

565
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,060
I don't care. Yoo-chan…

566
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,688
Where did he go? What?

567
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,236
I'm not going to live with you or dad.

568
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,364
You're the reason
I got suspended from the school.

569
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:30,242
Why do you guys never stop fighting?
I'm so ashamed to live together.

570
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,245
He won't live with you or me?

571
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,415
He's blaming me for getting suspended.

572
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,418
He's too ashamed to live with us.
See what he said?

573
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,713
You mean he ran away?

574
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,092
SON

575
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,470
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

576
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,388
Gosh.

577
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,809
-Hurry up and look for him!
-Give me my phone!

578
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,688
-Hey, Yoo-chan!
-Yoo-chan!

579
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,441
BELONGING TO THE DECEASED

580
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,032
Can you organize everything yourself?

581
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,909
I'll take my time.

582
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,245
By the way, Seung-yoo.

583
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,959
If you want any of my dad's books,
go ahead.

584
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,858
I think I'll give this to Shi-an.

585
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,532
-What is it?
-Are there more notes in the box?

586
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,284
Yes.

587
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,461
This is…

588
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,338
I'm checking it.

589
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,302
-This is it, right?
-I think so.

590
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,140
I thought they were
just meaningless notes.

591
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,685
-It turns out they weren't.
-Let's keep searching.

592
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,481
Let's find out which proof
my dad was working on.

593
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,648
Okay.

594
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,960
Here.

595
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,389
So this is what it means to no longer be
an accredited specialized school.

596
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:01,227
Asung's reputation is
swept away in a blink of an eye.

597
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,228
I know.

598
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,522
All the board members
have been replaced, right?

599
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,566
-Please move.
-Careful.

600
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,452
Cantor set.

601
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,246
Continuum hypothesis.

602
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,414
GEORG CANTOR: FIRST MATHEMATICIAN TO
FORMULATE THE CONTINUUM HYPOTHESIS

603
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,292
Due to Kurt Godel's work,
the continuum hypothesis

604
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,379
didn't need to be proven
whether its proposition held up or not.

605
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,049
But the professor discovered a new branch

606
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,218
by proving that continuum hypothesis
is false.

607
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,224
You still work on problems every day.

608
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,768
Dad.

609
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,019
Dad!

610
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,816
I asked him why he was working
on meaningless stuff.

611
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:53,070
I told him to stop.

612
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,572
I didn't know either.

613
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,409
I had no idea he was working
on this proof.

614
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,787
While nobody noticed what he was doing,

615
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,374
he was struggling
with an enormous challenge.

616
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,878
Even insignificant stars

617
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:15,634
occupy their own world amidst
these celestial bodies.

618
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,848
If you follow the connected stars,

619
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,142
you can arrive at a beautiful conclusion

620
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:27,730
while you journey through them.

621
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,236
I think I can come up with something
by using his notes.

622
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,114
With the ideas he planted in the notes,

623
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:41,160
I'd like to complete his proof
whatever it may turn out to be.

624
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,121
I don't care how long it takes
or whether I fail.

625
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,707
Can you handle it?

626
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:51,545
It could take more time
and hard work to complete

627
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,381
than the paper you won
a Lucifer Prize for.

628
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:58,636
It'll be a lonely struggle.

629
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,138
Nobody can help you or deter you.

630
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,557
I'm thrilled.

631
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,560
And a bit afraid.

632
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,355
Wait a minute.

633
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,373
Calculus, the foundation of numbers.

634
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,541
Seung-yoo.

635
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,379
Could you make another promise?

636
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,341
Be focused, but don't get carried away.

637
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,260
Enjoy it, but don't obsess over it.

638
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,306
I'll try.

639
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,101
Don't worry about me.
I'd appreciate your support.

640
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,145
I'll always support what you do.

641
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:52,898
You can do it.

642
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,582
3 YEARS LATER

643
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,710
So what happened to the mathematician?

644
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,422
I don't know. I wonder about him too.

645
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,800
Hope you enjoy reading the book.

646
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,385
Thank you.

647
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,483
Hello?

648
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,405
Hi, Ms. Ji.

649
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,993
How's school?

650
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,162
You have a heavy workload, don't you?

651
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,289
I'm keeping up.

652
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:53,792
I have to do my best since you wrote me
a recommendation letter.

653
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:58,338
By the way, Shi-an contacted me.
She came back, didn't she?

654
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,175
She was here for a brief visit.

655
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,428
She already wrote a paper
and her career is taking off.

656
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,096
She brags about it a lot.

657
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,809
Thank you for coming to see my mom.

658
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,816
She suddenly started mentioning you.

659
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,487
She's been asking

660
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,906
to see you.

661
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:31,330
I'll stay behind. You can talk to her.

662
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,554
I heard

663
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,891
you wished to see me.

664
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,396
Nobody comes here.

665
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,276
Nobody comes to visit me.

666
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,824
I'd think they'd come to see
how I've fallen.

667
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,582
My dad

668
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,335
passed away.

669
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,046
So did mine.

670
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,385
Were you at his deathbed?

671
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,681
I was a little late, but I was there.

672
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,689
Well…

673
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,733
I didn't go.

674
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,069
Yeon-woo probably stayed at his side.

675
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,115
I'm sure it was a big funeral.

676
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,576
It would have made him proud.

677
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,622
At one time,

678
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,711
my dad was proud of me.

679
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,131
He trusted me.

680
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,302
He even entrusted Asung to me.

681
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,149
I had to live up to his expectations.

682
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,319
It's the only way my dad…

683
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,156
would call me and support me.

684
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,827
I wanted to do my best.

685
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,956
That's all I wanted.

686
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,723
You don't have to do your best.

687
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:59,936
You no longer need to gain approval
from someone else.

688
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,774
You're a mother and Ji-na needs you.

689
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,327
Mom.

690
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,329
Let's go inside, Mom.

691
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:20,999
For dinner, they're serving
abalone porridge, your favorite dish.

692
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,043
So have that for dinner.

693
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,798
Thank you, Ms. Ji.

694
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,383
I'll keep in touch.

695
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,305
Take care.

696
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,725
Sure, Ji-na. See you.

697
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,509
-Shi-an!
-Ms. JI.

698
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,891
-It's been so long. I've missed you.
-I've missed you too. Come inside.

699
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,310
-How have you been?
-Fine, of course. Come in.

700
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,189
-Isn't my bag heavy?
-It's okay. You must be hungry.

701
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,191
-Yes, very.
-Let's eat first.

702
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,154
That was a delicious meal.

703
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,614
Did you cook all of this yourself?

704
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,409
I'm a terrible cook, but I tried my best.

705
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,327
No, you're not.

706
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,372
You made so many delicious meals
for me whenever I came to visit.

707
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,292
And to show my gratitude…

708
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,545
Here, Ms. Ji.

709
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,007
-It's your paper?
-Yes.

710
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,634
I've been waiting for this moment.

711
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,094
To show you my paper.

712
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,478
Congratulations. Good work.

713
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,733
But do you know what Mr. Paik is doing?

714
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,695
I can't reach him on his phone.
I think he changed his number.

715
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,156
He doesn't even check his emails anymore.

716
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,950
Seems like he's working
on something intensely.

717
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,036
He even took a leave of absence
from his teaching job.

718
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,580
When he worked on his paper
that won the Lucifer Prize,

719
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:27,125
he lived like a hermit.
Perhaps, he's working on a proof.

720
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:30,629
Do you think he'll come
to see me receive the prize?

721
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,839
He promised to attend the ceremony.

722
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,759
If he doesn't come, I'll be upset.

723
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,844
When Shi-an
becomes a famous mathematician,

724
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,014
let's congratulate her together.
We should congratulate her.

725
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,067
-Are they the Calculus club members?
-Yes.

726
00:51:58,907 --> 00:51:59,991
Hi there.

727
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,327
-Hi, Hardy.
-Welcome, Hardy.

728
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,247
-Who is texting you?
-The Pleasant X.

729
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,667
Pleasant X? You still do math puzzles?

730
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,212
I could give them
a really hard math problem.

731
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,006
They'll be surprised
if I give them a super hard one.

732
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,133
-It's your turn to give a problem?
-Yes.

733
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,135
Hardy, what's today's math problem?

734
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:22,639
I came up with an interesting problem.

735
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:27,060
On a square chessboard of eight rows,
remove two corner pieces.

736
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:31,356
Then imagine you have
a sufficient bar on the right.

737
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,317
Try to cover the entire chessboard
with just these pieces.

738
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:37,070
-This is fun.
-It's interesting but really hard.

739
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,239
You never disappoint us, Hardy.

740
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,408
Answer. Impossible.

741
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:45,120
-What?
-Someone already gave an answer?

742
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:47,998
-I knew it. 3cut did it again.
-Who's 3cut?

743
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,833
Is that a nickname?

744
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,502
He's working on proving
the Riemann hypothesis.

745
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,962
RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS: UNSOLVED PROBLEM
IN PURE MATHEMATICS BY BERNHARD RIEMANN

746
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,171
The Riemann hypothesis?

747
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,132
Sure.

748
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,176
He's making quite a big claim
since his identity is hidden.

749
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,847
Tell 3cut that if he can prove
the Riemann hypothesis,

750
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,766
then I can solve Goldbach's conjecture.

751
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,560
GOLDBACH'S CONJECTURE: THE BEST-KNOWN
UNSOLVED PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY

752
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:11,855
3cut, you got the correct answer again.

753
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,857
-I knew 3cut could answer it.
-That was quick.

754
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,400
Why is the answer "impossible"?

755
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:19,237
Since 3cut isn't replying,
I'll explain the solution.

756
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,268
Hello, 3cut. This is Hardy.

757
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,563
Have you read this paper, by any chance?

758
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,539
I read the paper you sent me
a few days ago.

759
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,291
It was very helpful.

760
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,794
Thank you.

761
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,172
Really?

762
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:22,634
I found some more material
related to the paper.

763
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,970
Would you like me to send those too?

764
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:48,660
The Korean Math Council
is presenting you with this award

765
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:52,122
to honor your academic achievements,
as you have been selected

766
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:56,418
as the Youth Mathematician of the Year.
Given by Council Chair, Kim Young-eun.

767
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,555
A lot of things happened in my life
for me to get to this point.

768
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,683
And there are people
I would like to thank for supporting me.

769
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,737
MATH COUNCIL PROFESSOR KIM JUNG-IK

770
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,155
I'll take your picture.

771
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,116
You came out nicely.

772
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,243
I promised to give you a medal.

773
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:31,494
I kept my promise.

774
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,914
I'm so proud of you, Shi-an. Great work.

775
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,666
It's all thanks to you, Ms. Ji.

776
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:40,462
But Mr. Paik really didn't show up?

777
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:43,339
The ceremony was in the council journal,
so he probably knows.

778
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,301
You're Choi Shi-an,
the medal winner, right?

779
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:49,054
-Yes, that's me.
-A man asked me to give this to you.

780
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,306
He said he had to go
due to something urgent.

781
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:55,393
What? Mr. Paik sent these flowers.

782
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,771
"Choi Shi-an, congratulations
on your award."

783
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:01,983
So he did come.
I wish I could've seen him.

784
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:09,574
Congratulations, Professor Paik.

785
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:13,995
The Mathematics just called and said
your proof held up to scrutiny.

786
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,206
He has completed your proof.

787
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:20,960
Now we just have to publish it
in a paper to make it official.

788
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,254
-You're brilliant.
-Thank you.

789
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,172
By the way,

790
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:29,552
for many years,
a lot of mathematicians failed

791
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,514
in proving the hypothesis.

792
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:36,017
I'm sure you faced obstacles
while working on your proof.

793
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,478
How did you get a breakthrough?

794
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,480
I received some help.

795
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,129
Hello, 3cut.

796
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,714
This is the paper I mentioned before.

797
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,466
I hope it'll be helpful.

798
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:15,348
At first, I didn't think
the paper was related to my proof.

799
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,852
In fact, it didn't have any connection.

800
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:42,083
When Andrew Wiles was working
on proving Fermat's Last Theorem,

801
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:45,962
he got a hint from elliptic curves,
which is a different branch.

802
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,841
I also had insight like that.

803
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:53,595
So you got help
from a different branch of math.

804
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:56,389
And it allowed you to overcome
the last obstacle?

805
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,974
Who helped you?

806
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,684
Godfrey Harold Hardy.

807
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,060
G. H. Hardy?

808
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,521
The late British mathematician?

809
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:18,036
Hello, Hardy.
I'm publishing my paper soon.

810
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,414
You gave me a key insight
that helped me complete my proof.

811
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:25,043
I'd like to present my paper
to you to show my gratitude.

812
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,336
Please reply.

813
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,650
I miss her.

814
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:58,409
Director. I'm perfect for that role.

815
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:02,497
Just give me an opportunity.
I'd be glad to audition for it too.

816
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,251
I'll see you on the 25th, then. Bye.

817
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,335
Yes!

818
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,587
You're working so hard.

819
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:14,092
I have to make a living somehow.

820
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:18,638
Hee-sung, could I have
a double shot espresso instead?

821
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,432
-I knew you'd ask for it. Here you go.
-There you go.

822
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,393
That's free.

823
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,855
I need a jolt of caffeine
to get an energy boost.

824
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,024
I have an important audition
to go to later.

825
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,444
You were a celebrity. You'll get the part.

826
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,072
That felt good.

827
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,409
Okay.

828
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,827
I'll see you. Bye.

829
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,913
-Good luck.
-Sure. Thanks.

830
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:49,335
I wonder if Seung-yoo
is having three square meals a day.

831
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,004
He hardly calls us.

832
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,547
He's not a kid anymore.
He's probably doing fine.

833
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,049
Gosh, he's still a kid.

834
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,135
You don't even worry about him?

835
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,972
Welcome… Oh, my goodness. Son!

836
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,307
Oh, my, Seung-yoo.

837
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,891
Oh my gosh.

838
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,020
Sit down. My goodness.

839
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,983
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

840
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,192
Good job.

841
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,361
I'm so proud of you, son.

842
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:19,073
You've lost weight. Look at you.

843
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,701
You didn't even have
a bowl of millet gruel?

844
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,369
Did you bring your paper like last time?

845
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,538
No.

846
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:29,208
Good. I got a headache trying to read it.

847
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,085
You're finally being honest.

848
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,755
You couldn't understand a thing
even after spending days reading it.

849
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:34,964
Gosh…

850
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,178
Well…

851
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:44,057
I saw Ms. Ji Yoon-su a few days ago.

852
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,438
She was walking in the neighborhood.

853
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,315
Does she still live in Hangok-dong?

854
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,609
Or did she move back here?

855
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:59,280
You didn't have lunch, right?
I'll fix you a sandwich.

856
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:02,158
Now, wait here. I'll make it real quick.

857
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,327
Honey, make him a big sandwich.

858
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:11,042
Why don't you come over tomorrow?
Have some homemade cooking.

859
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,920
-Tell me what dish you want.
-I'll come over this weekend.

860
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,713
I have an important appointment tomorrow.

861
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,132
Snow is in the forecast
for today across the nation.

862
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,260
There's no worry for icy roads,
as temperatures will be above zero.

863
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,304
But remember to take an umbrella with you.

864
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,614
HANGOK ART HALL

865
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,561
I've arrived.

866
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,594
I'VE ARRIVED

867
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:29,013
Are you Hardy, by any chance?

868
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,489
Were you 3cut?

869
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:18,479
You said you completed your proof.

870
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,398
Congratulations.

871
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,067
It's thanks to you.

872
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,865
Did you bring your paper?

873
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,867
Yes.

874
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,978
Do you like math?

875
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,608
Do you like math?

876
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:09,530
Yes.

877
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,533
I like math.

878
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:40,353

MATH JHW

882
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:09,966
-Today…
-Yes.

883
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,801
You'll be giving a math puzzle, right?

884
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:15,763
Right. I think I'll give you
a really tough problem.

885
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,349
Sure. I accept the challenge.

886
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:23,646
If you cover the top half
of 128 square root of e980,

887
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:25,147
what do you get?

888
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,358
Cover the top half?

889
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,486
What?

890
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:52,258
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING MELANCHOLIA

891
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:50,608
