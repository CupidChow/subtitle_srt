1
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,354
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,358
Seung-yoo.

3
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,360
I'm not following…

4
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,029
What can I do?

5
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,158
If there's an irresistible problem,

6
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,078
which I can't hold myself back
from solving…

7
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,887
I don't know

8
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,682
what you're saying.

9
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,575
This is a gift.

10
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,287
So why are you showing me this photo?

11
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,040
I'll let you have it.

12
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,211
I think you'll find it useful.

13
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,589
Under one condition.

14
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,467
What condition?

15
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,556
Speak up.

16
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,809
Please give me
the list of expected midterm questions.

17
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,026
Oh, my goodness, Ye-lin.

18
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,656
You have matured
after going through a painful phase.

19
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,117
Now you present me with a deal.

20
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,080
This photo is quite amusing.

21
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,500
But I don't want what you're offering.

22
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,755
Ye-lin.

23
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,592
When it comes to deal-making,

24
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,636
you don't sell it
like an insurance policy.

25
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,102
It could be useful like you said.

26
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,606
Come to me when that's the case.

27
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,740
Have you shown…

28
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,578
that picture to anyone else?

29
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,458
No.

30
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,461
All right. Keep it under wraps.

31
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,339
Until the day you'll find it useful.

32
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,662
If there's an irresistible problem,

33
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,706
which I can't hold myself back
from solving…

34
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,334
Can I really show you…

35
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,920
everything about me?

36
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,732
-Hello?
-Did you get off work?

37
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,194
I'll pick you up on Sunday at 11:30 a.m.

38
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,779
What?

39
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,573
You forgot?

40
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,034
We're supposed to have lunch
with my family.

41
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,621
Okay.

42
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,373
You sound different.

43
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,625
I'll see you on Sunday.

44
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,308
INVITING YOU TO RYU SUNG-JAE
AND JI YOON-SU'S WEDDING

45
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,978
It seems Senator Sung's daughter
goes to Asung High.

46
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,148
-Yes.
-I saw you on TV.

47
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,192
Try to choose your words carefully
in public from now on.

48
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,529
Sung-jae has
a bright future in the ministry.

49
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,783
The daughter of
the Jangsung Financial Group chairman

50
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,911
and the sons of the Hyunsung Daily
president go to that school too.

51
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,456
Conduct yourself in a proper way.

52
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,249
Father.

53
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,669
Do you know how I sprained my ankle?

54
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:42,050
A student in my class
intentionally damaged my bike's brakes.

55
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,927
But I was more worried

56
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,722
about the student who did it

57
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,516
than my broken bicycle.

58
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,769
What are you trying to say?

59
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,271
The privileges these teenagers have

60
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,525
thanks to their rich parents
could be a curse in disguise.

61
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,956
What do you think
it'll be like when we have kids?

62
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:20,630
Wouldn't you want to do everything
you can for them?

63
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,133
Loving your child and providing them
with whatever they need is different

64
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,887
from cheating to get your child
ahead of other kids who worked hard.

65
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,100
Don't be so sure about that.

66
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:39,065
You have to have kids of your own
to really know how you'll act

67
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,235
in those situations as a parent.

68
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,835
What's happening between us?

69
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,838
It feels like our relationship
is going through a lot of bumps.

70
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,508
Is this normal before a wedding?

71
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,936
Yoon-su.

72
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,942
-Yes.
-I would feel relaxed around you.

73
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,236
But it's hard…

74
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,406
to feel like that lately.

75
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,748
-You don't have anything to say?
-I don't know.

76
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,795
I'm having a lot of thoughts
as our wedding approaches.

77
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,466
I wonder if all couples go through this.

78
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,186
-You're going home, right?
-I'm going to visit my dad.

79
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,191
I have to give him our wedding invitation.

80
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:04,984
I'm sorry.

81
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,236
Go without me.

82
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,989
I have to go to the Blue House
with the minister.

83
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,367
I'll get off here then.

84
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,416
-Drive safely.
-Okay. I'll call you.

85
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,859
This is new.

86
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,487
I've never seen this method before.

87
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,615
What problem will you tackle next?

88
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,954
The teacher got me to love math again.

89
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:02,500
Without Ms. Ji, math has no purpose.

90
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,671
I'm in love

91
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,423
with Ms. Ji.

92
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,469
Are you going to prove that?

93
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,638
Proving it won't change anything.

94
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,641
I just…

95
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,770
want to say it.

96
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,065
My proposition is the truth.

97
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,737
A proposition without the need
to prove it's true.

98
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,451
Well, there's an emptiness to that.

99
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,423
SALESIO SANATORIUM

100
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:55,428
2017 CONGRESS OF PROBABILITY THEORY
DATE: OCTOBER 28, 2017, SAT.

101
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,430
MR. PAIK SEUNG-YOO,
WE CORDIALLY INVITE YOU TO THE CONGRESS

102
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,602
How about submitting your proof
to the Academic Archives?

103
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,979
-Archives?
-Yes.

104
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,941
Based on my knowledge,
your proof uses a new approach.

105
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,276
Why don't you submit it?

106
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,529
2017 CONGRESS OF PROBABILITY THEORY
DATE: OCTOBER 28, 2017, SAT.

107
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,586
Mom.

108
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,133
Dad.

109
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,264
I'm getting married.

110
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,866
RYU SUNG-JAE & JI YOON-SU

111
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,986
Come to the math classroom
before your classes begin.

112
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,432
You visited

113
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,226
my dad on Sunday, didn't you?

114
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:54,940
-Yes.
-Thanks for showing him the proof.

115
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,530
I was invited to a congress.

116
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,117
I submitted my proof
to the Academy Archives.

117
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,368
Really?

118
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,621
That's good news.

119
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:21,091
I thought about what you said.

120
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,095
Yes.

121
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,476
There are irresistible problems
that you can't help but try to solve.

122
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:37,399
If you continue doing math,
you'll encounter such problems frequently.

123
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,278
But

124
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,574
you'll lose yourself

125
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,286
if you pour your heart
and soul into one problem.

126
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,333
It could destroy or damage you.

127
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,460
What if I find…

128
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,756
a problem that's worth it
in spite of the risks?

129
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,177
Don't look for a problem.

130
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,431
Let the problem find you.

131
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,893
Wait until you're strong

132
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,563
and can weather the storm
while tackling a problem.

133
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,946
I believe you'll reach that level
one day, Seung-yoo.

134
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:46,343
Thank you for the gift,
but I don't think I can accept it.

135
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,339
Hey, stop right there. You're dead.

136
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,636
Sorry.

137
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,551
-Who's going to the snack bar? Hyung-do.
-Hyun-jae.

138
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,136
-Seung-yoo.
-Seung-yoo. Let's go.

139
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,348
Come on.

140
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,196
COMMON TEST PROBLEMS

141
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,703
Damn it.

142
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,296
You have to go with the flow.
Studying won't help.

143
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,881
That's what I'm good at.

144
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,967
What? Why are you stopping?

145
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,178
What is it?

146
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,014
-Go ahead without me.
-Okay.

147
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,350
-I forgot my wallet.
-You're always forgetting it.

148
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,775
You came quickly. Pretty anxious, right?

149
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,822
You still like Ms. Ji?

150
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,368
She's getting married. Snap out of it.

151
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,496
-Give it.
-Does the teacher know that you like her?

152
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,459
What? Did you confess your feelings?

153
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,045
You're out of your mind. That's insane.

154
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,213
-Where is the framed photo?
-What will you do?

155
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,509
Her wedding is coming up. She'd be
so embarrassed if the students saw it.

156
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,638
I'll give it back. But not for nothing.

157
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,767
Give it up.

158
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,728
You already got bad grades
in the 10th grade.

159
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,229
No matter how hard you try,
you can't fix that.

160
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,564
What's it to you?

161
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,901
Don't try so hard in the midterms.

162
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,946
If you don't, I'll give it back.

163
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,533
Or else, I'll hang the photo
in the classroom tomorrow.

164
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,535
You piece of shit.

165
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,245
Go ahead and punch me. Try it.

166
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,166
If the teacher asks me
why you punched me, I'll tell her why.

167
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,045
You punched me
because you like Ms. Ji so much.

168
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,348
You have until tomorrow.

169
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,557
Think it over.

170
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,403
Hey Gyu-young.

171
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,284
Listen carefully.

172
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,830
Don't cause any problems for Ms. Ji.

173
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,623
What if I do?

174
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,378
I'll make sure nobody can harm her.

175
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,921
Like how?

176
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,426
Who has the most power in this school?

177
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,636
It's the top student.

178
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,305
The student with the top score.

179
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,644
And we'll find out in the midterm exams.

180
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,370
SEUNG-YOO'S FATHER

181
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,415
It's a fresh new season
and a new semester.

182
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,917
You must be very busy
with the upcoming midterm exams.

183
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,504
I would very much appreciate it
if you would come by our cafe.

184
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,682
How is Seung-yoo doing at home?

185
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,768
I don't get to see him lately

186
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,439
because we're not holding math club
activities during midterms.

187
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,318
-Well.
-These days,

188
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,487
I have to pinch myself to see
if I'm dreaming or not.

189
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,241
Seung-yoo is studying so hard
to prepare for the midterms.

190
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,412
-He is?
-It's thanks to you.

191
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:09,333
I can't thank you enough
for what you've done.

192
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,336
-I didn't really do much--
-At his age,

193
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,547
they're motivated by their teachers

194
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,966
and try to live up to expectations.

195
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,596
When my son focuses on something,

196
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,558
he is obsessed over it.

197
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,313
So please give him guidance, Ms. Ji.

198
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,482
The midterms are coming up.

199
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,150
-Do you know this?
-No.

200
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,319
-What about pi?
-What is pi?

201
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,738
I only want to find a way to your heart.

202
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,365
Get back to studying.

203
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,007
NO STUDENTS ALLOWED DURING MIDTERMS
ASUNG HIGH SCHOOL

204
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,303
I have an announcement to make
concerning the exam.

205
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,348
Please ensure that

206
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,268
there are no mistakes in the questions.

207
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,770
Until the exams are over,

208
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,898
please be careful that
no text questions are leaked.

209
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,068
-Ms. Yoo.
-Yes?

210
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,530
-Could you check this draft?
-Just a minute. Let me finish this first.

211
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,324
I also have a class to go to.
I need your help now.

212
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,951
Let the teacher assistant

213
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,787
take care of that if you're done
organizing the answer sheet.

214
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,497
Okay.

215
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,582
-Ms. Park.
-Yes?

216
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,087
Could you put these answer sheets
in the right envelopes?

217
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,005
Sure.

218
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,174
Students may come in here,
so please finish it before the break.

219
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,134
I will.

220
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,429
-How can I help, Mr. Han?
-I attached the file

221
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,097
but it's not uploading.

222
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,563
2017 MIDTERM EXAM FOR THE 2ND TERM
11TH GRADE MATH ANSWER SHEET

223
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,036
MR. HAN MYUNG-JIN

224
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,290
Could you stop taking selfies?

225
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,417
I told you to stop posting
stuff on social media.

226
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,960
You're going to exercise?

227
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,963
All right. Have a good workout.

228
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,800
What did she just do?

229
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,891
Ye-lin.

230
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,980
I got it. Here.

231
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,195
-What are these?
-I found a way.

232
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,280
Did you think I would do nothing?

233
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,907
Now memorize it quickly.

234
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,619
Mr. Han Myung-jin says
that the math questions are super hard.

235
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,537
You have to memorize them all, okay?

236
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:56,166
-Honey, could you get me a sports drink?
-Okay. Coming.

237
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,918
Do your best, okay?

238
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,395
Now pass out the test sheets.

239
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,356
MIDTERM FOR 2ND TERM
MATH, KOREAN HISTORY

240
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,442
Don't turn around. Just pass the sheets.

241
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,322
All right. Did everyone get a test sheet?

242
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,492
If you have, then begin.

243
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,777
MATH: PAIK SEUNG-YOO

244
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,288
MATH: SUNG YE-LIN

245
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,380
She did well.

246
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,226
Wow. I'm so doomed.

247
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,061
The Math test was too hard.

248
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,607
What the? Amazing. A perfect score!

249
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,567
-You did it?
-Seung-yoo. That's crazy.

250
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,402
How did you get all of it correct?

251
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,863
-A perfect score?
-Yes.

252
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,489
He's my friend.

253
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,742
Wow. That's amazing.

254
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,328
No matter how hard I try,
I can only score 20 points.

255
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,415
ANSWERS

256
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,176
MOM

257
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,761
How did the test go?

258
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,512
I got one wrong.

259
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,473
-Why?
-The answer was different.

260
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,974
How could it be different?

261
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,726
Did you make a mistake?

262
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,395
No, I wrote it correctly.

263
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,147
But the answer is different.

264
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,942
Oh, my! Why are you so surprised?

265
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,361
Ms. Ji wants to see you.

266
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,533
What do you mean? She changed the answer?

267
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,244
For problem number four.

268
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,371
We got the numbers mixed up.

269
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,873
I found out
when Ms. Ji spotted the mix-up.

270
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,041
When did this happen?

271
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,460
Yesterday. After you went home.

272
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,184
Did you call for me?

273
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,688
Yes.

274
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,148
You studied hard, didn't you?

275
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:11,027
I graded your exam and you did very well.

276
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,946
But…

277
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,658
for problem number four…

278
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,912
How did you get your answer?

279
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,415
Why?

280
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:28,753
The answer you gave could not be
possible with the given number.

281
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,923
In the problem, the given number was 13.

282
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,925
But you randomly used the number eight.

283
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,432
How did this happen?

284
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,857
I think I made a mistake.

285
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,277
Of course, mistakes happen.

286
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,113
But mistaking the number 13 for 8 is…

287
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,573
Ms. Ji.

288
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,200
Can I see you for a minute?

289
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,785
What?

290
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,081
I'd like to see you for a minute.

291
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,297
You're dismissed.
Let's talk about this later.

292
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,394
-Why didn't you discuss that with me?
-What?

293
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,731
You changed the answer
to problem number four.

294
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,777
Even if there was an error,
you should have told me about it.

295
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,447
I thought fixing the error was more urgent
because the exam was coming up.

296
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,574
Why were you talking to Ye-lin?

297
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,495
Weren't you asking her
something about her answer sheet?

298
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,832
I had something to ask
after grading her answers.

299
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,418
-I'll excuse myself.
-Discuss things with me first.

300
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,339
We're both math teachers,
so let's keep each other informed.

301
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,430
What?

302
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,183
What are you talking about?

303
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,519
You think Ms. Ji knows what we did?

304
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,063
I'm not certain that she knows,

305
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,357
but she could raise this matter.

306
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,903
If she asks Ye-lin again,
tell her to say it was a mistake.

307
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,114
No matter what.

308
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,116
How could you fumble this?

309
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,744
Why did she change the answer after
we got copies of the answer sheet?

310
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,246
What is this about?

311
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,872
-Oh, my.
-Who is it?

312
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,040
Wait.

313
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:30,542
Mr. Han Myung-jin?

314
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,876
Honey.

315
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,719
What did you just say?
You got copies of the answer sheet?

316
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:44,639
Honey, you see. Well, let me explain.
It's not what you think it is.

317
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,308
What am I thinking then?
And what did you do?

318
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,270
Hurry up and tell me!

319
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,273
Gosh. Why did this happen?

320
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,237
So that's the answer
before you corrected it.

321
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,365
And this is Ye-lin's answer?

322
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,242
Yes.

323
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,996
It's identical.

324
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,249
How could she submit that answer
when she was given the number 13?

325
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,419
Unless she copied this answer.

326
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,508
I mean… I'm not suggesting…

327
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,263
You don't suspect
the answer sheet was leaked, do you?

328
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,228
Ye-lin… Gosh, this is really bad.

329
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,272
What should we do about this?

330
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:38,359
Maybe she made a mistake.

331
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,445
You don't think that's possible?

332
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,656
We could find out
by checking her test sheet.

333
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,743
The students jot down
their calculations on it.

334
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,037
If it were a mistake,
we'd see it in her calculations.

335
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,455
You're right.

336
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,583
Then let's ask her
to bring her math test sheet

337
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,585
after the midterms are over.

338
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,253
After the exams are over?

339
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:00,381
We have to let her finish
taking the other exams.

340
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,383
If we were to question her now,

341
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:07,180
she could complain to us afterward
that we ruined her midterms.

342
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,224
That will be a big headache for us.

343
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,644
Okay.

344
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,931
My wife committed an unforgivable mistake.

345
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,393
If you kick out Ye-lin

346
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,480
and report my wife to the authorities,
I'll accept your decision.

347
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,109
They use the term "admissions hell."

348
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,112
I like those two words.

349
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,782
In such balls of fire,

350
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,702
Asung will rise
amidst a hell where fountain water boils.

351
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:16,165
We will be the sharpest blade
forged in such an environment.

352
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,962
Creating a heaven
where everyone is happy is meaningless.

353
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,966
Whoever survives hell
is crowned the true winner.

354
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:32,432
I wanted Ye-lin to be
the blade I could wield

355
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,394
after surviving this hellish competition
by using any means necessary.

356
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,105
To become that,

357
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,650
she should have never been caught.

358
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,653
You knew all along?

359
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,908
Did you think I'm not aware of everything
that goes on in this school?

360
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,914
-She wants the math answer sheet?
-Ye-lin's mom asked for it.

361
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,833
But I didn't agree to it. I would never.

362
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,587
Let her have it.

363
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,507
-Pardon?
-Give her the answer sheet.

364
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,760
But Director…

365
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,053
But…

366
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,265
Leave me out of this.

367
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,935
I didn't see nor hear anything.

368
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,813
Please let her off.

369
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,609
Please cover up this matter
for Ye-lin's sake.

370
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,778
If I say yes?

371
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,948
In the name of my daughter…
No, I'll swear upon my life

372
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,243
and never disappoint you ever, Director.

373
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:35,912
I promise.

374
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:45,797
-Jeez.
-Goodness.

375
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,507
All of my scores went up.

376
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,009
Why does he keep improving?

377
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,135
I did better this time.

378
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,806
-What about you?
-Did you study alone?

379
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,099
My scores always fall.

380
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,684
Hey, wait a minute.

381
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,018
Seung-yoo is incredible.

382
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,312
-Seung-yoo? Why?
-What? He aced all the subjects!

383
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,982
-Who did?
-That's crazy.

384
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,150
-What? Seriously?
-He aced all the subjects?

385
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,361
Move it.

386
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,281
I'm going insane.

387
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,202
You need a strong ankle
to score a penalty kick.

388
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,705
To pull off a knuckle kick,
you need strong ankles.

389
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,083
It's Seung-yoo!

390
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,168
Seung-yoo.

391
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:30,174
-He aced all the subjects.
-A perfect score? For real?

392
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,509
You're awesome.

393
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,178
-Hey, what is this?
-What is it?

394
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,430
What is it?

395
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,016
-It's a photo of Ms. Ji.
-Where did this come from?

396
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,517
Who took the photo?

397
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,768
But why is it here?

398
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,854
-But who put it there?
-That's strange.

399
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,614
What if I find a problem
that's worth it in spite of the risks?

400
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,701
Don't look for a problem.

401
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,496
-What are you doing?
-It's yours?

402
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,914
Where are you going?

403
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,215
There are irresistible problems

404
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:15,178
that you can't help but try to solve.

405
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,473
Let the problem find you.

406
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,392
Wait until you're strong

407
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,103
and can weather the storm
while tackling a problem.

408
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,858
I believe you'll reach that level
one day, Seung-yoo.

409
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,360
Thank you for the gift,

410
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,655
but I don't think I can accept it.

411
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,168
It's free.

412
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:34,507
My son, Seung-yoo, did very well
on his midterms, so I'm treating everyone.

413
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,926
-Congratulations.
-Enjoy.

414
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,094
It's free.

415
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,596
I think you should be worried.

416
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,473
Why? Did something happen?

417
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,226
Seung-yoo got a perfect score
in every subject, didn't he?

418
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,479
-Yes.
-Only Seung-yoo aced the math test.

419
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,357
Did Ms. Ji give him special lessons?

420
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,483
Special lessons?

421
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,153
There's a strange rumor going around.

422
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,363
-Don't do that.
-Why not?

423
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,992
How could the worst student
get the top score overnight?

424
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,910
There's something going on.

425
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,079
Well, Gyu-young says that

426
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,040
Seung-yoo and Ms. Ji
have a special relationship.

427
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,835
It was like they were on a date.

428
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,170
What the hell!

429
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,925
-Jang Gyu-young, where are you?
-Ma'am.

430
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,343
Ms. Min.

431
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,390
Where is Gyu-young?

432
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,810
-What's the meaning of this?
-You really have to ask?

433
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,689
Are you afraid that
I might cause harm to your son?

434
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,859
Then why did he spread
baseless rumors about my son?

435
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:35,943
Well…

436
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,488
It's a rumor going around school.

437
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,990
A rumor, you say?

438
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:43,701
Well then I want to hear
this from Gyu-young.

439
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,453
I want to hear directly from him.

440
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,039
Now listen.

441
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,791
Seung-yoo confessed

442
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:55,046
his feelings to Ms. Ji
and the whole school knows.

443
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,673
Gyu-young saw everything. Got it!

444
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,301
-Gyu-young saw everything?
-Yes!

445
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,596
I don't believe it.

446
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,808
He got so mad after losing to Seung-yoo
that he must be seeing things.

447
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,769
-That's ridiculous, lady.
-What?

448
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:14,106
Your son's math score dropped a lot
in a test that Seung-yoo aced.

449
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,735
He should blame himself for being dumb.
Why is he lashing out at my son?

450
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:21,405
-You must have lost it, lady!
-That's right, I've lost it!

451
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,492
You better erase those chat messages.

452
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,702
If you don't, I'll sue you for defamation.

453
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:30,081
And tell Gyu-young to watch
his mouth. Understand?

454
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,541
Or else, I'll rip his mouth apart.

455
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,718
If you throw ash on someone else's garden,

456
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,347
don't be surprised
if someone ruins your garden.

457
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,934
Oh, my goodness.

458
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,560
My gosh!

459
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,945
Jeez.

460
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:06,701
These women say whatever they want.

461
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,369
It's preposterous.

462
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,959
I'm home.

463
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,127
Seung-yoo.

464
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,924
Nothing happened, right?

465
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,011
Nothing's going on
between you and Ms. Ji, right?

466
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,805
It's a false rumor, right?

467
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,598
-What rumor?
-My gosh.

468
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,270
The school parents are saying
ridiculous things about you.

469
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,815
They said you confessed
your feelings to Ms. Ji.

470
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,155
You did?

471
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,701
Tell me whether you did it or not!

472
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,119
It's not like that.

473
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,748
Nothing should be happening.

474
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,502
If your dad were to find out about this…

475
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,129
Be careful.

476
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,675
Everyone thinks you're the competition
after your grades improved. Understand?

477
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,094
Ms. Ji is…

478
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,681
getting married soon.

479
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,851
That's good news.

480
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,312
We should congratulate her.

481
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,772
Let's go to her wedding.

482
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,066
-When is it?
-This Saturday.

483
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:21,942
I can't go.

484
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,527
Why not?

485
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,325
Good morning.

486
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,659
Good morning.

487
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,038
WE WILL BE HOLDING
THE CONGRESS OF PROBABILITY THEORY

488
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,708
ASUNG HIGH STUDENT PAIK SEUNG-YOO'S
LECTURE WILL TAKE PLACE

489
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,381
Ms. Ji.

490
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,341
Can we talk for a minute?

491
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:52,014
Well, about Ye-lin's answer.

492
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,392
I thought the principal should know,

493
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,478
so I briefed the vice-principal about it.

494
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,896
I see.

495
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,648
What did he say?

496
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,817
He said there's no need to check
Ye-lin's test sheet.

497
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,195
He said you'll understand the reason soon.

498
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,696
What does that mean?

499
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,199
I'm not sure.

500
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,327
An academic score review
committee will hold a meeting.

501
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,664
-I guess they'll discuss the matter.
-Academic score review committee?

502
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,416
And your wedding is tomorrow.

503
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,752
So don't let this matter bother
you ahead of your big day.

504
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:40,521
2017 ACADEMIC SCORE REVIEW COMMITTEE

505
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,655
First of all,

506
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,616
I would like to apologize.

507
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,247
Listen to me very carefully.

508
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,583
Okay.

509
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,502
I'll have the whole matter disappear.

510
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,797
Not a trace…

511
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,800
of everything.

512
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,345
I have something to inform the committee

513
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,724
regarding the 11th grade
math midterm test.

514
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,064
PRINCIPAL OH JIN-TAEK

515
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,279
Yes, it's me.

516
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,156
Can you talk for a minute?

517
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,950
There was a problem with the math test?

518
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,161
Tell me more about it.

519
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,006
Ye-lin.

520
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,262
Could you bring
your math test sheet to me?

521
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,516
-Why?
-I'd like to check something.

522
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,770
I threw it away.

523
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,231
You threw it away? The test sheet?

524
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:08,651
Ms. Ji! We've got a big problem!

525
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,569
Just a minute.

526
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,947
Let's talk about this later.

527
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,326
What is it?

528
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,704
They're going to re-administer
the math test. For the entire 11th grade.

529
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,665
I'll have to come up with new problems.

530
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:25,543
Redo the test? But why?

531
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,213
-Re-administer the test?
-If they take a second test,

532
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,674
the results from the first test
won't count.

533
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,634
So nobody will care about the first test.

534
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,219
Right.

535
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:36,804
That's right.

536
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,722
You're so smart.

537
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:44,144
I'm on my knees right now.

538
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,021
You can't see, right?

539
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,316
I wish you could see me on my knees.

540
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,695
This is the last time I'm doing this.

541
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:53,904
Of course.

542
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:58,576
Now you just have to watch what I do next

543
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,786
to repay you.

544
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,080
Get your hopes up.

545
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:06,875
-A second test?
-Why do we have to?

546
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,085
Be quiet. Stop talking.

547
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,004
Why do we have to take a second test?

548
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:14,341
There was a problem that required
a method which you didn't learn yet.

549
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:18,262
You're taking a second test
to make things fair. Got it?

550
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,680
Which problem was it?

551
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,099
-Number 15.
-Number 15?

552
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,267
Now look.

553
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,942
So you used L'Hopital's Rule
to solve it, right?

554
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:32,943
-Yes.
-Yes.

555
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,113
I'm sure all of the students
used the rule.

556
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,699
It's such a simple and useful formula

557
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:42,494
that it's not mentioned
in the math textbook.

558
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:47,207
Because it wasn't taught in math class,
this problem doesn't belong here.

559
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,001
What if I got it right by guessing?

560
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,711
The chances…

561
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,838
I didn't use L'Hopital's Rule to solve it.

562
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,049
What? Who said that?

563
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,216
I didn't use the rule to solve it.

564
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,137
Why you! You punk. Gosh.

565
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,641
Then how did you solve it?
Did you use the Taylor series to solve it?

566
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,101
Teacher, Seung-yoo aced the math test.

567
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,729
If Seung-yoo didn't use
the rule to solve it

568
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,147
then isn't everything fine?

569
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,734
-Exactly.
-That's right!

570
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,235
Be quiet!

571
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,072
Who said you could interrupt me?

572
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,909
What difference does it make
that Seung-yoo got a perfect score?

573
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,916
You're mad about taking a second test
since you aced the first one?

574
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:36,382
Is getting good grades everything?
Moral character is important too.

575
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,344
Well, you did nothing wrong.

576
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:45,265
Blame it on that teacher who constantly
praises you for being special.

577
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,939
Why you, punk!

578
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,608
Look down.

579
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,529
I said look down!

580
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,617
See me after class is over.

581
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,169
You can't solve it without using the rule.

582
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,713
I'm so sorry. I gave that problem.

583
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,174
I thought they could use the rule.

584
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,803
He said there's no need to check
Ye-lin's test sheet.

585
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,180
He said you'll understand the reason soon.

586
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,643
You think you're a math genius?

587
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,812
What?

588
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,065
I've seen students like you before.

589
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,902
But with that attitude of yours,
you won't go far.

590
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:43,073
Because teachers praise you
for being smart,

591
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,284
you think you're the best, right?

592
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:49,079
You were nothing.
You had one little streak, that's all.

593
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,500
Hey, I'm still talking to you!

594
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,795
Since the limit value exists as k,

595
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:42,382
we can substitute x with ex in tangent x
with ex and use the addition formula.

596
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,717
You can find the value of k.

597
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:45,969
Without using L'Hopital's Rule.

598
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:49,306
Seung-yoo! Can I give you a hug?

599
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,808
Thank you. You saved my butt.

600
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,019
I'm so relieved now.

601
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,480
There's no need to give
the students a second test.

602
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,193
I'll treat you to a nice lunch, okay?

603
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:09,868
Seung-yoo.

604
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:13,914
Thanks.

605
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:19,336
Thanks to you, you stopped
something that was very unfair.

606
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,796
What do you mean?

607
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,174
You don’t need to know.

608
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:28,804
I'll try harder to handle
such school matters

609
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,098
that can sometimes be outrageous.

610
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,976
Is there some kind of problem?

611
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,272
By the way, do well in your lecture.

612
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,107
You can do it.

613
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,000
COUNSELING OFFICE

614
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,879
Ye-lin?

615
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,465
Ms. Ji wants to see me
to ask me something.

616
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,135
But you're taking a second test. So why?

617
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,013
I don't know either. What should I do?

618
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:16,476
Buy some time. I'll be there soon.

619
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,162
Is there anything you'd like to tell me?

620
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:39,833
-Ms. Ji.
-Yes. Go ahead.

621
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,170
Mr. Han said we're taking a second test.

622
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:49,217
The first test won't count,
so why do we have to talk about this?

623
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,178
There is

624
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,014
no second test, Ye-lin.

625
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,311
There's no second test. This will count.

626
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,689
That's why we need to have this talk.

627
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,945
-You can't administer a second test?
-I'm sorry.

628
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,573
Seung-yoo pointed out an issue.

629
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,950
What kind of issue?

630
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:14,951
The thing is,

631
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:19,247
he was able to solve the problem
using an unconventional method.

632
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:22,209
I've never seen anyone
solve it like that before.

633
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,011
How were you able to write down

634
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,348
the answer as it was
before I corrected the error?

635
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,310
Ye-lin.

636
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,438
I don’t know what you're saying.

637
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,983
-You really don't?
-No.

638
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,321
You need to know.

639
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,283
You should be explaining yourself.

640
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,702
That's the right thing to do.

641
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:01,164
I wish you'll explain everything to me.

642
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,920
I'll ask you one last time.

643
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,174
You have nothing to say?

644
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,267
Ye-lin!

645
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,229
Ye-lin!

646
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,734
-Excuse me, can you help me?
-What's the matter?

647
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:31,653
-She needs to see the school nurse.
-I'll carry her on my back.

648
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,198
-Stay alert.
-Isn't that Ye-lin?

649
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,242
I think so.

650
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,702
-What's going on?
-Ye-lin.

651
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:39,953
-Ye-lin.
-This way.

652
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,040
-She's having trouble breathing.
-Okay.

653
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:47,753
Ye-lin.

654
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,547
-Ye-lin!
-Ms. Yoo. Please stay back.

655
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,090
Calm down.

656
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,066
-Ms. Yoo, you can't do that.
-Move it!

657
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,738
Who are you?

658
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,073
-Let go, Seung-yoo.
-Let go of my arm!

659
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,533
Let go of her!

660
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,536
Seung-yoo!

661
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,206
Let go of her now.

662
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:34,174
You're totally
out of your mind, aren't you?

663
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,551
So it's true about
the relationship you two have.

664
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,722
-You must be proud of him, right?
-Ms. Yoo.

665
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,891
What is going on here?

666
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,608
Is it true?

667
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:56,404
Did a school parent physically assault
a teacher in our school?

668
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,120
Apologize to Ms. Ji immediately.

669
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,874
-It's not like that.
-If it's not,

670
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,961
would you like the police to get involved?

671
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:17,092
I wasn't myself for a moment.

672
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,427
I apologize to you, Ms. Ji.

673
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,930
When I saw Ye-lin fainting,

674
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,349
I couldn't think straight.

675
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,893
Please forgive me.

676
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,106
I heard that

677
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:35,861
you had an issue with an incorrect answer
that Ye-lin gave in the math test.

678
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,612
-But you see…
-Ms. Yoo.

679
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,825
-Could you wait outside for a moment?
-What?

680
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,286
Please step outside.

681
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,709
What did you mean by that?

682
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:55,005
About Seung-yoo and you?

683
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:56,798
You didn't know?

684
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,176
-That's--
-Let's talk about that matter with me.

685
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:23,700
Are you okay?

686
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:28,288
Well, you know what Ye-lin's mom
said to the teacher earlier…

687
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,166
About you and Ms. Ji… It's not…

688
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,667
-I meant to say it's not true.
-I know.

689
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:33,585
-Untrue.
-Exactly.

690
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,003
-How could it be true?
-No, it can't.

691
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,339
You're in shock.
So Ms. Ji must be shocked too.

692
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,966
-I know.
-And it's her wedding tomorrow.

693
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,052
This is so upsetting.

694
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:51,519
There won't be a second
math test for the 11 graders.

695
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,314
Mr. Han told me.

696
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,524
Since the math test results are valid,

697
00:53:57,233 --> 00:54:01,988
I think there should be an inquiry
to unearth any cheating in the exam.

698
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,241
All right.

699
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,829
We'll conduct a comprehensive review
to uncover any negligence

700
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:14,167
regarding the exam questions
and whether there were lax measures

701
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,420
in storing the answer sheets
and exam questions.

702
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:21,466
We'll also call Ye-lin
and her parents to school for a meeting.

703
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,513
After which, we'll give you
the full report, Ms. Ji.

704
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:33,269
I'll wait for the results then.

705
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,344
Hello?

706
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,014
-Congratulations, Yoon-su.
-Yoon-su, join us!

707
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,223
No way.

708
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,767
You got off work, right?

709
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,603
I'm heading home.
You're still hanging out?

710
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,272
Yes. They won't let me go home.

711
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,191
Would you like to stop by here?

712
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,693
No, I'll head home and rest.

713
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,487
We have to wake up early tomorrow.

714
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,156
Then go home first. I'll stop by later.

715
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,493
Okay. Don't drink too much.

716
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,332
Are you Ms. Ji Yoon-su?

717
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,465
Welcome.

718
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,138
-What is the occasion?
-Sit down. Have some wine.

719
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,225
We briefly saw each other
at the competition.

720
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,936
We couldn't talk much so that was too bad.

721
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,902
You haven't changed at all.

722
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,613
I'm the only one who's getting older.

723
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:52,158
Why did you want to see me?

724
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,327
I heard you had something to say.

725
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:58,081
Isn't it hard to teach
at Asung High School?

726
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,419
Do you remember our teacher,
Mr. Kim Jung-yoon?

727
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,093
Mr. Kim!

728
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:16,307
JI YOON-SU

729
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,767
Come along.

730
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,238
Why didn't you come?

731
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,740
You said you'd give a witness statement
during the investigation.

732
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,242
Why didn't you show up?

733
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,243
NOH YEON-WOO

734
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,245
Because of us…

735
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,957
-Because of us, Mr. Kim…
-It's not because of us.

736
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,377
He did this to himself.

737
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,089
You still don't understand?

738
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,969
Our school doesn't need good teachers.

739
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,391
Only teachers that
the school needs remain.

740
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,362
It didn't matter
whether a teacher taught well.

741
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:16,743
Mr. Kim was a whistleblower
that my dad had to get rid of.

742
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,915
After that day,
I couldn't look you in the eye.

743
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,336
Do we have to talk about that now?

744
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,631
I don't want the same thing to
happen to you.

745
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,885
Director Noh Jung-ah

746
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:37,055
is worse than my dad
in how she treats teachers.

747
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,139
So?

748
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,141
If you need my help, ask me anytime.

749
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:43,811
That is, if you trust me.

750
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,106
Are you any different?

751
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,361
I'm asking because I truly want to know.

752
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,369
I want to be different from them.

753
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:03,373
Okay, I understand what you're saying.

754
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:05,500
I'll see you around.

755
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,493
VICE-PRINCIPAL CHOI SUNG-HAN

756
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,793
We have a problem.

757
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:52,505
Ms. Ji just met
with Principal Noh Yeon-woo.

758
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,910
Honey, I'm back.

759
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,329
You're back?

760
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,124
Take a look.

761
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,253
What do you think?
Seung-yoo can wear this tomorrow.

762
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,339
-Did he try it on? Does it fit?
-Not yet.

763
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,633
I told him to come home.
If it doesn't fit, I'll exchange it.

764
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:43,389
Ms. Ji. What brings you here at this hour?

765
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,642
I have something to tell you.

766
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,457
I couldn't gift-wrap it.

767
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,627
Tell Seung-yoo

768
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:17,173
to give a fine lecture tomorrow.

769
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,811
This is a nice pen but it's old.

770
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,354
What?

771
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:33,731
Math JHW?

772
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,609
-Let me have it.
-Why?

773
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,361
I'll give it to Seung-yoo myself.

774
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,613
Wait a minute.
These are someone's initials.

775
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,032
Hi, Seung-yoo.

776
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,742
Seung-yoo, take a look at this.

777
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,287
Ms. Ji came by and wanted
you to have this.

778
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:54,961
She said good luck.

779
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,007
But what does this fountain pen
have to do with tomorrow's lecture?

780
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:04,178
MATH JHW

781
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,597
When did she come by?

782
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,041
Ms. Ji!

783
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,340
Seung-yoo.

784
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,643
Congratulations…

785
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:57,440
on your wedding.

786
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:09,952
Thanks.

787
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:17,043
I'm cheering for you.

788
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,924
You'll do well tomorrow, Seung-yoo.

789
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,529
You're wearing that number. 1729.

790
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,615
Do you like math?

791
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:34,328
I teach math at Asung High School.
My name is Ji Yoon-su.

792
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,763
You're Paik Seung-yoo,
not Paik Min-jae anymore.

793
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,600
I'm glad to meet you.

794
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,471
-Big brother.
-Big brother.

795
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:34,847
-Hello.
-Hello.

796
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,641
Please take good care of Ms. Ji.

797
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,726
-She's very delicate.
-And she's strong.

798
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,645
Live happily ever after!

799
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,313
-Hello. We came.
-hello.

800
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:45,149
-Welcome. Thank you for coming.
-Congratulations.

801
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,444
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

802
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:49,779
Hello.

803
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,822
-We're Yoon-su's coworkers at Asung.
-hello.

804
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,240
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

805
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:14,553
-Ms. Ji!
-Congratulations!

806
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,597
Congratulations on your wedding!

807
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,018
-Let's take photos.
-Hurry up!

808
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,895
One, two, three.

809
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:25,439
Be quiet.

810
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,234
Oh, my! How on earth!

811
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,611
You're so pretty!

812
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,781
I saw the groom and he was so handsome.

813
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:35,408
You two make a cute couple.

814
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,576
-Thank you.
-Congratulations!

815
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,747
Thanks, guys.

816
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,333
-Hello.
-Congratulations.

817
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,669
-Congratulations.
-Thank you for coming.

818
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:49,338
This is the Director at Asung High
and this is the Vice-principal.

819
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:50,506
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

820
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:51,757
Please go in.

821
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:56,095
Oh, my, Hello.

822
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,555
-Hello, Ms. Min.
-Hi.

823
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,780
MATH JHW

824
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:23,914
The wedding ceremony of Ryu Sung-jae
and Ji Yoon-su will begin soon.

825
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:28,711
All wedding guests,
please be seated at your table.

826
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:30,713
Recently, an interesting paper

827
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:33,716
on the estimation lemma
of a random Poincaré conjecture

828
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:37,053
inside a 3-sphere
has been uploaded to the archives.

829
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:40,389
It was written by a high school student.

830
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,059
I introduce you to Paik Seung-yoo.

831
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,660
Here come the bride and the groom!

832
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:34,860
There's an error in the proposition.

833
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,921
What the?

834
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:03,556
What? It's Seung-yoo.

835
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,476
What? Seung-yoo?

836
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,242
Congratulations

837
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:26,078
on your wedding.

838
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:40,653
The mood on the set
is very different today.

839
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,154
I'm quite excited.

840
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:45,366
It's because of the special guest
we'll be having in a short moment.

841
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:49,495
That's right.
Our next guest has an impressive resume.

842
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:52,206
When he was ten,
he was invited to take courses at MIT.

843
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:56,543
He got his GED at the age of 18,
and went to Hankook University.

844
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:59,838
In 2020, he won the Henri Poincaré Prize
European Math Society Prize,

845
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:03,384
Ramanujan Prize, and other prizes
in the world of mathematics.

846
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:07,680
And he participated in the International
Mathematician Olympics in 2021.

847
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,348
So what were his results?

848
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:13,060
He's the first Korean
and the youngest person over

849
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:15,354
to enter the 2021 IMO
which was held in St. Petersburg

850
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:18,607
where he became the recipient
of the Lucifer Prize,

851
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,693
the Nobel Prize of Mathematics.

852
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:25,239
We introduce you to Paik Seung-yoo,
our guest of honor.

853
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,102
I've been trying to contact
that person you asked about.

854
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:57,563
-But I'm not making any progress.
-Noh Jung-ah?

855
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,231
It says she's looking forward
to seeing you.

856
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,399
Do you have plans to meet her?

857
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:02,026
I don't think it's a good idea.

858
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:03,777
Do you think he wouldn't know?

859
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:04,695
Nice to meet you. I'm Paik Seung-yoo.

860
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:06,613
Unless he had an ulterior motive,

861
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:08,657
why would he turn down offers
from universities to come here?

862
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,576
I need you to look into something.

863
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:13,620
We have another question
from someone called "Calculus."

864
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,539
I waited for a particular moment.

865
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:17,958
The moment when the answer would find me

866
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,960
instead of having to look for the answer.

867
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:25,924
