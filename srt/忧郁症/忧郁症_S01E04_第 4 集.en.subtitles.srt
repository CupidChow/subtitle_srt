1
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,563
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,857
I'm glad…

3
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:29,112
to see you get angry and also smile.

4
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,036
So don't shut yourself off to others.

5
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,459
Don't hide who you are.

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,047
Really?

7
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,844
Can I really show you…

8
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,639
everything about me?

9
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,480
What is it going to be?

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,649
You still won't write an apology?

11
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,655
Make a decision by tomorrow morning.

12
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,200
Depending on that, the disciplinary
committee could open a case.

13
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,457
Don't take it that far.

14
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,834
This isn't worth the trouble.

15
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,630
You understand, right?

16
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,049
I'll see you tomorrow.

17
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,001
Yes?

18
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,088
I was about to call you.

19
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,466
Can you come home right now?

20
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,511
Okay.

21
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,437
What the hell?

22
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,817
Which kid did this?

23
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,237
Who the heck posted
a damn photo like this?

24
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,281
Student Affairs is handling it.

25
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,993
They will take disciplinary action
against the student tomorrow.

26
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:46,666
Tell me what disciplinary measures
are given tomorrow, okay?

27
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,501
Okay.

28
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,007
Isn't he that student? The umbrella kid.

29
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,384
Yes.

30
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,930
I'm sorry for leaving so abruptly earlier.

31
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,682
I was in shock.

32
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,397
Teenagers these days are…

33
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,901
How could they be so disrespectful to you?

34
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,863
There's so much pressure at school.
You can't discount that.

35
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:21,117
You can quit if it's too much for you.
It doesn't matter to me.

36
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,494
Think about it.

37
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,376
Make time on the weekend
for a lunch appointment.

38
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,379
-With who?
-With Vice Minister Shin.

39
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,757
Why do I need to go?

40
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,427
Since the minister won't be able
to officiate our wedding,

41
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:44,557
the vice minister will come instead.
So you have to introduce yourself to him.

42
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,060
Officiate the wedding?
We didn't discuss this.

43
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,353
What's there to discuss?

44
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,522
Who would you ask to
officiate our wedding, then?

45
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,695
I'll get going then. Lock the door.
And take some rest.

46
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,533
I will. Bye.

47
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,030
It's not because you have a special gift.

48
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,702
But you have a perspective on math,
and that is quite unique.

49
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,705
I like it.

50
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,897
The AI research center is doing a study
on the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

51
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,066
I chose a topic covered in the study.

52
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,901
Face recognition technology?

53
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,404
Yes, here's my draft.

54
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,160
I'll take a look at it.

55
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,538
I think you're getting good experience
at the research center.

56
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,458
How about checking out some films,
books or paintings too?

57
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,502
You could find some interesting topics.
You'd be surprised.

58
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,837
Okay.

59
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,507
Ms. Ji.

60
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,676
Ms. Ji.

61
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,311
Gyu-young, apologize to the math teacher.

62
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,813
Tell her this won't happen again.

63
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,443
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,528
I won't do it again.

65
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,697
All right.

66
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,534
I'll trust that you're being sincere
and that you'll keep your promise.

67
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,870
Okay.

68
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,830
Gyu-young, say sorry to Seung-yoo.

69
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,376
Sorry, man.

70
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,716
Sorry for punching you.

71
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,719
Jeez, you two…

72
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,305
We're letting you off easy this time.
Watch yourselves.

73
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,058
If this happens again,
there'll be severe consequences.

74
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,893
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

75
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,311
You're dismissed.

76
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,821
Good job.

77
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,660
I chose a topic for my speech.

78
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,204
You did?

79
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,502
We let them off this time
with a sharp warning.

80
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,296
It wouldn't be good
to put this on their record.

81
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,341
Have all the fake photos deleted.

82
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,677
Don't let it be circulated
outside of the school.

83
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,554
Yes, ma'am.

84
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,158
Seung-yoo didn't get punished this time.

85
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,909
That's a relief.
I thought he'd get suspended.

86
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,870
They're the ones who started it.

87
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,288
Why did they let Seung-yoo off?

88
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,331
He hit you first.
He shouldn't be representing our school.

89
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,916
Why did he overreact anyway?

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,794
Does Paik Seung-yoo like math teacher?

91
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,838
That crazy bastard.

92
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,256
I'm going to get him someday.

93
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:46,799
Move it.

94
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,852
This is a famous apple mango
shaved ice dessert from Jeju.

95
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,940
This isn't edible,
so I'll put it down there.

96
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,739
-It's a very special dessert.
-Of course, it is.

97
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,450
I always think
about nice gift ideas for you.

98
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,660
But I cause you a lot of worries instead.

99
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,875
I heard that Seung-yoo was
involved in a physical fight.

100
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,836
-Will he be able to represent the school?
-Ms. Yoo.

101
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:29,634
Just competing in the Olympics
isn't Ye-lin's goal, right?

102
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,678
Of course, no. She wants to win.

103
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,015
Then just focus on that.
Don't bother with the small matters.

104
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,351
Oh, okay.

105
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,357
What is this?

106
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,318
An award acceptance speech draft.
Have Ye-lin use it as a template.

107
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,613
Wait. Ye-lin is being trained
by Ms. Ji Yoon-su?

108
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,784
I thought she was working
as an intern at the AI research center.

109
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,706
If people were to later learn that
a high school student interned there,

110
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,708
that could raise suspicions of favoritism.

111
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:09,090
So you're saying that it's better to say

112
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,634
she trained at school?

113
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,971
Ms. Ji Yoon-su can be very useful.

114
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,973
Remember that.

115
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,560
-Your guest has arrived.
-Okay.

116
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,728
Hello, Senator.

117
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,731
I was on my way here
when the senator called me, you see.

118
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,526
He wanted to have lunch,
so it's okay if he joins us, right?

119
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,820
Of course.

120
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:35,366
This is Senator Sung Min-joon
of the Minguk Party.

121
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,326
This is my fiancée.

122
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,038
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Sung Min-joon.

123
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,669
Nice to meet you too.

124
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,255
-It's been a long time, Ms. Ji.
-How have you been, sir?

125
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,965
Let's sit.

126
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,768
I'm sorry for showing up
like this without being invited.

127
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,605
When I heard you were coming,
I had to come to meet you.

128
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,690
-Me?
-Right.

129
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,818
His daughter is a student at Asung High.

130
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,779
She's in the 11th grade. Sung Ye-lin.

131
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,948
That's my daughter.

132
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,535
Ye-lin?

133
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,039
This is the paper
on the facial recognition software

134
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,415
we'll present tomorrow.

135
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,834
Go over the part that you'll be reading.

136
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:27,793
Okay.

137
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,297
Are we all prepared
for the academic conference in Jeju?

138
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,007
-Yes, Professor. We're ready.
-Okay.

139
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,636
And Ye-lin, you'll be assisting, right?

140
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,638
Yes, I just received the material.

141
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,556
Great. You can do a good job, right?

142
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,224
I'll try my best.

143
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,144
Let's take a look at it.

144
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,657
Thanks to Ms. Ji and her teaching skills,

145
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,742
I heard the good news about your daughter.

146
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,703
-I heard she'll be competing in the IMO.
-Yes.

147
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,707
It's thanks to your teaching, Ms. Ji.

148
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:11,587
I went over Ye-lin's speech
that she prepared.

149
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,256
I see. How was it?

150
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,927
I was impressed. Her draft was flawless.

151
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,472
You're probably full
after getting all these compliments.

152
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,850
I'm very flattered to hear.
Thank you, Ms. Ji.

153
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,770
If I were to be totally honest with you,

154
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,357
it was beyond the level
of a high school student.

155
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,526
It seemed like an expert reviewed it.

156
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,705
You have a very keen eye, Ms. Ji.

157
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:51,544
We were lucky enough to get a bit
of advice from an expert in the field.

158
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,963
She only received guidance.

159
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,632
The speech itself was
entirely written by Ye-lin.

160
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,760
And she didn't ask for outside advice

161
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,972
because she thought
you were lacking in any regard.

162
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,393
Of course, not.
Ms. Ji is an excellent math teacher.

163
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,562
-Let's drink.
-Sure.

164
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,407
-It was a fabulous lunch, Senator.
-Don't mention it.

165
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,492
How about we play a round of golf someday?

166
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,162
Sure. It'll be on me next time.

167
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,915
I hope your wedding will be delightful.

168
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,294
I'll prepare a nice speech
to give when I officiate.

169
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,420
Thank you, sir.

170
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,672
Congratulations on your wedding.

171
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,632
-Sure.
-Thank you.

172
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,676
Take care.

173
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,471
-Vice Minister, I'll be going now.
-Goodbye.

174
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,444
The senator would like you
to have this gift.

175
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,404
It's an apple mango shaved
ice dessert from Jeju.

176
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,865
Eat it right away
or store it in a freezer.

177
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,793
It was uncomfortable, wasn't it?

178
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,339
Please understand, okay?

179
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,967
The vice minister and senator
are very close friends.

180
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,596
I hope I won't have to do this again.

181
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:36,106
You said there was another contestant
from Asung High? Who is it?

182
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,484
A student named Paik Seung-yoo.

183
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,570
-Are you helping him yourself?
-Yes.

184
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,905
Well…

185
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,950
Don't put too much effort into it.

186
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,827
What do you mean?

187
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,164
Actually, Senator Sung
added the high school category

188
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,085
-to the Olympics.
-What?

189
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,504
He brought in the Math Council
and got the Ministry

190
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,756
to back the Competition. It's his project.

191
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,261
You're not implying that

192
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:09,056
the winner has
already been decided, are you?

193
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,646
You knew but still introduced me to him?

194
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,023
It's not about winning the prize, is it?

195
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,860
Just entering the Olympics
is an accomplishment--

196
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,404
The other entrants
are just there for window dressing?

197
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,990
It's also teaching Ye-lin a bad lesson.

198
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,370
How could you agree with this
when you work in education?

199
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,913
I didn't agree to it.

200
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:38,043
There's no benefit in rejecting it too.
It's for a good cause.

201
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,636
ECO BAG

202
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,810
MS. JI YOON-SU

203
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,229
Don't go around accusing them.

204
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,149
Some of the judges are professors
from foreign universities.

205
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,942
They can't influence all the judges.

206
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,861
Thank you for telling me this.

207
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,989
I'll change my strategy
if this is the case.

208
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,074
-Yoon-su--
-All right.

209
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,327
It's not about winning or losing.

210
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,915
But I don't want my student getting hurt
from unfair competition.

211
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,338
Return that gift.

212
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,716
It's just a dessert.

213
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,386
-Do we have to return it?
-You really think there's just a dessert?

214
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,557
Are you pretending
you don't know what's in it or what?

215
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,855
Let me off. I need to take a walk.

216
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,025
MS. JI YOON-SU

217
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,696
Hey, Seung-yoo.

218
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,324
It was a 2-for-1 deal.

219
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,016
I feel much better now.

220
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,610
How's your speech coming along?

221
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,699
No, I didn't even write one sentence yet.

222
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,452
This is a once-in-a-lifetime competition.
You can't take this lightly.

223
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,537
So I got permission from my folks.

224
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,080
What permission?

225
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,124
To fly to Jeju.

226
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,627
But I have to be back on the same day.

227
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,256
So I'll take an early morning flight
and return on an evening flight.

228
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,177
-You really got permission?
-Yes.

229
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,512
But they said…

230
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,850
I had to win a trophy.

231
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,942
Seung-yoo.

232
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,236
You can do well, right?

233
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,198
You'll try hard, won't you?

234
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,201
Let's try this together.

235
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,412
Okay.

236
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,264
What are you packing for?
Are you going on a trip?

237
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,226
I have to wear a different outfit
for the conference and banquet.

238
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,144
And another outfit for the flight.

239
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,980
You need to have at least three outfits.
Isn't it pretty?

240
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,274
I forgot.

241
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,487
-Oh, Honey. You're home?
-Yes.

242
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,198
How's the preparation going?

243
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,496
I had lunch with Ms. Ji Yoon-su today.

244
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,625
I told her how you were preparing
for the competition, so don't worry.

245
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,502
Just stay focused.

246
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,546
-What about Seung-yoo?
-What?

247
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,048
Him? What?

248
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,383
How is he preparing?

249
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,469
I have no idea. She didn't mention it.

250
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,433
Don't worry. I have everything planned,
so there's nothing to worry about.

251
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,317
I'll have an Americano and orange juice.

252
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,459
-Ms. Ji.
-Hey.

253
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,629
You also brought that bag?

254
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,800
No need to bring matching bags.
Let's not mix up our bags this time.

255
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,177
Okay.

256
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,601
I'm going to have coffee. What about you?

257
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,602
I'm not thirsty.

258
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,811
-You're okay?
-Yes.

259
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,104
-Wait here.
-Okay.

260
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,461
It's been such a long time, Vice Minister.

261
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,879
This is my eldest daughter.

262
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,381
Nice to meet you. I'm Noh Jung-ah.

263
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,217
It feels like we've met before.

264
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,220
-We have?
-Because I've heard so much about you.

265
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,388
Your school sends
the most students to SNU.

266
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,725
Asung is number one in the nation.
Everyone is talking about Asung High.

267
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,187
Thank you for the kind compliments.

268
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,399
-Shall we start playing?
-Sure. Let's go.

269
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,359
Dad.

270
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,655
I'm sorry for being late.
I got into a slight fender bender.

271
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,406
You did? You didn't get hurt?

272
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,700
-No, I'm fine.
-Okay.

273
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,494
Hello. Nice to meet you, sir.

274
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,870
She's my second daughter.

275
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,164
-She's at Asung Int'l Middle--
-Hey!

276
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,167
-Oh, my. Yeon-woo!
-My gosh!

277
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,127
You two know each other?

278
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,587
She's Wellesley alumni.

279
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,090
I graduated much later.

280
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,591
Gosh, it's been so long.

281
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,843
-I know.
-Really.

282
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,054
I had to drag my wife here
to play a round of golf.

283
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,889
But she looks happy now.

284
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,934
-Let's go.
-Sure. Let's go.

285
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,604
I had Yeon-woo come to break the ice.

286
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,107
Let's take that cart.

287
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,954
My driving skills are a bit rusty,

288
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,205
but I'm not a bad driver.

289
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,125
-Okay.
-Here we go.

290
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:25,761
INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM
OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY

291
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,015
This is AI-based facial
recognition technology.

292
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,770
You can observe
how the software recognizes faces.

293
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,605
Now please face the screen.

294
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,733
You'll see how it recognizes faces.

295
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:43,028
Please stand here
if you would like to try it out.

296
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,029
Excuse me.

297
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,364
Next person.
Please stand inside the circle.

298
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,992
Now look straight ahead.

299
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,037
You'll see information
on how the computer recognizes faces.

300
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,538
So take a look.

301
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,832
Just a minute.

302
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,753
NEW POST, PROCESSING

303
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,297
#PROUD OF MY DAUGHTER
#VOLUNTEERING

304
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,628
This is it.

305
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,257
Welcome.

306
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,844
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

307
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:52,157
This steak buffet is my treat.

308
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,366
So eat all you want.

309
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,619
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

310
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,497
It's an honor to have a famous actress
treat us all to drinks.

311
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,375
The honor is mine, Professor.

312
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,670
-Please be a good advisor to Ye-lin.
-Don't worry about that.

313
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,506
-Let's all raise our glasses, shall we?
-Let's have a toast.

314
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,508
To tonight!

315
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,427
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

316
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,388
Cheers.

317
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,766
You're so adorable.

318
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,602
Ye-lin is so smart and sensible.

319
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,187
You have nothing to worry about.

320
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:27,484
If you want to be adored,
you either need to be smart or sensible.

321
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,905
Enjoy the food.

322
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,115
Ye-lin, dig in.

323
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,749
-I'll go buy tickets.
-Okay.

324
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:07,292
Van Gogh paintings remind me
of my dad a lot.

325
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,212
Van Gogh was so immersed in his own art

326
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,258
that he became far removed
from the world. That's similar to my dad.

327
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,387
I looked up Professor Ji Hyeon-wook.

328
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,473
You did?

329
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,560
The math problem you gave me

330
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,271
that I haven't solved yet…

331
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:34,194
is one piece of his theorem
that he tried to prove, isn't it?

332
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,404
You're right.

333
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,243
A flaw was found in his proof.

334
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,455
So ten years of work went down the drain.

335
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,876
He spent another couple of years
to fix the flaw.

336
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,304
Did he fix it?

337
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,191
What do you think?

338
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,573
It's hard to fathom.

339
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:27,497
One tiny flaw made ten years of work
on the theorem a colossal waste of time.

340
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,625
And he spent
another couple of years to fix the flaw.

341
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,295
It's hard to imagine
how he must have felt.

342
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,841
Is that why…

343
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,177
you said that to me before?

344
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,681
To not fall in love with a problem…

345
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,939
Be focused on it,
but don't get carried away.

346
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,527
I want you to like math,
but not obsess over it.

347
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,822
Take that outlook on math.

348
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,667
But can I control that?

349
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,462
Not falling for something

350
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,839
I've fallen for?

351
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,684
How did you like the exhibition?
Was it nice?

352
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,644
Yes.

353
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:35,231
-I need to wash my hands.
-Okay.

354
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,567
What are you listening to?

355
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:21,736
What are you listening to?

356
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,055
Conference is over. It's a success.

357
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,352
How is it going there?

358
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,480
It was a success.

359
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,527
Relatively.

360
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,008
Well done.

361
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,344
Thanks to you, it went well.

362
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,139
I hope I can use your help again.

363
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,767
Stop dragging dad into doing stuff.
He's old.

364
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,310
Do you feel inferior?

365
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,190
Does the widening gap between Asung
and your international school

366
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,442
bother you?

367
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,902
Widening gap?

368
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,032
Your school can't compare
to the international school.

369
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,826
Did you know this, Jung-ah?

370
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,870
Our international school and Asung High

371
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,331
is separated to
the north and south by Teheran Road.

372
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,125
To the south,
you have Asung High School parents

373
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,419
who are obsessed with sending
their kids to a good university

374
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,463
so that they can get
high-paying jobs like them.

375
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,091
And to the north,
parents at the international school

376
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,510
care about bequeathing
their wealth to their kids.

377
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,638
So?

378
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,807
They don't care about
the quality of education.

379
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,935
Their kids will live with ease
after they get their inheritance.

380
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,062
Which colleges
they get into doesn't matter.

381
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:09,153
It's a rarefied world
that you have no inkling of.

382
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,116
Don't be mistaken.

383
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,910
Neither of us is from the north side.

384
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,247
We need to claim the Father's title
more than getting an inheritance.

385
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,707
The chairman title.

386
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,959
Don't you agree?

387
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:28,006
-What do you mean, we?
-Oh, right. Not both of us.

388
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,633
Just one of us.

389
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,298
Could you bring out our luggage?

390
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,549
Let's go.

391
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,261
-You did so well today, princess.
-Yes.

392
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,471
We're not late, are we?

393
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,099
-I have to use the restroom. Wait here.
-Okay.

394
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,713
Ye-lin, what's the matter?
Are you feeling okay?

395
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,634
-Let's go. We'll miss our flight.
-Wait a minute.

396
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,095
We still have time.
Let's have some coffee. Come on.

397
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,180
At this late hour?

398
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,057
-I can smell alcohol on you.
-You do?

399
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,268
I only had one glass of wine. What smell?

400
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,563
Gosh, you're so sensitive.

401
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,124
Thank you, sir.

402
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,131
You had a long day. Did the trip help?

403
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,633
Yes. I'll work on my speech.

404
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,011
Okay.

405
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,263
If you have any questions, ask me anytime.

406
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,265
I'll see you tomorrow at school.

407
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,017
Good night.

408
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,144
Good night.

409
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,604
Okay.

410
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,091
-On the weekend…
-How was your trip to Jeju?

411
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,426
How did you know?

412
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,596
I always need to be on top
of what is going on at Asung High.

413
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,934
Seung-yoo's homeroom teacher,
Ms. Kim must have told you.

414
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,229
I'm sorry for not submitting
a travel request before going.

415
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,690
There wasn't enough time to do it.

416
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,901
Next time, please report such
out-of-school activities beforehand.

417
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,111
And…

418
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,532
you need to be a little careful.

419
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,534
What do you mean?

420
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:10,413
Our students are very sensitive and keen.

421
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,917
They can instantly tell if a teacher
favors one student over another.

422
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,963
There was that incident
involving Gyu-young too.

423
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,216
There's no need to further aggravate
the problem, is there?

424
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,262
We went to Jeju to visit an exhibition

425
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,723
that was relevant
to Seung-yoo's speech topic.

426
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,975
You can read about the details
in my travel report.

427
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,979
And these are my comments
after reviewing Ye-lin's speech draft.

428
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,897
I'll get going, then.

429
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,024
Ms. Ji.

430
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:44,572
Don't try to teach
the students about fairness.

431
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,285
We live in an unfair society anyway.
Teaching them such things

432
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:54,373
will only produce losers
who'll blame the world for their problems.

433
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,796
Try to take care of it.

434
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,133
I wonder how this will grow

435
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,260
under your stubborn personality.

436
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,980
Don't be a shrinking violet. Grow upright.

437
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,691
You can grow tall and strong too.

438
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,279
Hello.

439
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,365
I told Seung-yoo to come too.

440
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,075
I see.

441
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,203
I read your final draft.

442
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,747
I left a few comments but overall,

443
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,874
it was well written.

444
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,709
Thank you.

445
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,504
Wasn't it hard to write?

446
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,675
The topic you chose is hard
for a high school student to write about.

447
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,344
It must have been difficult.

448
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:54,558
Math was never an easy
subject for me, anyway.

449
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,976
I'm different from Seung-yoo.

450
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,187
What?

451
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:02,316
-I didn't mean to imply--
-You like Seung-yoo a lot, don't you?

452
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,195
He was born with a gift.

453
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,157
I think I would like him too,
if I were you.

454
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,662
I envy him.

455
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,084
I liked math,
but I was not gifted like Seung-yoo.

456
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,211
Then you probably know how I feel.

457
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,756
How it feels to compete against him.

458
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:31,178
I was meaning to tell you two
not to compete against each other.

459
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:37,435
The Mathematician Olympics
isn't a contest. It's a special event.

460
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:42,398
Later on, you might regret
not having enjoyed the experience more.

461
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,614
I'll leave now
if that's all you have to say.

462
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,952
All right, Ye-lin. See you tomorrow.

463
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,079
Okay.

464
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:03,919
Ms. Ji.

465
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,923
Can you just go over
the part I did so far?

466
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,467
Sure. Read it.

467
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:22,771
AI computing can handle many tasks.

468
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,264
That's what I did so far.

469
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,853
It's wonderful.

470
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,789
Here's a lucky talisman.

471
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,006
Calculus.

472
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,884
Yes. That pebble.

473
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,098
This small pebble
is the foundation of numbers.

474
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,727
If you get nervous, hold that tight.

475
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:46,897
Okay.

476
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,078
2017 INTERNATIONAL MATHEMATICIAN OLYMPICS

477
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,750
I checked that your names
were on the list.

478
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,336
Here are your nametags
and guideline sheet.

479
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,088
When do we have to be at the contest hall?

480
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,592
It starts at 2 p.m. So let's meet
in front of the hall at 1:20 p.m.

481
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,553
Go listen to a lecture
or see the exhibits before then.

482
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,681
Isn't it exciting to be
at the Mathematician Olympics?

483
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,683
I'll see you then.

484
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:33,527
What?

485
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,698
That's Professor Muller.

486
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,618
Adolph Muller is an expert
in algebraic geometry.

487
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,078
I signed up for his lecture.

488
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,663
What? I did too.

489
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,290
-Let's go.
-Okay.

490
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,465
Hey, Ye-lin.

491
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,594
The teacher told us to come
to the contest hall by 1:20.

492
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,595
She did?

493
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:02,264
Then you can memorize
the answers until then. Here.

494
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,437
Your dad put in a lot of effort
to make this happen.

495
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,551
Yes? Vice-principal.

496
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,346
I'm here with the Director
of School Affairs and Principal.

497
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,599
-Come to the contest hall quickly.
-Okay.

498
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,769
-Seung-yoo.
-Yes?

499
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,562
I have to go to the contest hall now.

500
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,606
-I'll see you there in 20 minutes.
-Okay.

501
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,500
Like always.

502
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,795
You're so special.

503
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,518
Min-jae, you're special.

504
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:30,913
Min-jae, you're special.

505
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,373
I can never be as good as you.

506
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,334
Never.

507
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,836
Like always. You're so special.

508
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:39,838
You're special.

509
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,009
I can never be as good as you.

510
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,135
Never.

511
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,822
Jin-ho!

512
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,242
Jin-ho.

513
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,588
Jin-ho…

514
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,967
-Where are you?
-And your father is in good health?

515
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,469
Yes, he is.

516
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,807
We'll be announcing
the youth science initiative soon

517
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,184
and expand natural sciences
and engineering departments.

518
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,395
We'll have the budget approved too.

519
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,815
The students here today will become
the researchers of tomorrow.

520
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:48,402
Especially Asung High.
They have many gifted students.

521
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,904
Are your students well prepared?

522
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:54,658
We can't let such a special opportunity
slip through our fingers.

523
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:58,453
Since our school is hoping
to be designated as a school for gifted,

524
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,414
we have rigorously prepared
our students for this competition.

525
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,748
That's right.

526
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,960
There she is.

527
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:10,257
She is their math teacher
at Asung High. Ms. Ji Yoon-su.

528
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,844
I heard a lot of good things about you.
You're Sung-jae's fiancée.

529
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,723
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

530
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,685
I must go and gather our two students.

531
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:27,691
She's Sung Ye-lin
and representing Asung High.

532
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,692
Ye-lin, say hello.

533
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:32,738
This is Minister Jung Il-young
and Vice Minister Shin Seung-jae.

534
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,699
Nice to meet you. My name is Sung Ye-lin.

535
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,618
I heard that Senator Sung's daughter
was entering the competition.

536
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,745
So that's her.

537
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,288
I'm looking forward
to hearing your speech.

538
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,622
Thank you.

539
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,249
Let's go, Ye-lin.

540
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:49,880
Yoon-su.

541
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,842
I'll be watching the contest.

542
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:55,719
Call me after it's over.

543
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,054
Isn't Asung High
getting special attention?

544
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,806
I didn't know the ministers
were also there.

545
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,808
It's fine. They just came to say hello.

546
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,059
Do your best.

547
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,192
Did you see Seung-yoo?

548
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:13,236
-I saw him heading to the lecture hall.
-You did?

549
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,576
Ye-lin, go ahead to the waiting room.

550
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,661
Okay.

551
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,995
Where are you, Seung-yoo?

552
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,665
I…

553
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,002
What did you say? I can't hear you.

554
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,130
I'm sorry.

555
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,177
I don't think I can do this.

556
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,889
Where are you?

557
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,140
I'm sorry.

558
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,643
I'm sorry, Ms. Ji.

559
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:33,316
Where are you? I'll come to you.

560
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,034
Melencolia?

561
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,037
Isn't it referring to depression?

562
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:31,541
Well, depression refers to

563
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,627
feeling down and lethargic.

564
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,880
But when you keep spiraling downward,

565
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,758
you'll hit rock bottom.

566
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,094
There's nothing around you.

567
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:46,056
You reach a state of nothingness.

568
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,560
There's a ray of light shining here.

569
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,026
When there's absolutely nothing,

570
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,987
you start hoping for a new beginning.

571
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,291
You'll notice things
you didn't see before.

572
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,538
Promise me one thing.

573
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,126
Don't fall in love with this problem.

574
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,255
As a mathematician,

575
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:04,009
solving a problem doesn't make you happy.

576
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,303
Also, an unsolvable problem
doesn't make you unhappy too.

577
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,515
Then why do mathematicians

578
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,268
keep solving problems?

579
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:20,191
When you work on it,
there's a tingling sensation,

580
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,777
excitement,

581
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:24,988
or anxiety that you feel.

582
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,668
Whether or not you find the answer,

583
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,629
it's the moment
when you're engrossed in it

584
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,382
that enraptures you.

585
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,184
Seung-yoo!

586
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,573
Are you okay?

587
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,869
I solved it.

588
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,164
I found the answer.

589
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,716
-That's good, Seung-yoo. But what's wrong?
-Later.

590
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:28,718
I'll tell you later.

591
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,555
We need to go first.

592
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,601
-Jang Yoo-jin of Gayoung High.
-Present.

593
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,937
-Sung Ye-lin of Asung High.
-Present.

594
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,688
Paik Seung-yoo of Asung High.

595
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,317
Paik Seung-yoo of Asung High.

596
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,738
Paik Seung-yoo from Asung High is here!

597
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:49,739
Sit over there.

598
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,806
Wow, it's amazing.

599
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,724
It sure is amazing.

600
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,059
This way, sir.

601
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,811
Go ahead.

602
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,604
Okay.

603
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,692
You're here?

604
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,445
Yes, it'll begin soon. Okay.

605
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,789
Honey, let's go inside.

606
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:18,036
What? Director Noh Jung-ah
is already here.

607
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,538
-Let's say hello.
-Not now.

608
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:24,876
Hi, Director.

609
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:27,212
Hello, Ms. Yoo.

610
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,630
I'm so nervous.

611
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:31,174
-Do you think Ye-lin will do well?
-Don't worry.

612
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:33,760
I saw her earlier and she looked ready.

613
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,012
Really? I'm so relieved to hear that.

614
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,181
-I'll see you afterward.
-Sure.

615
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,689
-She has the same one.
-What?

616
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:50,735
You bought this for me in Italy, remember?

617
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:53,446
Director Noh had the same accessory
on her handbag.

618
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,282
Must be a similar item.

619
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,243
This was really expensive.

620
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,787
She wore a dress.

621
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,584
Can I sit next to you?

622
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,046
What brings you here?

623
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,965
I came to see the Asung High students

624
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:15,635
since you say they're so great.
I'm very curious.

625
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:43,913
We'll begin the special youth
mathematics speech competition

626
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,915
ahead of the opening

627
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,376
of the 2017 International
Mathematician Olympics.

628
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,262
Advanced information technology
that underlies

629
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,847
the Fourth Industrial Revolution,

630
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:05,018
such as artificial intelligence,
the internet of things,

631
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,895
and big data,
are all based on mathematics.

632
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,692
Automatic driving
is an important technology

633
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,277
in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

634
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,279
For example, mathematical principles

635
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:20,450
such as control theory
are used to arrive at a destination.

636
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:28,666
-This drone is controlled through…
-That's interesting.

637
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,834
…wireless signals.

638
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,046
You have to align the center of gravity
in order to enable

639
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,548
-vertical take-off and landing.
-They're so good.

640
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,802
Archimedes once said that
there are things which seem incredible

641
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,680
to most men
who have not studied mathematics.

642
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:51,230
Sung Ye-lin of Asung High. You're next.

643
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,316
-Like a car that drives by itself,
-Okay.

644
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:57,195
a talking android,
and a city managed by big data,

645
01:00:57,278 --> 01:01:00,865
it has the power
to make our dream future come true.

646
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:06,913
The next contestant is Sung Ye-lin
from Asung High School.

647
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,760
ASUNG HIGH SCHOOL, SUNG YE-LIN

648
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:02,635
Awesome.

649
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,096
It's game over.

650
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,686
Paik Seung-yoo of Asung High. Your turn.

651
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,002
The next contestant

652
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:39,505
is Paik Seung-yoo of Asung High School.

653
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,777
An AI supercomputer can write a novel.

654
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,446
It can also compose music.

655
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,659
It has even beat humans
in the ancient game of Go.

656
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:12,872
Going forward,
AI will open up new possibilities.

657
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:16,042
And they say it can carry out
unlimited tasks.

658
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:21,464
But will AI surpass humans
and reach limitless heights?

659
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:26,177
Are there an infinite or finite
number of stars in the night sky?

660
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,847
It is said that there are
a finite number of stars in the universe.

661
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:34,519
Well, I could count all the stars
in this painting right now.

662
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:41,692
Are these lights finite or infinite?

663
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,488
There is also a finite number
of electrons in the entire universe.

664
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:47,824
Would it be an enormous task
to count all these lights?

665
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:50,326
He's not making any points.

666
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:54,956
But I saw infinity within this painting.

667
01:03:56,249 --> 01:04:00,419
The stars in this painting that were drawn
by Vincent van Gogh in 1889

668
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:04,715
impressed people even after 100 years

669
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:08,594
and will continue to do so,
even 1,000 years from now.

670
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:12,098
Although he lived a finite life,

671
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,225
his works contain an infinite quality.

672
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:20,731
In the beginning of my talk,
I asked if AI can reach unlimited heights?

673
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:23,359
My answer to that question is

674
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:25,236
AI

675
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:28,948
can only accomplish amazing tasks

676
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:32,869
through formulas and data
entered by humans.

677
01:04:56,684 --> 01:05:01,564
AI that is based on finite data
can never reach infinity.

678
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,067
But…

679
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,070
humans are different.

680
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:16,454
It's our job to imbue
imagination and creativity

681
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:18,748
into AI.

682
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:24,128
Like Cantor, who created the set theory
based on the principles of infinity

683
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:26,756
and solved many complex problems
and made dazzling progress in his field,

684
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:46,442
we can dream with no bounds.

685
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:50,446
And it can also…

686
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,618
free the boundaries of our thinking.

687
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:15,846
I want you to like math,
but not obsess over it.

688
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:19,392
Take that outlook on math.

689
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:27,024
I'd like you to be free
from any constraints.

690
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:30,069
Infinity…

691
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,280
is not in the far future.

692
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,119
It's within us…

693
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:43,541
right now.

694
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:51,549
But can I control that?

695
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,176
Not falling for something

696
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,762
I've fallen for?

697
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:22,788
Everything sounded muffled
and I couldn't hear anything,

698
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,582
but then I heard your voice.

699
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:27,793
We've got a big problem.
A reporter visited him this morning.

700
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,463
Ms. Ji, it seems like
you want to make this into a big issue.

701
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,673
I want to make things right.

702
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,092
When did Ji Yoon-su give that interview?

703
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,094
Then back out. Keep your promise!

704
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,221
I can't keep that promise anymore.

705
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:40,264
Ms. Ji!

706
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:42,099
What are you going to do about Ms. Ji?

707
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:44,727
If you cross the line,
you'll leave me with no choice.

708
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,228
It's so obvious.

709
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,064
But you can't hide your feelings.

710
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:54,779
