Well, It's confusing.

44
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,295
Same. We could be confused
about different things

45
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,630
or we could be confused
about the same thing.

for my likeability is Choi Seo-eun.

KIM HAN-BIN

48
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,770
She worked really hard
when we were preparing dinner.

49
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,939
We talked while we were cooking,

50
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,274
and she laughed a lot.

51
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,942
So I chose her.

52
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,905
The person who I voted for
as the most likeable is Choi Jong-woo.

CHOI SEO-EUN

54
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,242
When we were eating,
I still felt kind of awkward,

55
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,994
so we didn't get to talk much.

56
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:26,581
But since he was across from me,
I saw him smile a lot.

57
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,209
I chose Shin Seul-ki.

58
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,502
CHOI JONG-WOO

59
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,672
I think it's because she's close
to my ideal type

60
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:39,844
and she has a kind of charm that makes me
want to get to know her better.

61
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,765
So, I think that's why I chose Seul-ki.

62
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,018
I chose Dong-woo for my likeability.

SHIN SEUL-KI

64
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:52,649
We went to get water together yesterday,
and he seemed very calm.

65
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,985
And it felt like we had good chemistry.

66
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,779
So, I think we became a bit close.

67
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,780
No.

68
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,700
I think Dong-woo, who I voted for,
would have written me a postcard.

69
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,412
It felt like he kept talking to me

70
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,706
and kept staring at me.

71
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,335
I think Dong-woo would have voted for me.

SHIN DONG-WOO

The first choice of likeability I made
in Inferno was Nadine.

74
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,511
The way she was so awkward at first
and seemed a bit clumsy

75
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,265
brought out this feeling in me
that I should protect her.

76
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,351
And the person
I would like to get to know better is

77
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,521
Shin Seul-ki.

78
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,067
Seul-ki seemed like she has
a pure and innocent charm,

79
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,612
so I want to get
to know her a little better.

80
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,949
I sent a postcard to Dong-woo.

LEE NADINE

82
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,287
How he walked along the island
in the beginning,

83
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,038
that kind of stuck with me.

84
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,418
I think he took care of me a lot.
And he asked me a lot of questions.

85
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,878
I think that's what I liked about him.

86

PARK SE-JEONG

87
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,509
For my choice yesterday,
I chose Yoong-jae.

88
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,930
When we were touring the island together,

89
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,559
he was really friendly
and started lots of conversations

90
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,270
and I liked how he tried
to lessen the awkwardness.

91
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,356
I think I have a splinter.

92
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,942
Is it all right with you
if I tried to take it out?

93
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:18,901
Yes.

94
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,571
He was charming, so I chose Yoong-jae.

95
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:26,784
I'm guessing that…
maybe Yoong-jae voted for me too.

96
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,828
JO YOONG-JAE

97
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:33,124
The person who I chose
as my first likeability is Park Se-jeong.

98
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,795
I chose her
because I was attracted to her looks.

99
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,675
I also liked how when we were touring
the island, she started conversations.

100
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,969
So we had a good time talking.

101
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,888
LEE SO-E

102
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,975
I sent my card to… Yoong-jae.

103
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:56,731
I'm a very shy person,
so I'm not good at starting conversations.

104
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,068
But I felt comfortable
when I talked to Yoong-jae yesterday,

105
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,445
he seemed very mature to me.

106
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,949
So, I just thought
that I would like to talk to him more.

107
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:13,247
So, Han-bin chose Seo-eun,
Seo-eun chose Jong-woo.

108
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,500
Jong-woo chose Seul-ki,
Seul-ki chose Dong-woo,

109
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,418
Dong-woo chose Nadine.
Everyone just keeps…

110
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,544
Missing each other.

111
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,880
The lines are all crisscrossed.

112
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,468
As of now, the only singles
whose choices were reciprocated

113
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,054
-are Shin Dong-woo and Lee Nadine.
-[Kyuhyun] Yes.

114
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,348
[Jin-kyung] And Choi Yoong-jae
and Park Se-jeong.

115
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,557
[Kyuhyun] Two couples.

116
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,726
These two couples
are connected perfectly, right?

117
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,896
And then the two who unfortunately
didn't get any votes

118
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,148
are Kim Han-bin and Lee So-e.

119
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,692
So there's one person from each side.

120
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,654
-But we don't know how this will change.
-[Kyuhyun] Right.

121
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,739
That's the beauty of Single's Inferno.

122
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,867
And even though Dong-woo
gave his vote to Nadine,

123
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,037
the person he wanted
to get to know better is Seul-ki.

124
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,623
-Right.
-This is how they felt in the beginning.

125
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,041
Their first impression.

126
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,627
In Single's Inferno,
people's feelings change.

127
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,255
And in terms of the second couple
with Yoong-jae in the middle,

128
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,758
So-e and Se-jeong both chose Yoong-jae.

129
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,177
But, since Yoong-jae chose Se-jeong,

130
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,054
So-e got zero votes.

131
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:15,226
Something tells me So-e will start
to express herself a lot more.

132
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,271
I feel like after getting zero votes,

133
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,440
her attitude is going to change a bit.

134
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,607
-[Jin-kyung] Right.
-Yes.

-On alternative foods.

[Yoong-jae chuckles]

144

Alternative foods.

It's something
I've been meaning to read about

146
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,972
so I guess now is my chance.

-Yes!

I was going to read a book.

But I thought a book might be too much.

151
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,863
Are you reading this so you'll know
how to make these kinds of foods?

-No, it's just a personal…

-Interest?
-Yes.

If there is something I'm interested in,
I have to look into it further.

-Your journal? Oh, how was it yesterday?

157
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,754
I think I was being way too shy,

and awkward.

159
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,426

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,054
and parts of myself
that I don't even recognize.

161
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,348
-It's because you were nervous.
-I was nervous.

162
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,933
It was like that for me too.

163
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,144
Still, you're the one
I talked to the most yesterday.

164
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,062
Right.

165
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,108
I think it'll start to be fun,
uh, once we talk more.

166
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,947
Let's get to know each other.
It's like destiny. This is like destiny.

167
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,156
[chuckling] Right.

168
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,200
[gasps]

169
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,118
[chuckles]

170
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,829
-She's being very straightforward.
-Yeah.

171
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,292
-How tall are you?
-Guess. [chuckling]

172
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,504
[chuckles]

173
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,632
-Fifty-eight?
-Fifty-eight.

174
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,926
-158 cm?
-I'm so short, it's so sad.

175
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,387
But honestly,
I don't think you're short at all.

176
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,430
Really?

177
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,767
I'll guess your height.
Stand up for a second.

178
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,438
This would be…

179
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,565
[chuckles]

180
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,066
This would be…

181
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,153
Hundred… Wait.

182
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,865
185 cm?

183
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:20,369
Eighty-five. Around that. 185-186. 187.

184
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,163
Wow, you're really tall.

185
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,457
Give me 5 cm.

186
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,750
[chuckles]

187
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,877
It's on its way.

188
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,378
[both chuckle]

189
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,799
[chuckles] He said, "It's on its way."

190
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,052
-I support this couple.
-[Hanhae] "It's on its way."

191
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,638
-I'm rooting for those two.
-Right? Me too.

192
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,848
-It's like a romance comic.
-[Da-hee] I'm rooting for them so much.

193
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,768
[Han-bin] I'm hungry.

194
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,520
[Yoong-jae] Let's see
if breakfast will be cereal.

195
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,315
[Han-bin] It's cereal,
bread, milk, and juice.

196
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,691
[Yoong-jae] Oh…

197
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,693
Wait, I think I need juice first.

198
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,279
-[Han-bin] Drink some juice first.
-[Jong-woo] Milk for me.

199
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,199
-Hello.
-[Dong-woo] Cheers.

200
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,159
-Wanna join in for a toast?
-[Nadine] Yes.

201
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,661
[Dong-woo] Orange juice and milk.

202
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,329
-What would you like?
-I'm here.

203
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,623
-Orange juice?
-Yes, orange juice.

204
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,582
Orange juice.

205
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,002
[chuckles softly]

206
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,546
-[Yoong-jae] To our first morning.
-[Dong-woo] Good morning.

207
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,006
-[Han-bin] Good morning!
-[Nadine] Morning!

208
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,924
[Dong-woo] Good morning.

209
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,135
[whimsical music playing]

210
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,809
They're drinking it
like it was a protein shake.

211
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,811
[both laughing]

212
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,980
-[Seo-eun] Hello.
-[Han-bin, Jong-woo] Hello.

213
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,023
Did you sleep well?

214
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,400
-[Han-bin] They're all up.
-Hello.

215
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,819
Oh, there's fruit. Wow.

216
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,239
-I'll cut the fruit with you.
-Oh, sounds good.

217
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,282
I'm quite good at cutting fruits.

218
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,410
-Okay.
-Okay!

219
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,577
I'll help.

220
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,580
[Seul-ki] This looks good.

221
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,665
Can I sit here?

222
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,166
-[Jong-woo] Sure, anywhere.
-Really?

223
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,796
-I knew it.
-[Dong-woo] What'd you do in the morning?

224
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,297
We put makeup on.

225
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,426
You were the first one up.
The most productive.

226
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,802
No, I woke up late.

227
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,138
-Actually, So-e woke up early.
-[Dong-woo] Really?

228
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,806
I was on my way to the restroom, and I…

229
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,017
Oh. The navy blue hoodie?

230
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,770
-No, he's the one with that.
-That's me. Why?

231
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,188
[Seul-ki] I saw you earlier.

232
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,358
-Did the color stand out?
-[Seul-ki] Yes, it kind of stood out.

233
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,484
[chuckles]

234
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,656
I said hi and you just went scurrying by.

235
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,701
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.
I was hiding my bare face.

236
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,411
[Se-jeong] 'Cause you had no make-up on?

237
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,663
[Dong-woo] You don't
look different without makeup.

238
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,166
[Seul-ki] Really?
I'm surprised you recognized me.

239
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,876
-Of course.
-[Seul-ki] Yeah?

240
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,587
-There's not that many people here.
-That's good.

241
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,137
Wow.

242
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,764
I can tell there's something there.

243
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,018
Split this in half.

244
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,563
-Be careful.
-Okay.

245
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,274
Were you hungry when you went to bed?

246
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,860
We kept talking to each other
about how hungry we were.

247
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,197
-Thank God it digested fast.
-Right? I said that too.

248
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,656
Very.

249
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,992
Daikon is digested fast.

250
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,785
[pleasant music playing]

251
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,591
Come and eat.

252
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:24,470
-We feel bad seeing you still working.
-[Han-bin] Eat, these are all cut up now.

253
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,597
-Here.
-[So-e] Thank you.

254
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,515
Sure.

255
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:28,724
Thank you.

-[Han-bin] Seul-ki, left-handed?
-How'd you know?

257
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,359
-[Jong-woo] You're eating with it.
-Yes.

258
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,486
-[Han-bin] You're the only one.
-Am I the only one?

259
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,695
-[Jong-woo] I'm a lefty.
-[Yoong-jae] Me too.

260
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,863
-[Seul-ki] Really?
-Wow.

261
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,782
-[Seul-ki] Lefties are so--
-Hand and foot.

262
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,825
-[Jong-woo] Which foot do you use?
-I'm left-footed too.

263
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:47,868
[Jong-woo] Amazing.

264
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,413
Don't lefties tend
to be more artistic types?

265
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:52,873
They are.

266
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,043
-[Dong-woo] They are?
-Yes, they have good sense.

267
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,963
-Right?
-[So-e] Wow. That's amazing.

What do you need? Water?

-Some apple.
-Apples.

-[Nadine laughs]
-[Dong-woo] Oh!

-[Seul-ki] Yeah.

The view is really nice here,
but you can't see it.

-[Se-jeong] Oh, really?
-[Yoong-jae] Yes, it's really nice.

277
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,496
Tomorrow morning,
you can sit on this side.

278
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,998
I'm a nice view too, right?

279
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:34,915
Even better.

-[all applauding]

Why aren't you eating?

[chuckles nervously]

283
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,722
You're barely eating.

and eat really good food.

-[Seul-ki] Right. I want meat.

She's looking at him when she said that.

287
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,192
She's looking at him and doing this,
like, "I want to go."

288
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,988
I think Se-jeong especially,
expresses herself very clearly.

289
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,158
She says, "Ah, I want to go to Paradise,"
and looked straight at him.

"I want to go to Paradise."

-[Seul-ki] Right. I want meat.

When did you decide
to speak casually to each other?

294
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,297
We decided to start
right when we got up this morning.

-[Han-bin] But nobody can.
-Should we?

-[Han-bin] All together.
-Okay.

-We're calling each other by name, then?
-Sure.

-[Se-jeong] Yes.

00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,457
-They look good, really.
-Thank you.

624
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,167
What were the ones before like?

625
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:40,588
I don't remember the ones she had before,
but these go well with her outfit.

626
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,632
[Jong-woo] You're very
detail-oriented, Yoong-jae.

627
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,133
Yeah, he's the best.

628
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,219
[chuckles]

629
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,681
-Aren't detailed compliments so nice?
-[Kyuhyun] They are.

630
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,391
Right, about the little things.

631
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,978
-[Se-jeong] Sweet potatoes!
-[Han-bin] Sweet potatoes.

632
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,105
-[Seul-ki] Sweet potatoes?
-[Han-bin] Chicken breasts?

633
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,566
-Should I scoot over?
-You want to sit here?

634
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,942
Yes, I'll sit in the middle.

635
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,654
-This is my water.
-You take such good care of your water.

636
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,490
[Seul-ki, Dong-woo and Nadine]
Enjoy the food!

637
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,450
-[Se-jeong] Looks good.
-[Han-bin] So good.

638
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:11,828
Mmm!

639
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,872
-[Se-jeong] Delicious.
-[Dong-woo] It's good?

640
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,665
[Se-jeong] It's good as it is.

641
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,083
[Seo-eun] It's just good.

642
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,127
-They're nice and cold.
-[Seul-ki] Mmm!

643
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,255
-[Seo-eun] Nice and cold.
-You eat the skin, too, Seul-ki?

644
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,172
Yeah.

645
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,716
-[Dong-woo] Really?
-I eat it with the skin.

646
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,217
-[Seo-eun] It's really nice with the skin.
-[Dong-woo] Why?

647
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,219
[Seul-ki] It's good
if you eat with the skin.

648
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,137
[Seo-eun] Right.

649
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,681
[Dong-woo] I have to peel the skin off.

650
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,683
-[Seul-ki] Really?
-Aren't you supposed to?

651
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,518
[Seo-eun] No, if you eat it with the skin…

652
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,896
There have been times
when I only ate the skin.

653
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,272
Should I try it, then?

654
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,815
[waves splashing]

655
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,362
[indistinct chatter]

656
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,867
Seeing you eat like that

657
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,828
reminds me how they eat
in that old cartoon Black Rubber Shoes.

658
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,371
Black Rubber Shoes.

659
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,373
That's funny.

660
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,959
[quirky music playing]

661
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,676
[Se-jeong] You prefer Korean
sweet potatoes or garnet sweet potatoes?

662
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,638
-[Han-bin] What are these?
-[Se-jeong] Honey sweet potatoes.

663
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,682
I was joking.

664
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,024
Watching you makes me
want to peel it for you.

665
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,233
How should I peel it?

666
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,277
-Just all at once.
-All at once?

667
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,279
[Dong-woo] At the end, press onto it and…

668
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,031
-[Nadine] Like this?
-…it'll come out like this.

669
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,116
[Se-jeong] You still
have to peel some more.

670
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,457
I think Dong-woo is very conflicted
between the two.

671
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,334
-[Da-hee] You think he's watching?
-Yes.

672
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,920
-Seul-ki is keeping track of Dong-woo.
-She's watching him.

673
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,548
And Nadine seems to be good at unknowingly
drawing attention to herself.

674
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,549
Don't you think so?

675
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,344
Peeling the sweet potato
and making a mess.

676
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,304
[laughter]

677
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,268
It's really nice to hear
the sound of the waves when it's quiet.

678
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,146
-I was just thinking that.
-[Yoong-jae] I just want to listen.

679
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,107
It's so nice.

680
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,401
-[Jong-woo] I want to stay here.
-[Yoong-jae, So-e] Yeah.

681
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,613
[Jong-woo] We were talking
about who looks the youngest.

682
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,824
-And you're the one So-e chose.
-Me?

683
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,117
-Yeah.
-It wasn't me.

684
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,035
I actually thought
you could be pretty old.

685
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:16,953
[Jong-woo] Really?

686
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,372
-[So-e] From the way you talk.
-The way I talk?

687
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:22,458
-[Jong-woo] It might have been Nadine.
-I think you're the youngest.

688
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,168
-Oh, Yeah?
-Yeah, I can see it.

689
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,462
-You have this vibe.
-[Jong-woo] Oh, my vibe.

690
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,464
You know, people give off vibes.

691
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,758
[mellow guitar music playing]

692
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,094
How are you when you're in a relationship?

693
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,554
-[So-e] Me?
-[Yoong-jae] Yeah.

694
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,016
I think if I like someone,
I'm don't ever leave them wondering.

695
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,351
-[Yoong-jae] Ah.
-[Jong-woo] You act with certainty.

696
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,981
It's not like I do it intentionally,
but it's hard for me to hide my feelings.

697
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,609
-What if more than one person likes you?
-[So-e] Yeah.

698
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,405
But there's only one you like.
How do you handle that situation?

699
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,365
[So-e] If I have feelings for one of them,

700
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,035
then even if it maybe
hurts the other ones,

701
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,247
I think it's right that I express
my feelings exactly as they are.

702
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,125
-Oh.
-[So-e] I think honesty is the best way.

703
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,794
I think for me,

704
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:11,382
I've noticed I tend to drag things out
because I feel sorry for the person, so…

705
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,886
I've dragged things out
because I felt sorry too.

706
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,180
-But I learned that's worse.
-Yeah, that's true.

707
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,432
-[So-e] You're giving them false hope.
-Right.

708
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,642
So I just try to trust my gut

709
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,895
-You just go with your gut?
-Yes.

710
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,356
-[So-e chuckles]
-Is your gut mostly right?

711
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,110
-[So-e] Yes.
-I typically do have a standard.

712
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,820
Yeah, what's your standard?

713
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,657
My typical standard
is someone who's easy to talk to.

714
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,203
Things like this are what I typically
think are important.

715
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,704
-[So-e] Yeah.
-But here,

716
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,624
-we don't have time to check all that out.
-[So-e] Hmm.

717
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,461
So I think I'm gonna do what you do,
and just go with my gut.

718
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,671
-There's so little time.
-[Yoong-jae] Yeah.

719
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,633
For me, it's not my gut so much.

720
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,053
I think if I talk to people
when it's just the two of us

721
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,639
I'll be able to find the person
who is right for me.

722
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,935
That's kind of what I was thinking
when I first came here.

723
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:07,063
I talked to you the most, So-e.
We talked a lot here too.

724
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,482
I also spent a lot of personal time.

725
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,275
[chuckles]

726
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,861
[mellow music playing]

727
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,865
With Jong-woo, it felt like
I was talking to someone my age.

728
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,117
LEE SO-E

729
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,829
Whereas with Yoong-jae,
it felt like he was a lot more mature.

730
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,415
I think I usually tend to go for people

731
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,960
who seem to me like
they are more mature so…

732
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,422
[chuckles]

733
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:39,303
I think Yoong-jae is a good listener.
He's maybe too good of a listener.

734
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,681
He seems to have good manners with anyone.

735
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,352
He listens really intently like that
to anyone and asks questions.

736
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,021
-He seems like that type of person.
-Right.

737
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,732
But here we learn for sure
how So-e feels about them.

738
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,776
I wonder how Yoong-jae feels.

739
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,863
-I'm curious.
-[Jin-kyung] Yes, I'm curious.

740
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,365
-[Seul-ki] Here they come.
-[Seo-eun] Come on.

741
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,575
[Jong-woo] Hello.

742
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,451
[Seul-ki] Did you enjoy the meal?

743
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,287
-[Yoong-jae] It was good.
-[Seul-ki] Really?

744
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,915
-You had chicken breast?
-Yes, sweet potato and chicken breast.

745
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,209
-You like sweet potatoes and you got some?
-[Seul-ki] Yes.

746
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,210
Your wish came true.

747
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,212
-Sweet potatoes.
-Her wish came true.

748
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,338
It wasn't a wish.

749
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,966
You said earlier that
you really liked sweet potatoes.

750
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,094
The colors of your shirts are so…

751
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,431
-The two of you--
-[So-e] They're idol singers.

752
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,767
-But this is similar to yours, Seo-eun?
-Oh, we match?

753
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,519
-Oh, we do.
-[Seul-ki] You do

754
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,772
-It's the same color.
-Right. It's such a bright blue.

755
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,150
Were you wearing this earlier?
You had something else on.

756
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,319
[Se-jeong] Including me, the three of us.

757
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,112
[Yoong-jae] The colors are all so pretty.

758
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,655
-You're twins.
-[Seo-eun] Right?

759
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,116
-Everyone dressed in bright colors today.
-[Yoong-jae] Yes.

760
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,078
-[Nadine] You are wearing the same blue.
-[Seo-eun] Right? It's so pretty.

761
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,496
I really like this shade of blue.

762
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,290
[Nadine] Se-jeong's skirt
is also that shade.

763
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:53,711
[Seo-eun] I like blue.
I could really go for a coffee.

764
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,795
[So-e] Right?

765
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,882
[Seo-eun] Can't get that out here though.
Our only chance is…

766
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,553
-[So-e] Paradise.
-[Seo-eun] Paradise.

767
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,430
[Yoong-jae] It was good.

768
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,641
[Seo-eun] Bacon sounds good.

769
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,809
-[Nadine] It does. True.
-Thinly sliced.

770
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,603
Thin and greasy.

771
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,396
[So-e] Are you okay?

772
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,315
-With Bacon and--
-[Yoong-jae] Yeah, I'm fine.

773
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,399
[Kyuhyun gasps]

774
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,443
-Did you see how she touched him?
-[Da-hee] Yeah.

775
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,905
-She touched him and he was like this.
-[Kyuhyun] Maybe he didn't feel it?

776
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,615
I'm curious, though.

777
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,826
Is there anything you think is important
when it comes to guys?

778
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,037
I want the person to feel cozy.

779
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,456
There are people who feel comfortable.

780
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,876
They make you feel comfortable
when you're with them.

781
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,712
-Friendly, gentle, and with good manners.
-Right.

782
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,798
-[Seul-ki] Yeah.
-Even if I don't say anything,

783
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,008
-they watch and take care of me.
-[Seul-ki] Right.

784
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,969
[Seo-eun] And they can't lack depth.

785
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:46,055
They strike the right balance
without overdoing it.

786
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,975
Seems like we all value similar things.

787
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,477
Did one guy get all the votes yesterday?

788
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,689
-[Se-jeong] Who?
-No way.

789
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,440
[Nadine] I think it's possible.

790
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,943
You all sound like you're
talking about the same guy.

791
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,445
[Jong-woo] I don't know
who Yoong-jae will pick.

792
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,823
To be honest, unless you go to Paradise,

793
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,492
what you can talk about
is too limited here.

794
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,160
Too limited.

795
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,997
-You talked to Seul-ki earlier.
-[Dong-woo] Yeah.

796
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,167
[Han-bin] How was it when
you two talked? Was it awkward?

797
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,087
-I think she's just cute.
-[Dong-woo] And innocent.

798
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,882
Are you saying you're conflicted
between two people?

799
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,803
-The person you liked in the beginning…
-Not sure it's the person I had in mind.

800
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:26,846
[Han-bin] Yes.

801
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,097
I'm confused.

802
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,933
-So I want to talk to them some more.
-[Han-bin] Right.

803
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,977
I want to talk to everyone some more.

804
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,523
-But there's so little time.
-Me too. I feel like there's no time.

805
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,234
The way we have to choose
so suddenly like this.

806
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,486
-[Jong-woo] Yeah. Too hard.
-[Han-bin] It's hard.

807
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,451
When I first meet guys,
I usually tease them a lot.

808
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,202
I'm kind of like that.

809
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,496
-You seem like you're playful.
-[Nadine] Yes.

810
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,333
-But for that to show…
-It takes time?

811
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,459
-…I need time.
-Right.

812
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,503
So I can't help
but feel awkward right now,

813
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,547
I'm just sitting here like, "Yes."

814
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,466
"Yes."

815
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,677
-You did seem to only respond.
-Yes, you're right.

816
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,179
I know I shouldn't be.

817
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,139
No, that's just your personality.

818
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,016
Yeah, you'll get better as time goes by.

819
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,434
Once you get close.

820
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,479
It's still so awkward.

821
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,147
Go try right now.

822
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,233
We only get such
a short period of time, so…

823
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,986
I think we should be
more actively talking.

824
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,529
-[Seul-ki] So true.
-[Nadine] Hmm.

825
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,157
[chuckles]

826
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,873
[Nadine] Hello.

827
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,584
-Do you want to go get water?
-[Dong-woo] Yes, water.

828
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,212
-[Nadine] Thirsty?
-[Dong-woo] I was just feeling thirsty.

829
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,964
You came to me
right when I started feeling thirsty.

830
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,342
I watched you afar when you first came.

831
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,136
-[Nadine] Yeah?
-[Dong-woo] Uh… You were pretty.

832
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,389
So I was like, "Who is that?"

833
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:55,101
-[Nadine] Oh, really?
-[Dong-woo] Yes. It turned out to be you.

834
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,021
-Go ahead.
-[Nadine] Thank you.

835
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:03,109
Talking over just water
like this and not coffee…

836
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,610
-Right.
-This is new.

837
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,861
Yes.

838
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,948
But the reason I wanted
to talk to you is… [chuckles]

839
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:14,829
I appreciated how you asked me
a lot of questions on the first day.

840
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,582
[chuckling] But I think
I acted too cold to you.

841
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,794
Was your journey here all right?

842
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,004
Ah, yes.

843
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,757
Do you like sports?

844
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,050
Yes.

845
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,803
-Do you like walking?
-Yes.

846
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,807
[women laughing]

847
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,519
[Dong-woo] I like it too.

848
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,354
-[Nadine] I'm sorry.
-Do you like walking?

849
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,189
"Do you like walking"? Yes, I do.

850
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,357
[chuckles]

851
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,234
Your English is really good.

852
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:48,112
But your response is still the same
even if I ask in English.

853
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,530
[laughs]

854
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,074
-He's right.
-[Jin-kyung] She gave short answers.

855
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,617
-She felt bad.
-Oh.

856
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,328
-Dong-woo really did put in a good effort.
-[Da-hee] Yeah.

857
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,956
[Kyuhyun] Dong-woo's fun. He's charming.

858
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,751
Ah. But I understand
because you don't feel comfortable.

859
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,754
-Yeah. That's why I was thinking…
-Yeah.

860
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:10,009
"Maybe he took it the wrong way."
I guess that's what I was thinking.

861
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,219
Ah, I mean, I understand.

862
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,723
And I felt like I wanted
to take care of you

863
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,894
seeing that you were feeling
unfamiliar and a little uncomfortable.

864
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:21,979
Hmm.

865
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,357
Thank you. [chuckles]

866
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,067
Yeah, I think that's how I felt.

867
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,028
-Hmm.
-But…

868
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,363
How are you doing here?

869
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,241
-Inferno's fun for me.
-Inferno shouldn't be fun for you.

870
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,910
-But it's fun.
-You have to go to Paradise.

871
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,578
It's really fun. [chuckles]

872
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,290
How else would I have an experience
like this? On a deserted island.

873
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,750
I like adventures.

874
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,920
But you should go to Paradise
and eat good food,

875
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,463
enjoy good vibes.

876
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,800
For me, I don't think
"I want to go to Paradise."

877
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,887
Nice bed, nice bathroom.
You know, all that stuff

878
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,932
I want to go there with someone
who I want to get to know.

879
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:03,354
You know, someone
I'm really interested in.

880
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,688
Someone I like.

881
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:11,153
But what's important about Paradise is
that there you can talk… about everything.

882
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,281
-Yeah.
-Do you feel this way? Like,

883
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,409
you could have multiple people
you're curious about?

884
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:22,998
I… I want to get to know
one person one at a time.

885
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,252
If I'm interested in someone,

886
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,046
I don't think my energy goes
anywhere else.

887
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,132
So rather than going back and forth

888
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,636
between multiple people
and talking to them, I just…

889
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,224
I just want to get to know
one person, one at a time. Take it easy.

890
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,936
So, like, do you believe
in love at first sight?

891
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,980
-No, not that.
-Not that?

892
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,147
Not that.

893
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,315
[chuckles] Never.

894
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,400
I just…

895
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,904
I don't know.
I'm just not interested in other people

896
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,990
while I'm, like, looking at one person.

897
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,667
I'm curious, though.
I want to have more serious conversations.

898
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,297
I want to ask questions, but I can't.

899
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:15,050
We'll be able to talk more
in Paradise, right?

900
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,017
-Did you finish your water?
-I'm saving it.

901
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,976
[chuckles]

902
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,395
-Water is precious.
-[intercom chiming]

903
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,188
[Master] Singles.

904
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,983
Please get ready to go to Paradise.

905
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,693
[sighs]

906
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,153
-Let's go.
-It's time to choose.

907
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,237
Let's go.

908
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,656
Let's leave these here.

909
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,118
The color of your outfit
is really pretty today.

910
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,453
Ah, thanks.

911
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,622
I only wear achromatic colors.

912
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:48,042
[laughs] Me too.

913
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,296
-Meaningful talk.
-I have a good feeling about this couple.

914
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,798
Dong-woo is charming
when he's talking with another person.

915
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,967
-I think I saw some of his charms.
-[Kyuhyun] Right.

916
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,677
He's very sincere.

917
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,388
Now I definitely get why he got two votes.

918
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,683
-And Nadine is very charming too.
-[Jin-kyung] Yeah.

919
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,435
Now that I see her talk.

920
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,229
[waves splashing]

921
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,495
[mellow music playing]

922
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:41,512
There are two people
who I wanna talk to more.

923
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,931
JO YOONG-JAE

924
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,518
I'm not quite sure yet
who I want to go with…

925
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,313
to Paradise.

926
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,816
Just not sure yet.

927
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,696
Yoong-jae seems like
he's a little confused.

928
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,657
-[Kyuhyun] Yeah.
-Wheels are turning.

929
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,202
-Se-jeong and So-e both gave him signals.
-[Hanhae] Yeah.

930
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,632
-Have you decided yet?
-It's harder than I thought.

931
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,093
-[Yoong-jae sighs]
-[Seo-eun chuckles softly]

932
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,763
-[Yoong-jae] Got a lot on your mind?
-[Seo-eun] On my mind?

933
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,934
I did, but I should be making
a decision right about now.

934
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,355
-What's your standard for choosing?
-My standard for choosing?

935
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,066
Am I'm still curious about the person.

936
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,612
Are you going to choose someone
you're curious about?

937
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:45,159
Do you have someone you're curious about?
And someone you like separately?

938
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,871
I want to choose her
because I'm really curious,

939
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,291
but I'm worried
she might not be curious about me.

940
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,250
Hmm.

941
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,628
You're not worried about that?

942
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,548
Well, it's not like
I can actually change that

943
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,092
by worrying about
what he might be thinking.

944
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,304
Don't you think it's important to do
what your heart tells you to do?

945
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,763
-[Yoong-jae] Uh…
-Yeah.

946
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,309
-You're very wise.
-Mmm. [smacks lips]

947
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,561
No, I worry a lot too.

948
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:17,483
But this feels like the time
for being honest about how I feel.

949
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:20,777
Yeah.

950
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,154
[mellow music playing]

951
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,865
So did my advice help at all?

952
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,075
You're really good at talking.

953
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,079
-[laughs] Really?
-Yes.

954
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:35,375
-I'm like…
-You have a nice tone, and it's like…

955
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,463
-Your job… Oh, we can't talk about that.
-[chuckles]

956
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,341
Oh, you're curious about my job? [laughs]

957
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,509
Of course.

958
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,885
-You're curious?
-Yes.

959
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,553
Are you curious?

960
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,347
-I am curious.
-Ah, you are curious

961
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,556
Of course I am.

962
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,893
-This is fun.
-It is fun.

963
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,854
It's like, starting today,
everything will be getting serious.

964
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,899
-It's fun talking about this.
-Right?

965
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,234
-Yes.
-It's fun.

966
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,694
I don't know if it's just me,

967
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,531
but Yoong-jae seems to get
more one-on-one conversations.

968
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:08,200
Yoong-jae's face when he was
talking to Choi Seo-eun

969
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,370
looked like he was asking her
something he's curious about.

970
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,455
-Uh, no, it didn't.
-[Da-hee] Right?

971
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,750
Isn't it acting like he's asking her
something he's really curious about?

972
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,628
But I think Seo-eun
really has feelings for Yoong-jae.

973
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,088
-Really?
-Really?

974
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,716
If she does have feelings,
isn't she approaching him a bit too late?

975
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,427
I mean, it seems like she's interested.

976
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,428
-It does?
-[Hanhae] Yes.

977
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,513
[Jin-kyung] It does?

978
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,598

[groovy music playing]

980
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,066
[intercom chiming]

981
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,277
[Master] We will now
match the first couples

982
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,737
who will go on a date in Paradise.

983
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,365
My heart hurts.

984
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,702
I'm nervous all of a sudden.

985
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,413
It'll be interesting
if we chose the same people.

986
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,497
[Dong-woo] Gosh.

987
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,667
[Dong-woo] Today, I'm--

988
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,044
[Master] The male participants
have already chosen

989
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:04,590
the female participants
they want to go to Paradise with.

990
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:05,966
Really?

991
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,759
30 MINUTES EARLIER

992
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,761
-[Jong-woo] Wow, the ticket.
-[Han-bin] Wow.

993
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:13,348
-[Dong-woo] Supposed to take this with us.
-[Yoong-jae] I'm so conflicted.

994
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,058
[upbeat music playing]

995
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,946
[Master] Now, female participants,

996
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,407
come out to the campfire one by one

997
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,911
and say the name of the male participant
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

998
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,623
[gasps] We're supposed to go out
and say their names?

999
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,041
-[So-e] No way.
-Is that right?

1000
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,167
[gasps]

1001
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:44,338
[Master] If the male participant
you call out chose you back,

1002
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,884
you can escape to Paradise together
and enjoy your date.

1003
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,472
-Do you think you made the right choice?
-Yeah.

1004
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,683
Curious to see what happens.
Will anyone actually leave?

1005
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,019
-Will anyone go to Paradise?
-[Yoong-jae] We don't know.

1006
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:02,522
The matching of the first couples
to go on a date in Paradise finally begun.

1007
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,942
-Is this method the same as before?
-[Kyuhyun] Yes, it is.

1008
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:09,071
The men have already chosen the women
they want to go to Paradise with.

1009
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:12,032
Now, the women will come out
to the campfire one by one

1010
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,369
and say the name of the guy
they'd like to go to Paradise with.

1011
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:19,581
But both the man and the woman
have to have chosen each other

1012
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,583
for them to go to Paradise.

1013
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,002
If the choices do not match,

1014
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,172
they stay in Inferno,
no matter how many votes they got.

1015
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:30,592
So with this, it's important
to feel the same way about each other.

1016
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,637
-Getting lots of votes is meaningless.
-That's right.

1017
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,348
So the key is,
will it be Se-jeong and Yoong-jae?

1018
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,059
-Or So-e and Yoong-jae?
-I'm also curious about that.

1019
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,603
People will be curious
to see what happens.

1020
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,648
And on top of that,
Seo-eun approached Yoong-jae earlier

1021
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:48,652
and perhaps expressed herself
by saying all those things.

1022
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,364
But the conversation
between Seo-eun and Yoong-jae…

1023
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,324
Didn't you think it had no substance?

1024
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,493
-Huh? No!
-Then it meant something?

1025
00:49:56,576 --> 00:50:00,414
I thought Seo-eun expressed her feelings
to Yoong-jae in her own way.

1026
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,833
-I think she expressed herself.
-[Da-hee] But this--

1027
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:06,253
So Seo-eun is not the type to do "aegyo"

1028
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,630
or be obvious or flirtatious.

1029
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,215
-No, she's not.
-Yeah.

1030
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,425
So to her,

1031
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,719
she was being indirect and cool

1032
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,596
about how she's developing feelings
towards Yoong-jae.

1033
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,390
And I think Yoong-jae got that.

1034
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,641
[Jin-kyung] Let's guess.

1035
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,185
-I want him to choose So-e.
-[Da-hee] Yeah.

1036
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,937
But I think he chose Se-jeong.

1037
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,065
Me too. I think Yoong-jae
will choose Se-jeong this time.

1038
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,484
-[Jin-kyung] Yes.
-And Dong-woo will choose Seul-ki.

1039
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,527
[Kyuhyun] Huh?

1040
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,279
-[Jin-kyung] Not Nadine?
-Not Nadine?

1041
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:36,700
No, but I'm stuck on how he said
he wants to get to know Seul-ki.

1042
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,911
So I think it'll be between those two.

1043
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,706
Dong-woo will definitely choose Nadine.

1044
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,541
-[Da-hee] Nadine, this time?
-Yes, Nadine.

1045
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,001
Let's get to it and see.

1046
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,669
Let's hurry up. I'm curious.

[Jong-woo] I didn't think
it would be this bad.

is Dong-woo.

-[Kyuhyun] I think he will.

Because he wants to take care of her.

1229
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,959
[Seo-eun] It's so nice.

1230
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:55,128
[Jong-woo] Paradise must be fun.

1231
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,672
-[Han-bin] I wonder what they're doing.
-[Jong-woo] Staring at each other?

1232
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:58,923
[Se-jeong] This is tough.

1233
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,550
I've got a lot on my mind.

1234
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,343
[So-e] I'm so sad.

1235
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,594
[Jong-woo] Don't cry.

[both laughing]

1237
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,056
[Dong-woo] What if I can't sleep
because my heart explodes?

1238
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:07,974
[Seul-ki] That is possible.

1239
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:10,810
[Jong-woo] I should take courage.
I should get closer.

1240
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:15,440
[Nadine] I was interested, but it's not
like my feelings were serious.

1241
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,483
[So-e] I was literally abandoned.

1242
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,318
-[Seo-eun] What?
-[Yoong-jae] Someone's coming.

1243
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,362
-[Nadine] Who'd come now?
-[Seo-eun] Someone new.

1244
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,406
-[Seo-eun] What?
-[Yoong-jae] Is this supposed to happen?

1245
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,283
-[Dong-woo] This isn't right.
-[Seul-ki] He was so cool.

1246
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,618
[Nadine] I want to talk to the new guy.

1247
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,662
[Seo-eun] For some reason, I'm excited.

1248
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:33,082
[Yoong-jae] What if she's too cool?
It could upset me.

1249
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:36,127
[Seul-ki] Honestly, I'm really conflicted.
