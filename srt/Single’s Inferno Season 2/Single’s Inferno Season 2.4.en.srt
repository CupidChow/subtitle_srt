please choose two women you would
like to enjoy the special meal with.

Choi Seo-eun

00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,124
Great job, everyone.

That sound like such a good meal.

-The two who went to Paradise?
-Right.

27
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,722
Ah, so then it's the three again.

28
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,058
Ah, this is like fate is playing a trick.

29
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,727
Meanwhile, poor Jong-woo and Han bin.

00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,020
No, don't.

31
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,275
They have to do something.
But the new guy won the special meal.

32
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,238
-The second he got here…
-[Jin-kyung] They lost their opportunity--

33
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,280
to get a special meal--

34
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,824
And with the women,

35
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,993
those who've been to Paradise,
have both been chosen again.

36
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,829
So, it's, like…

37
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:05,083
I think Seul-ki and Jin-young could really
get along.

38
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,671
Because she thought Dong-woo being
aggressive was too much pressure for her.

39
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:13,341
The way I see Jin-young is,
he's kind of, blunt like this.

40
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,634
That's what he seems.

41
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:18,805
So, he seems like someone Seul-ki
can approach more.

42
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,266
-They could go well together.
-[Da-hee] Yes.

43
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,270
[Seo-eun] We didn't expect
this kind of situation at all today.

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,896
Suddenly a new guy.

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,232
[Nadine] The two of you
are different types.

46
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,985
Your appearances are very different.

47
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,737
Maybe he picked you because you're pretty.

48
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,656
-[Seul-Ki] No.
-[Seo-eun] So, pretty.

49
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,408
Yeah, but…

50
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,538
What?

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,623
But it's like…

52
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,376
You don't know what to do.

53
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,297
No, but really,
wasn't he kind of cool earlier?

54
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,465
So, go tell him.

55
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,926
-Don't tell us.
-[Seo-eun] Right.

56
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,514
I think you're totally crushing on him.

57
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,851
No, it's not that.
He was just a really cool earlier.

58
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,270
When he was done, he turned around and…

59
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,397
-[Seul-ki] Yeah.
-went like this.

60
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,151
Right? His face was so calm.

61
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,277
[Seul-ki] Yeah.

62
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,739
[Kyuhyun] Her heart skipped a beat.

63
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,116
Yeah, it seems like
she really fell for him.

64
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,493
She's normally this expressed by nature.

65
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,205
What were your first impressions of him
when he entered? Let's talk about it.

66
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:30,168
I feel like his job wouldn't require him
to be on a set schedule.

67
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,254
He would have more freedom.

68
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,340
For me, it was his hair.

69
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,800
That was interesting.
For a man to have that--

70
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,760
[Se-jeong] Long hair.

71
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,803
-Yes he's good looking.
-[Se-jeong] Yeah.

72
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,513
He seemed to carry himself well.

73
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,141
When he was walking, he wasn't fidgeting.

74
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,143
-He looked at the ocean.
-[So-e laughs]

75
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,270
He could have acted
all shy, like this.

76
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,188
[Seo-eun] Right?

77
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,107
But… he looked at the ocean.

78
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,108
[Seo-eun] Right?

79
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,151
[Se-jeong] He was cool.

80
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,445
He seems to have a lot of self-confidence.

81
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:01,074
This is the first time hearing
Seul-ki describe someone as cool.

82
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,492
[Se-jeong] You're right.

83
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,410
Yeah, this is the first time.

Isn't her reaction different?

87
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,543
[Se-jeong] He reaction--

88
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,295
[Seo-eun] She's acting different.

89
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,797
[Se-jeong] Different from before.

90
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,299
You're doing this because you're shy.

00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,009
-[Seo-eun] You keep smiling.
-Really?

-Really?

95
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,599
I am very curious.

96
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,019
What kind of person is he that
he has that immense strain?

97
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,772
[So-e] Look into it for us.
Maybe he lived overseas.

98
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,024
[Seo-eun laughs]
Have you lived overseas?

99
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,734
Find out everything.

100
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,236
And then tell us how he is.

101
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,323
I really want to know
why he picked you two.

102
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,993
I will ask him in detail.

103
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,412
It feels like
everything's going to change.

104
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,955
All of it.

105

They're going crazy.

106
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,501
He took control of the mood immediately.

107
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,045
This one moment was more than
the last three days.

108

-[Han-bin] To have the special meal.

-[Han-bin] Enjoy. See you later.
-[Jong-woo] Enjoy.

116
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,650
[Seul-ki] Bye.

117
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,029

118

Those two look excited.

119

[Jong-woo] Yeah.

-I'm hungry.
-[Yoong-jae] Yeah.

121

Let's make guesses on our way there.

122
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,541
What kind of person do you think he'll be?

123
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:37,628
I think he'll be exactly like
my first impression of him, very reserved.

124
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,505
Reserved and?

125
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,467
I think he could be…

126
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,261
can be quite fun.

127
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,346
No?

128
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,684
-[Seo-eun] You think he'll be fun?
-[Seul-ki laughs]

129
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,894
[Seo-eun] In what way?

130
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,273
[Seul-ki] He could be different
from his first impression.

131
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,858
[Seo-eun] There could be a twist?

132
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,653
[upbeat music playing]

133
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,336
-[Seo-eun] Hello.
-Yes, hello.

134
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,879
-[Seul-ki] Hello.
-Yes, hello.

135
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,425
-[Seo-eun] Have you been waiting long?
-[Jin-young] I just got here.

136
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,718
[Seul-ki] Isn't it hot?

137
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:26,844
Yes.

138
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,223
"Isn't it hot?" "Yes."

139
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,975
[Da-hee] Most would say, "No, It's fine."

140
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,811
-He's not ordinary.
-He's not ordinary.

141
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,063
I've never seen anyone like him before.

142
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:40,900
[Seo-eun] Thank you.

143
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,110
Ah, no.

144
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,904
-[Seul-ki] For choosing us.
-[Seo-eun] We don't…

145
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,824
You may not know this yet,
but we don't really get to…

146
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,867
-Ah…
-eat like this here.

147
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,953
-Really?
-[Seo-eun] This is very nice.

148
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,082
-You must be hungry.
-[Jin-young] Yes, I am.

149
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,669
-[Seul-ki] Enjoy the food.
-[Jin-young] Yes, let's eat.

My pleasure.

154
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,112
[Seul-ki] You eat it with the sauce
poured on top?

155
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,198
I was going to do half and half,
so you can have a choice.

-[Seul-ki] Thanks.
-Thank you.

-Oh.

00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,497
-He still does everything he can do.
-That's right.

160
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:40,960
Eat.

161
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,299
"Eat."

162
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,344
-[Da-hee] He's very unique.
-Ah, this is funny.

163
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,222
Eat.

164
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,479
You don't really have much
of a change in facial expression.

165
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,189
You're charismatic.

166
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,733
-It's because I'm nervous,
-[Seul-ki] Really?

167
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,902
What's your personality like usually?

168
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,944
-[Jin-young] Me?
-Yes.

169
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,448
I tend to be a bit shy
with people I don't know.

170
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,367
-[Seul-ki] Really?
-I'm sorry I asked you to eat with me.

171
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,370
And I'm shy.

172
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:22,001
Why did you choose us
when you didn't even know our names?

173
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,462
-[Seul-ki] Right.
-[Seo-eun] How did you choose?

174
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:28,674
I think you just had a good
first impressions. Very…

175
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,885
bubbly, which I liked.

176
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,307
And pretty, which I liked.

177
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,185
You are honest.

178
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,271
-I was just bubbly.
-You were bubbly and pretty.

179
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:45,900
Thank you.

180
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,528
I think you being bubbly is nice to see.

181
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,822
[happy music playing]

182
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,994
[Seul-ki] Do you have an ideal type?

183
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:03,292
My ideal type is someone who I feel sparks
for when I first see them.

184
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,171
-[Seo-eun] Isn't that hard?
-I know.

185
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,924
I think the way it feels
is most important.

186
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,262
And whether she seems easy
to talk to as well.

187
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,889
Do you have a type appearance-wise?

188
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,684
Appearance-wise, I like pretty people.

189
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,021
-You're honest.
-[Jin-young] Yes.

190
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,274
He's honest.

191
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,610
Ah, he's interesting.

192
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,280
Doesn't he kind of feel like

193
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,907
he's the prince
of the island or something?

194
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,493
That's exactly the vibe he gives off.

195
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,619
"You're here. Sit"

196
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,454
-Yeah. "Eat."
-"Eat."

197
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,250
What about you two?

198
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,211
I like someone who has good manners…

199
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,964
and speaks nicely for me.

200
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,175
For me, it's someone who laughs easily.

201
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,680
And someone who I want
to be like, you know?

202
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,724
Somebody you can look up to.

203
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,268
Yeah, I like someone
with a mindset like that.

204
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,567
[Han-bin] Oh, it's sweet potato
and chicken breast.

205
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,154
[all] Enjoy the food.

206
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,574
[Jong-woo] This is the best feast
There's plenty of protein.

207
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,954
[Se-jeong]
This one's mixed with mayonnaise.

208
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,167
[Jong-woo] The sweet potato
is really good.

209
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,418
[woman] Yeah. So good.

210
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,545
How was Paradise?

211
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,507
It was pleasant.

212
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,801
[Se-jeong] The bathroom was nice.

213
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,012
It was nice because
the shower was great.

214
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,138
I heard it was nice.

215
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,389
I have a question.

216
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,893
Have you felt a change of heart
since you've been back?

217
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,187
Change of heart?

218
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,313
[Dong-woo] Yeah.

219
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,942
Going there and talking
and getting to know someone as a person,

220
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,779
-it does change things.
-So, it's different when you go.

221
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,113
It changed things a lot?

222
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,199
Going there,
you get to know that person.

223
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,328
Now he knows the most about Seul-ki
out of all of us.

224
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:12,213
What about you, Yoong-jae?
Is there any noticeable change of heart?

225
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,925
Yeah, there is change.

226
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,927
[suspenseful music playing]

227
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,096
This is hard.

228
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,227
Well, it's not like this at the end now
because we went to Paradise.

229
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,562
[Jong-woo] We can get to know more people.

230
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,897
It hasn't really started yet.

231
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,774
-It did start.
-[Se-jeong] It starts now.

232
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,858
[So-e] It did start.

233
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,111
It's that we need to start.
The five of us.

234
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:41,659
I'm curious to see how things
will play out with the new guy here.

235
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,701
Yeah.

236
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,704
How is the new guy?

237
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,623
We haven't talked much.

238
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,875
Does he not talk a lot?

239
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,420
He seems very calm.
He seems really calm.

240
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,339
-That's exactly what--
-[Se-jeong] We thought.

241
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,427
[Jin-young] How do you eat dinner then?

242
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,929
Us? Yesterday they gave us radishes.

243
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,473
-Radishes?
-Yes, it was radishes, then, pumpkin.

244
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,225
But like just actual pumpkins.

245
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,020
Ah, so that's the kind of food give you?

246
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,022
[Seul-ki] You have to cook with that.

247
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,443
Yeah, and let me tell
you another fun fact. Water.

248
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,654
-We have to-- bring it from over there.
-Water?

249
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,823
-Bring it from there.
-[Seo-eun] Isn't it fun?

250
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,658
We get seaweed from the ocean, too.

251
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,535
[Seul-ki] We also catch anchovies.

252
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,454
[Seo-eun] Sometimes you catch a big fish.

253
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,749
I think you're messing with me.

254
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,298
-He's kind of cute when he smiles.
-[Hanhae] I know.

255
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,008
He has an unexpected charm.

256
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,260
If someone who smiles frowns,
people say something.

257
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,221
But if someone who's always frowning
smiles, people think it's adorable.

258
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,224
We do at least have a bathroom.

259
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,311
We don't dig a hole?

260
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,191
[Seo-eun] I didn't expect that.

261
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,152
I really didn't expect that.
Not that bad.

262
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,570
[Seo-eun] It's not that bad.

263
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:04,158
And when you go to Paradise,
you get to see real luxury.

264
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,327
Right.

265
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,578
Have you been there?

266
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,330
Us? Guess?

267
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,376
I feel like at least one of you
must have been there.

268
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,004
-[Seo-eun] That's for later.
-Later.

269
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,006
You'll get to know things eventually.

270
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,470
-This is fun.
-[Seo-eun] This is fun.

271
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:31,602
I like faces that are kind-looking
and, kind of, friendly-looking, but…

272
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:35,439
Jin-young is the complete
opposite of that.

273
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,401
So, the tension felt different to me,

274
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,154
and I thought it would be nice
to get to know him.

275
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,951
When I first saw Jin-young,

276
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,079
his vibe felt very intense
and charismatic.

277
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,207
But I got this feeling that
once I get to talk to him more,

278
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,251
he'll turn out to be a fun person.

279
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,796
So, I want to keep an eye on him a little,
from now on.

280
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,632
[Han-bin] Your back.

281
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,967
[all exclaim]

282
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,927
[Han-bin] Was the food good?

283
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,304
-Yes.
-We didn't eat well.

284
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,431
[upbeat music playing]

285
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,725
We had sweet potato
and chicken breast.

286
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,227
[Seo-eun] There's rice, too.

287
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,021
[Jong-woo] Introduce yourself.

288
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,275
[Dong-woo] A lot of people
want to talk to you. Since you're new.

289
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,776
[Seo-eun] Self-introduction.

290
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,951
Just as I introduced myself earlier,

291
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,786
my name is Kim Jin-young.

292
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,121
[all] Nice to meet you.

293
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,793
-Any questions?
-Any questions?

294
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,794
[man] Not yet.

295
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,921
Anything you're wondering
about this place.

296
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,631
[Jin-young] About this place.

297
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,969
Who went to Paradise yesterday?

298
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,220
[Han-bin] Those two.

299
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,680
The two you talked to.

300
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,515
[Jong-woo] The men are these two.

301
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,143
This one was paired,
and this one with the other.

302
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,188
-[Han-bin] Confusing, huh?
-[Jong-woo laughs]

303
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,316
[Jong-woo] He's confused already.

304
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,401
[Han-bin] A confusing vortex.

305
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,528
Inferno is okay, too.

306
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,529
It's okay?

307
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,782
-Right?
-[Se-jeong laughs]

308
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,452
Why are you making that face?
[chuckles]

309
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,832
Gosh, this…

310
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,709
The tension.

311
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,922
[indistinct talking]

312
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,674
[Nadine] He shouldn't walk by himself.

313
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,763
Everyone's really tall.

314
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,599
I'm not usually one to be intimidated.

315
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,100
[Dong-woo] Why would you be?

316
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,101
[woman chuckles]

317
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,563
[Nadine] How'd it feel when you walked in?

318
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,315
-[Jin-young] Walked in?
-[Nadine] Yes.

319
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,360
[Jin-young] Everyone seem so cool.

320
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,613
[Nadine hums in agreement]
You could see everyone from there?

321
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,491
[Jin-young] Yes, the way everyone
was dressed was impressive.

322
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,411
[Nadine laughs]
I made an effort to look pretty today.

323
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:58,499
[Jin-young] So, I was a bit intimidated.

324
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,042
[Nadine gasps] No!

325
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,004
You're so cool today.
The women were all saying you're cool.

326
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,717
We talked really briefly,

327
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,220
and he made good eye contact.

328
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,765
He's way more likable
than I thought at first.

329
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,811
I don't know.
I think he's adorable.

330
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,896
[upbeat music playing]

331
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,108
-He seems to have an adorable charm.
-[Hanhae] Yeah.

332
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,318
When someone's adorable to you,
it's over.

333
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,029
-[Jin-kyung] That's true.
-Don't the women look interested?

334
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,572
They're all focused on him.

335
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:35,577
Nadine had said that she usually doesn't
express herself or approach someone first.

336
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,830
And yet, did you see that last part?

337
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,916
Just now, Nadine was very actively…

338
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,585
Dong-woo keeps throwing
glances at her like this.

339
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,630
"Nadine keeps talking to him."
That's what his looks like.

340
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,508
Someone who can shake things up
has arrived.

341
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,510
I think he's a force to be reckoned.

342
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,846
-[Hanhae] He's a force.
-They are in trouble.

343
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,810
[Han-bin] Hello.

344
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,228
[Seo-eun] Hello.

345
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,771
Can you come up for a second?

346
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,652
I think Han-bin and Seo-eun left just now.

347
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,448
Seo-eun is amazing.

348
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,742
I'm not sure…

349
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,369
who I should go for.

350
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,580
I want to talk to the new guy.

351
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,042
At least once.

352
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,585
I'm curious.

353
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,547
I'm going to go.

354
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,759
-[Se-jeong] Go where?
-[laughs] I don't know.

355
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,926
[Se-jeong] Okay.

356
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:37,056
So rushed.
She's in a rush. She can't talk.

357
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,310
I've been wanting
to have a conversation with you.

358
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,145
But you've been so busy.

359
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,564
-Me?
-Yes, you're to popular.

360
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,191
No, I haven't been busy.

361
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,693
You haven't? Then I just lacked courage.

362
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,652
[Han-bin laughs]

363
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,404
But I wanted to talk to you.

364

[Seo-eun hums in response]

365
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,365
That would be nice.

366
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,201
Sit here so you can see the ocean.

367
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,535
[Seo-eun] Thank you.

368
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,705
How do you feel?

369
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,790
About what?

370
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,874
Just in general.

371
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,293
-In general?
-Well, like…

372
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,630
Putting aside the situation,
now, how are you feeling?

373
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,256
How am I feeling?

374
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,759
[Seo-eun hums]

375
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,221
A little bit more relaxed.

376
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,639
[Han-bin hums in response]

377
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,727
I could see that you're the busiest
here, trying to get us together

378
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,356
and all the effort you've put
in behind closed doors, so…

379
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,607
Oh, yeah?

380
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,901
-I'm glad I worked hard.
-Huh?

381
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,569
I'm glad I worked hard.

382
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,405
-You work so hard. It was really great.
-I'm glad.

383
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,826
So, I…

384
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,911
Almost since the beginning--

385
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,788
No, right from the very beginning,

386
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,414
I've been…

387
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,000
feeling this way.

[Seo-eun hums in response]

389
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,295
I felt this way since the beginning,

390
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,799
You were really good
at chopping up the onions.

391
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,268
You were great at chopping up the onions.

392
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,770
Ah, onions.

393
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,401
And I wanted to talk to you yesterday.

394
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,947
But I wasn't sure if you'd feel pressured.
I didn't wanna pressure you.

395
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,741
I thought maybe I could
come off as shallow.

396
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,328
I think that's why I didn't.

397
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,123
But, like, we don't know each other yet.

398
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,083
-And all the others too.
-Right.

399
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,085
So, don't feel pressured or anything.

400
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,088
-The same goes for me, too.
-Right.

401
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,925
It's not like I confess
my love to you or anything.

402

I'm just letting you know
that I wanted to talk to you the most.

How was the pork cutlet?

405

The pork cutlet?
I don't really like pork cutlets, so.

Next time there's something delicious…

I'll make sure to win
so we can eat together.

That's so…

without any pressure.

-But I didn't have a chance.

There wasn't any free time
or opportunity, so.

of the small amount
of time and talk a bit.

talking to you briefly

and things like that,

And when we talked,

434
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,400
you're good at giving compliments
that weren't meant to be a compliment.

Like you were good at noticing
the little details and asking about them.

that make people feel good.

Apparently, the way it sparkles is called
yunseul.

472
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,135
-Yunseul.
-Yes, such a pretty name.

473
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,470
-Yunseul.
-Yeah.

474
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,847
Yun Seul-ki.

475
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,516
Sorry. I'm sorry.

476
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,355
Oh, that's nice. Ah, Yun Seul-ki.

477
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,776
Yun Seul-ki. Yeah. Yeah.

478
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,738
-I like it.
-Yeah. Yun Seul-ki.

479
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,324
Because your Shin Seul-ki.

480
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,076
-That's yunseul?
-Yeah.

481
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,327
It's very pretty.

482
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,371
It's as if diamonds are sparkling.

483
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,455
Yeah.

484
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,166
This is really nice.

485
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,418
There's so much I want
to talk to you about.

486
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,673
[Se-jeong] Who's in there?

487
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,341
No one?

488
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,093
[Nadine] No one?

489
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,846
[Se-jeong] Wanna go look
at the ocean together?

490
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,139
Sounds good.

491
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,141
[upbeat music playing]

492
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,145
[Nadine] Ah, go ahead.

493
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,939
-[Se-jeong] Come with us.
-With you?

494
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,442
-[Jin-young] Wow, it's boiling
-[Nadine] It's hot.

495
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,653
[Jin-young]
My face is going to get tanned.

496
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,823
-[Nadine] Where?
-There are only two seats.

497
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,949
[Nadine] Go ahead.

498
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,496
I'll stay here by myself.
[chuckles]

499
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,999
Bye.

500
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,587
Why? Go with them?

501
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,674
Earlier, Nadine said that
she was interested…

502
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,217
-In Jin-young.
-In Jin-young.

503
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,762
But Se-jeong created the situation.
Maybe Se-jeong has feelings for him.

504
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,055
-Does she?
-I think she does.

505
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,183
Nadine is trying very hard right now.

506
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,475
But she gave up again.

507
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,019
-Right.
-[Jin-kyung] Right?

508
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,066
You've been here for two days now?
Three days?

509
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,110
Three days, including today.

510
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,195
How has it been?

511
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,906
You think there's someone here
who fits your ideal type?

512
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,908
-Here?
-At least one.

513
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,327
Not 100 percent…

514
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,205
but close?

515
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,333
What about you?

516
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,712
I think I'm going to have to talk
to more people.

517
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,551
But for now, I think there will be.

518
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,054
That's your guess?

519
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,055
Yeah.

520
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,433
But, like, first impressions
and how you feel

521
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,143
once you've talked to them…

522
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,103
-Right.
-they're very different.

523
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,190
-So far, it's interesting.
-Yeah.

524
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,735
[soulful music playing]

525
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:34,699
When you're dating a guy
or when you're looking at guys,

526
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,577
do you think you tend to be more free?

527
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,871
Free as in what, for example?

528
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,000
-You know, if he had drinks with…
-Yeah?

529
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,044
a female friend, for example.

530
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,421
So, like, are you cool
about things like that?

531
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,259
-Yeah.
-Huh?

532
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,096
It would be fine
as long as he still text me

533
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,931
or if he lets me know beforehand.

534
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:58,848
It's okay.

535
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,434
That's cool.

536
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,149
I can't keep my eyes open.

537
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,526
Do you want to move here?

538
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,278
I can't open my eyes.

539
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,239
-Am I sitting where I can't open my eyes?
-Yeah.

540
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,865
Because of the sun.

541
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,743
-I can't open my eyes.
-You can come over here.

542
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,621
No, I don't want to frown.

543
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,292
Why not? It's adorable.

544
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,794
Jin-young's laugh is quite charming.

545
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,966
[Yoong-jae] This is my bed,
but go ahead and sit down.

546
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,968
You can sit here.

547
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,264
-[all exclaiming]
-Really?

548
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,558
That was brave. Good for her.

549
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,813
-[Yoong-jae] How are you doing?
-In what respect?

550
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,024
So are you, like…

551
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:54,654
-curious about me.
-Am I curious about you?

552
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,655
Yeah.

553
00:26:56,656 --> 00:27:00,201
So, I mean, we did talk a little.

554
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,411
Yeah.

555
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:05,081
So, I was wondering
if you wanted to get to know me better.

556
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,084
[both hum in response]

557
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,546
You're right. I am curious about you.

558
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,842
[So-e laughs]

559
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,595
Ah, you're curious about me.

560
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,222
Since the first impressions,

561
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:25,143
I've had my focus entirely
on the same person.

562
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,312
-So…
-[Yoong-jae hums]

563
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,858
Ah, the same person since
the first impressions in the beginning?

564
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:32,859
Yeah.

565
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,944
Just one person?

566
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,073
Yeah. I wasn't like, "I'm confused."

567
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,409
Ever since we first sat down
in the beginning.

568
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,581
What about you?

569
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,042
-Me?
-Yeah, who've you been interested in?

570
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,044
I think it kept changing.

571
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,796
-Really?
-Yeah.

572
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,924
I'm kind of seeing it as…

573
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:00,303
a process of deciding on who I like
right up until the final decision.

574
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,431
Yeah, sounds nice.

575
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,558
Should talk to a lot more people.

576
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,435
-That's where I'm at.
-You haven't.

577
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,855
Yeah, that's true.

578
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,400
At first, there was all of the women.

579
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,610
But it did narrow down.

580
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,698
Anyway, that's me.

581
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,283
Yeah, that's good.

582
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,827
[Yoong-jae laughs]

583
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,454
-Good. Good?
-Good. Yeah, good.

584
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,372
Yeah.

585
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,000
Are you curious about me?

586
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,753
Of course I am.

587
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,463
I am curious about you.

588
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:41,177
But, you know, even if we do talk,
what we can talk about is limited.

589
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,597
So, I do feel like…

590
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:49,436
I want to have conversations with people
without the limits.

591
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,063
And you're one of them.

592
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,733
-Yeah. Okay.
-So-e…

593
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,068
[soulful music continues]

594
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,907
[So-e] Did you have fun?

595
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,909
[Jong-woo]
Yes, I'm coming back after a talk.

596
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,329
[Yoong-jae] Bye, So-e.

597
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,044
I talked to Seul-ki for a while.

598
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,922
[Yoong-jae] Oh?

599
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,800
[Yoong-jae exclaims]

600
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,302
[Jong-woo laughs] What?

601
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,095
What? It was kind of nice.

602
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,139
-Talking with her was nice.
-[Yoong-jae hums]

603
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,891
I think I like her even more.

604
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,934
I still want to talk to her.

605
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,270
-You like her even more?
-Yeah.

606
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,481
[Yoong-jae chuckles] Okay.

607
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,319
How was it when you talked to So-e?

608
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,406
She's a really good person.
She's okay.

609
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,241
Who suggested talking first?

610
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,411
-So-e.
-So-e suggested talking first?

611
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,372
Yoong-jae, you're becoming Mr. Popular.

612
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,791
[Yoong-jae] Me? No.

613
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,505
-[Jong-woo] You're back?
-Yes.

614
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,714
Had a nice conversation?

615
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,382
-Yes.
-Who did you talk with?

616
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,509
[Jin-young] Me?

617
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,762
It was Se-jeong, right?
I kinda saw you.

618
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,013
Yes, the girl crush.

619
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,640
[Jong-woo] Oh, the girl crush.

620
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,768
-You sum her up with one phrase.
-[Jong-woo] A girl crush.

621
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,478
But with an unexpected charm.

622
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,437
[Jong-woo] Oh.

623
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,439
That's amazing.

624
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,024
It was really nice.

625
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,029
It was only his first impression
that seemed cold.

626
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,990
I think he's kind of adorable.

627
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:29,702
He's different when you talk to him.

628
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,663
He seems like he's too cold.

629
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,873
-[Se-jeong] He said so himself.
-Yeah.

630
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,836
Once we talked,
he seemed a bit similar to me.

I think that's why we clicked.

634

That I'm cool and charming.

636

But well, he could just be saying things.

637

I think he's right, Se-jeong.

In pairs, right?

642

[all agree]

And you can't go with the person
you went with yesterday.

Yeah.

645
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,748
Doesn't that mean
we might all be going to Paradise?

646

You never know, though.

647
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,129
But it's not like
we'll be making risky choices.

648

-[Se-jeong] All things considered.
-Right?

649
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,260
So-e gained confidence after her talk.

650

-Yeah, with Yoong-jae, just now.
-[Jin-kyung] Yes.

is now here.

00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,351
-Right.
-Yes.

653
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,979
But only So-e's feelings are the same.

654
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:38,897
Right.

Everyone else is, "I wonder
what kind of person this man is."

656

But So-e isn't even interested.

657

Only Yoong-jae?

658
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:50,199
She said, "It's been the same person
ever since the very beginning."

659
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,869
I do think Yoong-jae and So-e will go.

660
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,166
Based on the probability,
he goes to Paradise with So-e

661
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,628
since he said he's curious about her,
and spend time with her there,

662
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,255
and comes to a conclusion about So-e.

663
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,674
I really hope they go, So-e and Yoong-jae.

The cast? Jong-woo, at least,
has his eyes on Seul-ki.

-[Kyuhyun] You don't think so?

Yoong-jae will go with So-e.

it's good 20 times again.

different than what I thought.

00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,576
-Ah…
-That could be right.

946
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,162
But Seo-eun left.

947
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,168
[Se-jeong] Excuse me.

948
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,962
-Yes. Yes.
-[Se-jeong] Can we come in?

949
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,800
[So-e] Hi, who is it?

950
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,344
[Jong-woo] Huh? What?

951
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,762
-[Se-jeong] Hi.
-[So-e] Hi.

952
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,223
[Jong-woo] I didn't expect
you two to be left.

953
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,766
Come on in.

954
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,768
[So-e] Why are you two left?

955
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,604
-Did you expect this?
-[So-e] No, I did it.

956
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:48,897
Why are you two left?

957
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,816
Yoong-jae must be surprised.

958
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,609
-He would have known.
-He must have known.

959
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:55,487
-But it's not Seo-eun.
-Because Seo-eun's not here.

960
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,364
-He's surprised.
-He's shocked.

961
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,075
-[Hanhae] He's shocked.
-His face is like, "She's gone."

962
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,828
-[Jin-kyung] He's having a meltdown.
-[Da-hee] Right.

963
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,704
Sit where you're comfortable.

964
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,622
Sit over here.

965
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:07,791
Wherever you want.

966
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:12,254
The three of us didn't go again.

967
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,673
[Se-jeong laughs] I know.

968
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,678
I wore this shirt. I should have…

969
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,221
worked harder.

970
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,265
Wear it again.

971
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,268
[Jong-woo] Should I?

972
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,688
I'm wondering if I'll ever get to go.

973
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,441
[sad music playing]

974
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:38,697
I packed my swimsuit.

975
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,199
I wanted to swim. This is disappointing.

976
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,661
Are you okay?

977
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,499
I just really wanted to go to Paradise.

978
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,752
I'm disappointed I didn't get to.

979
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:57,173
I think it's because
I have huge expectations.

980
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,426
[Jong-woo hums]

981
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,761
So, who went with who?

982
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:06,850
Can you guess? Because I can't,
judging by who's left.

983
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,935
-Yeah, I can.
-[Se-jeong] I can guess.

984
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,730
You can't go with the people
you've been there with.

985
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,231
It's just a guess.

986
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:14,983
Nadine…

987
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,819
-[Se-jeong] Dong-woo?
-Who? Dong-woo?

988
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,155
No, not Dong-woo. Jin-young.

989
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,740
Jin-young, the new guy.

990
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,325
-The new guy.
-Did he tell you?

991
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,869
No, but I felt something.

992
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,496
I think you would have gone with Nadine.

993
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,166
-[So-e] What about Seuk-ki?
-Seul-ki with Han-bin.

994
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,459
It has to be Han-bin.

995
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,545
Did Seul-ki and Han-bin
have any connection?

996
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,423
I saw them say hi earlier.

997
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,591
They just said hi.

998
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:43,470
No, I saw them say hi
as if there was some kind of telepathy.

999
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,181
No, that's the first I've heard of it.

1000
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,893
-My guess is different.
-[Se-jeong] Tell us, what do you think?

1001
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,311
[Yoong-jae] I think…

1002
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:55,398
It's Jin-young and Seul-ki,
Han-bin and Seo-eun.

1003
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,817
-That's what I thought.
-I thought so, too.

1004
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,402
-Really?
-[So-e] Dong-woo and Nadine.

1005
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,280
-[Yoong-jae] Ah, Dong-woo, Nadine.
-Am I oblivious?

1006
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,115
Your instincts…

1007
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,785
I feel like you have terrible instincts.

1008
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:10,538
Right. It's very hard to predict
other people's emotions.

1009
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:12,999
I thought you'd be going.

1010
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,085
-[So-e] Me, too.
-Me? Really?

1011
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,128
I said you're definitely going.

1012
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:22,008
Did you vote because you were certain
or did you have to think about it.

1013
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,179
Since when we first came here until now…

1014
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,683
I just went with what I wanted.

1015
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,979
I didn't base it on the other
person's feelings.

1016
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,690
So, even if they rejected me,

1017
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:40,068
if that's how I feel,
I'm going to go with it.

1018
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,278
[Jong-woo] You stay true to your feelings.

1019
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,826
Why're you all the way over there?

1020
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,120
-Come here and talk with us.
-Okay.

1021
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,790
-Having a hard time?
-For some reason, I keep curling up.

1022
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:59,170
So, did you think a lot when you chose?

1023
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,089
Yeah, I did.

1024
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,633
I thought about it a lot.

1025
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:09,014
Can I ask what factor
you think is the most important?

1026
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,310
Myself.

1027
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:18,356
I think you have to think of yourself,
first of all.

1028
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,566
[Se-jeong] The way you feel?

1029
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:24,154
I really don't like giving vague answers.

1030
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,323
I… I just…

1031
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,077
When it comes to choosing someone,

1032
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,079
-[Se-jeong hums]
-I choose…

1033
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,083
I have no idea what I'm saying.

1034
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:41,004
-[Jong-woo] Why are you so restless?
-I don't know.

1035
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,964
[sad music continues]

1036
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:49,054
It's Yoong-jae's first time, right?
Being rejected.

1037
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,848
Right, but I don't think I was rejected.

1038
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,517
It's just,
we weren't right for each other.

1039
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,728
-[Jong-woo] Not right for each other?
-Yeah.

1040
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,438
That's even sadder.

1041
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:03,068
If you're not right for each other,
then nothing you do will even matter.

1042
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,486
Were you feelings strong?

1043
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:07,238
-[Jong-woo] Huh?
-Were your feelings, like, huge?

1044
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,991
They weren't small.

1045
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,659
Were you really certain?

1046
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:17,791
It could have just been me
who is certain.

1047
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:22,045
By my standards, I think I'm trying
and I think I'm getting somewhere.

1048
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,006
But still…

1049
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,134
I think it's a bit slow.

1050
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,052
[Se-jeong hums]

1051
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:32,597
I feel like I don't know what other people
are thinking on the inside.

1052
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,975
I realized that by coming here.
I used to think that I did.

1053
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,520
How could you know?

1054
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,063
Right, how could you know?

1055
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,816
I think sincerity works.

1056
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,275
[Jong-woo hums in response]

1057
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,736
[sad music playing]

1058
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,579
Maybe we'll feel better once we eat.

1059
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,248
[Jong-woo] You think so?

1060
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,500
Do you think we'll even be able to cook?

1061
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,835
[Se-jeong] See you.

1062
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,587
-[So-e] See you later.
-Let's go. We have to get our things.

1063
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:11,511
Let's go, Yoong-jae, let's do this.
At least I'm not here alone.

1064
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,930
I would have cried if I was left alone.

1065
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,891
Thank you for staying with me.

1066
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,894
This is really hard.

1067
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,147
I think I'm having a mental breakdown.

1068
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,068
[upbeat music playing]

1069
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,408
[Se-jeong] So-e?

1070
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,161
[So-e] What if I cry later?

1071
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,121
-[Se-jeong] Huh?
-[So-e] If I cry later?

1072
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,498
I can't.
[So-e sniffles]

1073
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,292
[sad music playing]

1074
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,085
[So-e crying]

1075
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,221
[So-e] It honestly
doesn't matter if I'm rejected.

1076
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,724
The way people feel
can't be helped. But…

1077
00:57:58,516 --> 00:57:59,893
I'm so sad.

1078
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,187
[So-e sniffles]

1079
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:10,820
Seeing how I expressed my feelings
to Yoong-jae,

1080
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,573
and he didn't choose me.

1081
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:17,452
He could have purposely
made a different choice.

1082
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:20,163
Thinking of his relationship with Seo-eun,

1083
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,373
whom he went to Paradise was before.

1084
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:27,545
Or it could have been because
I didn't approach him more actively.

1085
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,923
There could be many reasons, but…

1086
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:32,300
it hurt my feelings.

1087
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,760
It hurt, but…

1088
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,513
people's hearts can't be helped.

1089
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,681
[sad music continues]

1090
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,570
She's been cheerful this whole time.

1091
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:57,450
These lingering feelings are so strong.

1092
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,411
So-e was talking
as if she was consoling Jong-woo,

1093
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:03,623
but actually she was talking to herself.

1094
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,416
All those things she said earlier,

1095
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,253
-[Hanhae] Right.
-Always smiling in front of the others

1096
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,798
and then bursting into tears
where there are no cameras.

1097
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:16,970
I think, for example, there are things

between men and women.

that stays true to who I am.

1250
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:37,887
So…

1251
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,599
I would never want you to feel pressured.

1252
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,728
I don't want that.

1253
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:49,106
[sad music continues]

1254
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:53,569
I see.

1255
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:55,029
Yeah.

1256
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,747
-I'm a bit flustered, but…
-Yeah.

1257
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:08,459
Thank you for telling me
I shouldn't feel pressured.

1258
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:15,716
I think it's really cool.

1259
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:23,724
-This is a very surprising situation, so--
-Really?

1260
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:26,227
-Yeah.
-Is this an unexpected situation?

1261
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,062
To be honest…

1262
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,564
I did think that

1263
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:34,068
maybe you chose me

1264
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,071
when we were talking earlier.

1265
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:40,991
So, I thought you would…

1266
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,245
be disappointed

1267
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:49,250
or angry at me.

1268
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,962
So, I was actually very cautious

1269
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,714
when we had dinner earlier.

1270
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,927
To be totally honest, I was upset.

1271
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,721
It did seem that way.

1272
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,975
I'm sorry. I'm not good at controlling
my facial expression.

1273
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:08,060
It's nothing for you to be sorry about.

1274
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:12,731
I just thought that perhaps
it could have been my fault.

1275
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:19,613
So, the way you approach me,
saying how we should talk,

1276
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:25,494
well, I think you really expressed
your feelings very well.

1277
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:29,039
So, I don't want to say…

1278
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:32,459
that I've changed my mind, but…

1279
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:37,214
I do feel like maybe I could
look at things differently.

1280
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:45,181
So, I'll let you know what I think
sooner rather than later.

1281
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,057
Okay. Thank you.

1282
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,351
I'll get back to you
without taking too long.

1283
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,062
Thanks.

1284
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,439
I thank you.

1285
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,913
[So-e] I've been revealing
to you how I felt

1286
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,831
and said everything there is to say.

1287
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,042
[Yoong-jae] I've thought a lot about this.

1288
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,293
[Seo-eun] I tried new things.

1289
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,670
Of course, I'm curious about other people.

1290
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:19,798
I'm not cut out for pretending
like everything's good.

1291
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,800
You never really know what lies ahead.

1292
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,011
You were really cool.

1293
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:25,429
Can I cross your boundaries?

1294
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:30,726
[dramatic music playing]

1295
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:35,105
[Jong-woo] I thought I knew
where things started to go wrong.

1296
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:38,817
[Dong-woo] I think this emotion
is maximized because I'm focused on it.

1297
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,694
[Jin-young] I wanted to take things slow.

1298
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,905
[Seul-ki] My heart hurts so bad.

1299
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:50,079
