SINGLE'S INFERNO

12
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,007
Last episode, during the second
Paradise date selection,

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,759
So-e, who chose Yoong-jae

14
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,178
and Yoong-jae, who's never chosen So-e,

15
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,180
were left in Inferno together.

16
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,973
It was so sad to watch.

17
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:00,226
So-e mustered up her courage and told him
how she felt one more time.

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,353
Do you remember the last expression
on So-e's face?

19
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,399
So I'll let you know what I think
sooner rather than later.

20
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,321
-Thanks.
-I thank you.

21
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,828
She was smiling, but then had
the sad look on her face in the end.

22
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,663
I couldn't get it out of my head all week.

23
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,706
Right, it's sad.

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,834
Yeah, she was smiling, but then
made this bitter face.

25
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:29,798
Their conversation felt very mature to me.

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,967
I thought So-e was just adorable.

27
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,429
But the way she expressed her feelings
toward Yoong-jae

28
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,681
so neatly,
without adding or hiding anything

29
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,975
made me feel So-e is
a strong-minded person.

30
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,894
-If it were you, Hanhae…
-Yes?

31
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:46,564
If a woman you don't have feelings for
spoke to you bravely like that,

32
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,067
would she suddenly
feel different to you or not?

33
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,861
That conversation really strengthened
her charm for me.

34
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,115
So I thought there could be
a chance there.

35
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,283
I think there's enough
possibility there too.

36
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,494
And Yoong-jae said
he'll give her an answer

37
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,872
as quickly as possible.

38
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,250
It's true that
Yoong-jae's decision is important,

39
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:09,212
but I don't think So-e will have
any regrets about her actions.

40
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,673
-I agree.
-Even if Yoong-jae rejects her.

41
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:16,553
Also now, well, there's them,
and then, there's Kim Jin-young.

42
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,096
-He's a funny person.
-Yes.

43
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,765
Only a few hours after arrival,
he went straight to Paradise.

44
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,933
Yes.

45
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,519
-Well…
-Yes?

46
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,521
Can you carry this for me?

47
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,314
-You want me to carry that?
-Yes.

48
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,441
-I'll carry it for you.
-Oh, no. I can carry it.

49
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,943
Okay, carry it.

50
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,114
You saw how he said he wouldn't
carry the bag

51
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,782
when she said she could do it, right?

52
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,409
-Yes.
-Very strong-minded.

53
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,745
-He's amazing.
-Who is this person?

54
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,373
He has a kind of unique charm
that isn't ordinary.

55
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,584
So I'm also curious about how he'll be

56
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,502
in front of Seul-ki in Paradise.

57
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,753
So I'm very curious.

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,173
Jin-young's kinda disheveled appearance
with neat Seul-ki…

59
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,260
-"Huh, what?"
-That's the right way to put it.

60
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,512
"Huh, what?" That's how
she suddenly liked him.

61
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,015
I'm very curious about
what will happen to him.

62
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:02,974
Very curious.

63
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,225
Let's hurry and watch.

64
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,438
PARADISE
JIN-YOUNG AND SEUL-KI

65
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,531
It's amazing, right?

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,742
-This is the door?
-Yes.

67
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,118
-Really?
-Yes.

68
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,749
-That's the front door?
-I know, right?

69
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,918
This is the room.

70
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,962
This is insane.

71
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,423
It's great, right?

72
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,926
This is the pool.

73
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,599
Wow. The pool is great.
It's really shocking.

74
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,686
Really? This is for real?

75
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,817
Wow.

76
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,695
And there's room service.

77
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,241
Yeah. Let's order room service first.

78
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,285
What should we eat?

79
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,714
Do you usually have trouble deciding?

80
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,882
No.

81
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,717
-Oh, you're letting me decide?
-Yes.

82
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,303
-I was waiting for you.
-I was waiting for you too.

83
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,763
Well then…

84
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,556
Hmm…

85
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,227
Do you prefer rice or noodles?

86
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,021
What do you like better?

87
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,690
-I like rice.
-Rice?

88
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,816
-Yes.
-Rice.

89
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,110
-We should order a rice dish.
-Yeah.

90
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,612
Do you want something to drink?

91
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,906
How is your alcohol tolerance?

92
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,574
Oh, I don't drink.

93
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,994
Uh, you don't drink?

94
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,578
-Well, then…
-But…

95
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,330
I won't drink either.

96
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,999
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

97
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,419
But won't you regret it?

98
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,795
Why would I?

99
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,131
It's okay for you to drink.

100
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,173
Yeah?

101
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,968
-Let's see what they have.
-Here.

102
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,137
Then I'll have a cold beer.

103
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,722
-Okay.
-Okay.

104
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,016
We should order now,
then wash up.

105
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,058
Okay.

106
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,561
Wow.

107
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:20,987
Oh, Jin-young.

108
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,322
He's so charming.

109
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,575
-He's adorable.
-He's adorable like that.

110
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,838
He's turning the lights
off and on again.

111
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,848
-He's going through everything.
-He's the first person to open drawers.

112
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,600
Why would he open the drawers?

113
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,102
I open the drawers sometimes
when I'm in a hotel.

114
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,105
Like, "Why are there so many drawers?"
as I'm opening them.

115
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,319
Let's go eat.

116
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,364
PARADISE
HAN-BIN AND SEO-EUN

117
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,658
What is this? It's very…

118
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,659
Wow!

119
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,412
-What is all this?
-Wait a second!

120
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,457
Wow, what is all this?

121
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,834
Wow, an amusement park.

122
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,752
Wait.

123
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,170
They have bumper cars.

124
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,923
Did they rent the whole place?
There's no one here.

125
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,508
That could be true.

126
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,551
Wow! All of this?

127
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,512
The whole place's
been rented out.

128
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,554
Right.

129
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,768
Never had an amusement park
all to myself.

130
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,062
It's so pretty.

131
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,356
-Everything's colorful.
-I know.

132
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,942
-That one first.
-Okay.

133
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,070
-Wow. We're going up!
-We're flying.

134
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,115
We're flying in the sky
a lot today.

135
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,407
Right.

136
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,577
Oh, wow, this is fast!

137
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,038
-It's kind of thrilling.
-It's faster than I thought.

138
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,332
It's going up high!

139
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,417
What if it goes
through the ceiling?

140
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,964
This is fun.

141
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,049
-This is fun.
-Yeah!

142
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,884
-This is fun.
-Even better together.

143
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,136
For me, too.

144
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,431
-What kind of ride is this?
-It's getting faster.

145
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,600
-What is this thing?
-It's getting faster.

146
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,436
-Amazing!
-Wait!

147
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,062
It's flipping.

148
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,522
I didn't expect this!

149
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,650
You're like a pineapple.

150
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,986
What do you mean, a pineapple?

151
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,032
Whoa! A merry-go-round!

152
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,659
Yeah, you're to take pictures here.

153
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,869
Right.

154
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,121
-Can we go on the merry-go-round?
-The merry-go-round?

155
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,289
Shall we?

156
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,748
Whoa!

157
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,250
Right, that's it.

158
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,503
Here. Thank you.

159
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,546
Let's go.

160
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,012
Wow.

161
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,098
Wow!

162
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,933
-This is nice.
-I feel like a kid.

163
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:56,934
Right.

164
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,354
Merry-go-round…

165
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,484
-This is nice.
-Yeah.

166
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,319
I feel relaxed all of a sudden.

167
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,237
Look at me.

168
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,407
As we're going up and down naturally.

169
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,284
-Yeah, Mr. Hair Stylist.
-Yes.

170
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,581
-They rented an amusement park!
-I know.

171
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,834
I something I never really
even imagined.

172
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,878
I know. They gave us a gift.

173
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,799
It's so romantic how they're
on the merry-go-round,

174
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,092
with no one else there.

175
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,969
-Right.
-Yeah.

176
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,765
Wow!

177
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,100
This is really all for us?

178
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,227
I know.

179
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,396
You think we get to eat all this?

180
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,815
Yeah. We should really eat a lot.

181
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,946
It's good.

182
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,198
Mmm.

183
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,700
It's good.

184
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,745
I think I can definitely get
your age right.

185
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,998
Is it two or three?

186
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,376
-Two.
-Two?

187
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,629
Twenty… two?

188
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,215
-Eight.
-Twenty-eight?

189
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,300
You're really young.

190
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,262
I'm 24.

191
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,351
What?

192
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,772
What?

193
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,066
Oh, he's 24?

194
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,193
-He's four years younger?
-Yeah.

195
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,071
But Han-bin kind of looks mature.

196
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,197
Yes.

197
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,076
This is amazing.

198
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,247
I thought you were around my age.

199
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,040
Twenty-seven, twenty-eight.

200
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,834
That's honestly what I thought.

201
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,796
I'm around your age.
It's only a four-year age gap.

202
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,465
-That's true.
-Yeah.

203
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,386
Will you tell me what your job is?

204
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,472
Painting.

205
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,978
A painter?

206
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,814
Yeah.

207
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,399
Art, yeah.

208
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,860
It suits you.

209
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,195
You kind of have a painter's eye.

210
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,158
That's right.
You drew your eyebrows very nicely.

211
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,118
Really.

212
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,454
You drew your eyebrows very nicely.

213
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,706
Did I prove my skills?

214
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,291
You really are a painter.

215
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,501
No wonder Yoong-jae said

216
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,713
-he was surprised again in the morning.
-Why?

217
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,341
It kept occuring to him that you're
a painter, so he was surprised,.

218
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,009
-After hearing what I do?
-Yeah.

219
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,554
No wonder he couldn't help
but be surprised.

220
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,890
You drew your eyebrows well.

221
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,224
Guess what I do?

222
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,727
It might be hard for you to guess.

223
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,979
-You'll never guess.
-You're a chef?

224
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,773
You guessed correctly.

225
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,947
Really? He's a chef?

226
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,616
That's why he was good at cooking.

227
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,701
-Really?
-No wonder.

228
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,663
I'm a chef.

229
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,458
At the Korea International Cooking Contest

230
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,627
organized by the Korean Cooks Federation,

231
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,380
I won the grand prize in 2018.

232
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,716
And the Director of Organization Award
in 2019.

233
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,720
I have certifications for Korean,
Western, and Chinese cuisines.

234
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,472
Also in food safety management

235
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,974
supervised by
the National Restaurant Association

236
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,351
in the United States.

237
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,019
Oh, he's talented.

238
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,562
Wow.

239
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,483
It's been about seven years
since I started cooking.

240
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,404
I think I feel attracted
to the cooking process.

241
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,116
I have pride in myself as a chef.

242
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,660
KIM HAN-BIN, 24, CHEF

243
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,911
That's cool.

244
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:45,996
Whoa!

245
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,540
And that's what I do.

246
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,834
This is worth clapping like a seal.

247
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:54,130
I kept telling you when we were cooking
and having dinner on our first day,

248
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,716
the way you were handling the knife
seemed extraordinary.

249
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,846
Anyway, you kept doing things amazingly.

250
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,015
You're really good at this.

251
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,437
But you kept denying it
and saying it was because you live alone.

252
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,106
I couldn't help but be sincere
about cooking.

253
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,274
I see.

254
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,114
What made you choose me earlier?

255
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,742
-There's something I wanted to tell you.
-Okay.

256
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,743
So…

257
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,455
At the end, after you and I talked,

258
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,583
and you said, "Don't feel pressured.
I'm not trying to."

259
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,251
When you said that, I actually felt…

260
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,379
So…

261
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,673
Almost since the beginning…

262
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,550
No. Right from the very beginning.

263
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,010
I've kept…

264
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,596
feeling this way.

265
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,055
Oh.

266
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,851
I'm just letting you know that
I wanted to talk to you the most.

267
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,315
This person really

268
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,443
must have felt things heavily.

269
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,739
I thought that you must have
really mustered up the courage

270
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,657
to tell me.

271
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,702
I felt that you seemed like
a very nice person.

272
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,289
But there weren't
a lot of opportunities to talk to you,

273
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,248
and… Yeah.

274
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:15,085
We… didn't have a chance
to talk to each other.

275
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,922
And on the second day, I was fine.
But I woke up this morning,

276
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,466
and I was really disappointed
all of a sudden.

277
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,595
The anxiety of, "Is it okay
for me to not do anything like this?"

278
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,307
It made me wanna hurry up
and talk to you. So…

279
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,311
Anyway, the fact that you made
the opportunity yourself was what…

280
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,230
I was…

281
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,066
I was surprised by and liked.

282
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,192
That's a relief.

283
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,661
I feel like after they revealed their age,

284
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,413
something's kind of…

285
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,625
Seo-eun is usually a good listener
and good talker in the first place,

286
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,337
but I keep having this suspicion
that something has happened here.

287
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,756
I agree, because it's true that
she's a Noona to him.

288
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,341
-Right.
-For some reason,

289
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,176
it feels like she became his Noona.

290
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,720
It feels as though, at some point,
her position changed

291
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,763
-just like that.
-Right.

292
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,139
Age is not important,

293
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,017
but it feels like, at some point,
for Seo-eun,

294
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,021
she felt as if
he's like a younger brother.

295
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,481
I agree.

296
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,235
-We're here.
-Wow!

297
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,449
This is delicious.

298
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,957
We're eating really fast right now.

299
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,876
It's weird.

300
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,421
I didn't enjoy the food
this much yesterday.

301
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,717
Maybe you weren't feeling well yesterday.

302
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,387
-Maybe.
-Yeah.

303
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,349
I thought I would never come here.

304
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,726
Why?

305
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,021
Because I'm not good at expressing myself.

306
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,649
Like, in situations like this,
and places like this.

307
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,402
Because the culture
and language are different?

308
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,361
Yeah.

309
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,198
So then, is it better
if you speak English?

310
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,451
Can you answer in English?

311
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,453
I could try my best to do so.

312
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,706
But I'm kind of scary
when I speak in English.

313
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,709
I heard I'm different when speaking
English and speaking Korean.

314
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,753
I'm even more curious
since you've said that.

315
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,795
Okay.

316
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,214
English only.

317
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:30,387
If you speak Korean, then you have
to take a drink or something.

318
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,139
-Okay.
-Okay?

319
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,349
Okay, so…

320
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,352
If you lose, you have to drink this, okay?

321
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,146
Oh, his English is good.

322
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,150
He seems much more attractive now
compared to when he was with Seul-ki.

323
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,486
If you lose, you have to drink this, okay?

324
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,862
Okay.

325
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,948
Wait, that?

326
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,159
It's just one shot.

327
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,912
Wait, how can I lose, then?

328
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,040
-If I speak what?
-So…

329
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,584
The only person
who can lose in this situation is you.

330
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,543
Yeah, it's me.

331
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,836
Okay, so…

332
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,506
-They're all for me.
-Wait, I didn't get that.

333
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,132
-They're all for you.
-So, actually--

334
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,051
I just realized this game doesn't work.

335
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,303
Yeah. So you don't need
to be worried about…

336
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,554
-Okay.
-…like, how much…

337
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,015
It's for myself.

338
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,350
For yourself?

339
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,311
They sound like they're
having an American-style conversation.

340
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,021
Because it's in English, right?

341
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,565
Wow, they go well with each other.

342
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,694
Do all doctors speak
good English like that?

343
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,447
Your English is pretty good, I would say.

344
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,033
-Your pronunciation--
-Your English is pretty good too.

345
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,284
Oh, thank you.

346
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,078
Thank you.

347
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,582
I hope it's good, given that
I've been there most of my life.

348
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:46,922
Let's toast to…
our very first night in Paradise.

349
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,257
Okay.

350
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,341
Cheers.

351
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,725
So, yeah.

352
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,476
Mmm…

353
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:03,105
What did you feel yesterday?

354
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,732
-Yesterday?
-Yeah.

355
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,485
You actually talked to me
before making a decision.

356
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,445
Yes.

357
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,031
Do you feel this way? Like…

358
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,284
You could have multiple people
you're curious about.

359
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:20,414
Actually, I want to get to
know one person, one at a time.

360
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,209
I don't know.
I'm just not interested in other people

361
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,253
while I'm, like, looking at one person.

362
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,136
For me, like, that was really
out of my comfort zone.

363
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,221
Like, I've never done that before.

364
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:41,810
Like, go up to
another guy or boy or whatever

365
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,146
and ask them, like, "Hey, can we talk?"

366
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,940
I've never done that.
And I know that sounds so stupid,

367
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,651
but I actually have never,
like, made the first move.

368
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,611
Ever.

369
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,698
And the reason why I felt like
I had to do that in that scenario,

370
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,200
like, in that situation was

371
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,204
because I felt like you were
making an effort to talk to me.

372
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,831
I don't know if you were.
Maybe you weren't.

373
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,418
And I just like…
You're just a nice person. I don't know.

374
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,506
I could really sympathize with you

375
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,051
because I can relate to you a little bit,

376
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:19,181
but not fully, because I actually
spent one year in the States.

377
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,224
Where?

378
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,225
In LA.

379
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,601
-In LA.
-When I was young.

380
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,644
So…

381
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,480
I know what it's like to be

382
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:30,818
like, a minority, in the sense
of language.

383
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,694
-Okay.
-So…

384
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,654
Yeah.

385
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:39,535
I'm glad you noticed that, because I was
having such a hard time adjusting.

386
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,121
In the beginning, I felt like…

387
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,580
I felt really insecure,

388
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,583
and I just thought
that I didn't belong there.

389
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:51,839
No, like, I actually care
about you in that sense.

390
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,176
I just remember you
talking to me and asking me questions

391
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,427
when I felt like…

392
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,306
when it was silent,
and I was just kind of sitting there.

393
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,892
To do that, like, I appreciated it.

394
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,646
Thank you.

395
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,943
I'm curious about your age.

396
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,069
Guess how old I am.

397
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,029
Twenty-seven?

398
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm 32.

399
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,993
T-Thirty-two?

400
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,744
Korean age.

401
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,373
Nine years.

402
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,879
I'm 22 internationally.

403
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,756
-So you're 23 in Korean age?
-Twenty-three.

404
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,341
Nine years…

405
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,763
Oh, my gosh.

406
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,435
-I should go back to speaking honorifics.
-No, just speak casually.

407
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,521
Language doesn't know
the difference between them.

408
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:50,731
We're all friends.

409
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,357
Okay.

410
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,863
But you really do seem younger.

411
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,949
You do. Sorry.

412
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,578
She said, "You really do seem younger."

413
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,038
She's adorable, too.

414
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,916
Did you feel any age difference
in their conversation?

415
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,960
-Right. It felt natural.
-Age is really…

416
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,214
Do you think it's a huge age difference?

417
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:19,218
No. Not huge, but it's a lot bigger
than I thought it would be.

418
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,637
Age isn't that important to me.

419
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,806
For me, jobs are important.

420
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,558
In what way?

421
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,977
Because of time.

422
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,607
Are you saying you don't like
people who don't have time and are busy?

423
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,568
No, I think I would respect them
if they are busy.

424
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,655
You think you would respect someone
who lives a busy life?

425
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,200
Yeah. Someone who has a lot
of passion for what they do.

426
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,369
I think that's attractive.

427
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,164
Wait. Let me take guess at your job.

428
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,670
I think you're a student.

429
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,214
Yeah, I'm a student.

430
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,590
A student? Oh, a student.

431
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,218
-So what do you study?
-I…

432
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,928
Pre-med.

433
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,441
I'm currently a
third-year student at Harvard University.

434
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,069
-Harvard?
-Harvard University?

435
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,404
Wow.

436
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,867
My current concentration
is Neuroscience,

437
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,453
and I have a secondary
in Computer Science.

438
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,041
After I graduate,
I hope to go to medical school

439
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,044
and I really want to pursue surgery.

440
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,844
I'm currently working at a lab
at Boston Children's Hospital.

441
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:49,057
I do research on temporal lobe epilepsy,
for around two years now.

442
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:57,357
LEE NADINE, 23, HARVARD UNIVERSITY
NEUROSCIENCE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJOR

443
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,942
Oh, she's so cool.

444
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,570
Not the frontal lobe,
but the temporal lobe.

445
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,698
Harvard?

446
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,700
Harvard? Oh, my God.

447
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,080
Really? That's interesting.

448
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,251
I'm… a doctor.

449
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,587
-What?
-I'm a doctor.

450
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,964
-Doctor?
-Yeah.

451
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,970
So, honestly, when you said "pre-med…"

452
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:27,929
Yeah.

453
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,474
…I was surprised.

454
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,769
But doctor… What kind of doctor?

455
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,730
Dermatology?

456
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,024
That was close.

457
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,275
-Plastic surgery?
-Yeah.

458
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,486
You're a plastic surgeon?

459
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,323
Wow. I want to specialize
in plastic surgery.

460
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,910
-He's a senior colleague.
-Right.

461
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,120
She met someone
in the same industry.

462
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:55,123
Wow. I want to specialize
in plastic surgery.

463
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:02,464
But why did you want to specialize
in plastic surgery

464
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,216
and not anything else?

465
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,383
First of all,

466
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,593
surgery and things like that

467
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,720
-were fun for me. A good fit.
-Yeah.

468
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,305
And basically, you decide on either

469
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,933
a department that does surgery
or one that doesn't.

470
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:13,892
Right.

471
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:15,602
Respect.

472
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,190
Because it's my dream.

473
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:25,153
I've dreamt of becoming a doctor
since I was six-years-old.

474
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,321
I see.

475
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,449
I had been really sick this one time.

476
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,994
And I was hospitalized for a long time,

477
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,289
and I think the doctors seemed
so cool to me then.

478
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,502
It's not that easy for a person to have
a dream for such a long time.

479
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,546
Right, and that's why…

480
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,550
-You have to do it.
-Yes, I really want to.

481
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,885
I really want to go to med school,
become a doctor.

482
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,220
I wanna do surgery.

483
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,557
You're going to be very busy.

484
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,810
I'm excited,
but obviously, it's hard.

485
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,063
This is like the last break
before things get busy.

486
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,231
Yeah, the last one.

487
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,191
-It must be.
-Yeah.

488
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,614
So then, if you meet someone here,

489
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,367
but then, you have to go back.

490
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:18,290
But I've always been flying
back and forth from Korea to the States.

491
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:23,795
Like, in vacation? Just
to meet with your family and your friends?

492
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,715
Yeah, almost every vacation.

493
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:35,432
Are you more of an emotional person
or a rational person?

494
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,186
I'm more rational now.

495
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,437
I wasn't.

496
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,439
Why did you turn that way?

497
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,734
Is there some kind of event or…

498
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,944
When I, in the past…

499
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,156
Like, when I used to date, I would be very

500
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,326
all-in when I dated.

501
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:58,747
And I think that was really bad for me.
I don't think that works with me.

502
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,665
Why do you think it's bad?

503
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,585
-Why?
-I just don't like it.

504
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:10,425
Is it because you just don't want
to make mistakes and get hurt?

505
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:15,138
That's exactly right.
Like actually, that's right.

506
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:20,435
-Yes, but I'm totally the opposite of you.
-You think…

507
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,394
What do you mean?

508
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,482
I'm rational

509
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,401
in most parts of my life,

510
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,780
but as for dating, love,

511
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,907
I always follow my heart.

512
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,910
Mmm.

513
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,412
And even if I get hurt…

514
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:46,878
Well, I would consider myself
a pretty spontaneous person.

515
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,755
-I like to take risks.
-Adventurous?

516
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:49,881
Adventurous, so--

517
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,009
But you would never come up
to a guy first.

518
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,970
Yes, that's hard for me.

519
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,471
Why is that?

520
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,640
I don't know.

521
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,141
I just haven't done it.

522
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,687
I haven't had the chance to.

523
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,064
And I guess when I had the chance to,

524
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,857
I did it, you know.

525
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,442
I took that step.

526
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,573
I hope you approach more guys.

527
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:16,533
I hope so, too.

528
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,034
No, not…

529
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,330
Not just for dating in this Inferno.

530
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,915
-Right.
-I just…

531
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,085
-Just like you just reached out to me.
-Okay.

532
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:28,962
I think it's…

533
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,340
It's better to reach out
to other guys, too, as well.

534
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,678
Interesting.

535
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,107
Looks like he's setting up boundaries
at this point.

536
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,276
This feels like a therapy session,

537
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,945
-not a date.
-Yeah, it feels that way.

538
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,197
When Dong-woo was with Seul-ki,

539
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,366
he was very restless.

540
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,744
And the conversation didn't go as smoothly

541
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,954
-as it went right now.
-Yes.

542
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,291
But you know the restlessness
of guys, that's almost suffocating?

543
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,668
The feeling you feel
when you like someone.

544
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,879
But as a viewer, it was uncomfortable,

545
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,923
-bumpy, and not smooth.
-Right.

546
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,467
That's what it was like then,

547
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,261
but now, it's like the conversation
is going so well,

548
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:22,474
but Dong-woo kind of feels like
he's feeling down.

549
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,643
-We know how he is when he's happy.
-Yes.

550
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,022
We know. We saw.

551
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:32,108
He appears so different right now,
it's like, "Huh?"

552
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,320
Maybe he doesn't like how they're
in the same industry.

553
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,030
That's what occurred to me.

554
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:40,950
Dong-woo expressed his feelings precisely,
and set up boundaries.

555
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,702
-Right.
-When he said that,

556
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,247
Nadine's face just suddenly became somber.

557
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,291
Yeah, she must have taken the hint.

558
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:52,420
But then again, Nadine was
interested in Jin-young besides Dong-woo.

559
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,464
-Right.
-So I don't think we know

560
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,673
how Nadine feels yet.

561
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,467
I think the conversations after Paradise

562
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,386
will be extremely important.

563
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,972
PARADISE
JIN-YOUNG AND SEUL-KI

564
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,474
This looks good.

565
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,268
This looks good.

566
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,311
I know.

567
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,070
Is there a bottle opener?

568
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,238
The bottle opener?

569
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,366
It's right here. Bottle opener.

570
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,123
What?

571
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,543
Right. He can't just open it.

572
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,961
That's how he does things.

573
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,547
I've never seen someone open
a bottle with a spoon.

574
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,857
Do you want me to do it for you?

575
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,275
No. But how do I do it?

576
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,361
-Can't you just put it here and eat?
-You're supposed to wear it.

577
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,487
-On my head?
-Yes.

578
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,115
What do you mean wear it on my head?

579
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,662
I don't really know these things.

580
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,621
Yes.

581
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,999
Please understand
if I'm not familiar with it.

582
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,918
I'll teach you.
I have more experience after all.

583
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,714
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

584
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,768
It's really cold, right?

585
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,810
It really is.

586
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,062
Do you feel better now?

587
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,610
Wow, you haven't laughed like this.
This is the first time.

588
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,695
This is nice.

589
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,364
I agree, but I… Never mind.

590
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,825
Why am I so awkward?

591
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,997
-She's certainly different.
-Seul-ki is

592
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,583
acting like how Dong-woo acted yesterday.

593
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,132
Do you like this sauce?

594
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,511
No, I'll eat it on my own.

595
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,470
Okay.

596
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,889
You're energetic.

597
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,016
I think…

598
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,894
You kind of make me energetic.

599
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,020
-Me?
-Yes.

600
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:19,108
I just thought… How should I put this?
Excessive kindness

601
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,653
could feel like too much pressure to some.

602
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,737
I see.

603
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,031
I could be doing something out of kindness

604
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,116
-but that might not be how you take it.
-Yeah.

605
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,661
Which is why I'm trying to do
things moderately.

606
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,998
Okay.

607
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,338
I forgot what I was going to say.

608
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,972
Why am I so nervous?

609
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,391
What?

610
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,642
It's like…

611
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,895
I can't seem to bring things up easily.

612
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,814
-To me?
-Yeah.

613
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,233
Is that a bad thing?

614
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,362
-I don't know.
-Mmm.

615
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,076
Hmm.

616
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,789
We're allowed to talk about
everything here, right?

617
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,624
-Right.
-How old are you?

618
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,211
-Me? Do you want to take a guess?
-Your age?

619
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,088
I think you'll be around my age.

620
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,674
Oh, that's how you saw me?

621
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,676
Why? What do you think?

622
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,303
Twenty-eight?

623
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,889
That's correct.

624
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,265
-Really?
-Yeah.

625
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,100
I'm 25.

626
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,435
You're 25?

627
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,769
Yeah.

628
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,816
So, should I call you Oppa?

629
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:44,694
No.

630
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,322
So then, just…

631
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,450
Yeah. "Hey" or "you."
Do whatever you want.

632
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,661
Okay.

633
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,079
Hey.

634
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,675
It kind of feels like
he's really not interested.

635
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,428
-But something's tingling.
-The mood is very odd here.

636
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,555
-Really odd.
-I don't get it.

637
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,019
So what is the meaning of this?

638
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,604
Um…

639
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,564
It's not an arm-warmer, right?

640
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:27,195
This holds the meaning of "Warrior".

641
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,363
I see.

642
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,198
That kind of tattoo.

643
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,159
What's your religion?

644
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,702
-Religion?
-Yes.

645
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,079
I don't have a religion.

646
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,372
-I see.
-Yes.

647
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,915
But angel?

648
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,375
Warrior.

649
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,876
Oh, warrior.

650
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,712
Oh. Warrior.

651
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,132
I used to be a soldier.

652
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,845
That really suits you.

653
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,683
I was in the UDT for four years.

654
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,394
-Really?
-Yes. I was discharged.

655
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,479
That's amazing.

656
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,607
Oh!

657
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,402
-That's an extremely tough place.
-Right.

658
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,071
I had the UDT tattooed on myself.

659
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,448
They're bullets.

660
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,325
The shapes are bullets.

661
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,120
So what do you do now?

662
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,914
I am a YouTuber.

663
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,124
Oh.

664
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:25,294
I was discharged from the UDT,
the Navy special forces team,

665
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,505
and I'm currently working
as a content creator.

666
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,466
I do a variety of content.

667
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:35,013
But since I'm confident
in things like tactics and shooting…

668
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,723
You need to go straight ahead.

669
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,766
I'm going to make use of my expertise

670
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,853
and make military content in the future.

671
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:45,440
KIM JIN-YOUNG, 28, CONTENT CREATOR

672
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,485
Is the UDT a very hard place?

673
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,571
Basically, there are
many special forces teams,

674
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,740
but among them,
you say you're from the UDT--

675
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,116
People respect you.

676
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,951
It's hard and requires a lot of patience.

677
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,246
Really? That's why when he was
in the tug-of-war contest earlier,

678
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,707
he just got there at once.
That's the reason why.

679
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,083
-Right.
-Right.

680
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,168
He's a manly man.

681
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,462
That was
a piece of cake for him.

682
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,339
What do you do?

683
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,968
I'm a university student.

684
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,137
-You are a university student?
-Yes.

685
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,389
What major?

686
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:19,974
A piano major

687
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,227
-at Seoul National University.
-Piano? Oh, really?

688
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,773
So what year are you in right now?

689
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,149
I'm a senior.

690
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,400
-You're a senior?
-Yes.

691
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,402
I'm in my first semester of senior year.

692
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,405
I didn't go to university,
so I don't know the system well.

693
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,116
That's understandable.

694
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,620
So, now we finally know who we are.

695
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:48,127
This is interesting.
I've never met someone from the UDT.

696
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,630
I've never met a pianist either.

697
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,970
-They're so different.
-Very.

698
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,098
The mood is odd.

699
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,560
Can I ask you

700
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,438
if you thought I was gonna come out?

701
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,898
Um…

702
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:09,982
No.

703
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:14,612
I hadn't expected it,
so I was very surprised.

704
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,240
I was also surprised.

705
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,951
But I really thought you wouldn't come.

706
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,579
-At lunch earlier…
-Yeah?

707
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,582
…we asked about each other's ideal types.

708
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,669
For me, it's someone who laughs easily.

709
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,966
I immediately thought,
"Oh, that's not me."

710
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,594
So I thought there was no way
you would come out.

711
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,764
But knowing you wouldn't come out

712
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,559
and choosing someone else
in fear of being rejected

713
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,686
seemed like the more
embarrassing thing to do.

714
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,854
So I went with how I felt.

715
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,772
I see.

716
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,653
My decision today, too…

717
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,740
I was thinking about if I should choose
someone who likes me

718
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:03,244
or someone who I like.

719
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,037
Wait a second.

720
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:10,168
Or if I should choose
someone I'm curious about.

721
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:16,424
But I just made my decision
based on what I wanted.

722
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,217
I kind of was thinking,

723
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,762
"Well, if it doesn't work out,
I can just have fun in Inferno"

724
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,723
when I made my choice.

725
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,601
And I was so surprised when you came out.

726
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,898
Me too.

727
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,568
I think we had the same thought.

728
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,619
You won the game.

729
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,331
You were really cool.

730
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:56,672
You don't really seem to express yourself,
the way I see it.

731
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,009
I don't think I like showing things.

732
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,803
Like showing my emotions.

733
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,140
When my feelings have been expressed,

734
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,685
I think I go so far
as to feel kind of embarrassed.

735
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,563
Kind of like you've been caught?

736
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,024
Yeah, that's right. That's accurately put.

737
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,153
It would be fun,

738
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,407
being here and becoming a bit emotional.

739
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,328
It would be nice
if there's someone like that.

740
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,465
How is it?

741
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,218
It's good.

742
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:46,222
You just expressed yourself, right?
That it's really good?

743
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,348
It's good, yeah.

744
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,059
I think we're starting
to get to know each other now.

745
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,356
-Right.
-Yeah. It's nice.

746
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,820
I think I'm the type of person
who needs time to get to know someone.

747
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:01,862
Mmm.

748
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,365
I'm a bit wary.

749
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,496
-But once I do, I'm good to people.
-Right.

750
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,956
And fun.

751
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,418
I'll wait for you.

752
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,426
I'll wait for you.

753
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,435
-I think you're a bit playful too.
-Very.

754
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,273
But you don't like it
when your boundaries are crossed.

755
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,691
-Me?
-Yes.

756
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:39,900
I'm okay with it.

757
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,572
So can I cross your boundary?

758
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,333
Look at him laugh! He's so cute!

759
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,918
-He fell for her.
-He's blushing!

760
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,171
-He's disarmed.
-He's adorable.

761
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,672
Jin-young laughed.

762
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,215
-He fell for her.
-Those two!

763
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,092
I want to make Jin-young laugh.

764
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,927
Why am I getting tingly?

765
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,471
-Why do I feel tingly?
-Right?

766
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,765
-It's like a line from a movie.
-She is so lovely.

767
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,101
-What Seul-ki said is amazing.
-Jin-young has this charm to him?

768
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,103
So can I cross your boundary?

769
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,989
I see.

770
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,083
Are you scared of the water?

771
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,001
-No.
-You're not?

772
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,169
No.

773
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,837
Oh, then let's go in the water.

774
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,423
-The water?
-Yeah.

775
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,092
Unless you don't want to.

776
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,845
Do you want to go in?

777
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,098
I can watch.

778
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,266
Watch?

779
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,936
I don't mind either way.

780
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,985
Wow, I mean, her speed
and Dong-woo's did not match,

781
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,321
but these two are moving like
pacemakers in a race.

782
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,572
-Right.
-Like this.

783
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,282
-Both are slow.
-Yeah.

784
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,035
-But seems like they get each other.
-She said she'll wait.

785
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,663
But the way she said,
"Can I cross your boundary?"

786
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,082
doesn't this express
exactly how she feels?

787
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,583
-Right.
-Very.

788
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,002
How would you feel
if the woman you're interested in

789
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,587
says, "Can I cross your boundary?"

790
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,589
I wouldn't be able to
pull myself together.

791
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,425
I'm a woman, too, and my heart is…

792
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,094
And then making Jin-young laugh is…

793
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,639
Right. So Seul-ki would've
always been this pretty,

794
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,016
men would've always tried to win her over.

795
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,934
Yeah.

796
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,978
So after always treated like that,

797
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,896
and then coming across
a man like Jin-young,

798
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,190
with whom she can't tell
what's going on inside,

799
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,026
and he's a bit brusque,
and won't carry her bag.

800
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,696
I think she could've thought,
"What's with this man?"

801
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,614
Like, he would have felt new to her.

802
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,784
It's obvious how
she's bursting with curiosity.

803
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,911
-She's very curious.
-Right. She's co curious.

804
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:59,874
As I was watching them, I kept being
reminded of the movie Titanic.

805
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,125
They kind of feel like

806
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,336
the disheveled Leonardo DiCaprio
and a princess.

807
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,382
But they're oddly attracted to each other.

808
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,009
And the feelings are bubbling

809
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,720
which makes Seul-ki seem
even more charming.

810
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,972
I feel as if I'm watching a woman

811
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,016
-who's falling in love, right?
-Right.

812
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,352
Seul-ki, and the way she's
acting so lovely…

813
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,729
This is so exciting.

814
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,316
PARADISE
HAN-BIN AND SEO-EUN

815
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,078
What are you up to?

816
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,873
I was just mindlessly…

817
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,249
You're drawing?

818
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,210
Wow, you're really good.

819
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,336
No, it's just…

820
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,254
Do you want me to draw you?

821
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,380
Yeah.

822
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,217
I should've asked you to draw me
while I had makeup on.

823
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,927
This is so embarrassing.

824
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,346
You're really good.

825
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,058
Okay.

826
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,074
You're really focused.

827
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,370
I drew so well, huh?

828
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,665
Wow.

829
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,252
This is the prettiest I can draw a human.

830
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,338
Thank you!

831
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,965
I should put face mask on you.

832
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,177
I'm putting it on. It's cold.

833
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,808
Wait. Trust me.

834
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,726
Wait.

835
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,437
Your face is so small.
The mask is too big.

836
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,359
It's cold!

837
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,694
Hang in there.

838
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:56,865
Like this.

839
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,002
Does it need fixing?

840
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,671
-Wait, I'll do it for you.
-I look like a panda.

841
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,298
-Here.
-This…

842
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,925
-Let me tell you what it is.
-A tear-shape.

843
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,385
You can't move.

844
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,138
-If you do--
-It keeps falling off since I'm laughing.

845
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,934
Tears!

846
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,103
INFERNO

847
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,272
Let's all
ask each other questions.

848
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,356
Okay.

849
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,318
I have questions for Yoong-jae, too.

850
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,861
-Me?
-Yeah.

851
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,323
You can ask me anything you want.

852
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,743
Have things changed
after what happened today?

853
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,755
I won't make the same choice as today.

854
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:54,882
What?

855
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,802
Because I don't think it'd be right.

856
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,056
I think I made the wrong choice.

857
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,265
Mmm.

858
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,852
That can happen.

859
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,150
You said you thought
about today's decision?

860
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,109
Yeah.

861
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,197
Is the person you're conflicted about
one of these two?

862
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,367
It is.

863
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,078
Oh.

864
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,749
I'm curious.

865
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,711
I wanna ask, too.

866
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:36,465
How many times has your choice changed
since the first decision?

867
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:37,925
It hasn't.

868
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,551
-It's the same?
-Yes.

869
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,595
-Really?
-It hasn't changed, not once?

870
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,805
No, it hasn't changed.

871
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,808
You're the type to only have eyes
for one person.

872
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,811
I'm just curious, so it hasn't changed.

873
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,691
So, after today, do you think
your choice will change?

874
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,653
Not yet. I don't think it will yet.

875
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,865
I want to get to know
the person I'm interested in.

876
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:06,286
Unless the person
really pushes me away, or rejects me.

877
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:07,871
Then…

878
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,084
What if, tomorrow, she comes back,

879
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,838
and you think
you expressed yourself fully,

880
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:20,634
but for the next selection,
you still aren't chosen?

881
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,219
What do you think you will do?

882
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,930
If I went to her and talked
but still wasn't chosen?

883
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,516
Yeah. Even after you
seriously talk to her.

884
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,685
-"Again"?
-Yes, again.

885
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,647
I wasn't chosen again?

886
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:36,817
I would cry.

887
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,864
In that situation, if I'm rejected again…

888
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,827
She's already gone with two.

889
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,663
-If she goes again, that would be three.
-Yeah.

890
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:50,581
Right?

891
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:55,377
Then I'm still a remaining card.

892
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,130
-So…
-So you'll still choose her?

893
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,590
Your eye's on her no matter what?

894
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,425
I think I will still try to talk to her

895
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,969
-until we go there.
-Yeah.

896
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,054
It'll just take a while.

897
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:12,394
She might not know how you feel,
the way you think she does.

898
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:17,024
Right. I'm not really good at this.

899
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,194
I'm rooting for you.

900
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,529
I'm rooting for you, too.

901
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,032
-Me too.
-Thank you for being honest with us.

902
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:25,991
Oh, really?

903
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,204
I think I'll keep going, for now.

904
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,039
That's a good mindset.

905
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,165
For now.

906
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:40,422
PARADISE
JIN-YOUNG AND SEUL-KI

907
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,725
It's been a while.

908
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,916
You're such a good swimmer.

909
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,628
You're having fun, huh?

910
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,047
I am, but it feels awkward.

911
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,554
You're really pretty right now.

912
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,931
What?

913
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,141
You look very pure, but your body's cool.

914
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:36,895
You're pretty.

915
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,654
Is it warm?

916
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,115
I'm not even joking,
it's like a hot spring.

917
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,283
Really?

918
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,410
Should I dip my feet in?

919
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,497
The water's fine. It's nice.

920
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,041
-Really?
-It's warm, yeah. It's really warm.

921
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,044
It would be disappointing if you don't.

922
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,087
Right?

923
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,341
Okay. I'll go get changed then.

924
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,637
Oh, wow.

925
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,556
-The power of love.
-Really?

926
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,099
Wow. Look at this.

927
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,435
Dong-woo, you shouldn't
watch this, really.

928
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,527
I feel so shy.

929
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,323
How should I do this?

930
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,546
It's really warm.

931
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,131
-It's warm, right?
-Yeah.

932
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,763
-Good choice.
-Right?

933
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,609
But really…

934
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:06,735
Yeah.

935
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,404
I didn't swim yesterday.

936
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,822
-Yesterday?
-Yeah.

937
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,574
Why didn't you yesterday?

938
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,369
The situation was a bit…

939
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,539
Well, you are today.

940
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,874
I know.

941
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,126
It's so funny.

942
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,714
Is that a mosquito bite?

943
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,966
Where?

944
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,510
Is it a bruise?

945
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,261
-This?
-Yes.

946
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,888
It's a Mongolian spot

947
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,181
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

948
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,683
How did you see it?

949
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,310
I spot things like that really well.

950
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,897
I mean, kind of.

951
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,904
Do you feel relaxed now?

952
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:53,407
Yeah, I feel tired and nice.

953
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,663
So among the women…

954
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,333
Today was the men's game.

955
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,294
And yesterday…

956
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,887
Oh!

957
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,100
And yesterday…

958
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,906
What kind of game do you think we'll play

959
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,117
if it's men and women together?

960
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,453
Together?

961
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,138
Why are you trembling?

962
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,150
I think we might do something like that.

963
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,152
What?

964
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,658
I have no idea what I'm talking about.

965
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,035
You talk.

966
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,536
I kind of…

967
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,955
I'm just saying.

968
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,515
I kind of am curious.

969
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:42,516
What?

970
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,227
Your ideal type, appearance-wise.

971
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,145
-Do you have one?
-You.

972
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,232
-Really?
-Yeah.

973
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,985
Cute and sexy.

974
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:03,245
That's why I asked you
to have lunch with me today.

975
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,003
Oh, did we start talking casually?

976
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,131
That's right.

977
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,300
Right. We started talking casually
at some point.

978
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,718
Maybe because we're comfortable?

979
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:19,845
I know.

980
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,230
It didn't get on your face at all, did it?

981
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,407
I think
we can call it a night.

982
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,542
You had fun, right?

983
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,504
I appreciate you coming in.

984
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,929
Wait just a moment.

985
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,688
Come up, just like that.

986
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,358
Over here, like this?

987
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:19,905
Thanks.

988
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,345
I mean, who is that person?

989
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,680
-Who is that?
-Wow.

990
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,390
This is like a movie.

991
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,351
He has this thing that drives women crazy.

992
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,685
Really. He does.

993
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,687
-Those eyes…
-They could melt a person.

994
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,189
I think I could get lost in them.

995
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,024
The way they held hands was so natural.

996
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,735
And if his hand was like this,
it could've been too much.

997
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,529
-Right, he did it like this.
-He came and wrapped around hers.

998
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:04,282
He didn't even tell her to come in.

999
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:07,077
-He naturally made her come in.
-She got changed on her own.

1000
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,745
There's something bewitching about him.

1001
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:12,624
It feels as if Seul-ki is like,
"Should I do this? Is this okay?"

1002
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:16,419
And she's just kind of being led by him.

1003
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,380
So, in a way, the mindset Seul-ki had

1004
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,966
has kind of crumbled
because of Jin-young's charms.

1005
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:24,260
Yeah, it feels like
there really are sparks

1006
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:28,181
flying between Seul-ki and Jin-young.

1007
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,140
Exactly.

1008
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:32,602
Wasn't Seul-ki different from
how she was on her date with Dong-woo?

1009
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,770
Obviously.

1010
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:38,066
So what kind of man
is this man named Kim Jin-young?

1011
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,736
We don't even know.
Which is why he's attractive.

1012
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,863
-So mysterious.
-Yeah, he's mysterious.

1013
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:55,602
PARADISE
JIN-YOUNG AND SEUL-KI

1014
00:55:58,354 --> 00:55:59,481
Oppa.

1015
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,733
-Can I come in for a second?
-Sure.

1016
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,693
-You can come in.
-Okay.

1017
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,528
What's up?

1018
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,572
Do you know know how to style hair?

1019
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:10,075
-I'm not really good at it.
-Really?

1020
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,034
No.

1021
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,328
-Want me to try?
-Yes.

1022
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,205
This is my first time
doing a woman's hair.

1023
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,456
-Really?
-Yeah.

1024
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,754
-Do it like this, right?
-Yeah.

1025
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,591
-Press down here?
-Yeah.

1026
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,012
I should press this down a bit more here.

1027
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,348
Right here.

1028
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,167
Are you sure it's okay?

1029
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,211
-It is.
-Really?

1030
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,170
Yeah.

1031
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,549
Just this part.

1032
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,050
-Okay.
-This is…

1033
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:12,178
-It needs more volume?
-Yeah.

1034
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,778
No, wait.

1035
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,029
No. Sit down.

1036
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,614
What are you doing?

1037
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:32,574
This is…

1038
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,993
-Sit down.
-Oh, no!

1039
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,327
Do you have hairspray?

1040
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,330
Wait. Sit down. Let me fix it.

1041
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,958
-It's weird, right?
-No, it's not weird. Wait.

1042
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,835
If I do this one thing, it'll be perfect.

1043
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,671
No, wait. No!

1044
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,214
What are you doing?

1045
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,216
Are you always like this?

1046
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,010
-Seul-ki really likes him.
-Yes.

1047
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:55,597
Because in a situation like that,
no matter who it is,

1048
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,558
-"What did you do?" This would come out.
-Right.

1049
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,435
Yes, because she likes anything he does.

1050
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,436
Right.

1051
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,188
Let's hang in there.

1052
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,148
-We got this.
-We got this.

1053
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:07,233
-I really have to hang in there today.
-Right.

1054
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,235
I think today is gonna be tough.

1055
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:14,365
It was like that for me yesterday.

1056
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,283
Really?

1057
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:16,993
Jong-woo.

1058
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,078
-That's sad.
-Jong-woo.

1059
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,914
When I came back with my bag…

1060
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,790
That feeling is really…

1061
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,417
I know that feeling.

1062
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,253
-Doesn't the bag feel heavier?
-Right.

1063
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,588
My bag was really heavy.

1064
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,424
-It was like that for me yesterday, too.
-Right. That feeling.

1065
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,383
Yeah.

1066
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,013
-It's okay.
-It's so…

1067
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,474
It's okay. If things work out
after being sad,

1068
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,684
it'll feel way better.

1069
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:42,727
Right.

1070
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,396
What if things work out for Jong-woo,

1071
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,981
and he cries over there?

1072
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:51,110
"I can finally leave!"
Like this.

1073
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,196
I think he will.

1074
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:56,032
I might actually do that.

1075
00:58:56,658 --> 00:59:00,328
But don't cry in front of the fire.
It would feel really like hell.

1076
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,456
Like fiery hell.

1077
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,416
I don't think I'll be able
to control myself.

1078
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,335
-I think it'd be nice.
-Right.

1079
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,967
I'm curious how things will be
once they're back.

1080
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:14,926
Right, right.

1081
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,803
I'm also curious who she went with.

1082
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:17,845
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1083
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:20,598
-They'll be coming in together.
-Run to her and carry her bag.

1084
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,017
But if the guy she went with
is carrying it,

1085
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,227
do I take it from him?

1086
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,895
-Take it.
-Take it?

1087
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,981
No, don't do too much.

1088
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:32,777
-There's still lot of time.
-Right. There's still lots of time.

1089
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,697
Aw.

1090
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:39,659
But Seul-ki is so into
Jin-young right now.

1091
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,414
-We're back!
-We're back!

1092
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,915
Be careful.

1093
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,417
Yeah, be careful.

1094
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,377
You be careful, Seo-eun.

1095
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,214
Are we too far away?

1096
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,718
-It's fine.
-It's fine. We have our own pace.

1097
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,596
Right. Go slowly, go however you wanna go.

1098
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,098
We have our own speed.

1099
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,810
Do you hear them?

1100
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,645
Do you hear them coming?

1101
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,523
Shall we go out?

1102
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,735
We're back.

1103
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,111
We're back!

1104
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,114
Oh, my gosh.

1105
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,165
These two are coming back late.

1106
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,127
Did you have fun?

1107
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,129
-Yes, we're back.
-Hi.

1108
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,964
Hello. Welcome back!

1109
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,676
Did you get some good rest?

1110
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:40,970
We did, yes.

1111
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,141
-Hi.
-Hello.

1112
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:46,267
Did you have fun?

1113
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,977
-Yes.
-Yes.

1114
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,937
Did you coordinate outfits?

1115
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,981
No, he copied mine.

1116
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:55,401
-He copied yours?
-No, she did the copying.

1117
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,488
You're back.

1118
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,530
I'm back.

1119
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,368
Shall we head inside and find out?

1120
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,953
About how it was?

1121
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,331
Do you wanna hear about it?

1122
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,918
How were everyone's dates?

1123
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,837
We had lots of fun.

1124
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,048
I think it would have been loud.

1125
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,550
We were just talking about anything.

1126
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,053
But it was very funny.

1127
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,639
It was funny, and we had
deeper conversations, too.

1128
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,475
I actually was surprised.

1129
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,895
-We went to an amusement park.
-Really?

1130
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,355
-There's one there?
-Yes.

1131
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:33,356
Really?

1132
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,817
There was this one ride
that went up like this,

1133
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,318
-then suddenly, it flips.
-Really?

1134
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,778
And it turns like this.

1135
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,655
But then there's this thing,

1136
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,949
like this.

1137
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:46,119
I can't do that. I have to hold on.

1138
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:51,499
I think Dong-woo
might've done something active.

1139
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,209
What did you do?

1140
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,753
I think I know
what that smile means.

1141
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:58,423
It's something about
Nadine's personal information.

1142
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,092
-It's pretty amazing, honestly.
-Seems like she'd be.

1143
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,427
It's really…

1144
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,636
It's that great?

1145
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,556
She's really amazing.

1146
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,059
-This is making me really curious.
-She's amazing, truly.

1147
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,061
I think she's great.

1148
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:14,480
How was it, Nadine?

1149
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,606
-Did you have fun?
-I did.

1150
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,859
-Did you talk in English?
-Yeah.

1151
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:20,737
-Wow, that's cool.
-We talked in English.

1152
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,322
Since we used English,
I just said everything.

1153
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:26,617
-That's nice.
-That must've relieved some frustration.

1154
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,327
Yeah. He understood everything.

1155
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,372
-That's a plus.
-Kind of.

1156
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,458
-Confidence.
-Confidence?

1157
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,085
-Confidence.
-He had a lot of confidence.

1158
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,837
I think he has a lot confidence.

1159
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:42,175
Anyway, so you had a good time.
And Seul-ki?

1160
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:45,261
-Right.
-Look at Seul-ki's face.

1161
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:46,471
-No, please.
-I love watching

1162
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,097
-people's expressions.
-Really?

1163
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,891
Did you swim yesterday?

1164
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:51,184
Yes.

1165
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,980
There were a lot of unexpected things?

1166
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:59,776
Yeah, there were things that were
different from his first impression.

1167
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,819
How was it when you heard what he does?

1168
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:06,282
I wasn't, like, really surprised,
but it was still unexpected.

1169
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,369
His age?

1170
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,206
His age was what I expected.

1171
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,334
You must have had a good hunch.

1172
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:17,293
Yeah.

1173
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:21,005
Jin-young was very unexpected for me.

1174
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:24,091
The person you were with
wasn't the person I thought it'd be.

1175
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,761
-Me too.
-I didn't see things right.

1176
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:31,307
Did you have fun?

1177
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:35,019
Yes, it was my first time there,

1178
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,021
so it was interesting.

1179
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:38,356
Did you talk a lot?

1180
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,275
Talk?

1181
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,155
I think I talked a lot more
than when I'm here.

1182
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,951
How is it, now that you know
her personal information?

1183
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,370
Personal information?
I don't think anything changed

1184
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:55,832
because I know her personal information.

1185
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,251
Anything that became a plus
or something like that?

1186
01:03:58,334 --> 01:03:59,710
No. there was nothing like that.

1187
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,255
-You're just getting to know her?
-Yes.

1188
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,006
It was your first day anyway.

1189
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:08,845
But even if it is the first day,
you talk a lot when you go to Paradise.

1190
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,180
-True.
-Right, we did talk a lot.

1191
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,809
-Everyone's curious right now.
-Yes. So curious.

1192
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:18,104
-Dong-woo and Jong-woo.
-I thought it was a hearing or something.

1193
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,193
The hottest inferno in the world,
Single's Inferno.

1194
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,572
Today, you will be going on dates,
freely, in Inferno.

1195
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,743
Take some time today
with the person you want

1196
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,245
and get to know each other.

1197
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,045
-You're going to talk to Seo-eun, right?
-Yes.

1198
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,255
-Yoong-jae.
-Yoong-jae.

1199
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:45,423
What?

1200
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:47,383
-He's running.
-What?

1201
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:51,596
-You're going to talk to Seo-eun, right?
-Yes.

1202
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,223
-Let me know when you're done.
-Will do.

1203
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,604
Yoong-jae?

1204
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,480
That was cool.

1205
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,440
He flew away.

1206
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,779
It must be Seo-eun, right?

1207
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,740
Oh, wait.

1208
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:12,533
So-e will be there, though.

1209
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,249
Can I come inside
for a second?

1210
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,208
Huh?

1211
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:22,835
He's here already.

1212
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,719
Wow.

1213
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,182
Seo-eun, do you have time?

1214
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:40,102
Yes, I think I do have time.

1215
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,772
Yes, I think I do have time.

1216
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:46,108
-Want to step out for a sec?
-No, I don't have time.

1217
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:48,653
Seul-ki, do you have time?

1218
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:50,237
-Yes.
-Nope.

1219
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:52,490
-No.
-I don't have time.

1220
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:53,449
No.

1221
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,543
Did someone spray cologne?

1222
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:07,296
I think I did.

1223
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,673
-Did you?
-Yes.

1224
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,342
I thought it smelled familiar.
