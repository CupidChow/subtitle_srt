00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,727
and then I stepped outside.

321
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,021
I came outside for that reason.

322
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,775
And I thought,
"If, by any chance, Seo-eun comes outside…

323
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,485
Yeah?

324
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,070
…I have to start a conversation with her."

325
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,822
-Really?
-"I have to talk to her about something."

326
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,491
That's was what I was thinking.

327
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:58,040
But then you just happened
to be there, so… it felt very…

328
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,792
How should I put this?

329
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,044
-I felt encouraged.
-Yeah?

330
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,837
When I think about it,

331
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,465
the way I remember it
is that I started the conversation.

332
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,676
Really? I remember it
as me who started it.

333
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,928
-No?
-We're both saying we started it?

334
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,179
-Yeah?
-[Seo-eun] Yeah.

335
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,806
[mellow music playing]

336
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:21,772
Either way.

337
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,399
[Seo-eun] Mmm.

338
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,321
But be honest, you planned the blue.
Yes? No? [laughs]

339
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,073
That's what I was thinking. Blue.

340
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,827
-Blue--
-I mean, even if it wasn't planned…

341
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,829
-Right.
-…it was still a good choice.

342
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,831
[pleasant music playing]

343
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,212
-They connected.
-[Da-hee] Really.

344
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:49,133
-Yoong-jae was already interested.
-He had feelings.

345
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,468
But what's attractive about Yoong-jae

346
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,680
is I thought he was really just
going to be calm and a bit introverted.

347
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,890
But when he's talking about his feelings,

348
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,852
he just speaks honestly
without any reserve.

349
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,022
It's nice because he's honest,

350
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,275
yet he still talks
in a slightly bashful way.

351
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,069
Yes, he's shy
but he doesn't try to hide anything.

352
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,654
He's just straightforward.

353
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,072
That's charming.

354
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,702
[Seo-eun] Oh. Did we decide
to speak casually today too?

355
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,621
-Casually?
-Yes.

356
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,499
-Yes. Yeah.
-Okay. Should we speak casually?

357
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,710
It's best to do that
before we reveal our age.

358
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,711
I think that too.

359
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,087
-[Yoong-jae] Right?
-Good.

360
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,798
How old are you?

361
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,552
-Should we guess?
-Yes. Let's guess.

362
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,470
Oh, age.

363
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,056
What if they're four years apart?

364
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,892
Should we say it on a count of three?

365
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,186
-[Yoong-jae] Okay.
-One, two, three.

366
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,854
-Twenty-seven
-[Yoong-jae] Twenty-eight.

367
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,981
-Am I right?
-Yeah.

368
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,483
[Yoong-jae] You're wrong. [laughs]

369
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,359
[quirky music playing]

370
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,820
-Mmm.
-[Seo-eun exclaims]

371
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,114
-Wait, 29?
-No.

372
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,240
-Thirty-one?
-Thirty-two.

373
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,367
-[Seo-eun] Really?
-Yeah.

374
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,619
[Seo-eun] Wait.

375
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,413
-They're four years apart.
-What's the age difference?

376
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,457
[Kyuhyun] She was born
in 1995 and he was born in 1991.

377
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,374
What?

378
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,587
-Why did you think I was so young?
-No, you look very young.

379
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,506
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

380
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,966
What do you think my job is?

381
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,345
-Should we give each other hints?
-Okay.

382
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,055
It's in this room.

383
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,059
-[Yoong-jae] Lighting?
-No.

384
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,774
Hmm?

385
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,693
-[Yoong-jae] Art?
-Yes.

386
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,946
You paint?

387
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,950
[upbeat music playing]

388
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,164
[Seo-eun] I graduated
from Pratt Institute in New York

389
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,416
as a Fine Arts major
with a focus in painting.

390
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,253
Currently in Korea,
I'm working as an artist.

391
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,964
That's so cool.

392
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,174
She's an artist?

393
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,387
[Seo-eun] Mostly I paint abstracts.

394
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:04,768
I like to paint simple and neat paintings
that get people to imagine lots of things.

395
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,564
CHOI SEO-EUN, AGE 28, ARTIST

[guests exclaim]

397
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,527
-This is kind of unexpected.
-It is.

398
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,905
-It's a job I didn't even think of.
-People who do art are so cool.

399
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,243
-That's so cool. Super cool.
-[chuckles] No.

400
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,330
-Okay, if you can give me one hint then.
-Okay.

401
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,373
Tell me.

402
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,584
I wear suits a lot.

403
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,461
-Suits?
-Yeah, so--

404
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,173
Hang on, so a stock brokerage firm?

405
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,091
-That's correct.
-[gasps]

406
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,552
-Wait, I'm really good at guessing, right?
-Yeah.

407
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,012
[upbeat music playing]

408
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,600
[Yoong-jae] I currently work
at a stock brokerage firm in Yeouido.

409
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,811
-Yeouido?
-[Hanhae] Yeouido.

410
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,565
Wait, a guy this good-looking works
at a stock brokerage firm in Yeouido?

411
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,776
[Yoong-jae] I graduated
from Hanyang University

412
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,528
with a major in Business Finance.

413
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,448
And got hired through open recruitment
at a stock brokerage firm.

414
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,118
I'm responsible for analyzing assets

415
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,621
and creating
specialized private equity funds

416
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,832
or SPCL investments
that institutions can invest in.

417

JO YOONG-JAE, AGE 32

-[Hanhae] It suits him.
-[Jin-kyung] It suits him so well.

419
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,798
Wow, this is so fun.

420
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,468
-We're the only ones who know this.
-I know.

421
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,929
I was right with the stock brokerage firm.

422
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,430
Phew. [laughs]

423
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,265
[laughs]

424
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,726
We haven't really eaten.

425
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,021
Eat. I think I talked too much.

426
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,607
No, I had so much fun too.

427
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,860
To be honest, I feel full
even though I didn't eat.

428
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,612
-[Yoong-jae] Right?
-Yeah.

429
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,240
It's not, "I have to eat."

430
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,867
-It's, "I'm fine either way."
-Yeah.

431
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,203
-It's nice if we eat, but if not--
-We can eat now.

432
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,746
[mellow music playing]

433
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,166
-This is fun.
-Really fun.

434
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,417
[both] Yeah.

435
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,964
[Yoong-jae] You learn a lot.

436
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,715
[Seo-eun] I learned a whole lot.

437
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,467
[exhales heavily]

438
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,929
There's not a single negative thing
popping up during this date.

439
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:04,972
There's nothing.

440
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,808
-They just look so good together.
-They look so good together.

441
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,811
And Yoong-jae was drinking
easily without even noticing.

442
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,897
They definitely have
a good alcohol compatibility.

[mellow music playing]

446
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,445
This looks really good.

447
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,073
[Dong-woo] All of a sudden,
all this well-prepared food.

448
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,075
[Seul-ki] Yeah. It's a real feast.

449
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,286
Enjoy the food.

450
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,956
-Okay, you want the salad first, right?
-Thanks.

451
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,001
[Dong-woo] Let me cut it up for you.

452
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:39,881
[Seul-ki gasps]

453
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,845
-This is really good.
-Yeah, this is really good.

454
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,391
[Seul-ki] I think this is the most
delicious thing I've had this year.

455
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,476
[both] It's nice to be here with you.

456
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,436
[Seul-ki] Cheers.

457
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:01,945
-Seul-ki, do you tend to eat a lot?
-I really like Korean food.

458
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,697
All Korean food.

459
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,701
What should we call each other?

460
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,078
-What about you?
-Mr. Dong-woo?

461
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,455
-"Mr. Dong-woo"?
-Sir Dong-woo?

462
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,165
What about you, Sir Dong-woo?

463
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,042
I think I like meat the best.

464
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,003
What do you usually eat?

465
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,087
[chuckles]

466
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,673
-What I eat?
-[chuckles]

467
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,008
I'm just curious.

468
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,886
I, uh…

469
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,347
You live with parents?

470
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,223
Yeah, I live with my parents.

471
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:35,228
But because of my studies,
I live near my campus right now.

472
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,147
-Mmm.
-[Seul-ki laughs]

473
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:41,234
-We're talking about this already?
-Then guess this.

474
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,237
Try and guess

00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,947
-[Seul-ki] Yeah, it's nice.
-It's so cool.

635
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,492
What do you think will happen from now on?

636
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,412
It's not like we'll always end up
coming to Paradise together.

637
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,748
We might not.

638
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,792
What do you think
will happen with your feelings?

639
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,045
-I don't know.
-[laughing]

640
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,632
It's a secret. I can't tell you.

641
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,759
I'm sorry,
but are you at a congressional hearing?

642
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,219
You keep saying you don't know anything.

643
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,222
I don't know. I just don't know.

644
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,935
I think he's getting disappointed
that she keeps saying that.

645
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,437
-She does seem a bit passive.
-Yeah.

646
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,607
Because earlier she said
she tends to actively express herself

647
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,984
to the person she likes.

648
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,070
-Now, she keeps saying she doesn't know.
-Right.

649
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,406
But then, Seul-ki did say earlier

650
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,950
that she's the type of person
who needs time.

651
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,121
This might be part of the process
of her getting to know him. Her process.

652
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,874
I don't know. I just don't know.

653
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,169
Why are you so cute all of a sudden?

654
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,882
Your cuteness was 50
and I think it's about 100 now.

655
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,676
Really? I'm not really the cute type.

656
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,971
-But…
-Yeah?

657
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,180
Mmm.

658
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,393
-I don't know. I really like you.
-Hmm.

659
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,604
And I want to treat you nice.

660
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,440
Thanks.

661
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,942
[mellow music playing]

662
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,613
[Dong-woo sighs]

663
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,451
I hope I come here with you again.

664
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,584
You're not going to say,
"I don't know," are you?

665
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,211
[exhales sharply, clears throat]

666
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,969
What was the biggest age gap
out of all people you've dated?

667
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,931
I've only been…

668
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,352
in a relationship once.

669
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,145
Oh.

670
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,859
Is it hard for you to open up to people?

671
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,113
No. It's just I've been studying
for a long time

672
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,743
and so I haven't really had the chance
to meet people.

673
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,913
You sure you didn't
push them away intentionally?

674
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,832
[laughs] No.

675
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,961
You know how they say love blossoms
even in the middle of a war?

676
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,339
-I keep work and love separate.
-Yeah.

677
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,926
It's just, love is love and work is work.

678
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,345
-That's true.
-They're totally separate for me.

679
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,638
-Yeah.
-No matter how busy I am,

680
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,432
I've never thought
I can't meet someone because of work.

681
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,477
I don't think I've ever been that way
in my life.

682
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,855
Hmm.

683
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,111
[Dong-woo] I like this night so much.

684
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,241
-Yeah.
-To be honest, I don't want to go back.

685
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,159
Me neither. Can't we just stay here?

686
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,620
What's the main reason
you don't wanna go back?

687
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,707
-[laughing]
-Because they keep making us do things?

688
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,042
I don't want you to
ask me things like this.

689
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,168
Okay, I'm sorry.

690
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,920
It's between you and me.

691
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,924
-No, but it's a bit too much.
-Okay. Okay.

692
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,092
[gasps]

693
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,343
[Hanhae] Right.

694
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,805
But that was harsh. "I don't want
you to ask me things like this."

695
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,516
But Seul-ki is the type that needs time.

696
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,518
And even if she was interested before,

697
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,770
Dong-woo keeps
actively asking her questions

698
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,773
to get some kinda confirmation
or keeps expressing himself.

699
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,401
She could've felt like
those questions put pressure on her.

700
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:52,196
-She's gradually pushing him away.
-They're moving at two different speeds.

701
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,906
Right, that's exactly it.

702
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,326
And they don't have anything
that fits with each other.

703
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,079
He's like, "You want to drink?"
She's like, "No, I can't drink."

704
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,247
"Swimming?" "No."

705
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,459
Compared to the beginning,
their vibe is a bit--

706
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,585
-Different.
-It changed.

707
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,422
Right. It's as if their feelings
for each other started off as 50-50,

708
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,675
now it feels like Seul-ki is still
on the same level or decreasing.

709
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,093
[Jin-kyung] Does seem like that.

710
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,138
Meanwhile, Dong-woo's like this,
all of a sudden. Really up there.

711
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:21,100
Dong-woo's feeling a little bit tipsy
and becoming enthusiastic.

712
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,436
-That's absolutely possible.
-[Jin-kyung] It is.

713
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,230
I don't think he'd be
that enthusiastic by nature.

714
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,900
He could be acting like this
because of the alcohol.

715
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,570
PARADISE

[mellow music playing]

717
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,199
Should I sleep here? [laughs]

718
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,659
[Yoong-jae] I'd feel uncomfortable.

719
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,210
[Seo-eun] Oh!

720
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,755
-This is nice.
-So nice.

721
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,008
[Seo-eun] Wait. Come here for a second.

722
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,803
Lay down here for a bit.
Lay down just once.

723
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,513
It's really different over here.

724
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,475
What they use for the bed is different.

725
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,811
It's so different.

726
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:07,897
[both chuckle]

727
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,484
-Isn't it so nice?
-Wow.

728
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,195
[Seo-eun] This is paradise.

729
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,281
Good night.

730
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,492
[Yoong-jae] No. Here.

731
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,496
-[Seo-eun] This place is so nice.
-Yeah.

732
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,707
-Thanks, Seo-eun.
-[laughs]

733
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,835
-[Seo-eun] Thank you.
-Huh?

734
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,295
-[Seo-eun] I thank you.
-Me too. Thanks to you.

735
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,172
Thanks to you.

736
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:36,592
[Seo-eun sighs]

737
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,513
[Yoong-jae] Really.

738
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,394
-We'll be able to come back again, right?
-I hope so.

739
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,483
-Did you have a good day?
-Today?

740
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,444
-Yeah.
-I don't think I'll ever forget it.

[both chuckling softly]

00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,031
It was really…

743
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,412
Everything came together
at the right time.

744
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,456
-[Yoong-jae] Yeah.
-Which made it a great day.

[mellow music playing]

746
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,921
It was really nice that I got to
come out here with you, oppa.

747
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,133
-[Yoong-jae] Me too.
-I really was so curious about you.

748
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,971
[Yoong-jae] Like, "What's his deal?"

749
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,516
[Seo-eun] "What's got him
acting like this?"

750
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,934
[Yoong-jae] Ah, like that.

751
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,105
I'm not hungry at all.

752
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,649
I don't think we ate
as much as we think we did.

753
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,944
I was surprised
we didn't eat as much as I thought.

754
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,405
We have breakfast tomorrow.

755
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,364
[Yoong-jae] Okay.

756
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,700
[Seo-eun sighs]

757
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,747
-It's so cushion-y.
-Go to sleep.

758
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:52,585
-You look really happy.
-[laughing] Because it's nice.

759
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,214
[Yoong-jae] This is nice too.

760
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,299
-It's so nice.
-Good.

761
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,930
[Yoong-jae] Really, today was very nice.

762
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,557
Not just because I'm here.

763
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,809
[Seo-eun] Yeah.

764
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,061
[Yoong-jae] It was nice

765
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,688
that we were able to

766
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,441
talk a lot.

767
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,611
[Seo-eun] It was fun
because we got to come here together.

768
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,570
[Yoong-jae] Yeah.

769
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,406
-Good night.
-[Seo-eun] Good night.

770
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,828
[Yoong-jae] It's nice to talk
right next to each other.

771
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,330
[Seo-eun laughs] Right?

772
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,124
[Yoong-jae] Can we stay up a bit more?

773
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,085
-[Seo-eun] Okay.
-[Yoong-jae] Talk for ten minutes?

774
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:37,004
-[Seo-eun] I'm okay with that.
-[Yoong-jae] You don't mind?

775
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,047
Oh, what?

776
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,968
He just doesn't want to go to sleep yet.

777
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:42,885
That's real.

778
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,096
If they fall asleep like that,
it's like being on the phone…

779
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,514
-[Hanhae] Right.
-…and falling asleep

780
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,474
-without knowing who fell asleep.
-[Hanhae] True.

781
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:51,227
-[Kyuhyun] That sort of thing.
-Seems like he's really excited.

782
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,355
INFERNO

783
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,608
So did anyone…

784
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:03,906
kind of… change after today?

785
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,451
Like a change in direction.

786
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,287
To be honest,

787
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,790
I've been talking about the same person
ever since first impressions.

788
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,792
-[Se-jeong] Oh, really?
-Hmm.

789
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,504
But… how should I put this?

790
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,925
For me, even if I have
the slightest bit of feelings,

791
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,721
-I tend to show it.
-[Se-jeong] Hmm.

792
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,973
[So-e] But it's only been a few days now.

793
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:33,686
So I'm worried that he might feel
that I was putting pressure on him,

794
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,523
or you know, something like that.

795
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,570
Even though in terms of my feelings,
that wasn't my intention.

796
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,280
[Se-jeong] Yeah.

797
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,448
But today,

798
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,283
I think Seo-eun…

799
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,493
How should I put this?

800
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,203
I think he and Seo-eun…

801
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,707
-Left together, right?
-Yeah, I thought he would.

802
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,167
-Really?
-Yeah.

803
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,586
Because I saw the two go inside to talk.

804
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,254
[Se-jeong] Hmm.

805
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:04,467
-But when we were having brunch earlier…
-[Se-jeong] Mmm.

806
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,678
…we talked a lot, so,

807
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:14,935
I thought maybe he would
want to talk more with other people.

808
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:17,855
Mmm-hmm.

809
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:22,109
So now I think maybe
I'm not really that charming to him.

810
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,569
[Se-jeong] Hmm.

811
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,490
Why is So-e so good
at seeing these things?

812
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,327
-She has her eyes only on Yoong-jae.
-Right.

813
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,413
What about you, Nadine?

814
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,753
Right now, I'm like… ground zero.

815
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,881
-I feel like I'm starting from scratch.
-Ah.

816
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:47,551
Do you get what I mean?
I briefly talked to him too.

817
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,595
It's like,

818
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:55,351
it's really not in my nature
to just ask someone to talk like that.

819
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:56,852
[Se-jeong] Hmm.

820
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,814
I think that was
the first time in my life I did that.

821
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,190
[Se-jeong] Talk?

822
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,943
Asking someone
I have feelings for to, like…

823
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,112
-[Se-jeong] Really?
-…just talk.

824
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,279
[Se-jeong] Oh.

825
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,115
-Wow.
-[Nadine] Literally, the first time.

826
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:13,369
So I'm very proud of myself
right now. [laughs]

827
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:16,288
-[Se-jeong] You had a new experience.
-I had a new experience.

828
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,165
So did something change?

829
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,501
Yes, but now it's like,

830
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,798
I tried it once and didn't work out,
so the thought of doing it again is--

831
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,174
-[Se-jeong] Frustrating?
-Yeah.

832
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,469
So you shouldn't think that he

833
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,098
acted the way he did
while having no interest in you.

834
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:41,063
He still must have had some feelings
to have talked with you like that, right?

835
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,898

PARADISE
SEUL-KI AND DONG-WOO

838
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,337
Did you sleep well, Seul-ki?

839
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,881
[laughing]

840
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,135
Do you always, like,

841
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,513
speak like that?

842
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,641
-Like what?
-Like…

843
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,898
-Anyway, enjoy the food.
-Enjoy the food.

844
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,947
I usually cook fish a lot and
they served us this fish, Korean food.

845
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,533
-It's excellent.
-Mmm. Mmm.

846
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:39,163
-We have to eat it up before we leave.
-Yeah.

847
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,376
-We have to go back soon.
-Yeah.

848
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,837
What are your thoughts
about coming to Paradise?

849
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,843
It was really nice because

850
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,973
we're placed in a completely different
environment again.

851
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,893
It's like a playing field.

852
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,189
That's how I felt.

853
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,485
Yeah, I agree with that, but…

854
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,322
But I wanted to know how it was for you
in terms of other aspects.

855
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,658
Mmm…

856
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,789
This is our first time coming here,

857
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,708
and it's only been two days.

858
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,587
So for me, asking questions like that…

859
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,175
it's like…

860
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,513
I don't think they're questions
I can easily answer.

861
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,431
[quirky electronic music playing]

862
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,145
[Kyuhyun] I can't watch. Wow.

863
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,856
-And--
-Yeah, she's honest.

864
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,818
It's even scarier to hear
than to say, "I didn't like it."

865
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,861
-It's nice that she's honest.
-[Kyuhyun] Wow.

866
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:57,032
Dong-woo's face looks like he's never
heard anything like that in his life.

867
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,827
[quirky electronic music continues]

868
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,128
What do you think we'll be doing today?

869
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,256
I think there will be a game
for just the men.

870
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,634
If I win the game,

871
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,928
do you want me to
choose you again like this?

872
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,059
Well,

873
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:29,356
oppa, I want you to choose someone
you really have feelings for.

874
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,151
Whoever you have feelings for, oppa.

875
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,652
[solemn music playing]

876
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,033
I really wanted to know.

877
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,285
Yeah.

878
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,705
Seul-ki, do you like someone who you like?

879
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,874
Or do you like someone who likes you back?

880
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,043
I definitely like someone I like.

881
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,796
-Even if they don't really like you?
-Yeah.

882
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,174
Same.

883
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,092
Someone I like.

884
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,678
Oh.

885
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,853
You know, a person's feelings

886
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,731
aren't something I can get
by paying money for it.

887
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,067
-That's true.
-Yeah.

888
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,944
So even if the person doesn't like me,

889
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,947
I think I'll just…

890
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,326
respect that.

891
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:32,127
I can try to get him to like me,
but that's not how things work.

892
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,843
It's really kind of sad.

893
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,597
What is?

894
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,643
I wanted to try doing
this and that with you.

895
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,978
But this was so short.

896
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:57,236
When we get back,
we never know when we'll be able to

897
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,571
talk again, just the two of us.

898
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,449
And I think

899
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,453
there will be some sort of challenge.

900
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,706
But I want us to see each other again…

901
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,002
without being swept up in that.

902
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:16,213
[solemn piano music playing]

903
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,301
[Dong-woo sighs heavily]

904
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,305
[groans]

905
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,850
I don't think Seul-ki likes
what's going on at all.

906
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,268
I don't feel anything from her.

907
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,644
-There's a wall.
-[Jin-kyung] Yeah.

908
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,271
-[Da-hee] Yeah.
-I feel a wall strongly.

909
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,940
Do you dislike it when someone
keeps asking questions like that?

910
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,359
Seul-ki kept telling him.

911
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,279
If she didn't say anything about it,
and he kept talking,

912
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,698
one could think
it's because he didn't know.

913
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,868
In regards to things like speed,
she told him she needs time.

914
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:46,952
She expressed how she felt,

915
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,455
but Dong-woo kept pressing her
without any consideration.

916
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,749
So I would've said something
along those lines too. I'd hate it.

917
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:56,170
But I think Seul-ki
kept responding with uncertainty.

918
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,715
Whereas Dong-woo wanted to confirm things.
So I get why he would ask again.

919
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:00,924
Because he's a doctor.

920
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,468
-[laughs]
-[Hanhae laughs]

921
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,179
In hospitals,
when you're dealing with patients,

922
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,181
you have to know
the condition of the patient.

923
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,558
"How do you feel
after taking the stitches out?"

924
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,518
-"Did the swelling go down?"
-He has to know.

925
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,355
-He has to keep asking these things.
-Right, so this could be work-related.

926
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,357
The vibes here are just totally off.

927
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,651
As if someone poured
cold water all over them.

928
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,069
I think what did it is,

929
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,864
-"Did you sleep well, Seul-ki?"
-[Hanhae] That's right.

930
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,033
-This wall just appeared.
-[Hanhae] Right.

931
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:29,077
-"Did you sleep well?" was a bit cheesy.
-[Da-hee] Yeah.

932
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,288
Seul-ki should tell him
what she doesn't like.

933
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,499
-[Kyuhyun] Right.
-"Did you sleep well?" This too.

934
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,502
-She hated it as she heard it.
-She could've let it go, but she hated it.

935
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,713
That's why she's saying,
"It's too much, I don't like it."

936
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,425
-I think Dong-woo is doing a good job.
-[Jin-kyung] Hmm.

937
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,262
-They're not right for each other.
-They're different.

938
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,681
[Jin-kyung] True, right.
It's not Dong-woo's fault.

939
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,518
-Dong-woo just likes Seul-ki.
-[Kyuhyun] Yeah.

940
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,020
INFERNO

941
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,189
[mellow electric guitar music playing]

942
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,900
[Han-bin] I wonder
how things will play out.

943
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,028
I thought we'd be able to predict
what was about to happen.

944
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,947
But I really don't have a clue anymore.

945
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,324
All because the people we chose…

946
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,828
had stronger feelings for someone else.

947
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,875
[Jong-woo] We didn't
really have lots of time to talk.

948
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:20,003
-That's true.
-I think it's a given that the women

949
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,714
will have more feelings for people
they've talked to.

950
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:28,178
They can't help but have feelings for
someone who's actively expressed himself.

951
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,139
I personally don't think
we should worry about that.

952
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,812
I'm trying to not care about it all.
If I worry about every single thing,

953
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,108
I'll be too intimidated
and I won't be able to express myself.

954
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,861
-That's gonna makes things even worse.
-Yeah. So just be confident.

955
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,158
[blows air]

956
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:51,785
Gosh.

957
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,413
Jeez, that fly is flying so hard.

958
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,791
If a fly is flying that hard,
we should be trying hard too.

959
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:00,127
-[Jong-woo] I'm attracting flies today.
-[laughs]

960
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,461
[quirky music playing]

961
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,672
Doesn't seem like a good sign.

962
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:07,217
Yesterday the button on my pants fell off
and today I'm attracting flies.

963
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,429
-I can't help but read meanings into this.
-But even that fly likes us.

964
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,306
That's another way to look at this.

965
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,225
-Someone else might like us too.
-Since the fly likes us.

966
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,560
[both laughing]

967
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:20,063
-This is weird.
-I hope other people like us too.

968
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,025
[mellow music playing]

969
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:27,988
-[Dong-woo] Did you have fun, Seul-ki?
-[Seul-ki] Yeah, it was a new experience.

970
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,115
-[Dong-woo] Be careful.
-[Seul-ki] Yeah.

971
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,701
I walked this path
by myself when I came here.

972
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,329
-[Dong-woo] Yeah.
-It's more fun to walk in together.

973
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,998
-[Dong-woo] We should come back next time.
-[Jong-woo] Read this.

974
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,542
[Han-bin] "Don't make rules?"

975
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,881
-Are you okay? Is it heavy?
-I'm okay.

976
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,217
I think they're coming.

977
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,262
[upbeat music playing]

978
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:55,641
[Jong-woo] I guess they're here.
Hey, you guys, you're back!

979
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,351
-When did you get back?
-[Seul-ki] Hello.

980
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,269
-That was a short trip.
-[Seo-eun] Hi.

981
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,354
[Han-bin] I know, right?

982
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,357
Good morning.

983
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,108
[Seul-ki] Good morning.

984
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,277
Good morning.

985
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,156
Look at them, walking with such energy.

986
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:14,034
-[Seul-ki laughs]
-[Yoong-jae] I could even run now.

987
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:19,331
-Ah, was that too harsh?
-[Dong-woo] Go ahead, Seul-ki.

988
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,541
I'll carry this over there for you.

989
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,252
[Han-bin] They're back!

990
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,592
-Ladies, they're back.
-[Jong-woo] Did you have fun?

991
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,511
We're back.

992
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,595
We did.

993
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,056
Was the food good?

994
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,141
We did eat lots of delicious food.

995
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,476
-Hello.
-[Seo-eun] Hello.

996
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,354
-[Nadine] They're here?
-[So-e] Hello.

997
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:43,939
[Se-jeong] You're back.

998
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,982
[So-e] Hello.

999
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,068
[Se-jeong] Her face is glowing.

1000
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,736
[Nadine] You look different.

1001
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,363
[So-e] Hello.

1002
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,199
[Nadine] So pretty!

1003
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,493
[Se-jeong] So pretty.

1004
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,995
-Seo-eun, I'll leave your bags.
-Thank you, Yoong-jae.

1005
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,497
[Seul-ki] See you later.

1006
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,790
[Jong-woo] See you later.

1007
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,625
-[Han-bin] See you.
-[Seo-eun] Thank you.

1008
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,793
[Han-bin] You're here.

1009
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,378
-[Yoong-jae] How are you?
-Missed you.

1010
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,504
[laughing]

1011
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:10,674
-[Jong-woo] I'll bet you didn't miss us.
-[Han-bin] He didn't miss us at all.

1012
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,135
[Jong-woo] First,
I want to know what you ate.

1013
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,597
When you go in, you say,
"Wow", like, 20 times.

1014
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,433
Wow.

1015
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,477
[Yoong-jae] You can't help
but say it nonstop for five minutes.

1016
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,187
[Jong-woo] Because you've never seen it?

1017
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,982
It's a place that makes you think,
"This is Korea?"

1018
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,775
[Jong-woo] Really? It's that great?

1019
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,027
The ceilings are so high.
The place is huge.

1020
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,612
Did you eat good food?

1021
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,239
-Yes. Good food.
-What did you eat?

1022
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,574
-Steak and--
-[Se-jeong] Wow!

1023
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,744
We really ate a lot. Baked salmon?

1024
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,121
-[Se-jeong] Sounds delicious.
-[Seul-ki] It was.

1025
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,665
Paradise is named Paradise for a reason.

1026
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,463
You know his job and age and everything?

1027
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,173
-[Seul-ki] Yeah.
-[Se-jeong] I'm so curious.

1028
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,592
-Were you surprised?
-Was it what you expected?

1029
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,344
I think the job suits him.

1030
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,054
To me, personally.

1031
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:04,311
So I was like, "Okay, yeah."

1032
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:05,812
[woman gasps]

1033
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,940
You keep smiling. [laughs]

1034
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,818
As you're talking, you keep…

1035
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,653
I think we had a fun time talking.

1036
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,489
We talked a lot.

1037
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,700
Like, three, four hours?

1038
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,702
I think it was, like, six?

1039
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,662
-[Jong-woo] Six hours?
-[Yoong-jae] Six hours.

1040
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,414
-[Jong-woo] Really?
-Yeah.

1041
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,958
-[Han-bin] Had good conversations?
-Well, it was fun, yeah.

1042
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,879
-Dong-woo?
-[Han-bin] Why do you look troubled?

1043
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,839
You've been to Paradise,
but you look troubled.

1044
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:33,924
No, I'm just tired.

1045
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,053
And I really talked a lot too.

1046
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,472
But I'm like,

1047
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,558
now I know one person,

1048
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,354
But I feel like I want to
get to know other people too.

1049
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,313
Mmm.

1050
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,775
I want to meet different people.

1051
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,568
[So-e] Mmm.

1052
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,155
The vibes are going to be different today.

1053
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,615
[Se-jeong] The vibes, yeah.

1054
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,410
I found myself thinking
that rather than going to Paradise,

1055
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:07,290
I really want to try my best
with someone I really have feelings for.

1056
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,170
This is day two, three, right?

1057
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,129
Yeah, day three.

1058
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,466
Why does it feel like
it's been a month? [laughs]

1059
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,052
[Han-bin] Probably because
you've been someplace else.

1060
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:20,804
It feels like it's been too long.

1061
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,557
[sighs] This is hard.

1062
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,641
What's hard?

1063
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,602
There's so much for me to think about.

1064
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,146
We can't really
say things out loud, so we hold it in.

1065
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,357
It's hard to talk openly about things.

1066
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:38,071
So I'm annoyed,
and the other person is annoyed.

1067
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:41,867
I feel like I'm a circle now,
because I keep talking around the point.

1068
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,618
[laughing]

1069
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:46,830
You're becoming a circle?

1070
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,749
-I'm about to roll away.
-[So-e] That's a good way to put it.

1071
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,627
[intercom chiming]

1072
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,755
[Master] Did you enjoy
the date in Paradise?

1073
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,425
[suspenseful music playing]

1074
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:04,347
Today, another set of couples
will be matched

1075
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,224
to go on a date in Paradise.

1076
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,643
-What? Again?
-[Dong-woo] We're not going again, right?

1077
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:09,895
[Master] But today,

1078
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:13,732
you cannot choose the same person
you were a couple with yesterday.

1079
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,650
YESTERDAY'S COUPLES
CANNOT CHOOSE EACH OTHER

1080
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:16,735
[Jong-woo] Ah.

1081
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,612
Oh, really?

1082
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:20,739
Mmm.

1083
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,282
Then can we choose?

1084
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,619
[Master] I'll be looking forward
to the new Paradise couples.

1085
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,996
But before that, you'll be playing a game

1086
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,750
to win the opportunity to go on a date
and have a special meal.

1087
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,377
Participants, please come to the beach.

1088
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:38,089
-Special meal.
-[Han-bin] We have to play the men's game.

1089
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,133
[Jong-woo] It should be

1126
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,667
[Master] Two of you
will put on the shoulder harnesses

1127

that are connected by the rope.

1128
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,506
Once you hear the whistle,
move as fast as you can toward your flag.

1129
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:47,969
The first contestant
to pull his flag is the winner.

The game will proceed as a tournament.

This is all about strength.

1136

This is really a battle of pride.

1137
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:11,117
-But if they lose, won't they get dragged?

00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,018

1152
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,320
[Jong-woo] Yoong-jae has
a great lower body.

1153
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:51,866
They're both very muscular,
so, I'm not sure who'll win.

1154
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,662
A match between
a stockbroker and a doctor.

[Hanhae] Ah.

1156
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,957
How are they a stockbroker
and a doctor with those bodies?
