to win an opportunity
for a date in Paradise.

17
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,479
First place, Jo Yoong-jae.

18
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,938
Whoo!

19
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,398
Congratulations.

20
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,860

Third place, Kim Jin-young.

23
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,584
Great job, everyone.

24
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,015
-Oh.
-Gosh.

25
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:40,975
Oh.

26
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,647
-I think I'm going to cry.
-I think I could cry too.

27
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,609
He really did his best
just like he promised Seul-ki.

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,834
-Great job.
-Great job.

29
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,214
Oh, gosh.

30
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,299
What is this?

31
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,138
-Honestly, what is this?
-This is such a weird show.

32
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,266
-I'm tearing up because of Jong-woo.
-Why is everyone crying?

33
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,810
-What is this?
-Yeah, but why is he crying?

34
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,436
Why is he crying?

35
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,149
-What is that?
-Why is the music so--

36
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,400
I feel so…

37
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,526
I feel weird.

38
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,364
This season's main character,
Choi Jong-woo.

39
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,492
Oh, jeez. It's so sad.

40
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,328
It's his victory.

41
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,707
It's a victory that he achieved
through his own efforts.

42
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,334
I mean, this is because

43
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,213
we know what kind of mentality
Jong-woo had when he was fighting.

44
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,549
We do.

45
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,093
Even as he was
being dragged out by the other two,

46
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,638
he kept thinking,
"I can't get dragged out of here."

47
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,099
He almost did get dragged out a few times.

48
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,142
But every time,

49
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,395
he kept fighting
his way back in again thinking,

50
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,522
"I have to win this, no matter what."

51
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,275
I could see all that in his face.

52
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,070
-Great job.
-Great job.

53
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,780
-Great job.
-Great job.

54
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,658
-Congrats. You're the real winner.
-You did great.

55
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,661
-Jong-woo, you really…
-Don't forget the shoes.

56
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,914
-Jong-woo was amazing.
-Really.

57
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,749
He was
holding out with his legs.

58
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,376
-It's great Jong-woo's 2nd place.
-Amazing.

59
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,879
He just did it
thinking it was his last chance.

60
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:33,838
He did it.

61
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,008
-I feel drained.
-Go tell Jong-woo he did well.

62
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,760
-Right.
-Say something.

63
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:39,928
-Now?
-Yeah!

64
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,264
-No, I don't want to.
-Why not?

65
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,351
-Why not? This is the last game.
-Right.

66
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,771
No, I'm just
not going to say anything.

67
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,484
-It's not easy.
-This is fun.

68
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,569
-It wasn't fun.
-I'm so tired.

69
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,655
I couldn't do it again now if I had to.

70
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,158
Everyone's smiling now.
Earlier, their faces were all like…

71
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,952
I know.
They've lightened up now.

72
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,537
-Good job!
-You all did well, guys!

73
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,248
Thanks.

74
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,625
Jong-woo's going
to Paradise after all.

75
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,752
-He is.
-Jong-woo's going!

76
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,213
-Jong-woo's finally going!
-Jong-woo!

77
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,677
It was a good battle.
It feels like I fought.

78
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,346
-I fought with my heart.
-It was really intense.

79
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,806
-It was cool.
-Right.

80
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:25,723
So cool.

81
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,809
-They didn't give up.
-Right.

82
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,770
Highlight for me was
Jong-woo, Han-bin, Jin-young.

83
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,480
Yeah.

84
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,650
-It was fun.
-Seul-ki has a lot on her mind.

85
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,860
-She's thinking a lot.
-No.

86
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,570
What do you mean, "No"?

87
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,281
-Just say you are.
-Enjoy it.

88
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,533
-You're so funny.
-Just enjoy it.

89
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,038
Oh, Jong-woo must be excited.

90
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,749
-Jong-woo must be proud.
-He accomplished it on his own.

91
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,336
He kept wanting to do things
that he could do through his effort alone.

92
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,216
It was like, Jin-young was
strategically using techniques.

93
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,593
Yeah, he was using techniques.

94
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,180
-He seems like he does sports.
-Yeah, he must like sports.

95
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,474
The way he fought
looked like jujitsu, right?

96
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:12,603
-I can't predict who Jin-young will pick.
-Jin-young?

97
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,819
This is going to be fun.

98
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,198
They were all, like, shaking.

99
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,371
Are you supposed
to do that without looking?

100
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,126
Doesn't Nadine look very anxious?
The way she's turning the cube.

101
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,254
-You're supposed to look at it.
-She's just anxious right now.

102
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,214
I wonder who Jin-young will choose.

103
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,550
Right. If Seul-ki's already been picked.

104
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,348
-I wonder how things will end up.
-Me too.

105
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,725
I think Se-jeong will go.

106
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,728
-Se-jeong? I hope she goes.
-Right.

107
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:59,692
But we already know
who Yoong-jae and Jong-woo will choose.

108
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,986
Yeah, that's too obvious.

109
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,281
But now, Jin-young is the variable.

110
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,366
Right, who will Jin-young choose?

111
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,414
♪ Didn't think
This could happen with you ♪

112
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,291
♪ From the first time… ♪

113
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:18,544
-It feels like my skin will burn.
-I know.

114
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,801
I think Jin-young is someone
who is true to his heart.

115
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,427
LEE NADINE

116
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,305
So he'll do whatever he wants.

117
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,977
And I haven't been able to
express myself a lot to Jin-young so far,

118
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,814
so I don't think he'll pick me.

119
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,149
♪ I know you don't wanna go… ♪

120

00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,328
-What? Isn't this our tent?
-It is.

124
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,206
-Can I sit here?
-Yes, of course, please.

125
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,376
You're acting kinda cold since you
went to Paradise with someone else.

126
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,293
What?

127
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,879
You're acting cold since you
went to Paradise with someone else.

128
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,923
-No, I'm not.
-I'm just joking.

129
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:04,966
I'm not.

130
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,263
The ice cream was good.

131
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,349
-You had ice cream?
-Ice cream and sherbet too.

132
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,018
They were both good.

133
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,271
You had delicious food there.

134
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,399
But I hope you don't go again this time.

135
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,193
-This time? Yeah.
-Yeah.

136
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,778
It'll be more fun if you don't go.

137
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,613
I know. Like, of course,

138
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,701
I'm in a good mood
since I went to Paradise yesterday.

139
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,829
But now it seems like
everyone here had so much fun.

140
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,040
-We did have fun yesterday.
-Really?

141
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,836
Yeah. Seo-eun and Se-jeong
and Seul-ki and everyone.

142
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,505
All said it was so fun.

143
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,424
-They said it was the most they laughed…
-Really?

144
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,426
…to the point their throat hurt.

145
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,969
But you weren't there,

146
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,890
-You missed out on all the fun.
-Yeah, I know.

147
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,225
So, ultimately,
where I'm at is where it's fun.

148
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,852
All right.

149
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,771
I'm telling you,
where I'm at is where it's fun.

150
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,733
-So let's stay here today and have fun.
-Okay.

151
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,194
I need to think about what to do today.

152
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,612
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

153
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,200
-You should go in or you'll get burned.
-My skin tends to not burn.

154
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,993
Oh, yeah?

155
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,746
You must be healthy.

156
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,332
Be careful.

157
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,293
-Go inside.
-Okay.

158
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,880
-See you later.
-Have a good conversation.

159
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:26,839
Yes.

160
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,592
This one's about to
collapse from the heat.

161
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,345
Bye.

162
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,737
Seul-ki.

163
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,032
Do you have time to talk, maybe?

164
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,078
If you have nothing to say,
I'll go inside.

165
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,664
-Excuse me?
-If you've nothing to say, I'll go inside.

166
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,415
I just thought you might be busy.

167
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,628
-Do you want to go talk over there?
-Uh, yes.

168
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,546
Okay.

169
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,258
You're so dressed up for Paradise today.

170
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,594
You're even more dressed up, Seul-ki.

171
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,221
I haven't seen you like this.

172
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,568
-Oh.
-Bad timing.

173
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:29,986
Oh, my God.

174
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,363
Why is he
watching them from behind?

175
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,948
Where did he come from?

176
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,798
-You didn't get hurt?
-Huh?

177
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,342
-You didn't get hurt?
-No, I didn't get hurt.

178
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,386
Gosh.

179
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,305
It's too bad.

180
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,391
I was going for a second place.

181
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,602
I wasn't really interested in first place.

182
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:07,398
But I should have been second place
out of the three. It's too bad.

183
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,609
You still looked pretty cool.

184
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,490
I tried my best,
which is why I accept the result.

185
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,533
Hmm.

186
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,411
Jong-woo.

187
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,330
Jong-woo was strong.

188
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,252
Jong-woo was really desperate to win too.

189
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,170
Hmm.

190
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,423
Well, I lost, so, obviously,

191
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,593
he's going to take you, but…

192
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,553
…there's nothing I can do.

193
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,766
When you went to Paradise with me, uh,

194
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,852
we made an impact.

195
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,230
You really like "impact."

196
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,275
I heard you say that before, "impact."

197
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,569
What? What about impact?

198
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,987
I heard everything.

199
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,407
That your trip to Paradise
with someone else felt impactful to you.

200
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,243
Another kind of impact.

201
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,664
That one… Paradise is
the kind of place that does that.

202
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:12,046
-Have you decided on who you'll go with?
-Uh, who I'll go with?

203
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,965
Yeah, I've decided.

204
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,887
Well, then, can I ask you something?

205
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,556
-What?
-What criteria did you use to decide?

206
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,474
Criteria?

207
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,102
Yeah, I think
I'd be more at peace if I knew that.

208
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,686
Hmm…

209
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,064
Hmm…

210
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,403
Someone whose identity I'm curious about.

211
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,322
-I chose based on that.
-Hmm.

212
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,328
Anyway…

213
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,125
I'm fine now that I know. Let's go.

214
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,585
Okay.

215
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,173
Ah…

216
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,925
-She's slightly ticked off.
-Yes.

217
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,885
-Yes.
-She wanted him to hold on to her.

218
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,805
Right. I think in the end
she expected to hear something like,

219
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,932
"Someone who doesn't have
anything to do with me."

220
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,560
He could've said, "It doesn't mean
anything unless it's you."

221
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,519
Why didn't he do that?

222
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,522
-He's an honest person.
-Honest person.

223
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,983
I think that's Jin-young's charm.

224
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,776
-Right.
-Mmm.

225
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,824
There's someone sneaky here.
I can't figure out what he's thinking.

226
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,034
-Who?
-We all know who, right?

227
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,204
First off, how many people
do you have feelings for?

228
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,541
Two.

229
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,002
-I didn't know that. Two?
-Huh?

230
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,254
Take
the second person you like.

231
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,255
The second?

232
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,508
Well, to be honest,
I think the first person I like

233
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,302
will be chosen by the second-place winner.

234
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,432
-Anyway, won't things become clear today?
-Yeah.

235
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,976
Whatever it maybe,
things will become clear.

236
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,396
Everything will be clear after today.

237
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,739
We will now match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

238
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,116
COUPLE MATCHING TO PARADISE HAS BEGUN

239
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,242
Have fun.

240
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:09,455
Those who won the chance to
go on a date in Paradise in today's game,

241
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:13,000
Jo Yoong-jae, Choi Jong-woo,
and Kim Jin-young.

242
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,920
-Come out to the front of the campfire.
-See you later.

243
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,838
-Let's go.
-See you tomorrow.

244
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,341
-Have fun.
-See you tomorrow.

245
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,262
-Congratulations, really.
-Let's have fun tomorrow.

246
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,556
I'm happy for you.

247
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,108
JO YOONG-JAE

248
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,820
CHOI JONG-WOO

249
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,157
KIM JIN-YOUNG

250
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,537
Starting with Jo Yoong-jae,
who won first place.

251
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,121
Please say the name of the person

252
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,874
you'd like to
go on a date with in Paradise.

253
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,709
He's going to say it right away.

254
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,510
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is Choi Seo-eun.

255
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,558
The person Jo Yoong-jae
chose is Choi Seo-eun.

256
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,478
Choi Seo-eun, come outside
and leave for Paradise with Jo Yoong-jae.

257
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,439
-Bye!
-Have a great time.

258
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,358
-See you tomorrow.
-It should be fun.

259
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,028
Yoong-jae should buy me dinner
once we're out of here.

260
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,614
-Yes, he really should.
-Yoong-jae won.

261
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,243
-All this work for nothing.
-See you tomorrow, guys.

262
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,412
-See you tomorrow.
-We'll miss you.

00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,531
-It's heartwarming.
-This is how it feels.

275
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,199
They look so good together.

276
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,536
Look how he's going to her.
He's so excited.

277
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,749
Look at his manners.
Do we get out this way?

278
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,919
I told you
we should go together next time.

279
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,338
-Yeah.
-I think that's today.

280
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,965
I told you too
it'd be nice to go twice.

281
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,927
Yeah.
Personally I'm just so happy.

282
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,845
That's nice.

283
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,683
They really look
like a newlywed couple now.

284
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,145
-They were such a couple from the start.
-They look good together.

285
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,356
They're spending together
their first and last Paradise.

286
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,608
They've been together
from beginning to end.

287
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,279
Next, Choi Jong-woo
who won second-place.

288
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,075
Choi Jong-woo, please say
the name of the person you'd like

289
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,494
-to go on a date with in Paradise.
-We won't know until the end.

290
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,704
-What do you mean?
-We won't know?

291
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,581
Who did he fight like crazy for?

292
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,540
Right?

293
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,673
The person I want to go
to Paradise with is…

294
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,051
Shin Seul-ki.

295
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,727
The person
Choi Jong-woo chose is…

296
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,063
-Said your name right away.
-…Shin Seul-ki.

297
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,524
-Shin Seul-ki, please come outside…
-See you.

298
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,859
…and leave for Paradise
with Choi Jong-woo.

299
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,778
-Eat good food.
-Eat good food.

300
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,365
-Finally Jong-woo. Jong-woo.
-He's going.

301
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,860
We're finally going.

302
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,944
Let me carry this.

303
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,864
-Thanks.
-You want me to carry this too? Let's go.

304
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,744
Be careful of the fire.

305
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,459
You're dressed nicely.

306
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,628
-How's the denim-on-denim? Is it okay?
-Yeah, it's nice.

307
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,839
You look good
in that strawberry color.

308
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,140
I'm excited to go.

309
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:42,311
-Do whatever you want to there, Jong-woo.
-No, let's discuss what to do together.

310
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,148
Let's have lots of fun.

311
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,318
It's the first time
I'm walking on these steps.

312
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,570
-You're finally walking on them.
-I know.

313
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,738
With me.

314
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,407
This feels very new.

315
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,204
How long have we waited for this?

316
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,040
-Yeah, this moment.
-He earned it.

317
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,000
Good for you, Jong-woo.

318
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:11,131
Lastly, Kim Jin-young
who won third place.

319
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,720
Please say the name of the person you'd
like to go on a date with in Paradise.

320
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,223
Wow. This is the key point.

321
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,266
This is the highlight
of the matching session.

322
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,352
Wait, who do you think it'll be?

323
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,688
-Chances are it's Se-jeong or Min-su.
-Not Nadine, right?

324
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,234
-We don't know that, to be honest.
-I really don't know.

325
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,902
We know who his first pick is,

326
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,154
but he hasn't given
any hints about the second person

327
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,240
I have no clue who his second pick is.

328
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,076
I'm not sure. Nadine could be going.

329
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,912
-It's not me.
-Really can't figure Jin-young out.

330
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,414
-I think it's Nadine.
-I don't think it's me.

331
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,542
-Why not?
-We barely talked.

332
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,836
I can't figure out
what's going on inside of Jin-young.

333
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,380
-Can't figure him out.
-Can't figure him out at all.

334
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,340
I gave up
trying to predict Jin-young.

335
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,926
-Oh.
-I'm curious to see whom he'll choose.

336
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,303
I think it's Nadine.

337
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,765
-But Se-jeong should go at least once.
-Oh, yeah. Right, Se-jeong.

338
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,309
I hope either Se-jeong or Nadine goes.

339
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,149
The person I want to go
to Paradise with is…

340
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:15,654
I'm really curious. Something tells me
it's gonna take him a while.

341
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,615
-He's gonna contemplate over it.
-He's totally going to.

342
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,410
The person
Kim Jin-young chose is…

343
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:28,667
The person I want to go
to Paradise with is Lee Nadine.

344
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,045
…Lee Nadine.

345
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:37,718
Lee Nadine, come outside
and leave for Paradise with Kim Jin-young.

346
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,678
Nadine.

347
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,346
-Nadine.
-Told you.

348
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,348
Ah.

349
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,309
It's Nadine.

350
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,811
I really didn't see this coming.

351
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,105
What do I do?

352
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,107
Go and show off your pretty outfit.

353
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,276
I can't.

354
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,196
Didn't you pack your things?

355
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,239
-No.
-You didn't pack?

356
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,782
I mean, I did pack, but--

357
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,410
You thought you weren't going
so you packed without thinking?

358
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,703
Yeah.

359
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,747
-Still, go have fun.
-Yeah, go have fun.

360
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,957
See you tomorrow.

361
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,126
-See you.
-Love you guys.

362
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,253
-We love you too.
-Love you.

363
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,213
Love you.

364
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,395
-Hi.
-Hi.

365
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,109
-Surprise.
-Surprise?

366
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,320
-Let's go.
-Need help?

367
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,614
No, thanks. I can carry it on my own.

368
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,076
-Was this expected?
-No.

369
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,078
I really didn't expect this.

370
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,247
-Not at all?
-No.

371
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,707
Let's have fun today.

372
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,960
-Okay.
-Okay? Champagne?

373
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,962
-Champagne?
-Okay.

374
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,297
-We'll have fun.
-Okay. There's lots to do.

375
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,092
I have to find out
about your job, your age.

376
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,927
Me too.
It's the same for me too.

377
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,930
-We had the same thoughts just now.
-Right.

378
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,141
-I'm so curious.
-I'm very curious about who you are.

379
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,563
Did you know he'd choose Nadine?

380
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,692
-I said that it would be Nadine earlier.
-Yeah, you did.

381
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,669
Ah, she looks really down.

382
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,796
She must be disappointed.

383
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,506
It's like, I'm watching Se-jeong's face

384
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,217
and it feels like
she must have had some anticipation

385
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,719
that maybe it could be her.

386
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,139
If I were Se-jeong
when he actually called out Nadine,

387
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,975
I'm sure I would have had
a lot going on in my head.

388
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,020
Because she's become the only person
here who hasn't been to Paradise.

389
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,229
Yeah, that's right.

390
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,648
And Se-jeong is very charming.

391
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,150
-She is charming.
-I know.

392
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,777
Also, Jin-young and Nadine.

393
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:04,323
This couple was so curious
about each other as they were talking

394
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:08,035
and Jin-young had Nadine
on his mind the most after Seul-ki.

395
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,622
And Nadine has a lot of feelings
for Jin-young right now, so…

396
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,667
-I think this date in Paradise…
-Yeah?

397
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,919
…will be a very important one.

398
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,380
-In Jin-young's heart. Wow.
-Yeah.

-The bedroom too.
-I got lost once.

416
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,894
We could play
hide-and-seek in here. That'd be fun.

417
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,230
Yeah, right. We could do that.

-Okay. Teach me what to do.

-I'm so happy.
-This is written in different languages.

421
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,496
Should we order a dish from each country?

422
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,582
-I'll eat everything.
-Let's do whatever you want. Really.

00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,183
Back then and now?

471
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,770
I don't know. I'm not sure.

472
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,982
The sun is setting beautifully right now.

473
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,275
Yeah.

474
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,362
-Time really does go by quickly.
-Hmm.

475
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,240
What are you thinking?

476
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,576
Mmm…

477
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,495
-It's good that we came here.
-Huh?

478
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,955
-Why is it good?
-It's good we came.

479
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,416
I think it's good
that we came here in many ways.

480
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,710
And it's…

481
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,047
thanks to you.

482
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,631
I feel the same way.

483
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,801
And, like, looking back…

484
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,057
I think I made the right choice…

485
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,685
every single time.

486
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,064
The way I see it.

487
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,233
So, I think I did well.

488
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,153
That includes now as well.

489
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:39,741
Right.

490
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,161
I thought that too.

491
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,332
I think there were moments
when the timing was really good.

492
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,666
Mmm.

493
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,794
But don't you think we made it here…

494
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,632
because we had those moments?

495
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:02,138
Like, what if… that time in the beginning

496
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,350
when we had
our conversation by coincidence…

497
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,476
Mmm.

498
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,521
If I didn't realize things

499
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,440
or if we just didn't have
that conversation,

500
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,151
things could've been different somehow.

501
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,988
Mm-hmm. Right. I agree.

502
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,994
In every moment,
ultimately anything could happen.

503
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,750
-You go along one path.
-But because of that one choice…

504
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,586
-And that was the path that we went along.
-Right.

505
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,549
If we didn't have
that first chance encounter,

506
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,468
we could've taken longer
to get to this ending.

507
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,304
-This moment right here.
-Yes, that's possible.

508
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,307
And because we didn't, I'm very…

509
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,562
thankful for those coincidences.

510
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,233
I don't know. I guess I just

511
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,029
have very good facial expressions
when I'm with you, oppa.

512
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:00,947
Why?

513
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,492
The girls said
it's heartwarming to see us talking.

514
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,370
They did say that.

515
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,248
-I don't know why, though.
-I don't know.

516
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,543
I said something like that.

517
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,921
They asked what kind
of relationship I wanted.

518
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,633
What goal I had that made me
want to come and be on Single's Inferno.

519
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:25,263
And I just said,
"I want to be in a happy relationship

520
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:28,183
with someone who makes me happy
just by looking at them."

521
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,394
That's what I said.

522
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,647
And was that goal realized?

523
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,318
Why do you think I brought it up?

524
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,612
I'm not sure.

525
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:49,788
In many ways, I'm very… happy to be here
with the person who won first place.

526
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,049
INFERNO

527
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,300
Let's eat.

528
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,428
-I think it's raw chicken.
-Oh, God.

529
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,139
-Go with braised spicy chicken?
-Sounds good.

530
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,018
-Oh!
-Oh!

531
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,854
You're powerful.

532
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,274
We should be eating a delicious meal too,
not just the people in Paradise.

533
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,234
Right.

534
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,654
Do you eat chicken neck?

535
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,405
-Yes.
-Yes.

536
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,325
-You eat chicken neck?
-Yeah, I can chew up the bone too.

537
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,665
-You must think she's adorable.
-Excuse me?

538
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,667
-You think she's adorable?
-Yes.

539
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,297
-You said you were gonna do it.
-How many potatoes?

540
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,967
-Let's do five potatoes.
-Five?

541
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,847
Mmm…

542
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:54,811
It's too…

543
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,690
Be careful.

544
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,233
I think I cut it wrong.

545
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,527
It's fine. You did it well.

546
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,034
-What should I do?
-It's fine. I'll do it. It's sharp.

547
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,870
Should I do it like this, in thirds?

548
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,830
-I cut this weird.
-Two. You did good.

549
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,373
-Two?
-Yeah.

550
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,625
-One?
-In the middle. Yeah. Good.

551
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,295
-Thank you.
-I'll do it. Don't worry.

552
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,715
-I'm going to mess it up if I do it.
-No.

553
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,175
-You did fine.
-Okay.

554
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,304
How many chickens should we do?

555
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,686
All of a sudden Se-jun
and So-e's chemistry is good.

556
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,356
He's watching her
as if he's stuck to her like glue.

557
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,444
-Let's eat.
-Enjoy the food.

558
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,195
Enjoy the food.

559
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,864
Gosh, it smells great.

560
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,866
Potatoes!

561
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:52,994
Look at this.

562
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,079
Isn't it great?

563
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,170
Oh, this is really good.

564
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,423
-The broth is so good. I want more rice.
-Right. Me too.

565
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,508
Mix it in with rice.
It's really good.

566
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,177
I've been eating it that way.

567
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,804
And the view's nice.

568
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:16,225
-The ocean is… kind of an emerald color.
-Right.

569
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,146
I feel really relaxed.

570
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,359
When else would we
be eating and sleeping by the ocean?

571
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:42,961
It's like a painting.

572
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,215
It's more like a painting
than an actual painting, right?

573
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:52,095
PARADISE
JIN-YOUNG AND NADINE

574
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,569
This is on a whole other level.

575
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,946
Look at this.

576
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,366
Oh, my God.

577
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,452
It's so pretty.

578
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,918
-Are you amazed?
-I am. It really is amazing.

579
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,673
-I'm hungry, Nadine.
-Yeah, go ahead and eat.

580
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,385
-Enjoy the food.
-Enjoy the food.

581
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:39,767
-You must be starving.
-Yeah, I used up a lot of energy today.

582
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,145
I bet. But you were really awesome.

583
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,479
-Really?
-Yeah.

584
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,524
-Who do you think was the best then?
-You.

585
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,859
-Really?
-Yeah.

586
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,236
-Even though I lost?
-Yeah.

587
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,448
-I was cheering for you.
-Oh, really?

588
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,365
Yeah.

589
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:55,825
Oh…

590
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,244
I didn't expect that.

591
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,079
I didn't expect that.

592
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,209
She can express herself
now that it's just the two of them.

593
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:10,173
Yes. Why is it that
I want to cheer for this couple?

594
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,257
Yeah, they're cute.

595
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,384
-I want to cheer for them too.
-Right?

596
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,389
-Should we reveal our ages first?
-Our ages?

597
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,517
-Okay.
-How old are you?

598
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,146
-Mmm, in Korean age?
-Hmm.

599
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,483
-Twenty-three.
-Twenty-three?

600
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:33,738
Twenty-eight.

601
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,907
Yeah, you seem like you're 28.

602
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,533
-Really?
-Yeah.

603
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,202
-Or 27.
-Hmm.

604
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,537
You're 23.

605
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,332
You seem cuter all of a sudden.

606
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,501
All of a sudden, your actions seem…

607
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,628
-I don't like being cute.
-Hmm.

608
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:54,008
-No, I think you have it in you.
-I don't. I don't really act cute.

609
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,178
-You don't have to act cute to be cute.
-Mmm.

610
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,599
Then we're five years apart in age.

611
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,936
-That's kind of a lot.
-Hmm.

612
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,438
Well, age is something I don't really…

613
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,775
-Usually don't care.
-…tend to care about that much.

614
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,777
-What matters is the person.
-Mmm.

615
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,406
I'm curious about your job.

616
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,785
What do you do? Uh, no, no, don't say it.

617
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,411
-Don't say it.
-Why not?

618
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,913
I'm going to try to guess.

619
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,623
It's just…

620
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,793
Are you on YouTube?

621
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,087
-What?
-Are you a YouTuber?

622
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,967
Huh? Really?

623
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,097
-I'm working as a YouTuber.
-Seriously?

624
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,015
-Huh?
-How did she know?

625
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,434
-How did she know that?
-How did she know?

626
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,937
-Oh, my.
-Maybe it was easy…

627
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,816
-No way.
-Why not?

628
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,360
What kind of YouTube content? Workouts?

629
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,362
Well, at first, it was, like, tactics.

630
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,448
-Like, shooting guns and…
-Guns?

631
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,909
Yeah, I created
YouTube content using guns,

632
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,370
and now, I'm trying
a lot of different things.

633
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,541
Wow, that's amazing.

634
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:13,045
To be honest, it's difficult
to make gun content in Korea…

635
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,339
-Mmm.
-…because of legal restrictions.

636
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,718
So I'm making plans to go to the States…

637
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,306
and try doing it
maybe at the end of this year.

638
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,142
Come visit.

639
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,729
Where do you live, Nadine?

640
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,481
-Now I live in Boston.
-Boston?

641
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,567
-For school.
-For school?

642
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,528
-You're a student right now.
-Yeah.

643
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,199
I'm in pre-med.
I'm going to go to med school.

644
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,411
Med school? So you're preparing for it?

645
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,540
-I'm going to grad school for med.
-Ah.

646
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:53,002
So you have to go through
all of those steps to become a doctor?

647
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,254
You're a future doctor.

648
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,507
Yeah, my major is the brain.

649
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,802
-It's the brain field?
-Brain science.

650
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,054
Oh, I really…

651
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,100
can't match that to you.

652
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,311
Come visit Boston.

653
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,812
-Boston?
-Yeah.

654
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,439
I really should.

655
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,901
Where do you want to go
when you go to the States?

656
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:20,905
I think I should go somewhere secluded,
uh, to a shooting range center.

657
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,323
I want to train there.

658
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,620
The reason I want to do that
is because I used to be a soldier.

659
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,705
-Mmm!
-For four years.

660
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,540
You seem like a soldier.

661
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,708
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

662
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,544
-Do you know what the UDT is?
-I do.

663
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,421
Yeah, I used to be in the UDT.

664
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,464
Oh, really?

665
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,217
So, were you, from the start?

666
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,426
-In the UDT?
-Mmm.

667
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,804
I applied for the UDT from the beginning.

668
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,807
Oh, that's awesome.

669
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,811
-That's awesome, really.
-Thank you.

670
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,022
-I was briefly in the army too.
-You were?

671
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,649
You were in the army?

672
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,110
-You know ROTC, right?
-Yeah.

673
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,737
-I did ROTC.
-How long were you in the ROTC?

674
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:02,697
Just for a year.

675
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,783
So I wore uniforms too.

676
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,368
You were in the ROTC.

677
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,372
This is really a series of surprises.

678
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,750
I like things like the army.

679
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,169
-I didn't expect that.
-I've shot guns a lot.

680
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,754
-Oh, really?
-Mmm.

681
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,007
-What kind?
-I've never shot a sniper rifle.

682
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,386
-Just AR rifles or shotguns?
-Yeah. AR rifles, shotguns, pistols.

683
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,345
Pistols?

684
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,764
Then when I come to the States, we could…

685
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,809
-Shoot?
-Yeah, it'd be fun to shoot together.

686
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,603
-I'm quite good.
-You like things like that? You're good?

687
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,896
I am quite good.

688
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,566
-This is fun.
-It is fun.

689
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,527
-This is very fun right now.
-It feels different somehow, doesn't it?

690
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,821
I feel that way about you too.

691
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,365
It feels very different right now.

692
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,329
They have something in common.

693
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:55,082
She keeps saying,
"I like all the things you do," right now.

694
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,753
The way they intersect is so unexpected.

695
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,670
Right.

696
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,799
So, do you do
anything related to fashion?

697
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,012
-I don't do fashion content.
-Really? You dress really well.

698
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,638
-Really?
-Yeah.

699
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,140
I tried harder this time.

700
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:14,060
-I usually dress in all-black.
-All-black?

701
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,854
Me too.
I usually dress in almost all-black.

702
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,231
Well, my motorcycle is black, so…

703
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,276
-Motorcycle?
-Yeah, do you like motorcycles?

704
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,652
-Really?
-You like them?

705
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:27,865
-Harley-Davidson?
-No. Mine's the Yamaha MT-09.

706
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:31,035
-Yeah, I know what that is.
-And it's super-fast.

707
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,703
I really like things like that.

708
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,830
Cars, motorcycles.

709
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,582
-Yeah?
-Do you know what F1 is?

710
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,417
-Yeah, I know what F1 is?
-Are you a fan?

711
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,005
I like that.

712
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,341
-I really like the sound of the exhaust.
-Mmm.

713
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,051
It's not…

714
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,969
-It's "vroom, vroom."
-Ah.

715
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:52,056
"Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom!"

716
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:56,852
-You know how they do this, right?
-Why do you keep making sounds?

717
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,438
-I've always wanted to ride one.
-You have one?

718
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,649
No, I don't. I can't ride motorcycles.

719
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,943
-No?
-I just drive. I have a car.

720
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,321
-I'll give you a ride sometime.
-Give me a ride.

721
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,075
-It's nice to get to know you.
-Yeah.

722
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,910
To get to know each other.

723
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,079
Cheers.

724
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,748
Jinx!

725
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,053
What was the most fun moment you had here?

726
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:35,516
-Or a memorable moment.
-A memorable moment?

727
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,851
Yeah, since coming here.

728
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,523
-Right now.
-Mmm.

729
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,913
-She meant it.
-My heart fluttered.

730
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,499
This date was strong.

731
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,252
-It was short, but--
-She said, "Right now."

732
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,628
This had a strong impact.

733
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,298
Jin-young's heart skipped a beat just now.
In that moment.

734
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,176
-You felt it, right?
-Since it's only the two of them,

735
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:13,137
Nadine's focused tone
and her facial expressions

736
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,390
are completely different
from when she's in Inferno.

737
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,850
She's so charming.

738
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,436
I think all of Nadine's charms
are on display.

739
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,896
-Exactly.
-That's right.

740
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,316
-I couldn't stop myself from smiling.
-She's really lovely.

741
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,859
-Yeah.
-She's so charming.

742
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,402
-And pure.
-Yeah.

743
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,780
There aren't a lot of women
interested in things like that.

744
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:32,990
-So…
-That's true.

745
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,409
-…he must find her very attractive now.
-Right.

746
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,621
When he says he rides motorcycles,
"Huh, motorcycles?"

747
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,040
That's the usual reaction
because it seems dangerous.

748
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:44,502
And that would be the end
of the conversation, but here it goes on.

749
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,587
She even liked his exhaust sounds.

750
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,215
Besides school, she's also
very interested in different fields.

751
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,716
They all happen to be in the field

752
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,593
-Jin-young is connected to.
-Yeah.

753
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,179
-Right.
-They suit each other well.

754
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:58,307
PARADISE
JONG-WOO AND SEUL-KI

755
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,642
These look so good.

756
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,686
There are two forks per person.

757
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,897
-Use this one.
-Okay.

758
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,275
I've never seen a steak this thick before.

759
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,111
This looks really good.

760
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,281
Does it need sauce?

761
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,785
Smell it first.

762
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,996
-What does it smell like?
-Steak sauce.

763
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,997
Okay.

764
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,251
Mmm!

765
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,419
Does it melt in your mouth?

766
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,213
Your turn.

767
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,721
-Mmm!
-It's really good, right?

768
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,058
So this is why people don't eat…

769
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,519
…a lot of food in Inferno.

770
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,480
It's really good.

771
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,775
I'm really happy.

772
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:56,824
This is the most delicious
of all the food I've had here.

773
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,576
What did you have here last time?

774
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,286
-I don't even remember.
-Okay.

775
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,747
-Remember everything you ate today.
-Totally.

776
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,876
-Do you eat shrimp?
-Yeah.

777
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:09,920
Thanks.

778
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,424
-How about mushrooms?
-Yeah, I like mushrooms.

779
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:17,803
-Thanks.
-This and this guy.

780
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,597
Mmm.

781
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,141
Try the lamb chop before it gets cold.

782
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,520
You can stop now.

783
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,856
-Too full?
-You have another one.

784
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,567
I don't need anything.

785
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:35,195
Just being here
with you is great.

786
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,990
It feels like I'm dreaming right now

787
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,076
because what I've been dreaming of
is becoming reality here.

788
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,294
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

789
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,172
What on earth do you do?

790
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,842
-My job?
-We don't know anything right now.

791
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,553
It's your first time with me.

792
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,765
Do you have a guess?
What do you think I am?

793
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,143
Model, actor, K-pop idol?

794
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,812
I'll give you a hint.

795
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,564
One hint.

796
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,150
It's very close to us right now.

797
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,112
It's what we had. It's very close.

798
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,240
I don't know.

799
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:22,826
I have no idea.

800
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,703
Mmm…

801
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:26,580
It's this.

802
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,000
-Coffee?
-Yeah, a café.

803
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,795
With my parents.

804
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,548
-My family is…
-Ooh.

805
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,550
We run a business together.

806
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,677
Hmm.

807
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,513
Where is it?

808
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,516
-Gangwon-do.
-Gangwon-do?

809
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,267
Yeah, it's in Gangwon-do.

810
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,020
I've been to a ton of cafés in Gangwon-do.

811
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,606
-Really? Recently?
-Yeah.

812
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,025
-I might know it if I hear it.
-Yeah?

813
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,694
It's called Super Sweet Corn Coffee.

814
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,738
It's called Super Sweet Corn Coffee.

815
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,157
I know that place!

816
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,034
-You do? How do you know?
-Yeah.

817
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:08,539
-That is--
-Wow, I've seen you on Insta.

818
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:10,958
-Me?
-Yeah.

819
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,501
-Really?
-Yeah.

820
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:15,462
I wanted to drink
super sweet corn coffee so bad.

821
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,340
So I looked it up,
and that's the first place that popped up.

822
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,258
Really?

823
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,386
I'm a barista.

824
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,931
And I am running a café

825
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:29,059
that is famous for super sweet corn coffee
with my family.

826
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,853
SUPER SWEET CORN COFFEE
SOLD OUT

827
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,479
Isn't that place famous?

828
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,232
-Barista. That's cool.
-I know.

829
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:39,445
As a barista,
I take pride in how my coffee tastes.

830
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,906
To get the very best coffee,

831
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,826
I usually make the cream
first thing in the morning.

832
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:50,456
And by controlling the coffee grinder
and setting the coffee machine.

833
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:54,084
I always try to
make my customers the best coffee.

834
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,299
CHOI JONG-WOO
BARISTA

835
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,927
Then you can guess my age, right?
To a certain degree.

836
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,345
Twenty-eight?

837
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,805
-Twenty-eight?
-Yeah.

838
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,183
I want to hear yours first.

839
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,143
Tell me your age.

840
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,395
I'm 25.

841
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,938
-Really?
-Yeah.

842
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,608
-Wow, really?
-Yeah. Why?

843
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,485
-Hmm.
-Are you 25 too?

844
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,198
I'm 25 years old too.

845
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,450
We're friends.

846
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,578
No wonder I felt comfortable
going, "Jong-woo."

847
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:30,787
Really?

848
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,916
I thought you were older than me.
The way you talk is very…

849
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,375
What?

850
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:40,756
-You're really 25?
-Yeah, I was born in 1998. 98-03-03.

851
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:47,429
Oh, that's amazing. This is fun, '98.

852
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:52,100
Then, Seul-ki, you look like

853
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,937
you could be an idol trainee.

854
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,233
-Want me to tell you?
-Yeah.

855
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,068
I'm studying the piano.

856
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,071
-The piano?
-Yeah, I'm a piano major.

857
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,323
Oh, so that's why
you don't have your nails done?

858
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,451
Yeah. I've never had
long nails in my life.

859
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,829
-Can I see your palms?
-My hands are really small.

860
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,999
The tips of your fingers have to be tough.

861
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,668
Really.

862
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,295
-They're very tough.
-Yeah.

863
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,631
Whoa! They're kind of like paws.

864
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,093
That feeling? Like puppies.

865
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,637
-Ah.
-You know what I mean? Puppy paws.

866
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,930
It feels like that.

867
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,142
Not soft.

868
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,604
Are they like that because you play a lot,
or are they naturally like that?

869
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,856
Not sure, but if you look,
it's all calluses.

870
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,652
If you've played the piano
to the point where you have calluses,

871
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:48,198
you must have reached
a level that's really hard to achieve.

872
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:50,617
I imagine.

873
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,953
There were lots of times
I failed, too, but--

874
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,788
-You didn't give up.
-No.

875
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:57,332
Wow. There's a lot to learn from you.

876
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,252
I used to be an athlete myself.

877
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,338
-What sport?
-I was a soccer player.

878
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,799
-For about ten years.
-That's amazing.

879
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:07,050
And as a soccer player,

880
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:10,929
I was so close to joining
a professional soccer club.

881
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:16,351
I should've stayed mentally strong
until the very end.

882
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,730
I still have some regrets about quitting.

883
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:23,108
-Hmm.
-I've realized that recently.

884
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:28,447
But having chosen another path,
I'm not going to give up anymore.

885
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:33,327
Rather than seeing it as giving up,

886
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,538
maybe see it as
just a different new challenge.

887
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,206
Good point.

888
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,126
So are you graduating now?

889
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,587
-Yeah, I'm a senior now.
-You're a senior?

890
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,173
I have my
graduation performance next year.

891
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,424
You should come watch.

892
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,927
-Can I go?
-To my graduation, yeah.

893
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,639
Then I'll bring two cups
of super sweet corn coffee with me.

894
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,141
Well, your friends will be there,

895
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,226
-so they can take them to go.
-A real coffee truck?

896
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,145
-Do you want that?
-I do want it.

897
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,105
You want that? Okay. I promise.

898
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,523
-So, the cream--
-This is so nice.

899
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,816
…should be enough.

900
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,487
-I'll do it for you.
-Thank you for just saying that.

901
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,994
This feels amazing
and fun all of a sudden.

902
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,956
-First, our ages--
-I'm talking so much.

903
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,335
I think this is the first time
I've talked this much.

904
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,420
With me? Oh, you?

905
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:26,797
-Yeah.
-Right.

906
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,801
It takes a place like this
to share these things.

907
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:31,718
I know.

908
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,553
I was dying to tell you
when we were there.

909
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,972
I know. You seemed like
you wanted to tell me so much.

910
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,768
I've had too many
of these thoughts about being there.

911
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:44,064
You must have really wanted to win today.

912
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,945
♪ Take in all the views
And breathe the air… ♪

913
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,447
Did you get this scrape in the game?

914
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,659
-Yeah, but that one's fine.
-Did you get hurt in other places?

915
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,536
-I got hurt a lot.
-You got hurt a lot?

916
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,454
My knees and shoulders were scraped.

917
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:03,375
But I played with the mentality
that "to lose is to die," to be honest.

918
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,962
You cried that one time, Seul-ki.

919
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,505
Seeing that…

920
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,050
made me more determined.

921
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,762
If I had come in third place…

922
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,726
and then if Jin-young had picked you,

923
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,271
I think I really
would have cried in Inferno.

924
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,314
That's how much it mattered to me.

925
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,985
You expressed a lot to me too, Seul-ki.

926
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,904
Yeah. The compliments?

927
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,617
Yeah, the compliments you gave me
and… well, the little things.

928
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:41,204
Like last night when you asked me
to take the Polaroids with you.

929
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,206
When you wanted just the two of us.

930
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,833
Let's take one together.

931
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,334
How do we do this?

932
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,462
One, two, three.

933
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,549
-Oh, you two look good.
-You two look nice.

934
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,177
That was so nice.

935
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,764
-I brought this.
-Oh. Is it the Polaroid?

936
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,682
-To take pictures together.
-We should take some.

937
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:04,853
What? Did he take the shared camera?
He did.

938
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,107
-Shall we take one here first?
-Okay.

939
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,694
One, two, three.

940
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,036
-What? What's wrong with this?
-It's not coming out?

941
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,705
Huh?

942
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,124
-Maybe there's no film inside.
-There must be.

943
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,585
-Open it.
-No way.

944
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,630
Oh, well, there's no film in it.

945
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:37,469
Oh, no.

946
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,597
That's Jong-woo's charm.
That's just so him.

947
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,141
-That awkwardness.
-Yeah.

948
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,060
-And he's young.
-And he's young.

949
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:50,273
-I should've thought of that.
-Don't worry, let's enjoy this moment.

950
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:54,319
-We can take pictures with our eyes.
-Yeah, we can remember it ourselves.

951
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,822
Right. Swimming, there's a lot to do.

952
00:51:58,573 --> 00:51:59,699
Do you wanna go swimming?

953
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,117
-Go swimming first?
-Yeah.

954
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,037
-Let's change into our swimsuits.
-Get changed and… Okay.

955
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,915
-Seul-ki doesn't like drinking alcohol.
-No.

956
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,377
That's why she likes coffee,
going to cute cafés, and taking pictures.

957
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:16,007
"And the owner of the famous café
that I wanted to go to… is you?"

958
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,425
-That's so amazing.
-Right.

959
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,845
-There are so many cafés in Gangwon-do.
-I know.

960
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,055
-So I think that…
-This is so amazing.

961
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:25,433
…maybe her feelings
could have grown compared to before.

962
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,977
-I think so too.
-Yes.

963
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,063
And another thing is,
it felt like Seul-ki was leading a lot

964
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:33,233
compared to how she was
with the others in Paradise.

965
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,985
Yeah. I felt that too.

966
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,696
It kind of felt like
she was catering to Jong-woo.

967
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,241
-Yeah.
-So I saw that as a positive thing.

968
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,494
I'm actually a little anxious
about that because

969
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:48,540
it felt like Seul-ki wasn't
necessarily excited with him,

970
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,792
enjoying things with him,
and being happy with him.

971
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:55,297
Rather, she was like, "I have to
really cater to him," toward Jong-woo.

972
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,216
"I should really
make Jong-woo happy today."

973
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,677
I kind of felt this determination.

974
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,972
She could've started that way,
but now as she talks with him,

975
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,265
her feelings are like--

976
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,559
-Becoming relaxed?
-Yeah, I think they are.

977
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:11,605
And as I watch them, Jong-woo
is expressing his feelings to the fullest,

978
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,733
but honestly I don't think
Seul-ki has an answer for that.

979
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,611
It's like she wants to return
the favor of his feelings towards her.

980
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,487
-Because she's thankful?
-Yeah.

981
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,114
That's what I'm worried about.

982
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:25,410
But at the end of the day,
women eventually go for men like Jong-woo.

983
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:28,747
I think a woman like Seul-ki
could choose a man like Jong-woo.

984
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,957
-Hmm.
-Eventually.

985
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,959
We'll have to watch and see.

986
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,920
What I'm curious about here is,

987
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,131
can a woman's feelings
really be turned around

988
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:41,635
by, like, a man expressing
his pure feelings like that?

989
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,136
-Of course.
-Is that enough?

990
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,680
-Of course.
-It depends on the person.

991
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:50,060
Some people's feelings change,
but then some people don't change at all.

992
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,188
-It really depends on the person.
-Right.

993
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:56,066
PARADISE
JIN-YOUNG AND NADINE

994
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,610
-In the game today…
-Mmm.

995
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,697
…there was first, second, and third place.

996
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,366
-Yeah.
-Right?

997
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:07,118
You were third place,
so you didn't get to choose,

998
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:11,539
someone else had taken the one you
really wanted to come here with, right?

999
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,874
Mmm…

1000
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,586
But the one…

1001
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,465
You can be honest. It's okay.

1002
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,426
There were two people.

1003
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,388
There were two and one was you, Nadine.

1004
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:29,432
-Hmm.
-And there was other one, but…

1005
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:34,479
I really wanted to talk to you here.

1006
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,274
-I was so curious about what you do.
-Hmm.

1007
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,735
-I can only ask you that here.
-Hmm.

1008
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,948
-I really wanted to find out about that.
-Mmm.

1009
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,367
So I had to come here with you.

1010
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,205
As for the other person I had in mind…

1011
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:54,582
Mmm.

1012
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,502
I was hoping no one
would choose her to come.

1013
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:01,214
So she would have stayed there,
and then if I had a choice,

1014
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:04,676
I would either
come here with you or with her.

1015
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,052
Hmm.

1016
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,888
So I don't think I was
conflicted or anything like that.

1017
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,725
Once she was chosen and left,
I chose you right away.

1018
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,767
Hmm.

1019
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,481
-I don't think she liked that answer.
-No.

1020
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,526
-She asked, so he had to answer.
-And he had to be honest.

1021
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,445
-Jin-young is honest.
-He's very honest.

1022
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,033
But will you be able to balance…

1023
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,953
school and a relationship?

1024
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:37,667
Well, I… go all-in
when I'm in a relationship.

1025
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,627
-Really?
-Yeah.

1026
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,756
I think that's why it's harder for me.

1027
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,675
Like, I'm not an emotional person
like that by nature,

1028
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,636
but I get that way
when I'm in a relationship.

1029
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:52,057
Which is why I haven't been dating.

1030
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,976
-You have this fixed dream, Nadine.
-Yeah.

1031
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:56,936
That could…

1032
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:02,859
…become a source
of stress in terms of a relationship

1033
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,611
-was what I thought earlier…
-Mmm.

1034
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,237
…as we were talking.

1035
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,572
It's all planned out,

1036
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:10,366
-and you have specific steps to take.
-Mmm.

1037
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,244
-The path you want to take is so clear.
-Mmm.

1038
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,665
But I believe in it
and I want to meet someone

1039
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,751
who can support that.

1040
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:21,586
Mmm.

1041
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,423
Of course, we might have
less time to spend together,

1042
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,593
but I think it's even more meaningful

1043
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,097
when we spend time together like this.

1044
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,275
Why are you suddenly so quiet?

1045
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,944
-Huh?
-You're so quiet suddenly.

1046
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,362
I was just thinking.

1047
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:08,800
I think I'm seeing parts of myself that
I didn't know about when I first got here.

1048
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:13,304
For example, my ideal type
I always used to go for.

1049
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:16,141
-Mmm.
-Here, I'm drawn to people…

1050
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:21,187
-who are different from that.
-Mmm.

1051
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,439
This is new for me.

1052
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,402
-You learn a lot about yourself here.
-Yeah.

1053
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,698
-I think I did.
-Hmm.

1054
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,455
Doesn't Jin-young
seem like he's conflicted?

1055
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,665
And Nadine is studying him right now.

1056
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:44,878
I feel like they've encountered
a realistic problem in a way.

1057
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,256
To see this in a positive light,

1058
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,884
Jin-young is already
at the stage where he's like,

1059
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,803
"What would it be like
to be in a relationship with Nadine?"

1060
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,514
-Mmm.
-The fact that he's worried about this

1061
00:57:56,598 --> 00:58:00,268
has me thinking that,
"Oh, his heart is open to Nadine too."

1062
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,188
You think he's able to think that way

1063
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,564
-'cause his heart is open?
-Yes.

1064
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,567
But him saying that he's seeing parts
of himself he didn't know about…

1065
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,235
-There's something about that.
-Right.

1066
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:13,781
It's him saying, "Nadine, you're still
a bit in my head." That's how I took it.

1067
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:17,619
"Who am I to be thinking about
flying to Boston for the person I love?"

1068
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:18,912
-"Who am I?"
-Yeah.

1069
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,956
"I was interested in you from the
beginning and you weren't my ideal type,

1070
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,626
but still I think I'm changing
because I'm interested."

1071
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,921
"I think I'm changing since coming here,"
I think that's why he said that.

1072
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,047
Mmm.

1073
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:33,176
If nothing happens with Seul-ki
when they go back to Inferno…

1074
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,845
-Right.
-…then, yes, I think this could work out.

1075
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,263
It's so interesting.

1076
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,974
Something tells me
as soon as they arrive in Inferno,

1077
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,519
Seul-ki and Jin-young will go off to talk,

1078
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,939
and Nadine and Jong-woo
will be left watching them again.

1079
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,440
Yeah.

1080
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,401
PARADISE
JONG-WOO AND SEUL-KI

1081
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,197
-Wow.
-Wow.

1082
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,574
It's not really cold though.

1083
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:00,245
-Should I check the temperature?
-Yeah.

1084
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,789
There's steam, so it's warm.

1085
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:05,833
It stings a little.

1086
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,378
Your scratches. Are you okay?

1087
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,130
It's fine. I'll overcome it.

1088
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,883
Like I overcame today.

1089
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,681
The night view here is amazing.

1090
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,599
-I can see the lights.
-Yeah.

1091
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,187
-What's that? Is that the moon?
-Yeah, it's the moon.

1092
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,065
That's really pretty.

1093
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:34,487
-It came out just for us to see.
-Yeah, again.

1094
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,199
Tonight, the moon is pretty.

1095
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,286
Like everything.

1096
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,830
Everything is pretty.

1097
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:48,209
-Don't say that.
-Why not? Are you feeling shy?

1098
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,841
This is fun. But I really didn't expect

1099
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,053
that coming here
would bring my emotions up like this.

1100
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,931
Me too. I really didn't

1101
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,730
ever imagine that I'd come here
and I'd falter and waver.

1102
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:12,233
This has been a time when, for me,

1103
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,486
I could see
a completely different side of me.

1104
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,949
I have a question.

1105
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:25,288
It's our seventh, eighth day
since we came here now.

1106
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,543
We've experienced a lot during that time.

1107
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,422
Now that we're nearing the end,

1108
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:39,344
have you come to a decision
about your feelings?

1109
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:42,597
-I was curious about that.
-Oh…

1110
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,444
To be honest,
I thought that I had decided.

1111
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,237
Hmm.

1112
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,240
But…

1113
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,331
-I'm not sure.
-All right.

1114
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,000
All right then. I won't pressure you.

1115
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,169
I'm just…

1116
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,340
very…

1117
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:20,968
Well…

1118
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,763
How should I put this?

1119
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:33,773
Since you're someone
I've been so interested in…

1120
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,779
…I'm prepping myself to not be too hurt

1121
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:43,825
by whatever choice you finally make.

1122
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,041
Aww.

1123
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,459
Gosh.

1124
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,380
So emotional.

1125
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:04,512
But… Mmm…

1126
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,684
How should I put this?

1127
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,479
People all think differently.

1128
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,406
Since I came here, I've just always

1129
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,201
been thinking about the same thing.

1130
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,456
That I should do
what my heart tells me to do,

1131
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,500
-and do my best to follow my heart.
-Hmm.

1132
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,545
And I'm still doing that.

1133
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,716
-So, Jong-woo…
-Yes?

1134
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:44,719
…you should do what your heart
tells you to do too, and…

1135
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,514
let's both do our best.

1136
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,310
Us two kids born in 1998.

1137
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:55,229
-We're also born in the Year of the Tiger.
-I know.

1138
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:18,961
It's so sad because she's the person who
made him feel this emotion called love.

1139
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:23,633
He must want to express it so much,
and he must have very strong feelings,

1140
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:26,469
but he also knows
that she feels pressured by that.

1141
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:30,640
So he's controlling himself
and… holding it in,

1142
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,226
and he's trying to give up.
And I can see all that.

1143
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:34,977
I feel so bad for him.

1144
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,104
It's like we're watching
someone really in love.

1145
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:40,775
When we have a crush on someone,
we all find ourselves acting like that.

1146
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,694
We always feel small when we're with them.

1147
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:44,946
Right.

1148
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:48,032
Seul-ki seems like
she's doing her best like she said.

1149
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,284
Right.

1150
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,370
But Seul-ki…

1151
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:56,582
The feeling of love isn't something
that you need to do your best for

1152
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,418
and it's just something
you can't hide having, like a cold.

1153
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,129
But Seul-ki is just
doing her best right now.

1154
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:05,341
-That's what I think.
-You're so right.

1155
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,510
Oh, my heart.

1156
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,054
INFERNO

1157
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,143
What are you doing outside?

1158
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,896
-Where's your jacket? It's cold.
-We have to talk.

1159
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,316
Go on ahead.
I'll bring you a jacket.

1160
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,568
Okay.

1161
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,368
Here, put this on.

1162
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:35,288
-Wear it like this?
-Like this. This should be a bit warmer.

1163
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:37,248
This is big, so…

1164
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,626
It's really cold.

1165
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:45,965
-Today…
-Hmm?

1166
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:49,510
I felt like I was avoiding talking about…

1167
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,598
about how I didn't go
to Paradise with you, oppa.

1168
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,643
When I win first place.

1169
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,063
So I wanted to talk to you.

1170
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,609
Thanks, but I really
don't care about that.

1171
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,527
-No?
-No.

1172
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:08,529
Because if you'd picked me this time,

1173
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:12,033
psychologically, it could seem like

1174
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,202
a give-and-take situation
since I picked you.

1175
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:18,205
So I was actually
rather happy that you didn't,

1176
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,957
and that you picked someone else.

1177
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:21,626
Really?

1178
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:25,212
Yeah. I just want you
not to care about what others think,

1179
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:29,175
and really do what you want to do here.

1180
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:32,428
Do what your heart tells you to do.

1181
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,096
It's like, here,

1182
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:38,392
I just kept thinking that,
"If it's good, then it's good."

1183
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,604
I kept trying to not get hurt.

1184
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,441
Tried to make the decision
that's best for everyone,

1185
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:48,361
and doing that
kept making things hard for me.

1186
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:56,869
So I started thinking
I would just not think of other people,

1187
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:02,917
and just really do what I want,
but I couldn't seem to make that work.

1188
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:05,419
So it's frustrating.

1189
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:07,797
I understand.

1190
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:13,469
But, like, right then is… when you, oppa,

1191
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:16,472
took me with you, so…

1192
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,684
How should I put this? I was thank--

1193
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,520
You told me not to say thank you,
but I was thankful.

1194
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:27,358
-I told you not to say thank you?
-You told me not to say thank you.

1195
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:37,159
It's just that, before I chose you,

1196
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,079
when we briefly talked,

1197
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:42,790
I kept thinking about you.

1198
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:44,333
-Yeah?
-For me…

1199
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:51,424
it felt like you looked very bubbly,
but… you were having a hard time then.

1200
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:55,845
I didn't know what, but it felt like
you were having a bit of a hard time.

1201
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:57,638
I could feel it, to be honest.

1202
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:00,599
So, you were on my mind a lot and

1203
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:04,020
I guess I wanted to go there with you

1204
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:08,149
and help you relax in a comfortable place.

1205
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:10,651
Really.

1206
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:17,283
You going through a hard time
is something that's natural in a way.

1207
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:20,119
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1208
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,915
-Okay.
-I'm concerned.

1209
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,836
Thank you. I can tell you are.

1210
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,089
I don't know. It's just…

1211
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,508
-I'm just here, right?
-Yeah.

1212
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,427
Having you in my sight here
gives me comfort.

1213
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:40,181
Oh, my!

1214
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,141
"Having you in my sight here
gives me comfort."

1215
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:43,225
-Oh, Se-jun!
-That's nice.

1216
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,894
Is he Daddy-Long-Legs, or what?

1217
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:48,397
Having you in my sight here
gives me comfort.

1218
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,776
I feel comfort

1219
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:54,028
-when I just have you within my sight.
-Mmm.

1220
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,284
You're on my mind.

1221
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:04,747
Hmm.

1222
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:11,378
-So-e really has had a hard time.
-Right.

1223
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:13,422
And before when
So-e made her second choice,

1224
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,800
she chose someone else for Paradise.

1225
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:18,552
When she did, I remember
Se-jun saying he doesn't care

1226
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,596
and that he wants her
to choose someone else,

1227
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:23,265
-he just wants So-e to be happy.
-Hmm.

1228
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:26,352
I thought maybe Se-jun said that
because he doesn't have feelings,

1229
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,020
but it wasn't that.

1230
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,106
He's been going after her this whole time

1231
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:32,358
because he actually
does have feelings for So-e.

1232
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:34,860
Now that I think about it,
maybe that's Se-jun's style.

1233
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:37,696
But then So-e also
seems to have been bothered by it.

1234
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,990
-Right.
-About how she took someone else.

1235
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:42,618
I think So-e really healed a bit,
thanks to Se-jun.

1236
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:43,702
Yeah.

1237
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,789
PARADISE
YOONG-JAE AND SEO-EUN

1238
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:47,748
Cheers.

-I love melons.

1245
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:03,305
I like fruits.

1246
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,349
Pretty people tend to like fruits.

1247
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:08,227
I really like them.

1248
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:11,147
-Really pretty people.
-I seriously like them.

1249
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,232
Really pretty people really like fruits.

1250
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,484
Do you like them?

1251
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,528
-I like them a lot.
-Then you're pretty.

1252
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,994
There are so many
delicious things in this world.

1253
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:27,913
When we get out of here,
we should have sashimi and soju.

1254
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,290
Yes, we should.

1255
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,293
What? So do I go to Yeouido?

1256
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,171
-You're welcome whenever. Really.
-Mmm!

1257
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:37,798
I don't know anything about Yeouido.

1258
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:39,842
I know so many places.

1259
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,678
Then I should stick with someone
who knows many places

1260
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:44,680
-and get to know Yeouido.
-Of course.

1261
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,976
-I'll teach you everything.
-It's an island like Inferno.

1262
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:54,023
This is fun.

1263
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:55,941
Yeah, this is very fun.

1264
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,364
Alcohol tastes good today.

1265
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:10,915
That's really good.

1266
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:13,209
I haven't had this
cold sweetness in a while.

1267
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,169
This is great.

1268
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,923
-It's good, right?
-Mmm.

1269
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,759
It's good because you fed it to me.

1270
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:24,845
You made me want to feed it to you
because you won't eat it yourself.

1271
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:27,932
Do you know why I didn't eat?

1272
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:30,893
Because you feed it to me. I was waiting.

1273
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:33,562
This can't become a habit.

1274
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:43,447
Oh, my gosh.

1275
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,450
The lovey-dovey behavior
of early relationships.

1276
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:48,994
It's really not funny at all
and they're laughing.

1277
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,081
-They lock eyes and--
-A time when everything is good for them.

1278
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:54,833
Yeah, it's so good.
Things must feel great.

1279
01:10:58,295 --> 01:11:01,090
I think you're someone
I'm very curious about.

1280
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:04,218
You're someone I want to get to know.

1281
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:09,139
"I wonder what she thinks about this.
I wonder what she thinks about that."

1282
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,268
"I wonder what she thinks about usually."

1283
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,521
I think you're someone I'm curious about.

1289

I'm not going to
wash my hands from now on.

1290
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,849
I'm only going to wash my right hand.

1291
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,436
Should I not wash this either?

1292
01:11:58,355 --> 01:11:59,732
These two love birds…

1293
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,359
-Gosh, they're too sweet.
-Yes.

1294
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,114
I'll call for a roll-out bed
while you get ready to sleep.

1295
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:10,784
Yeah. No, wait. Uh…

1296
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,662
Anyway, here the…

1297
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:19,918
Wait, let's think about it.

1298
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,170
-Okay.
-Okay.

1299
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,050
I have to go wash up before I sleep.
Just a second.

1300
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,720
Let me lay down for just a second.

1301
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:34,224
I'll think about how to wash up
before I go wash up.

1302
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:35,601
Oh, my God.

1303
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,354
Oh, my God.

1304
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:55,913
Seo-eun.

1305
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:01,293
Seo-eun.

1306
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:08,342
You're still not waking up.
What are you going to do?

1307
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:09,802
Huh?

1308
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,012
I'm not easy.

1309
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,062
Hmm.

1310
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:44,420
-Wake me up in five minutes.
-Okay.

1311
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,176
Am I seeing things,
or is the sun coming up?

1312
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,679
It's up a little.

1313
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:56,765
What time is it? 5:00?

1314
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,517
It's around 4:00 or 5:00.

1315
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,186
-What?
-Did they stay up all night?

1316
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,772
-How long were they up?
-They kept talking until sunrise?

1317
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,023
That's great.

1318
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,525
Must've have been so good.

1319
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,827
-It's amazing.
-What is?

1320
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,912
This is all amazing.

1321
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,249
-It's fun.
-It's fun?

1322
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,085
It's fun and amazing and good.

1323
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,258
Thank you for coming today.

1324
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:32,342
Today…

1325
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:35,888
Thank you for saying, "Come out."

1326
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:47,941
There is no gap between them
for someone to squeeze through anymore.

1327
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:49,902
It's exciting.

1328
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:52,029
From the time these two left Inferno,

1329
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:54,531
to the time
they're going to sleep in Paradise,

1330
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:57,326
-they've been together for about 12 hours.
-Right.

1331
01:14:57,409 --> 01:14:59,244
-They don't want to sleep.
-Oh, my gosh.

1332
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,497
They don't wanna waste
a second or a minute.

1333
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:04,333
I thought it must be around evening,
they stayed up all night.

1334
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:05,667
No wonder they're sleepy.

1335
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:08,128
My heart fluttered watching them.
You know that feeling

1336
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:09,630
at the beginning of a relationship

1337
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:12,799
where people who really
love each other don't know what to do?

1338
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:16,261
I think rather than
laying down together in one bed,

1339
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,972
laying down a bit apart
but facing each other

1340
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:21,266
-is way more romantic.
-Right.

1341
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:24,811
FINAL DECISION

1342
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,026
It's Inferno.

1343
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,614
-Be careful.
-Yeah. Go slow.

1344
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,867
-This is familiar.
-This is familiar.

1345
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,536
This is really familiar.

1346
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,580
-I wonder what everyone is doing.
-I know.

1347
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,415
They ask so many questions
when we get back.

1348
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:47,668
-Right?
-"What'd you do? How was it?"

1349
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:49,127
-Yeah.
-"Was it nice?"

1350
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,380
-"Did you change your mind?"
-"Did something change?"

1351
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:54,716
I can't believe
it's the last night already.

1352
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:58,595
-We're here.
-We're back.

1353
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,141
You're here!

1354
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,726
-Hi!
-Hi!

1355
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:07,396
-Hello.
-Did you have fun?

1356
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:10,190
You both look like you did.

1357
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:12,568
Hi.

1358
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:14,069
-Hi.
-Hi.

1359
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:15,821
Wow!

1360
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,364
-Did you have fun?
-Hi!

1361
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:21,577
Our main character.

1362
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,453
-Hey!
-How was it?

1363
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:25,539
I don't really remember.
I was too nervous.

1364
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:28,500
-You were nervous there?
-I was so excited.

1365
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,877
You must have
prepared yourself all this time.

1366
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:31,878
Yeah.

1367
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:36,258
-It was a dream come true, it wasn't easy.
-I'm sure you did great.

1368
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,760
You look good, Seul-ki.

1369
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:42,848
You know how we're able to know
jobs, ages, and everything?

1370
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:44,683
Yeah.

1371
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:47,477
So I feel more comfortable
with Jong-woo now.

1372
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,813
I'm curious about his job.
You're the only one who knows.

1373
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:51,440
Yeah, only you know.

1374
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:54,735
That's true, but what gave me chills
was that I already knew him.

1375
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:56,903
-Because--
-You met him?

1376
01:16:56,987 --> 01:17:00,282
-I saw Jong-woo once before.
-You saw him? Is he a YouTuber?

1377
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:03,076
-Now I'm curious.
-It was really amazing yesterday.

1378
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:06,455
-I've gotten closer to Jong-woo.
-That's a relief.

1379
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:09,499
-Well, it was nice.
-It was just nice?

1380
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,881
Jong-woo didn't say anything,
but he smiled right away.

1381
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:17,341
It was, for me.

1382
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:20,177
As soon as it was brought up,
Jong-woo was all smiles.

1383
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:22,763
My cheekbones wouldn't come down
when we first went inside.

1384
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:25,849
We talked a lot,

1385
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:29,269
and once we revealed our jobs and ages,
we both were surprised.

1386
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:30,312
Both of you?

1387
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:33,273
I certainly was.
I hadn't expected that of her.

1388
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:36,443
But I think it suits her really well,
when I think about it.

1389
01:17:37,944 --> 01:17:40,864
How was it for you?
How'd you feel when you learned that?

1390
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:43,200
-I was shocked, honestly.
-Hmm.

1391
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:45,827
It was something I didn't expect.

1392
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:48,038
What about you, Nadine?

1393
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:50,415
-Nadine.
-It was fun. It was really fun.

1394
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:54,252
We had a certain experience
in common, it turned out.

1395
01:17:55,962 --> 01:17:57,005
Something similar.

1396
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,467
-Min-su would know what it is.
-Mmm.

1397
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,261
But I did all that too.

1398
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:07,015
So there really was a lot
for the two of us to talk about.

1399
01:18:07,891 --> 01:18:11,311
The conversation wouldn't have stopped.
Their energy was really good.

1400
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,480
This one's
basically on her honeymoon.

1401
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:15,524
I know. She's back from her honeymoon.

1402
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:18,902
When they leave, they'll get
a marriage licence. Right away, huh?

1403
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:21,113
What are you talking about?

1404
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:24,616
-She only got an hour of sleep.
-No, two and a half hours.

1405
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,119
-You talked all night?
-Honeymoon?

1406
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,622
There's a rumor
you got an hour of sleep.

1407
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:31,790
-Me?
-Yes.

1408
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,917
-I heard you barely slept.
-Really?

1409
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,504
-What on earth happened?
-No. We did sleep.

1410
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:40,340
-How long did you sleep?
-About an hour?

1411
01:18:42,759 --> 01:18:45,345
-You talked all night? Wow.
-Yeah, basically.

1412
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:47,806
-Talked for so long.
-Amazing you had the energy.

1413
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:51,226
We got there, and you know,
this was our second time going.

1414
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:53,895
We got the same room
as the first time we went.

1415
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:54,896
Ah.

1416
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,941
So at the beginning and the end,
we were in the same place,

1417
01:18:58,024 --> 01:19:00,527
but the way we felt was a bit different.

1418
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:03,071
It was very meaningful.

1419
01:19:07,617 --> 01:19:09,202
We'll be there after we put our bags away.

1420
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:11,079
Take our luggage
back to the dressing.

1421
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,038
Right.

1422
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:14,958
I hate free time the most now.

1423
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:20,589
-Why? Don't you want to talk to Jin-young?
-I do, but I'm also scared.

1424
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:22,883
-Huh?
-It's scary.

1425
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:27,345
-I think I probably still will, but…
-It's okay.

1426
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:28,847
…calling on him scares me.

1427
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,017
I'm worried he'll set boundaries with me…

1428
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,894
Because he decided
on his feelings before that?

1429
01:19:33,977 --> 01:19:34,811
…if we talk.

1430
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:38,190
Jin-young
wouldn't do that.

1431
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:40,066
-No?
-You went to Paradise together twice,

1432
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,735
so you must be close.

1433
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:51,620
The hottest inferno
in the world, Single's Inferno.

1434
01:19:51,703 --> 01:19:57,083
Today is the last day of free dates
before the final decision tomorrow.

1435
01:19:58,543 --> 01:20:02,547
Please enjoy the dates
until the end without any regrets.

1436
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:05,425
Excuse me.

1437
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:07,511
I'll get going.

1438
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:08,929
Go tell her.
