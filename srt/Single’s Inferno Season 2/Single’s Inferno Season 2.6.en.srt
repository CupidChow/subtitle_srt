SINGLE'S INFERNO

11
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,423
The weather's so nice today.

12
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,343
Seo-eun, why are you making me jealous
when I'm not the jealous type?

13
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,264
I'm kidding.

14
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:57,891
Did you have fun?

15
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,350
Yeah.

16
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,062
It's Paradise, right?

17
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,024
-Let's cross over here.
-And go to the beach like this?

18
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,028
-It's nice they gave us some free time.
-Yeah.

19
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,323
-I was the first one to come outside.
-Yeah.

20
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,284
But even if you hadn't come to me,
I might've gone to you to talk.

21
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,620
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

22
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,121
I mean, I would have.

23
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,958
CHOCOLATE CAFÉ

24
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,418
Shall we sit here?

25
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,227
I went running early this morning.

26
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,145
-You did?
-Yeah.

27
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,939
See the tracks I made over there?

28
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,023
Yeah.

29
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,109
I find myself running
when I'm emotionally tired.

30
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,779
Why are you emotionally tired?

31
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,198
-It's a bit exhausting here.
-I see.

32
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,533
Yeah.

33
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,579
I was curious about that.

34
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,834
Since I went to Paradise with Han-bin,

35
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,670
you might have been in a bad mood.

36
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,467
To be honest, I wasn't in a good mood.

37
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,595
I'd be totally lying
if I said I was okay with it.

38
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,723
It's the truth
that I wasn't in a good mood.

39
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,935
If you're interested, if you're curious,

40
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,981
I think it's better to resolve
that curiosity by talking to that person.

41
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,609
It's natural to perceive
the others as competition.

42
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,239
I'm just going to keep doing
what I do best.

43
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,243
That's why I was the first one
out the door.

44
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,162
Yeah.

45
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,623
This is a different topic all of a sudden.

46
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,791
Yeah.

47
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,751
The special meal.

48
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,546
-Yeah.
-It was the prize for the men's game.

49
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,136
-Yeah.
-And I saw the tenacity in you.

50
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,223
You were really cool.

51
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:03,850
Thanks.

52
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,269
I really wanted to win.

53
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,024
So then, if you had won
the special meal date,

54
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,276
who do you think
you would have eaten with?

55
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,861
That's what's odd.

56
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,196
You'd think the date
would be with one person.

57
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,283
I really don't know
who the second person would be.

58
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,079
But the first person
I want to eat with is you.

59
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,755
That is honest.

60
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,758
That was me being very honest.

61
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:44,766
The fact is, today I just…
didn't want to weigh options.

62
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,645
When the two of us decided to talk,
when you said you'd come outside,

63
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:54,525
I just wanted to say something direct,
like, like, "Yes, I was a bit jealous."

64
00:03:56,444 --> 00:04:01,991
So then, as I was talking,
I ended up being very… honest.

65
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,121
The two of us are in some ways in the…

66
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,792
-The same--
-We're in the same boat?

67
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,919
Right.

68
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,546
This is…

69
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,423
Two people who are waiting…

70
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,136
How are you?
What kind of thoughts do you have?

71
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,846
I talked to him yesterday.

72
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:25,807
Yeah, I saw.

73
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,559
While I'm the type
to pursue one person head on,

74
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,897
he's the type to want to get to know
everyone, one by one.

75
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,651
I don't think he's doing that, though.

76
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,321
The truth is, I think
he's only going after Seo-eun.

77
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,115
-Yoong-jae?
-Yeah.

78
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,327
Because he ran out of the tent right away.

79
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,371
And went directly to her.

80
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,875
And to be honest, if he was going to talk
to different people,

81
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,670
I thought he should be
most curious about you.

82
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,134
He doesn't really seem
to be curious about me.

83
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,556
If I had a 100 hours to spend,

84
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,019
I'd like to use like 90 of it
on one person.

85
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,437
Maybe even more.

86
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,689
If I can, all of it.

87
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:18,943
What about you?

88
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:25,533
If Seo-eun is not interested in you,
what kind of choice would you make?

89
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,829
I think I'd still keep trying.

90
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,124
If I hadn't gone to Paradise,
it might have been different.

91
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,292
Yeah.

92
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,377
But I learned a lot from going there.

93
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,087
And I was always into her.

94
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:42,091
But her being interested in me at all
happened for the first time in Paradise.

95
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,263
Since that was the first time.
I think I'd try a bit more at least.

96
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,474
I think I would regret it if I don't.

97
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,019
Inferno…

98
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,230
I missed this place.

99
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,441
While I was in Paradise,

100
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,777
my body was in Paradise but my heart…

101
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,072
I left some of it behind in inferno.

102
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,827
I think you're someone
who I think of a lot.

103
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,082
When they return
from their talk,

104
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,294
what they talked about would be important.

105
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,547
Honestly, it'd be difficult
for both of us,

106
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,593
but we have to do
what our heart tells us to do.

107
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,222
But things can change in the future.

108
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,057
We don't know what will happen.

109
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:37,563
But I am… good at protecting
what's mine.

110
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,692
I've never had anything taken from me.

111
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,612
How long are they going to talk for?

112
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,239
Right.

113
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,783
It's been a long time
since they started talking.

114
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,493
It's hard.

115
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,080
My steps felt heavy
when we came here.

116
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,666
-Are they lighter now?
-Yeah.

117
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,795
I didn't think we'd be having time to go
on dates freely right away like this.

118
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,047
But I'm happy about it.

119
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,968
-What?
-They're coming this way.

120
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,011
Are they coming? Really?

121
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,019
They're getting closer.

122
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:21,149
About a 100 meters, no, 200 meters.

123
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,568
I don't know. I can't make a guess.

124
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,319
What are you going to do?

125
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,449
I'm not sure if they're coming back or
if they're moving someplace else to talk.

126
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,034
It looks like they are
on their way back.

127
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,382
-I'm suddenly hit with this thought.
-What?

128
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,176
I was with Seo-eun until earlier,

129
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,013
so I think going up to her right now
might put pressure…

130
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,600
on her.

131
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,283
It's hard for me to meet his eyes.

132
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,453
I wonder what they talked about.

133
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,667
I don't think it would
put pressure on her.

134
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,463
And if you don't go to her now,
I think you might miss your chance

135
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:30,801
Because you'd be giving her time to think,
and you've already given her time.

136
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,764
If you give her even more time,

137
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,684
I think you're just giving her time
for her feelings to set.

138
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,523
That makes sense.

139
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,400
We'll go once they split up at the top.

140
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,365
Do we go? What do we do?

141
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,708
I've never sat down here before.

142
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,919
-It's nice, right?
-Yeah.

143
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,504
They sit down again.

144
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,172
What do we do?

145
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,030
The two of them…

146
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,701
It just occurred to me
when we saw them just now?

147
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,953
-Yeah.
-They look happy.

148
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,039
The two of them feel similar to me.

149
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,458
Seo-eun is…

150
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,628
like an adult by my standards.

151
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,132
And Yoong-jae is also like an adult
by my standards.

152
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,009
-Right.
-So I think that's maybe

153
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,844
why they get along so well.

154
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,604
Oh, my God, So-e's face is…

155
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,523
I feel so sad for her. Oh, my God.

156
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,403
-This is…
-What is going on?

157
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,866
The way I see it, Yoong-Jae
went straight to Seo-eun to talk.

158
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:21,495
Yes. Yesterday, he told So-e
he'll sort out his feelings

159
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,414
and get back to her as soon as possible.

160
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:27,752
I think he want to check on her
since she did go to Paradise with Han-bin.

161
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,379
Check on how she's feeling
and if it was a no from her,

162
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,632
then he was going to give So-e a chance.

163
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,179
I want them to take some time
to get to know each other at least once.

164
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:42,183
-Is that really not going to happen?
-After Yoong-jae first went to Paradise,

165
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,645
it's like returned, bewitched by Seo-eun.

166
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,482
So now I don't know if he should…

167
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,361
hurry and let So-e know
to give up on him or not.

168
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,988
I'm not sure
what's the right thing to do here.

169
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,991
Let's just say that it could be
that things don't work out.

170
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,993
But it's not like they can say,

171
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,953
"I guess it wasn't meant to be"
and go home.

172
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,164
-They have to be together.
-Exactly.

173
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,000
-They have to be together.
-And keep seeing each other.

174
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,213
Seul-ki, last time you said we should
swap books.

175
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,674
-So…
-Really? You brought one?

176
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,927
First, you should try this,
and if it's okay, then we'll swap.

177
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,261
Okay.

178
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,973
This is the cabana we came to
on the first day, where we sat and talked.

179
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,104
How are you doing?

180
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,688
I'm good.

181
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,315
-You okay?
-Yeah.

182
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,942
Is my headband okay?

183
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,819
Yeah. It looks great on you.

184
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,196
Do I look better with it on
or with it off?

185
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,492
If you put it on, you look cute,

186
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,911
and if you take it off,
you look cute and sexy.

187
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,913
Oh, then I'm going to take it off.

188
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,332
Right. It's better to be both.

189
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,001
But both look nice.

190
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,549
You must have guys
you want to talk with some more.

191
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:58,801
Yeah.

192
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,804
Who else have you not talked
with very much yet?

193
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,267
You haven't talked
to Yoong-jae much, right?

194
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,393
Yeah, that's right.

195
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,811
we haven't talked at all.

196
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,187
-Not at all?
-No.

197
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,899
What about you, Jong-woo?
Is there someone you want to get to know?

198
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,194
-Me?
-Someone you want to talk to?

199
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,321
I…

200
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,241
Right now.

201
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,119
I'm talking to her.

202
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,079
Oh.

203
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:34,920
Thanks.

204
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:39,091
I'm here talking to you
and I want to talk with you more.

205
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,263
I think there's plenty of things
we can talk about in an Inferno.

206
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,433
And if we have sincere conversations here,

207
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,811
I think we can become closer
to a certain degree.

208
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,104
That's nice.

209
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,731
Thank you for inviting me to talk.

210
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,732
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

211
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,151
I'm not very good at these things.

212
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,571
I'm really not good at these things.

213
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,991
I have almost never approached
someone first ever.

214
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,118
In your life?

215
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,207
-Really?
-But I came to you because my feeling of

216
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,834
wanting to talk to you first was strong.

217
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,004
If it was less strong,
I think I would have waited.

218
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,299
Thank you very much for that.

219
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:27,681
As for me, to be honest, I haven't been
able to think about things even yesterday.

220
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:32,478
I think I need to take some time
to seriously think about everything.

221
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,148
-On your own?
-Yeah.

222
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:37,983
Thanks.

223
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,529
There weren't many opportunities to talk.

224
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,782
So today's like getting
to know each other quickly.

225
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,117
I think I had
a different thought.

226
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,621
-Like…
-Do you want to come with me?

227
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,915
Yes. Okay. Let's go.

228
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,086
Nadine.

229
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,588
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

230
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,298
Okay.

231
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,718
It's so bright out here.

232
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,304
-We should bring sunglasses.
-Oh, I have a pair.

233
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,390
-Okay. I'll bring mine, too.
-Meet me here.

234
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,391
Okay.

235
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,366
She's adorable.

236
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,410
I really like seeing people like that.

237
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,662
When they have a second,
they fix their faces like this

238
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,248
to look good for the person they like.

239
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,376
Well, hi.

240
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,169
Are you having fun today?

241
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:44,842
What?

242
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,680
What did you guys do inside?

243
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:53,225
Us? We talked among ourselves,
and now I'm about to talk to Nadine.

244
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,810
-Really?
-Yeah.

245
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,354
Okay, bye.

246
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,609
He didn't even answer.

247
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,661
You don't have to run.
Oh, sunglasses.

248
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,164
It's so nice. I think the world
looks pretty good like this.

249
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,791
Right. Let's go get water.

250
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,918
Ice water, up there.

251
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,127
Okay.

252
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,504
This is my first time going.

253
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,505
I know.

254
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,468
-Please escort me.
-Escort? Okay.

255
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,472
-It's so nice up here.
-Okay. Where's the shade?

256
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,641
Nadine, you can sit here.

257
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,934
There's some shade here.

258
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,352
Oh, are you okay?

259
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,811
Are you okay with the sunlight?

260
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,481
It's so open here.
I'll just think of it as getting a tan.

261
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,982
-Are you sure?
-Okay.

262
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,400
Okay.

263
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,487
-English keeps coming out of you.
-Customized.

264
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,156
Custom, customized.

265
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,575
Wow, it's great out here.

266
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,077
It's so nice.

267
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,122
What kind of relationship
are you aiming for?

268
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,334
-What do you mean?
-I mean, seeking.

269
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,627
And what does that mean?

270
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,088
-Like, want.
-"Want"?

271
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,172
Okay, I get it now. Want.

272
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:11,303
Well, I don't like it
when people get clingy.

273
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,807
-Like texting me all day.
-Thought you wouldn't.

274
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,352
I would rather be in a relationship
that's casual but hot.

275
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,895
Casual but hot?

276
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,357
Yeah, fun but hardworking.

277
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,819
And passionate like, about his work.

278
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,738
Serious about his work?

279
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,532
-Yeah.
-And very passionate about it.

280
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,658
Yeah, that's right.

281
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,869
Do you think there's
someone like that here?

282
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,913
I don't know yet.

283
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,290
-You're not sure?
-No, I'm not sure.

284
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,501
I still want to talk to different people.

285
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,006
I don't really know what it is.

286
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,759
But I think your work
is something very professional.

287
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,722
If I had to guess,
because I feel this energy from you,

288
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,266
that people who are serious
about their work give off.

289
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,730
-Well, if you're curious…
-Okay.

290
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,356
Okay. You know what I mean, right?

291
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,403
That's cute.

292
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,700
What kind of relationship
do you want to be in?

293
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,453
I'll redirect the question
you asked me back to you.

294
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,374
A relationship where both are
confident about their domain.

295
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,503
-Their bane?
-No, each other's area.

296
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,715
Someone who's sure about their roles.

297
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,258
Really?

298
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,720
You seem like you'd be more free spirited.

299
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,931
But I hate recklessly extravagant people.

300
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,352
I want there to be something
she's focused on.

301
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:49,610
And I like being alone so much,
and I enjoy spending time alone.

302
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,865
Right, that's how I feel, too.
Being alone for me, too.

303
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:59,286
More recently in my life…
Do you understand?

304
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,412
Yes. In your life?

305
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,413
Yes.

306
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,331
Nearby, recently?

307
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,666
-Yes. Recently.
-Recently in my life recently.

308
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,210
Recently. That's right. Yeah.

309
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,922
Recently I felt that being alone
is really important.

310
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,426
It's important, and I should study Korean.

311
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,970
No, it's so attractive.

312
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,514
I should study.

313
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,183
-I'm really curious about what you do.
-Me?

314
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,851
Yes.

315
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,686
Thank you for being curious about me.

316
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,813
I am really curious.

317
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,776
I'm not really that curious
about all of the others.

318
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,739
I shouldn't be saying this,
but I've been keeping an eye on you.

319
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:36,990
-Really?
-Yes.

320
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,575
And you seem slightly cold.

321
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:42,746
But I saw a side to you
that's slightly cute.

322
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,292
-You hear that a lot, right?
-Really?

323
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,170
-That you're kind of cute?
-Me? Cute?

324
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,381
-No?
-I think you're the first person

325
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,343
to say something like that to me
after such a short period of time.

326
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,139
But you do have
a slightly cute side to you.

327
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:06,728
I'm not sure how to explain this…
but you're strangely cute.

328
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,314
Strangely?

329
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,901
That was… I'm sorry.

330
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,948
-It's kind of cute.
-Nadine is even cuter.

331
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,410
-I know, Nadine. Gosh.
-Their conversation is so smooth,

332
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,120
I'm looking forward
to their relationship.

333
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,454
-Me, too.
-Where this will go.

334
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,539
-I'm excited.
-Yeah.

335
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,749
Jin-young has good chemistry
with everyone.

336
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,627
-Yeah.
-Right. Nadine's slightly awkward Korean

337
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,630
and Jin-young's awkward English.

338
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,593
That's kind of making them both laugh.
Those things.

339
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,347
I look forward to seeing this pair
as much as seeing him with Seul-ki.

340
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,103
Did you enjoy your trip to Paradise?

341
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,607
-Yeah.
-How was it?

342
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,320
-Well, it was just-- It's just--
-Can you tell us about it?

343
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,572
You look like you're about to fall asleep.

344
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,033
I'm just a bit exhausted from the heat.

345
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,786
I mean, I think you would've done
something active.

346
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,583
Oh, yeah? I'm not sure. I'm a bit…

347
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,419
What can I do
when I'm tired from the heat?

348
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,715
-Hi.
-Hi.

349
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,509
-Did you have a good conversation?
-Yeah.

350
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,472
You look happy.

351
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,434
-Who were you out there talking to?
-Jin-young.

352
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,729
-Where did you go?
-The Ice water.

353
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,148
Did he go to the locker room?

354
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,816
No. He went in here.

355
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,402
Really?

356
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,615
You should put something on.
You're about to turn red.

357
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,866
I turn really red.

358
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,793
It's okay.

359
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,838
I'm fine. I think I'm just exhausted.

360
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,305
To be honest, he didn't say…

361
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,018
no or use other words
that express rejection.

362
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:55,022
But ultimately, the way things
are headed is towards rejection.

363
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,651
So the fact that I am feeling that fully,

364
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,654
I think it's reasonable
to feel heartbroken about it.

365
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:04,990
My heart did break.

366
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,373
Everybody, come on in.

367
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,920
You look cool.

368
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,541
Where's Seul-ki?

369
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,544
-Seul-ki.
-Seul-ki's over there.

370
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,713
Seul-ki's not here.

371
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,550
She had heatstroke earlier, right?

372
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,968
-Yes.
-Oh, that's right.

373
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,435
-Jong-woo?
-Yeah.

374
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,253
Did you have fun?

375
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,379
Yeah, I had fun.

376
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,923
But I heard you were exhausted
from the heat.

377
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,633
Here you go.

378
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,678
This will make you feel better.

379
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,346
What kind of pills are these?

380
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,764
Vitamin D and magnesium.

381
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,142
-Really?
-And there's a face mask.

382
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,435
Face mask's for soothing skin.

383
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,396
You said you have sensitive skin, so,

384
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,149
it's best if you do it later
in the evening.

385
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,276
-Thanks.
-It's aloe.

386
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,944
I love it.

387
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,405
He's so attentive.

388
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,115
Good job.

389
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,575
Very good job.

390
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:17,122
I was so nervous and I was dehydrated,
so I wasn't feeling well.

391
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,001
But Jong-woo approached me directly
and was very caring.

392
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:26,339
His feelings felt lovely,
and I felt grateful.

393
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,887
I'm wondering
how you're feeling.

394
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,224
I don't know about Jin-young.

395
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:40,020
But today, when we were together
for a bit, I watched him.

396
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,607
And he stayed interested in Nadine.

397
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,443
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

398
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,653
I think he's just
getting to know everyone.

399
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,323
It's like Jin-young joined midway.

400
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,242
Yeah, and since he joined late,

401
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,245
I don't think he feels certain
about anyone.

402
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,039
-Not yet?
-Yeah, I hope so.

403
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:04,336
I think that both you and Nadine
want to sway Jin-young's heart.

404
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,339
So this is the time for you
to actively take action

405
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,633
and express yourself or do something.

406
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,054
Remember he went to Paradise with Seul-ki
and they talked a lot.

407
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,473
And I'm certain they had a great time.

408
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,767
He hasn't decided yet.

409
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:25,148
Singles. At this time,
please gather in front of the campfire.

410
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,860
No way

411
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,195
I think we were right.

412
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,197
I think our prediction was right.

413
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,907
Our hunch was too good.

414
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,786
-I'm nervous.
-I think it's gonna be a new woman.

415
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,870
It could be a man.

416
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,206
Maybe a woman and a man.

417
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,209
Something tells me
a woman will come first.

418
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,212
Is someone else coming?

419
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,006
-Really?
-Things are complicated as is.

420
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,508
I know.

421
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,302
But there are people
who've lost their motivations, so.

422
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,346
-That's understandable.
-This could bring fresh energy.

423
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,347
Yes.

424
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,859
It's kind of exciting
that someone new is coming.

425
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,243
Who do you think will come?

426
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,871
-A woman?
-A woman?

427
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,709
Why am I feeling nervous?
It's like my first day again.

428
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,502
Yeah, that's right.

429
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,965
There. Someone's here.

430
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,845
-Someone's coming.
-Oh!

431
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,221
It's a man.

432
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,683
What?

433
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,226
It looks like he's tall.

434
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,192
-Is it a man?
-It's a man.

435
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,652
New face.

436
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:57,532
-It's a man.
-He's wearing a suit.

437
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,452
He looks a bit…

438
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,337
-He looks like an actor.
-Right, he's very tall and good looking.

439
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,596
-He's cool.
-He's very tall.

440
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,764
He's really tall.

441
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,769
-Hello.
-Hello.

442
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,359
Nice to meet you.

443
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,736
Hello. Have a seat.

444
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,576
My name is Kim Se-jun.

445
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,664
Somethings that I think make me
attractive to women are my kindness,

446
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,459
the way I make people feel comfortable,

447
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,921
and and how I can be sneakily cute.

448
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,633
These days I enjoy tennis as my hobby.

449
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,386
And I'm not too bad at it.

450
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:05,308
The kind of woman I would like to meet
is someone who's very nice and bubbly.

451
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,937
I tend to open up a lot quicker
to people like that.

452
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:14,567
And I know I was put here midway,
but well, if there's a woman I like,

453
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:18,488
I'll overwhelm her with my charms
regardless of the circumstances.

454
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,991
Nice to meet you.
Thank you.

455
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,243
Yes.

456
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,786
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

457
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,706
You look so exotic
and very cool.

458
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,543
Your voice is very low and cool, too.

459
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,298
Someone else.

460
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,973
-It's a woman.
-Yet another new person.

461
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,409
Why did I clap?

462
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,166
-Hello.
-Hello.

463
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,959
Nice to meet you. Hello.

464
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:17,839
Hello.

465
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:18,923
Nice to meet you.

466
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,217
My name's Lim Min-su.

467
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,387
My personality is kind of like
an iron hand in a velvet glove.

468
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:29,601
People tend to see me as someone who
laughs a lot and has a soft personality.

469
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,603
But if there's something I want to do,

470
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,731
or I feel like I should do,
I tend to be extremely proactive.

471
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,358
I'm quite adamant about my taste in men.

472
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,944
So if I see someone I want,
I think I'm the type of person

473
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,489
to go straight for him
without looking elsewhere.

474
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,492
Since I'm joining late,
there won't be many opportunities.

475
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,912
So I think I should hurry and find someone
who I like and go straight for him.

476
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,456
Welcome.

477
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,415
Welcome.

478
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,416
Nice to meet you.

479
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,962
-It's so pretty here.
-Right?

480
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,339
Yes.

481
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,759
Was your journey here difficult?

482
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,303
Well, there were quite a lot of stairs.

483
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,680
I wanted to look up at you all,
But I couldn't.

484
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,599
Because I was worried I might fall.

485
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,811
Those two could have felt awkward.

486
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:17,357
The way they're talking
seems like they're very motivated.

487
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:22,237
I'm watching Se-jun
and he has an imposing style.

488
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,656
-Do you think he could be the oldest?
-I have that feeling.

489
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,741
I wonder how Se-jun
might change the dynamic.

490
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,742
I'm curious.

491
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,870
-I'm curious.
-Let's see what happens.

492
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,294
Let's go.
Time to go make dinner.

493
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,796
I wonder
what ingredients we got.

494
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,882
-Let's see what they gave us.
-I hope there's something good.

495
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,093
Oh, kimchi.

496
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,679
-Kimchi?
-Tuna, kimchi.

497
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,889
Chef,
what's the menu for today?

498
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,518
Well, shall we make kimchi stew
and kimchi fried rice?

499
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,062
Oh, fried rice. Nice.

500
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,355
Sounds great.

501
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,489
-Hello?
-Hello.

502
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,492
-Hello.
-What did you say your name was?

503
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,493
I'm Lee Nadine.

504
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,704
Nadine. Oh, that's pretty.

505
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,248
-Everyone here has pretty names.
-No.

506
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,003
You don't have the torch, do you?

507
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,215
-Kimchi tuna stew?
-Kimchi tuna stew and…

508
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,634
You can come with me
to put your clothes in the back.

509
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,802
Yes.

510
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,473
Will those be enough?

511
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,434
What are we making?

512
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,810
Kimchi fried rice.

513
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,981
You guys prepare the ingredients, please.
Wash them.

514
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,359
I put your jacket over there for you.

515
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,236
Thank you.

516
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,196
Kimchi stew and kimchi fried rice.

517
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,619
They said, we have to use
the water sparingly,

518
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,662
since we have to throw everything out.

519
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,792
I just had a weird thought.

520
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:04,672
The two new people should get together
so they don't mess up anything.

521
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,466
That'd be beautiful.

522
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,718
I was just thinking that five minutes ago.

523
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,762
The two go well together.

524
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,516
Min-su, right? What's your name?

525
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,770
-I'm Kim Se-jun.
-Se-jun. Se-jun.

526
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,315
Aren't you two new comers?

527
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,734
-Doing too much work?
-Working hard.

528
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,662
You've got good skills.

529
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,997
-Do I?
-Do you live here or something?

530
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,754
Do you want to go get water?

531
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:45,922
Yeah, okay. Let's go.

532
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,841
Do you want to go with us?
Can I help with the water?

533
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,343
-Go ahead.
-I'll be back.

534
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,470
You want to go? Go get water?

535
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,099
-Okay.
-You go ahead. I don't have to go.

536
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,642
Oh!

537
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,270
-So-e just matched them.
-I know.

538
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,064
-Yeah.
-Wow.

539
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,899
We're the original members.

540
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,735
-Yeah, we are.
-We really are.

541
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,653
That's cool.

542
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,239
Don't I look like
a university student today?

543
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,324
You do kind of have
that look going.

544
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,951
Hey, did you do your homework?

545
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,957
-It's his first time.
-Really?

546
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,293
Oh, it's lit already.

547
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,922
It's done.

548
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,551
Last time, it took us about 20 minutes
to get it to burn.

549
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,470
It's done.

550
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:35,888
Easy.

551
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,015
Okay.

552
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,808
Good.

553
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:39,976
Next.

554
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:44,939
Simple.

555
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,817
The more I watch, the more I feel
that Jin-young is unusual

556
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,779
because, for example,
he had something going on with Seul-ki.

557
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,115
-Yes.
-So I would be bothered if I were him.

558
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,284
And Seul-ki went somewhere with two men.

559
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:00,288
But he's actually only interested
in the firewood. Look at him.

560
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,539
Don't you agree?

561
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,249
That's what got Seul-ki more anxious.

562
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,251
Yeah, I think he's
making her more anxious.

563
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,461
He's not even acting.

564
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,380
He's just all about getting
the fire started right now.

565
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,548
Yes.

566
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,301
It's so pretty.

567
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,969
I know.

568
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,388
Don't you think the weather's been
especially pretty today

569
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,639
since we've been back?

570
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,684
All right, let's get the water.

571
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,521
Okay. It's running.

572
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,275
-Now we watch the scenery.
-Yeah, that's right.

573
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,906
I love looking at this.

574
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,369
Don't you think
just watching this view

575
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,289
-tends to relieve…
-The frustration a bit?

576
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,707
Yeah. The frustration.

577
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,585
I wanted to ask you
about your trip to Paradise.

578
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,254
-With Jin-young?
-How were the conversations?

579
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,468
I'm not really sure
what kind of person he is.

580
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,679
Do you want to talk with him more?

581
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,014
You have to talk to him.

582
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,277
Both of them have feelings for Seul-ki.

583
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,365
Seul-ki, you went with me.

584
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,992
Do you think you have
an understanding of who I am?

585
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,662
When you look at me,
of who I am as a person?

586
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,621
Yeah.

587
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,832
Well, that shouldn't happen so easily.

588
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,416
Did I open up to you too much?

589
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,055
How was your journey here?

590
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,350
It was further away than I thought.

591
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,269
It's far, right,
and the stairs are very long.

592
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,729
Yes, and the steps
are very weirdly spaced.

593
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,983
-So I almost fell a few times.
-Really?

594
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:52,984
Yes.

595
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,778
There are 12 people now.

596
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,534
It's a lot, huh?
It's like a huge family now.

597
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,578
-It is.
-If there's anything you're curious

598
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,164
-or uncomfortable about, just ask.
-Thank you.

599
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:12,837
Can you chop them?

600
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,838
Yes.

601
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:26,392
You're very… precise about it.

602
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,021
Well, there's no reason to rush.

603
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,814
"There's no reason to rush."

604
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,025
Is that a dialect?

605
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,693
We'll see.

606
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,531
I was going to do it myself,
and suddenly I made you do everything.

607
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,408
Right, you're ordering me around.

608
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,077
You only realize that now?

609
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,005
That's good. I think we can make more.
Four cans.

610
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:58,925
This is for the stew.

611
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,849
Who here is confident
they can peel the garlic?

612
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,476
I am.

613
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,560
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

614
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,938
-It's difficult.
-I'll try it.

615
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,274
-I believe in you.
-How many?

616
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,070
Be careful.

617
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,031
Onions. Did we cut the onions
for the stew?

618
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,953
Can you show me the onions for the stew?

619
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,496
Drain the oil.

620
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,833
-Yes. I'll do it.
-Thank you.

621
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,050
The person who took care of me the most
when I came to the Inferno,

622
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,094
I think So-e took care of me the most.

623
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:47,139
She was trying to make sure that I felt
comfortable and got adjusted to things.

624
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,727
Seul-ki.

625
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,938
-Yes?
-Come here.

626
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,940
-What did you say?
-Come here, please.

627
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,316
So you want some help?

628
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,654
Yes, I'll wash the dishes out
and you can just rinse them for me.

629
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,365
Okay. Are you good at washing dishes?

630
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,534
Well, I'm average at it.

631
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,204
I'll keep an eye on you.

632
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,205
Okay.

633
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,297
-Why didn't you come outside?
-Huh?

634
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,049
-You stayed inside earlier.
-When you were playing in the water?

635
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,592
Yeah. You weren't feeling good?

636
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,428
No, I wasn't feeling good at all.

637
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,099
Maybe you got sick
from having too much fun yesterday.

638
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,559
Yeah, maybe.

639
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,936
Are You feeling okay now?

640
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,937
Yeah.

641
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,527
We should have waited.
More dishes are keep coming.

642
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,445
I know.

643
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,530
Jong-woo, what are you doing
with the pepper?

644
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,783
Oh, Jong-woo.

645
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,621
I'll go put this back inside.

646
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,207
-Are you done already?
-Yeah.

647
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,418
The human dishwasher.

648
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,879
Seul-ki, while you did that one,
I did all this.

649
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,175
Seul-ki. Seul-ki.

650
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,763
Seul-ki.

651
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,807
The way Jin-young speaks
is so interesting.

652
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,227
When he's playing around,
he speaks so respectfully.

653
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,605
He speaks casually when he's worried.

654
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,981
Really?

655
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,567
He goes, "I'm doing this.
I'm doing this, Seul-ki."

656
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,736
But then when he's worried,
his eyes shift and,

657
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,029
he asks, "Are you okay?"

658
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,156
"Do things properly, please."

659
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,908
"But are you feeling okay?"

660
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,205
Both of them are just so sweet.

661
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,791
-They are different.
-It's so unusual.

662
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,043
Whoa! What is this?

663
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,087
Are you using two knives?

664
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,380
-Yes.
-Wow.

665
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,923
To chop this up quickly.

666
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,967
There's an AI here.
A cooking AI.

667
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,427
Are you Wolverine, or what?

668
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,346
Chef, the rice came out great.

669
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,557
-It's perfect to make fried rice with.
-Let's fry it.

670
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,101
Okay.

671
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,229
-Something smells good.
-Right?

672
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,940
-Yeah. The smell.
-Wow.

673
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:02,817
It looks good.

674
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,990
Yay!

675
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,910
Wow, kimchi fried rice.

676
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,956
-Enjoy the food.
-Enjoy the food.

677
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,127
This is delicious.

678
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,713
This is so good.

679
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,299
Mmm. This is nice.

680
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,760
I think this is the best
thing I've eaten here.

681
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,761
It's delicious.

682
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,098
Do you know how to cook?

683
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,934
No, I'm just good at doing
what I'm told to do.

684
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,604
Are you two good at
memorizing names?

685
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,772
I'm trying my best.

686
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,899
How many have you memorized?

687
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,318
What if it's none?

688
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,946
-No, I did.
-Is there someone you remember exactly?

689
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,322
Seul-ki.

690
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,575
Dong-woo. Yoong-jae.

691
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,411
-Se-jeong.
-What?

692
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,913
Se-jun, be prepared. Mentally prepared.

693
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,457
I'm slowly memorizing them.

694
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,250
I haven't memorized anyone.

695
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,546
We have someone who uses name tags.

696
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,216
It's all right. There is still one person
who hasn't memorized our names.

697
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,676
He still can't memorize them.

698
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,261
I will slowly memorize them.

699
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,305
He got here yesterday.

700
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,641
-This was great.
-So perfect.

701
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,521
Now with the newcomers joining them,

702
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,273
things are awkward.

703
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,526
Yes, Se-jun is at least talking with So-e.

704
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,695
So-e is taking care of him.

705
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,114
And Se-jun seems grateful for that.

706
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,283
Right. Enough to develop feelings?

707
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,243
-Se-jun for So-e?
-I don't know.

708
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,289
But So-e, when she approached him
and talked to him,

709
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,124
he didn't really look at her.

710
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,752
I think that's just how he is.

711
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,964
He was facing forward as he opened the can
and when he came to help with the can,

712
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,551
he wasn't like give it to me
before opening it.

713
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,845
He just quietly came up
indifferently and opened it.

714
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,098
He could still be feeling awkward
about meeting people's eyes.

715
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:04,063
During dinner, the woman's feelings
towards Jin-young were quite hot.

716
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:07,942
But I'm still unsure about
who Jin-young has feelings for.

717
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,237
Whether Jin-young starts the fire
or is chopping things up,

718
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,280
someone comes and joins him anyway.

719
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:17,576
But Seul-ki is the only person
who he called over.

720
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,497
So I think she definitely holds
a bit more importance to him.

721
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,001
-The moon is really pretty.
-Yeah, it really is.

722
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,419
I can't stop looking at it.

723
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,671
Well, there's beer.

724
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,589
-What?
-There's beer?

725
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,384
Beer?

726
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,555
Let's have the newcomers sit
on the inside.

727
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,182
-Newcomers.
-Newcomers to the center.

728
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,768
-Right there.
-Thank you.

729
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,437
-Lefty.
-Yeah.

730
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,316
We're all squished together.

731
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,278
It's nice. I like it. It's warm.

732
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,711
Oh, next to So-e.

733
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,671
He's uncomfortable sitting next to her.

734
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,340
Tried to get another seat,
but came back this way,

735
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,093
-and I bet So-e is probably…
-Felt all that.

736
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,511
…is feeling all that.

737
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,473
I recommend this one.

738
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,975
Thank you. Do you like beer?

739
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:24,643
Do you like beer?

740
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,312
Yeah. I like beer.

741
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,106
Well, let's make a toast.

742
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,900
Cheers. A cheers wave.

743
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,193
Cheers.

744
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,779
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

745
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,284
This is good.

746
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,744
It's delicious.

747
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,245
It's sweet.

748
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,457
We have new people here,
so why don't we…

749
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,459
-Ask what we're curious about?
-Ask questions.

750
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,878
What is your ideal type?

751
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,838
That was a bold.

752
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,798
It's Single's Inferno.

753
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,010
Personality wise,

754
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:02,306
I'd like a person who's able to think
of others before they think of themselves.

755
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:09,480
Appearance wise,
well, I do like people who look sharp.

756
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:12,232
But to be honest,
I don't really care all that much.

757
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,943
Whether the person looks sharp,
I don't really care.

758
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:19,448
Someone with defined facial features
If I had to choose.

759
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,283
What about you mean, Min-su?

760
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,203
Appearance wise,
I like someone with a pretty smile.

761
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,829
Someone with a pretty smile.

762
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,415
And someone with a big frame.

763
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,251
Personality wise,

764
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,713
someone who naturally has good manners.

765
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,423
-Manners.
-Someone like that.

766
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,634
I like someone
who makes me feel comfortable.

767
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,053
So this is your first time
on Inferno.

768
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,888
-Yes.
-How does it feel being here?

769
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,307
Your first impressions.

770
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,976
Honestly, I don't think
it feels like hell yet.

771
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:51,063
-Because today was so--
-She hasn't gotten a taste of hell yet.

772
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,064
Not yet.

773
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,818
I'm looking forward
to experiencing hell in Inferno.

774
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,737
That's nice.
You had a good first impression.

775
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,155
Se-jeong.

776
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,242
How has Inferno been for you so far?

777
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,161
Inferno? You want to hear it from me?

778
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,206
What? You'll regret it.

779
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,086
A new experience?

780
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,754
But one I can grow from.

781
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,007
And one I can learn about myself through.

782
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,843
Right. I think that's right.

783
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,137
She's been in Inferno for four days.

784
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,514
-Really?
-She can tell you exactly how it is.

785
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,058
-Same as you, though, right?
-Yeah, that's right.

786
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:31,478
-So we can tell you about it.
-What is your answer, Jong-woo?

787
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,772
-About Inferno?
-Yeah.

788
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,649
Inferno is not all bad.

789
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:38,026
In fact, at times this is a place where

790
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:42,573
you might also feel like, this is heaven.

791
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,286
So I think everyone feels differently
about life on Inferno.

792
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:51,540
It could be heaven,
it could be actual hell, one or the other.

793
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:55,627
Is it heaven right now?

794
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,713
Yes. This is heaven for me right now.

795
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,506
I'm so happy.

796
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,551
It's heaven right now.

797
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,348
The alcohol is going down easy tonight.

798
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,477
Drinking like this. I want soju.

799
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,020
Another topic.

800
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,396
Are we done with this topic?

801
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,524
-Done drinking?
-Yeah.

802
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,775
Got smoke in my eyes.

803
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,155
-Do you want to switch seats?
-No, I'm fine.

804
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,492
Seul-ki, do you want to come over here?

805
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,618
There's no smoke here.

806
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,495
-Oh, can I?
-Yeah, the edge.

807
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,456
I've been blocked
by the communication barrier here.

808
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,013
He said he wants to switch seats.

809
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,015
-Yeah.
-I think it's so funny.

810
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,060
He's trying to sit next to Seo-eun.

811
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,144
Yeah, that's right.

812
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,775
When did she move over there?

813
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:00,776
What?

814
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,819
When did she move over there?

815
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:16,542
What's going on, Seul-ki?
Can we go talk for a sec?

816
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,169
-Right now? Sure.
-Yeah.

817
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,005
Is there no one here?

818
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,220
Do you want to look out
at the ocean while we talk?

819
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,931
-Yeah.
-Let's sit like this.

820
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:32,516
Okay.

821
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,521
When we first returned from Paradise,
I wanted to talk to you alone.

822
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:46,530
I thought, after Paradise, there might not
be a lot of opportunities to talk to you.

823
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,741
-Yeah.
-That really happened?

824
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,201
Yeah.

825
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:55,038
To be honest, oppa,
after going to paradise with you,

826
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,709
my impression of you changed.

827
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,171
How did it change?

828
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,682
I thought that we weren't really
a good match.

829
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,186
In what way were we not a good match?

830
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,396
So…

831
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:35,078
It's just, Oppa, you just treat me…

832
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:41,627
too much like someone
who is younger than you.

833
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,798
Oppa…

834
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,802
of course, you're being considerate of me.

835
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,098
Or maybe you do feel like I'm younger,

836
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,851
so you act like that
because you like me in that way.

837
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:02,814
But for me, it's like,
does he really see me as that young?

838
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,942
I kind of felt like that.

839
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,739
Honestly, I did think of you that way.

840
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,159
I just really wanted to take care of you.

841
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:19,206
And I guess I could have regarded you
as someone younger than me.

842
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:23,001
When a person like someone
who has feelings for them…

843
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,630
it feels better to give.

844
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,800
I think it was like that for me.

845
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,054
I see.

846
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,100
So after I came back from Paradise
with you, Oppa,

847
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,227
I thought a lot about myself.

848
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,356
And it was kind of hard for me, honestly.

849
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,705
How should I put this?

850
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,207
I just think I'm comfortable
with you now, Oppa.

851
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:10,257
Not as a potential love interest,
but comfortable as a close friend.

852
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,717
As of right now.

853
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:21,059
So once we came back from Paradise,
it wasn't easy for me.

854
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,732
To just talk to you alone.

855
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:36,408
So now do you want to spend
more time with other people?

856
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,372
I think I want to get to know
other people more. Yes.

857
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,920
Anyway, this is an environment

858
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,550
where you get to know people
and find someone your heart goes to.

859
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,720
-Right.
-So I want to focus on that.

860
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:06,438
So in the future there might be
more people you would want to get to know?

861
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,278
Yeah.

862
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,879
This is the first time we know
how Seul-ki feels.

863
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,882
-I think it's understandable.
-She's being honest about it.

864
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,842
Dong-woo can't believe this--

865
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,636
Because while they shared
the same time together,

866
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,555
how they felt about their experience
is completely different.

867
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,142
Dong-woo kept saying things like,
"I like this. This is so nice."

868
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:49,272
Now Seul-ki honestly expressed
how she feels,

869
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,400
but Dong-woo can't believe it.

870
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,780
He can't believe it so much
that he asked the same thing four times.

871
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,741
-He just kept asking her.
-Dong-woo is stunned.

872
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,201
I'm sure Dong-woo felt it.

873
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,956
Everybody just kind of disappeared.

874
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,541
I know, right?

875
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,960
Someone said,
they were going to the restroom

876
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,962
and then people just started leaving.

877
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:14,005
That's how it is.

878
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,632
-Really?
-Yeah.

879
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:16,842
Are they all women?

880
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,512
Is he surrounded by four women right now?

881
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:21,847
What is this?

882
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,266
-Is it four-on-one?
-What is this?

883
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,600
That's how it is.

884
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,436
Really? I'm not good at those things.

885
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,855
I just say straightforwardly,

886
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,607
-"Do you want to go talk?"
-Their signal is saying

887
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,817
they're off to the restroom.

888
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,653
-That's the signal? That's the signal?
-Yeah. Yeah.

889
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,946
No wonder everyone got up.

890
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,906
Everyone got up saying
they were going to the restroom, right?

891
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,825
Yeah. And they didn't come back.

892
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,577
Right.

893
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,790
Do you have anyone
you want to do that with?

894
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,918
Someone you want to talk to?

895
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,254
-Me?
-Yes.

896
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:58,049
Well, I want to talk
to everyone at least once.

897
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,594
With people who I haven't talked to.

898
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,347
Are you headed
back to your tent?

899
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,975
-I'm going to the restroom.
-Got it.

900
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,226
Bye, Seul-ki.

901
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,227
Yeah.

902
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:15,650
Seul-ki, are you feeling okay?

903
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,527
-Yeah.
-Let's go talk a bit.

904
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,528
Okay.

905
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,826
Who's that over there?

906
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:30,957
Nadine and the guy who you talked to
earlier in the afternoon.

907
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,919
-Who? A guy? Oh, Jong-woo.
-Pegasus.

908
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,839
I think he's a good competitor.

909
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,637
That's funny.

910
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:47,766
When I walked by, I heard you say
I want to talk to everyone at least once.

911
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,230
I didn't know you were walking by
behind me.

912
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,774
Women surrounding you.

913
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,984
I do want to.

914
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,112
You had an arrogant look.

915
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,238
-Really?
-Yeah.

916
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,953
Why did you have to walk by
at that moment?

917
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,538
Jerk.

918
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,582
Yeah.

919
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,043
That's funny.

920
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,170
Did you see the sunset today?

921
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,296
It was so pretty.

922
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:21,508
-Did you see it?
-Earlier when I went to get water.

923
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,093
-You went to get water?
-Yeah.

924
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,219
-When?
-You didn't see me?

925
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,304
-With who?
-You weren't looking at me.

926
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,223
No. You disappeared from my sight.

927
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,350
You should have kept watching.

928
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,853
-Why would you disappear from my sight?
-I kept my eyes on you, oppa.

929
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:40,694
-So did you have fun talking?
-With who?

930
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,195
Who you were just with.

931
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,033
-Dong-woo? Yeah, with Dong-woo.
-Yeah.

932
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:48,910
No.

933
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,247
Why not? You didn't enjoy it?

934
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,457
I told him honestly.

935
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,875
About what?

936
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,003
That I don't see him
as a potential love interest.

937
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,254
-Really?
-Yeah.

938
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,715
You know how to say those things?

939
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:02,716
Yeah.

940
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,641
Are you okay now?

941
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,062
You didn't really look like
you were feeling okay today overall.

942
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,566
I don't think you feel too good
right now, either.

943
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,905
Honestly, I'm not in the best mood
because in my position,

944
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,952
it's really not comfortable
for me to say those kind of things.

945
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,914
-So…
-What you told him?

946
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:36,541
Yeah.

947
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,337
My heart hurt so bad.

948
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,217
-But I'm…
-Yeah?

949
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,845
just…

950
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,599
doing what my heart tells me to.

951
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,689
Why didn't you talk alone with Seul-ki?

952
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,318
She was busy talking with Dong-woo.

953
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,865
I was waiting, but I just… it's hard.

954
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,492
-It's like…
-Right.

955
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,577
…overlapping.

956
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,706
I went to Paradise
for a second time with you, oppa.

957
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:18,374
So then the others…

958
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:22,212
they were really curious
to know what it was like,

959
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,714
-Really?
-Yeah. They kept asking.

960
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:31,304
They kept asking me, too, but I was like,
it was fine, but in reality I liked it.

961
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,182
But I didn't want to say that.

962
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,728
And I didn't want
other people imagining us like that.

963
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,107
If I say I liked it, they'd go,
why did they like it?

964
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,485
So I just kept on saying,
"Well, it was fine."

965
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,402
Like that.

966
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:51,157
But I really did like it.

967
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,952
I said I wasn't sure, too.

968
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,169
Let's go!

969
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,380
Let's go, Seul-ki.

970
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,425
You're tired, so today…

971
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,095
I'm not tired, oppa. You're tired.

972
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:15,306
No. No, I just think
you should take care of yourself.

973
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,309
-Seul-ki?
-Huh?

974
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:19,978
Are you done talking?

975
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,064
-Are you drunk?
-I'm sleepy.

976
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:26,067
You're sleepy.
Going to call it a night, then?

977
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,277
Let's talk tomorrow.

978
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,988
-You're tired, huh? Okay.
-Yeah.

979
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,782
You go on inside
and I'll bring you the book.

980
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,744
Just read one passage
before you go to sleep, okay?

981
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,496
Since you're tired.

982
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,874
-I'll bring it over.
-Okay.

983
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,381
Did you talk to her?

984
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,927
She's really tired,
so I'm just going to go give her the book.

985
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,941
Can I come in?

986
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:09,903
-Yes.
-I'll just take a second.

987
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:16,201
This is just something I did.
Do this and only read this side.

988
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,411
-Okay.
-And go to sleep, okay?

989
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,788
Goodnight.

990
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:40,683
-That sounds just like how he feels.
-Yeah, I think he passed on how he feels.

991
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,646
Unrequited love is so sad to me.

992
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,191
Oh, my gosh.

993
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,903
Are you going somewhere?
Can we talk?

994
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,404
Okay.

995
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,241
-I was going to…
-Yeah?

996
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:00,495
…ask you to talk to…

997
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:01,496
Yeah.

998
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,831
Thank you for reaching out…

999
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,085
and asking to talk first.

1000
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,176
When we talked yesterday,

1001
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:19,514
I told you, I would give you my answer
sooner rather than later.

1002
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,557
Yeah.

1003
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:24,727
But I did think that once today was over,
it would be a bit late.

1004
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:25,728
Right.

1005
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:30,275
To be honest, I thought about this a lot.

1006
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,318
Really, I'm not just saying that.

1007
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:39,367
To explain my thoughts, I thought that…

1008
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,582
during the time we have left,

1009
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,669
I should talk…

1010
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,463
to other…

1011
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:54,841
people.

1012
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,468
Or make…

1013
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,517
opportunities.

1014
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:10,189
Wouldn't that be what is best?

1015
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,608
Hmm.

1016
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,694
That was what I thought.

1017
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:19,032
But the meaning of other people for you.

1018
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,494
If I were to take a look
at how you honestly feel,

1019
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:29,292
I honestly, aside from talking about us,
I didn't ask you about other people.

1020
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:32,337
Because that might be rude.

1021
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:36,674
But I think I have to inevitably.

1022
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,594
Which is why I'm asking, by "other people"

1023
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,889
I think you mean just Se-jun.

1024
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,729
Honestly, the person who's always

1025
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:52,774
watching you the most in here
would be me, right?

1026
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:59,947
Of course there could be others,
but that's just what I've been doing.

1027
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:06,329
But what I saw every time is
your eyes are always only on Se-jun.

1028
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,417
So the way I perceive it is…

1029
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:16,881
it's like that.

1030
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:22,720
The way my feelings are like this,
that's how your feelings are.

1031
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:24,681
Is that right?

1032
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,152
I don't think I can deny that.

1033
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:44,742
The way I can't help how I feel.

1034
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,994
Of course, you can't help how you feel.

1035
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:48,996
I understand that.

1036
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:59,340
Honestly, I say I understand, but I know
I'm not a big enough person to understand.

1037
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:01,676
It's not easy.

1038
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:06,013
-It's not easy, but it is possible.
-Yeah.

1039
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,308
-Yeah.
-Time will solve everything anyway.

1040
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:13,479
This right now is such a big deal to me.

1041
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,899
But as time passes by, it won't be.

1042
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:25,324
And if we end things like this,

1043
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:28,953
maybe you and I
might be able to get along better.

1044
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,874
-Yeah.
-That's what I'm thinking.

1045
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:35,960
And, of course, I said,
I'm interested in you.

1046
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:40,548
I'm curious about you,
but those things can also apply

1047
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,384
to being just good friends.

1048
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,721
Or maybe colleagues.

1049
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:52,435
Then wouldn't we be able
to spend the rest of the time here,

1050
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,271
way more comfortably and fun.

1051
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:59,692
Just like, "Yeah, hi. Did you sleep well?"
Stuff like that.

1052
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,195
Would something like that be okay?

1053
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:10,036
If we can get along as good friends
and people, for me, I don't think

1054
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,205
there would be anything better than that.

1055
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,248
That's how I feel.

1056
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:15,708
Good.

1057
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,086
For five days.

1058
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,637
-Let's get along well.
-Yeah.

1059
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:35,853
I'm going to try to learn
how to cook from Han-bin.

1060
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,899
-Yeah.
-I'll make you something delicious.

1061
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,112
I just said that to make you laugh.

1062
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,572
Okay.

1063
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,993
Thank you for saying all this first.

1064
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,838
I'm good.

1065
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:04,674
Thank you for telling me.

1066
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:06,884
No, I…

1067
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,681
There's nothing for you to thank me for.

1068
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,395
-Should we go back?
-Yeah.

1069
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,775
-Last drink?
-Yeah.

1070
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:34,745
Good night.

1071
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:35,746
Good night.

1072
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,014
The night is long.

1073
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:56,017
Watching that all unfold,

1074
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,312
-I couldn't breathe.
-Me, neither.

1075
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,732
To be honest, person who deserves
to be comforted the most here is So-e.

1076
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:07,987
But Yoong-jae, who had no other choice
but to talk to So-e honestly,

1077
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,573
it seems like So-e was comforting him.

1078
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,618
Trying to make sure
that he won't feel bad.

1079
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,120
That was so sad for me.

1080
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:18,456
So-e is the one who should be comforted.

1081
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,166
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1082
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,751
It seems so sad to me.

1083
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,046
I'm sure Yoong-jae
won't be feeling good either.

1084
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,255
He won't be.

1085
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:29,342
The conversation itself seems to have
wrapped up well, but honestly--

1086
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,259
No, not at all.

1087
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:36,098
How can a person put feelings aside
and be like this in an instant?

1088
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,767
"Let's be friends from tomorrow."

1089
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,268
That's not how you become friends.

1090
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:42,939
But this, even if she gave up on
her feelings for Yoong-jae,

1091
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:45,441
who will So-e turn to in his place?

1092
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:49,403
Who will she reach her hand out to?
Who will she approach?

1093
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:52,448
This is not an easy situation
for her at all, to be honest.

1094
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:58,913
-What should be done about this?
-Can't So-e just leave?

1095
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,457
Let her leave.

1096
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,834
-No, not yet.
-All it takes is a boat.

1097
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:06,420
How can she endure this here?
It's too hard.

1098
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:09,173
Right. Can we get a helicopter
and the air facility?

1099
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:11,759
-Oh, gosh.
-So-e is a strong minded person.

1100
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,656
You weren't feeling
good yesterday.

1101
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:35,866
-Yeah.
-How are you now?

1102
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:37,076
Are you okay?

1103
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:39,120
You took such good care of me.

1104
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,579
What? With the food?

1105
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:42,081
Mr. doctor.

1106
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,253
If you need any, I have omega3, too.

1107
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:50,923
You're careful about your health, huh?

1108
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,299
Yeah.

1109
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:54,010
Health is happiness.

1110
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,888
You can only be happy if you're healthy.

1111
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:02,184
Which is why I was so thankful yesterday.

1112
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,604
There actually is a real doctor there.

1113
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,983
Oh, I was wondering what you meant.

1114
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,234
Jeez.

1115
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,987
Jong-woo is kind of like a sunflower.

1116
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,924
-What?
-Is he sick in bed?

1117
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,926
-The new guy.
-The new guy is sleeping.

1118
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:37,970
Is he getting an IV drip?

1119
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,930
It's understandable that he's tired.

1120
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:48,105
He got here yesterday,
so I figured he'd be tired.

1121
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,149
We were all up late last night.

1122
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,903
When we remember our first day,
it's understandable.

1123
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:57,448
We… were like this.

1124
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,242
We leaned back
and slept our first day, too.

1125
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,786
We know the feeling.

1126
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:02,787
Wake up.

1127
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,876
That was a good nap.

1128
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:25,434
The hottest inferno
in the world, Single's Inferno.

1129
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:30,439
Today, only Kim Se-jun, and Lim Min-su,
the newest singles,

1130
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,484
will be given the option
to choose to go to Paradise.

1131
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:37,613
-But it's fair.
-Really?

1132
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:42,076
This is the time to find out
where their hearts are headed.

1133
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,120
It's a real privilege.

1134
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,579
They should be given this.

1135
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:46,872
-Right.
-There's no time.

1136
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:49,208
Wow. They're going right away.

1137
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,335
I'm jealous. I've never been.

1138
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,588
I didn't even imagine this.

1139
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:56,841
How did they give them
the option to choose?

1140
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:59,468
The decision will be made
this afternoon.

1141
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,221
Wow.

1142
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:06,559
-This could be extremely cruel to someone.
-Right.

1143
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,227
-Really.
-Right.

1144
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,771
I didn't think it'd be Paradise.

1145
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,606
The more attractive
the person you like is,

1146
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,191
the more nervous you should be.

1147
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,110
I wonder who will be going.

1148
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,502
The person I was interested in
is Yoong-jae.

1149
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,004
When did he get into my heart?

1150
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:37,214
And I'm not okay with it,
but what can I do?

1151
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,091
I don't want him taken away from me.

1152
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,593
I really want to win.

1153
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:43,554
I think it became like this
ever since Jin-young got here.

1154
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,306
I don't know
about Jin-young yet.

1155
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:48,142
My feelings
that have gotten stronger.

1156
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:49,977
But I hate how she makes me feel confused.

1157
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:53,480
I just feel like everything
is going to be taken away from me.

1158
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:54,648
I really want to win.

1159
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,109
He's not ordinary.
