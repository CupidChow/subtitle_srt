Please enjoy the dates
until the end without any regrets.

17
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,404
Excuse me.

18
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,906
-Oh-ho!
-See you.

19
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,741
Go tell her.

20
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,913
Jin-young left first.

21
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,873
He was a step closer.

22
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,584
He came out immediately,
he came out right away.

23
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,795
Jin-young went to talk to her, right?

24
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,963
-Of course he went to talk to her.
-Yeah.

25
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,799
-So after…
-I should wait, then.

26
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,969
I'm going
to talk to her too, briefly.

27
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,932
But you spent a lot
of time with her, so yeah.

28
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,476
Yeah, we were together this whole time.

29
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,560
Dong-woo too?

30
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,271
"You spent a lot of time with her, so."

31
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,024
-"We were together this whole time."
-He's very single-minded.

32
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,151
She does makeup like this.

33
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,738
Who are you looking for?

34
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,449
-Over there.
-In the dressing room.

35
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,421
I'm going to go to him
when they're done talking.

36
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,924
Why didn't you just talk to him first?

37
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,929
Because the expression
on his face looked so…

38
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,015
It's okay.

39
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,768
I guess.

40
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,904
That was predictable.

41
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,947
Seul-ki?

42
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,158
Yes. Thank you.

43
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,118
Yes.

44
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,248
Oppa, I'll be back.
Wait just a second.

45
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,798
-You didn't find her?
-Yeah, I did.

46
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,884
Jong-woo, I'm a bit pressed today, so.

47
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,677
Yes. Got it. Of course you are.

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,179
I wanted to ask you
to let me talk to her first.

49
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,224
-It's a little bit urgent for me.
-We're both in line.

50
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,392
Both?

51
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,477
-Yeah. In order.
-You too?

52
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,230
Yes, I joined, too. But you go ahead.

53
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,818
Okay.
Don't worry, I won't take too long.

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,200
Let's go get some water today, Seul-ki.

55
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,870
I'm good at getting water.

56
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,498
You lead the way, then.
I don't know how to get there.

57
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,375
-Follow me.
-Okay.

58
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,294
You went to Paradise four times.

59
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,839
That's why you don't know
your way around here very well.

60
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,383
Inferno kind of feels
like paradise for me now.

61
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,344
Inferno is really amazing.

62
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,305
They do have good chemistry.

63
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,062
-How was it yesterday?
-Yesterday?

64
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,689
Yeah,
I heard it was lots of fun.

65
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,524
Nadine said
she had lots of fun?

66
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,525
Yeah.

67
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,738
I should
be having fun when I go there.

68
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,157
I can't be depressed, right?

69
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,579
Why does it feel like it's been so long
since I went to paradise with you?

70
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,291
Don't you think
you're too busy, Jin-young?

71
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,961
You're always going places too,
Seul-ki, right?

72
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,922
You and Jong-woo
seem to have a great time, huh?

73
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,091
Right?

74
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,554
It's nice
to have us all together.

75
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,516
-Let's have fun.
-It's too much for me, one-on-one…

76
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,517
Even with me?

77
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,810
-You?
-Yeah.

78
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,895
Want to have
one-on-one talk with me?

79
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,021
No, let's stop.

80
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,190
Jong-woo, you've changed.

81
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,858
Jong-woo's changed.

82
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,403
-After going to Paradise.
-No, I learned a lot.

83
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,655
-For sure.
-He's relaxed.

84
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,533
No, I can't relax just yet.

85
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,952
-You're relaxed.
-There's too many hyenas.

86
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,080
-Where's Seul-ki right now?
-She went to talk with Jin-young.

87
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,834
To get water. He said he's never done it.

88
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,297
Go stand over there,
I'll take one for you. Next to the ocean.

89
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,256
Okay.

90
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,719
That's nice. That's really nice.

91
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,265
One, two, three.

92
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,813
I feel awkward.
Why is taking pictures like this so…

93
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,858
-Wanna take one together?
-Sure.

94
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,943
First put the water
in the background.

95
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,113
One, two, three.

96
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,410
What is this?

97
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,329
That came out nice.

98
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,417
-The water is all done.
-Yes, it's done.

99
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,501
Yep.

100
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,713
Are they heavy? They are, aren't they?

101
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:43,426
-I don't care if they're heavy.
-You can put it on by yourself?

102
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,635
Yeah, I got this.

103
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,221
The guys couldn't put it on,
so I had to help.

104
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,766
I'm different, I guess.

105
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,143
I'm different, Seul-ki.

106
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,645
-Lead the way.
-Let's go.

107
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,359
This is nice.

108
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,613
I'll take one of you.

109
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,491
Why would you take a picture of this?

110
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,413
-How'd it come out?
-It came out really well.

111
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,790
Oh, yeah?

112
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,125
Oppa, you're good looking.

113
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,753
Good looking.

114
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,047
Hurry up, Seul-ki.

115
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,138
Jin-young keeps going to Seul-ki.

116
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,476
What are you going to do?

117
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,063
Me? I'm going to keep doing
what I've been doing so far.

118
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,568
I'm still very anxious
because even though it was really nice

119
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:46,614
when we went to Paradise,
it could have been nice only for me.

120
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,574
She might not have felt the same way.

121
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,830
But Seul-ki seemed like she enjoyed it.

122
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,333
My heart fluttered
for the first time in a while.

123
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,211
-Really?
-Yeah, my heart was literally pounding.

124
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,754
I'm jealous.

125
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,673
And I couldn't look her in the eyes.

126
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,218
Good for you, though,
that you were able to feel that way.

127
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,638
What's taking them so long?
Are they going to talk all day?

128
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,891
I think they're going to talk all day.

129
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,440
I don't think I'll be able to figure out
how Jin-young feels.

130
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,317
I talked with him yesterday,
but I'm still not sure.

131
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,781
It would be nice if Jin-young
and I could switch places, right?

132
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,200
-Since you want to talk to Jin-young?
-Yeah.

133
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,704
This is nice.

134
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,508
It feels like whenever we try to talk,

135
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,011
we have a hard time
opening our mouths to start.

136
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,473
-Right?
-Yeah.

137
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,099
I wonder why that is.

138
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,646
Did I tell you?

139
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,650
-About the dugout battle? Did I tell you?
-What?

140
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,361
That you looked really cool.

141
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,363
No.

142
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,698
Did I tell you?

143
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,951
You said I looked cool,
but you didn't say I looked really cool.

144
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,288
Yes, I did.

145
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,540
But you just said
that I looked cool…

146
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,460
I shouldn't have said anything.
You're all proud now.

147
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,046
-Gosh, no.
-I'm going to stop.

148
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,548
I'm not like that. I'm a humble person.

149
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,386
But you really did look cool. No.

150
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,389
-I looked cool?
-No.

151
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,187
See? Seul-ki's heart is with Jin-young.

152
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,231
Let's stop watching this.

153
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,816
Her awkwardness only comes out
when she's with him.

154
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,276
Yeah.

155
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,153
Seul-ki is always so confident.

156
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,156
Who did you cheer for?

157
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,702
-Can I be honest?
-Of course.

158
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,622
-Be honest.
-Really? Honestly?

159
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,334
At the time, I hoped Jong-woo would win.

160
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,460
Hmm.

161
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,587
But…

162
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,341
I think my eyes were on you.

163
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,137
The whole time.

164
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,779
I was watching you
in the Korean wrestling, too.

165
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,451
I wonder how funny I looked.
Who'd you cheer for?

166
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,786
-Me?
-Yeah.

167
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,621
I cheered for you.

168
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,047
What did you say is the most important
in a potential romantic partner?

169
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,383
-Me?
-Yeah.

170
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,803
Ah. Someone with a pretty smile.

171
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,847
-Yeah.
-Someone who smiles with their eyes.

172
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,307
-Yeah.
-Right.

173
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,685
What about on the inside?
What do you say about that?

174
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,187
Someone… like you?

175
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,235
It's over.

176
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,906
Who else is like Jin-young on the inside?

177
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,535
-Right?
-She's just saying she likes him.

178
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,121
It feels like the final confession
of her feelings.

179
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,167
Someone… like you?

180
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,839
Someone like me? What kind of person am I?

181
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,511
-Hmm?
-Kind of…

182
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,100
Like someone who's on my mind?

183
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,160
You and Jong-woo,
even though I like Jong-woo a lot,

184
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,206
I kind of hated seeing you with Jong-woo.

185
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,630
To be honest, when we went yesterday,
I had to wait because I was third place.

186
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,550
And I didn't want to look at you two.

187
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,765
Well, how are you?

188
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,267
Do you think you've decided?

189
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,686
Hmm…

190
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,648
Yeah.

191
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,864
-Oppa, have you decided?
-Me? No, I haven't yet.

192
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,117
I don't…

193
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:47,331
think it's over yet, so I'm going
to have to see how things play out.

194
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,500
I see.

195
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,715
-Wow.
-Until the very end.

196
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,468
He has her wrapped around his finger.

197
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,179
He's the best I've ever seen.

198
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,181
He keeps staying out of her reach.

199
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,809
Yeah, when she tries
to reach for him, he keeps…

200
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,229
I see.

201
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,940
I'm also still worried about some things.

202
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,403
Like what?

203
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,699
Honestly, I don't think
my job right now is…

204
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,036
I don't think I've settled down
after being discharged from the army.

205
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:35,629
Which is why I wanted to meet…
someone who's stable before coming here.

206
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,009
Because I'm so busy taking care of…

207
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,345
myself right now that…

208
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,768
If I find myself having to take care
of myself and my girlfriend,

209
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,271
I don't think I'll be able to do it well.

210
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,565
But since I'm only human,

211
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,068
I think I wanted…

212
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,033
to be with someone who I just like,
who my heart leans toward.

213
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,661
Which is why my head
is all over the place right now.

214
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,713
If you make things
complicated for yourself,

215
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,007
you could become even more conflicted.

216
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,053
Just do your best with how you feel.

217
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:32,561
I came here thinking that I really wanted
to meet someone I really connect to.

218
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,025
I think I'm thinking too much.

219
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,070
KIM JIN-YOUNG

220
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:45,491
The thing I had to consider
about Seul-ki was what she does.

221
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,828
She's still a student and she probably
has a long way ahead of her.

222
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,623
And a lot of things she wants to do.

223
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,417
The thought that it could be hard
for me to be there for her

224
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:00,172
during that time came to my mind,
so I am conflicted about that.

225
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,425
Wow.

226
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,594
Both Seul-ki and Nadine are students.

227
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,473
So it's possible
that Jin-young is thinking

228
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,893
that they might not have time
to spare for relationships.

229
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,565
The way I see it, he thought of things
like that for many reasons.

230
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,485
But since Jin-young is saying that…

231
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,030
It feels like he's here
to find someone he could marry.

232
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,450
Exactly. It's just dating, but he's
suddenly getting himself in way too deep.

233
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,872
It feels like he wants to be with a person
with their future in mind.

234
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,292
He might be thinking
ahead in terms of the future.

235
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,128
-Because he's not stable.
-About himself.

236
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,589
He's worried that when his girlfriend

237
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,049
tries to lean on him
or wants him to support her,

238
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,718
he won't be able to fulfill that.

239
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,638
-He's getting way ahead of himself.
-That's right.

240
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,183
Anyway from Seul-ki's perspective,
she's like "What is he talking about?"

241
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,269
I do think this is difficult for her.

242
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:59,023
From her perspective, she could take that
as a sign that he's rejecting her.

243
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,526
So I have this hope that
maybe Seul-ki might choose Jong-woo.

244
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,362
-That's right, because…
-Are we not letting go of that hope?

245
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,572
She could.

246
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,034
Jin-young wasn't conflicted at all
about who to choose.

247
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,705
He was conflicted about the future
of his relationship with Seul-ki.

248
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:19,043
But she could have interpreted that
as him being conflicted between people?

249
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,754
What's for sure is that Seul-ki

250
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,381
is completely different
when she's with Jin-young

251
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,968
compared to when she's with Jong-woo,
Dong-woo or anyone else.

252
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,804
-Right.
-I feel like she's totally different.

253
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,182
-I can feel that she's in love.
-Right.

254
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,066
Feels like time goes by
the slowest when I'm waiting.

255
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,987
We should relax.

256
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,366
It's difficult to watch them and relax.

257
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,995
Watch every ten minutes,
every five minutes.

258
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,040
We'll be able to see them come down.

259
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,292
I can see the people over here,

260
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,253
so I'm making sure
we'll be able to see them first.

261
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,591
Another two people
who are waiting for those two.

262
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,509
Yes.

263
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,761
There are two teams waiting for them.

264
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,596
There's a waiting list.

265
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,934
There's something
I'm upset with you about, Oppa.

266
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,645
Why are you upset with me?
All of a sudden?

267
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,397
-Yeah.
-Why?

268
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,983
-No.
-What do you mean, "No"?

269
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,568
-Nothing.
-Finish what you were saying.

270
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,113
Just know there is something.

271
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,156
They're coming back.

272
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,368
-Let's go, then.
-Go?

273
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,536
Yeah.

274
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,582
Why won't you tell me?

275
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,003
Why are you making me feel uncomfortable?

276
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,548
-No, but…
-You're such a fox, Seul-ki.

277
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,883
You're the fox.

278
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,679
Seul-ki, you're really good
at shaking things up inside a person.

279
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,974
What are you doing here?

280
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,184
Why are you walking so slowly?

281
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,895
What are those two doing together?

282
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,648
Let's just wait.

283
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,316
Stop walking.

284
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,403
Okay.
"Stop walking". That's funny.

285
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,448
Stop walking. Let's relax.

286
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,825
It's already funny.

287
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,995
You walk so slowly.
I thought you were a turtle.

288
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,167
Why don't we swap
around with each other?

289
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,920
-Oh! They left.
-Where?

290
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,048
They're not at their seats.

291
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,717
-Dong-woo?
-Dong-woo and Seul-ki.

292
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,470
-Oh.
-And Min-su and Jin-young.

293
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,681
They intercepted them.

294
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:42,311
It's like when you're about to hail a taxi
but someone steps in

295
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,230
and grabs it right in front of you.

296
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,442
-That feeling of…
-You're left waiting and

297
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,445
you go "Oh, we should have
stood further up the street."

298
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,989
It's like, "We could've
stood in front of them."

299
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,539
Seul-ki must be getting tired of this.

300
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,958
So much talking.

301
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,294
No?

302
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,547
I missed you
after spending two nights together

303
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,091
and then not being around you.

304
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,843
-Oh, yeah, is that right?
-Yeah.

305
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,055
You're coming on strong
all of a sudden, Min-su.

306
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,766
-Yeah?
-What was that?

307
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,477
You took me off-guard with that just now.

308
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,479
I'm so shocked right now.

309
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,149
Have a seat.

310
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,944
I think there's water in here.

311
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,739
There's ice in there.

312
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,868
Seul-ki, let's be comfortable and talk.

313
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,953
Yes, all right.

314
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,336
How are you? Did you have
a good time in Paradise?

315
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:53,549
Yeah, I did have a good time in Paradise.
I talked with Jong-woo, and it was fun.

316
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,300
I'm curious to know what you did.

317
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,639
How was it for you?

318
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,433
-Is it nine days? Eight days?
-Yeah.

319
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,436
You think time went quickly or slowly?

320
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,771
Feels like a blur.

321
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,151
Not just here. The time
when we went to Paradise is a blur too.

322
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,153
Feels like it was such a long time ago.

323
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,864
Now that I think about it,
I think it just flew by.

324
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,865
Hmm.

325
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,117
Right. I thought…

326
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:24,746
time was going by so slowly
but now it's already the last night.

327
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,584
Anyway, I…

328
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,378
I'm going to stick to…

329
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,632
the path I chose in the beginning
when we came here.

330
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,970
I'm not sure if you'll choose me but…

331
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,640
I respect your decision,

332
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,018
and I want you to always
be happy in the future.

333
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,228
I hope everything works out well for you.

334
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,278
-Yeah.
-I feel the same way.

335
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,575
Dong-woo is single-hearted, too, really.

336
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:05,746
Dong-woo is a doctor
and with those looks and that body--

337
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,166
-Not used to being rejected.
-You'd think women would be lining up.

338
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,169
But look at him here,
look at how dejected he is.

339
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,632
I don't know if you remember, but when
Seul-ki wasn't interested in him at first,

340
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,301
Dong-woo really couldn't believe it.

341
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,719
-His face--
-Right.

342
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,846
I remember it.
It got progressively more--

343
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,097
"What's happening?"

344
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,934
This island is a place
that humbles people.

345
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,561
I think he'll be leaving very humbled.

346
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,105
-Reflecting on himself?
-Yeah.

347
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,818
Did you have fun yesterday?
Did you talk a lot with other people?

348
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,780
Yeah, I did talk
with a lot of other people.

349
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:43,700
Yesterday, I had a lot on my mind,
so I also stayed in the tent a lot.

350
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,704
But I was reminded of you then, too.

351
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,374
-Yeah?
-This really isn't easy.

352
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,795
I thought we definitely
did have a good experience together.

353
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,089
Right, we did have a good experience.

354
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,720
Since that day, I have been worried
about things being weird between us.

355
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,765
"Will I be able to talk to him
before we leave?"

356
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,226
That's what I was thinking.

357
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,896
No matter what happens,
I had a lot of great experiences here.

358
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,734
I really enjoyed the time
I spent with you, Oppa.

359
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,987
I am very thankful for that.

360
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,658
And the reason why I wasn't really
uncomfortable when I first got here,

361
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,326
is also thanks to you, Oppa.

362
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,246
-Yeah?
-I'm thankful for that, too.

363
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,499
And I wanted to tell you that.

364
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,253
I'm thankful and it's been so nice.

365
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,754
It's been nice for me, too.

366
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,305
Nadine!

367
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,557
-Seo-eun.
-Dinner.

368
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,310
I'm so conflicted right now.

369
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,605
May I?

370
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,649
Of course.

371
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,151
Thank you.

372
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,486
I don't know what to do.

373
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:07,451
Jin-young went to Seul-ki first this time.

374
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,078
And now, Min-su went to Jin-young.

375
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,247
And I'm gonna go…

376
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:17,210
It's so complicated
and Min-su really likes Jin-young.

377
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,965
-Min-su is 100 percent Jin-young.
-I think so, too.

378
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,509
I think Min-su is having
a breakdown right now.

379
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,388
Wow.

380
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,308
I didn't know it was that bad.

381
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,312
So I… don't know.

382
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,775
I don't know.

383
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,947
It's going to be really hard for Nadine
to go to Jin-young in this situation.

384
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,034
Nadine's already taken
a lot of courageous steps.

385
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,620
And she's not the type of person
who's good at that.

386
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,872
Right. Nadine wants things to be natural.

387
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,249
She's so bad at doing those things.

388
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,503
But she has to fight and be courageous,
which makes things hard for her.

389
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,719
-Where are you going?
-I was on my way to you.

390
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,221
Is that so?

391
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,598
Yes. Would you like
to talk with me?

392
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,643
-Sure, shall we?
-Let's go to the beach.

393
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,561
Okay. The beach.

394
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,856
What did you do yesterday?
Have fun?

395
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,900
-Paradise?
-Did you eat a lot?

396
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,361
I had hangover soup for breakfast.

397
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,113
You heard we had chicken, right?

398
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,739
-Yeah.
-Raw chicken.

399
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,199
I was so shocked.

400
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,743
I heard how you
prepared all of them so deliciously.

401
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,371
And the sauce Se-jeong made was amazing.

402
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,040
Yeah. Se-jeong's cooking skills
have improve so much.

403
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:40,585
Yeah. My position feels threatened by her.

404
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,339
-I'm a little anxious.
-You need to be on your toes, Mr. Chef.

405
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:47,092
It's the last day so I'm… you know, right?

406
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,636
Of course I know,
why are you trying to hide it?

407
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,099
-Do you all of a sudden feel awkward?
-No, I've been hiding it from everyone.

408
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,102
Come on, aren't you
taking it a little too seriously?

409
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,154
It's complicated.

410
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,365
It's complicated.

411
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,833
In my life,

412
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,713
I think of myself as someone
who is not an emotional person.

413
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,258
But thanks to you, Seo-eun,

414
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,929
I realized that
I do have emotions.

415
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:38,143
My emotion right now
is that I want you to be happy.

416
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,648
My thought was just that
I wanted you as a person to be happy.

417
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,527
So I don't know
what this other feeling is.

418
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:52,782
So I didn't try to do anything about it
and I just cheered for you.

419
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,204
I think it's just my way
of going about things.

420
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,831
So it was a really nice memory.

421
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,174
What do you think, here on the last day?

422
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,094
Did you have a meaningful time?

423
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,807
I had so much fun, thanks to you.

424
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,435
That's good.

425
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:24,189
And I'm thankful
and very grateful, so honestly…

426
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,983
since I only feel appreciative, it's like…

427
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,780
It's enough.

428
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,701
Just that.

429
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,330
I'm thankful that
you think of me that way.

430
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,341
Oh.

431
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,135
-What even is love?
-Right?

432
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,847
I think Min-su's tears
are tears of resignation.

433
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,307
I think so, too.

434
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,143
Han-bin's smile is also like,
"I understand everything."

435
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,603
"I respect your decision."

436
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,480
A smile that shows he understands.

437
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,940
-Right. Han-bin is such a good person.
-Yeah.

438
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,902
Right? Without applying pressure
until the very end.

439
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:38,656
How he honestly expressed his feelings
for the last time is really sweet.

440
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,083
I just got used to things here
and now we have to leave.

441
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,460
-It's the last night.
-Yeah.

442
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,463
-It's really over.
-I know.

443
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,591
Wow!

444
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,260
Tonight they gave us soda.

445
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,516
-Should I sit here?
-Yeah.

446
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,945
It's our last night!

447
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,321
Let's have fun!

448
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,865
-It's so sad, though.
-Let's raise a toast.

449
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,450
Let's raise a toast.

450
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,494
Cheers!

451
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,288
Thank you
for your efforts, everyone.

452
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,964
It really feels like
it's coming to an end.

453
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,966
Only a few hours left.

454
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,719
I can't believe
it's already over.

455
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,181
So sad.

456
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,811
To the last day.

457
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,440
Should we finally
reveal our jobs and ages?

458
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,150
Yeah.

459
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,651
I'm really curious.

460
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,737
I'm excited.

461
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,071
Nobody knows right now.

462
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,157
Yes, I'm the mystery woman.

463
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,201
I'm 26 years old.

464
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:10,331
And what I do is, I'm currently managed
by an agency and working as a model.

465
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,627
I am a model.

466
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,882
Currently working mainly
as a commercial model.

467
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,095
I've been advertising for Sony
and for BMW vehicles.

468
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,019
The reason I do what I do is because
I like clothes and taking pictures.

469
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,730
So this line of work came to me naturally.

470
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,190
PARK SE-JEONG
26, MODEL

471
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,653
Hot girl!

472
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,363
Hot girl!

473
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,617
My age is…

474
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,244
I'm really looking forward to this.

475
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,333
-Thirty two years old.
-Wow!

476
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,585
No wonder you sound like a big brother.

477
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,421
Thirty-two?

478
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,174
My job is… plastic surgeon.

479
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,802
What? That's shocking!

480
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,845
I told you
I thought he was a doctor.

481
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,972
Oh, my God.

482
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,559
That's why he was so careful
not to get hurt when we played the games.

483
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,229
I went easy on you guys because
I was worried you'd get hurt.

484
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,314
You can fix us, though.

485
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,192
"You can fix us." This is fun.
So much fun.

486
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,070
-That's cool.
-That's amazing.

487
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,571
It's me. Yes.

488
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,115
I'm really curious.

489
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,243
Your age first.

490
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,161
-My age is…
-Twenty-nine?

491
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,956
-Twenty-five?
-Twenty-five? Twenty-nine?

492
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,207
I'm 24 years old.

493
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,628
He's younger than you.

494
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,047
Twenty-four? Twenty-four?

495
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,924
Wait, you're eight years younger than me?

496
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,634
Okay, you?

497
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,513
Are you okay?
You look like you're in shock.

498
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,807
-Oh, my God!
-Really?

499
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,395
His face turned pale.

500
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,565
-What's wrong, Jong-woo?
-I called him hyung assuming he was older.

501
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,482
Really?

502
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,193
Yeah, Jong-woo thought
he was the youngest.

503
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,404
Hyung, thank you for all your efforts.

504
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,282
-You're telling me I'm older?
-He's younger.

505
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,702
You still feel hyung to me.
Even after hearing your age.

506
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,079
Jong-woo's stunned.

507
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,998
I have a lot to learn
from someone younger.

508
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,126
How old are you, Yoong-jae?

509
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,086
I am…

510
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,965
I heard he's young.

511
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:28,094
-He's in his 20's.
-I'm really curious.

512
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,182
Thirty-two.

513
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,517
Thirty-two.

514
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,313
He's friends with Dong-woo.

515
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,316
Thirty-two?

516
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,611
This is a major plot twist.

517
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:49,741
I'm currently working
at a stock brokerage firm in Yeouido.

518
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,951
-I knew it.
-That's cool.

519
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:57,248
Nadine.

520
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,919
-I'm curious about your age.
-I'm 23 years old.

521
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,463
Baby!

522
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,507
They're the same age.

523
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,761
I'm currently a university student
in the States.

524
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,265
-What university?
-Where at?

525
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,309
I go to Harvard University.

526
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:19,771
-Harvard?
-What? Harvard?

527
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,943
Nadine, I'm sorry
for talking to you so casually.

528
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,070
I didn't realize you were
that kind of a person.

529
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,200
After we get out of here,
please don't think of me in a bad way.

530
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,244
-Oh, no.
-I apologize.

531
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,373
He's so startled.

532
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,542
-I like Se-jun's personality, he's funny.
-Yeah.

533
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,545
Can I ask a question to Yoong-jae?

534
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,466
Who did you pick
for the first impressions vote?

535
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,677
We can talk about that now.

536
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,556
For the first impressions vote,
I picked Se-jeong.

537
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,725
Oh.

538
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,894
I sat right next to her, so.

539
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,106
I voted for one of the few people
I'd talked to at the time.

540
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,529
We're allowed to talk
about this. Should we take turns?

541
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,489
Do you have something in mind, Jin-young?

542
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,741
First impressions.
When you first came here.

543
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,243
For me…

544
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,252
For me, it was Seul-ki.

545
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,379
She was the closest to my ideal type.

546
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,840
Direct answer.

547
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,558
-Jong-woo?
-I picked Seul-ki.

548
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,728
From the moment we made our entrance.

549
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,271
One woman man.

550
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,067
I picked her.

551
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:54,282
I want to ask Seul-ki, who I think
will be one of the key people tomorrow.

552
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,913
Have you decided
on who you'll choose tomorrow?

553
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,636
Yes.

554
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,524
I want to ask Jin-young something.

555
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,109
Jin-young,

556
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,490
during the dugout battle,

557
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,995
you and I were fighting, one-on-one.

558
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,164
At the time,

559
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,377
were you playing the game
with the same thought I had?

560
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,593
I just want to hear what you have to say.

561
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,693
Definitely.

562
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,863
Definitely?

563
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,628
This is heavy.

564
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,757
We don't have to say that
because we felt it

565
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,467
as our bodies crashed into each other.

566
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,635
Yeah.

567
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,179
We did communicate with each other.

568
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,812
I'd like to ask Seul-ki something.

569
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,821
Did you like the Paradise
you went to with me?

570
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:59,532
Or did you like the Paradise
you went to with Jong-woo?

571
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,618
-Savage.
-Oh, my.

572
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,829
-This is brutal.
-Wow.

573
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,831
Oh, my gosh.

574
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,709
They started out light
but now what is this?

575
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,835
I know!

576
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,132
It's getting hot in here.

577
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,274
I'm going to have to answer, no comments.

578
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,694
-Okay.
-Let me keep that to myself.

579
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,374
Well, as the oldest out of the girls,

580
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,628
it was so nice to do this with you all.

581
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,256
I don't think I'll ever forget
the time we had here.

582
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,051
And I want to say that I am very grateful

583
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:03,387
to have spent this beautiful
and radiant time together.

584
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,933
I hope we all keep seeing each other.

585
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:15,191
It was such a short time for us to try
and get to know each other well.

586
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:20,446
Since we each have our separate lives,
so I hope that even after we leave here,

587
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,950
we get to know each other more,

588
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,578
and build our relationships
into something better.

589
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,831
Thank you for your efforts, everyone.

590
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,920
I'm so relatively young,

591
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,257
and I don't have
a lot of dating experience.

592
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:44,762
But I definitely think I learned how
to express my feelings more honestly.

593
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,935
I think it was really nice.

594
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,860
I don't think I've ever…

595
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,905
really had the feeling

596
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,201
of my heart fluttering
since I've been an adult.

597
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:13,624
So it was nice to feel this emotion
that has been hidden away.

598
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,586
I'm still not good at expressing myself.

599
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:22,717
But I did feel like I got to be honest
with how I felt a lot.

600
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,303
So…

601
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,391
I'm…

602
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,857
so thankful and just…

603
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,653
Jong-woo?

604
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,113
Are you crying?

605
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,452
-It's okay.
-Don't cry.

606
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,371
Jong-woo.

607
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,750
It's okay.

608
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,870
Why am I so affected
by seeing a man crying?

609
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,872
I understand how Jong-woo feels.

610
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,374
It is sad.

611
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,042
I feel so sad.

612
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,921
There's something about Jong-woo
that gets you crying with him.

613
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,465
It's like, Jong-woo is a bit young,

614
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,259
and it seems like
what he's experiencing is pure love.

615
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,053
I get what you mean.

616
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,722
And I think Seul-ki
feels that feeling from him.

617
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,016
What's amazing is that Jin-young

618
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,977
asked who she liked
being in Paradise with better.

619
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,522
And Seul-ki said no comment.

620
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:05,569
That "no comment" felt to me like,
saying Jin-young in a way.

621
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,695
Yeah, that's right.

622
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,614
She was just being
considerate of Jong-woo.

623
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,033
She was being considerate of Jong-woo.

624
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,452
Why is this so sad?

625
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:23,564
The hottest inferno
in the world, Single's Inferno.

626
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,900
Today is the last day.

627
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,528
We will now begin the final decision.

628
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:38,329
The women are already waiting
for the men at the final decision spots.

00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,427
PARK SE-JEONG

633
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,474
CHOI SEO-EUN

634
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:08,150
The men will go to the spots where
the women they chose are standing.

635
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,905
If the man who comes to the woman

636
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,158
is the same man that
that woman has chosen,

637
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,619
they will become a final couple.

638
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,918
I personally think we're going to see
swarms around certain people.

639
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,753
Seul-ki will be getting three votes.

640
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:31,298
Jong-woo, Dong-woo and Jin-young
will be going to her.

641
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,802
And then there's the votes
swarmed around Jin-young.

642
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:39,431
Seul-ki, Nadine, Min-su, Se-jeong.

643
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,100
There will be swarms there too,

644
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,935
but I don't know
what choices will be made.

645
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,022
Hanhae, you think Seul-ki
and Jin-young will end up together?

646
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,440
Or will it be…

647
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,068
I think she'll choose Jin-young.

648
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,237
She'll follow her heart.

649
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,698
Some others have the same idea, though.

650
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:59,410
-I think it's Seul-ki and Jong-woo.
-Jong-woo? You won't give up.

651
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,412
Over and over.

652
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,205
I still think it will work out.

653
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,540
You're so consistent.

654
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:07,334
What do think will happen
with Se-jun and So-e?

655
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,961
I think it'll work out.

656
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,338
I'm not sure if

657
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,633
her feelings for him are romantic
or just appreciative.

658
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,343
I think she'll say, "I'm sorry."

659
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,095
-Right.
-I'm really curious.

660
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,931
The votes will be swarming
around some people.

661
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,814
Kim Han-bin, please go first.

662
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,358
-See you.
-See you later.

663
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,875
-Han-bin will go to Seo-eun, right?
-Right.

664
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,252
Yeah, he did express
his feelings the day before.

665
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,755
So-e!

666
00:43:55,424 --> 00:44:01,138
You really are the most important person
to me on Single's Inferno.

667
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,514
Thanks, you too.

668
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,267
-You've got this.
-Yeah.

669
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,023
I wanted the person
I like to just be happy.

670
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,778
And not be stressed, which is why
I didn't approach her as much.

671
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,532
But since this is the last time, it is
better to be selfish with my decision.

672
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,997
You're wearing blue.

673
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,125
Blue is my favorite color.

674
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,127
-You cold?
-You're wearing blue.

675
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,171
-Sorry you had to wait.
-It was fine.

676
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,965
That looks pretty good on you.

677
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,014
-The weather's amazing.
-It is.

678
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,938
Choi Jong-woo, please go next.

679
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,440
See you later.

680
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,161
Jong-woo has a long way to go.

681
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,580
Right.

682
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:22,177
She's the person
I've had feelings for since the beginning.

683
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,018
Hello.

684
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:35,149
-Are you nervous?
-Yes, I'm very nervous.

685
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,867
Being on Inferno with Seul-ki
really felt like paradise.

686
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:50,289
Let's take one together.
How do we do this?

687
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:53,292
-In selfie mode.
-One, two, three.

688
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,004
You two look nice.

689
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:00,132
Yun Seul-ki. Sorry, I'm sorry.

690
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,802
-I like it.
-Yeah, Yun Seul-ki.

691
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,807
For me it's a time where
every single moment was happy.

692
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,393
I think I liked everything about it.

693
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,570
-You did great.
-You did great.

694
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:24,364
I had the most fun
when I talked with you, Nadine.

695
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,576
-Bye.
-Yeah.

696
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,703
Good luck.

697
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,747
You've got this.

698
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,799
Because my heart
is full of only Seul-ki,

699
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,720
I will choose Seul-ki
regardless of what happens.

700
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,979
-He has his sight set on one path.
-Right.

701
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,023
He's single-hearted.

702
00:46:58,774 --> 00:46:59,900
It's admirable.

703
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,324
You must be cold.

704
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,326
No, I'm okay.

705
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,452
-You okay?
-Yeah.

706
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,375
The walk here was long, huh?

707
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,210
Yeah, it was farther than I thought.

708
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,685
Jo Yoong-jae, please go next.

709
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,158
When I'm with her,
our conversation keeps going non-stop.

710
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:55,872
Even though we talk a lot,
it's still not enough for me.

711
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,752
I want to see her
more than just for this summer.

712
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,674
It's So-e, then Se-jeong, then Seo-eun.

713
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,886
-Along the beach. It's so cruel.
-It is.

714
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,825
It was cool how brave you were.
Thank you for your efforts.

715
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,535
Thanks. Bye.

716
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,556
Suddenly hit me.

717
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,310
The three of us will be having a chat.

718
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,611
This is…

719
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,708
Kim Se-jun, please go next.

720
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:33,929
She has this thing about her
that keeps making me think about her.

721
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:39,643
Regardless of what happens, I want to
make her happy once we've left this place.

722
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:44,314
He's going to go to So-e.
I have a feeling.

723
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,961
-It's such a relief that So-e has Se-jun.
-Right.

724
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,380
No matter what So-e chooses.

725
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,349
Shin Dong-woo, please go next.

726
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,695
So there's Min-su.

727
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,948
Nadine, Seul-ki.

728
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,868
So he has to stop there.
That's Nadine, then Seul-ki.

729
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,537
-Over there.
-The vortex.

730
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,748
That vortex is very big.

731
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:49,379
I wanted to take care of her,
joke around with her.

732
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,174
She crept into my heart
so I wanted to treat her well.

733
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:55,218
I feel like I missed my opportunity
so I've been very disappointed.

734
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,138
But still, I should act with all my heart.

735
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,807
With that in mind, I'm gonna do my best.

736
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,696
Nadine.

737
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,115
Yeah.

738
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,118
It was nice meeting you.

739
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,661
Nice meeting you, as well.

740
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,580
-You're a wonderful person.
-Thank you.

741
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,040
Give me a hug.

742
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,672
-See you later.
-Bye.

743
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,565
Hi.

744
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,734
-Hi.
-You're here.

745
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,843
Kim Jin-young, please start.

746
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:29,312
I'm curious about this one.
Will he come down or go up?

747
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,899
He's so popular
that it's a bit complicated.

748
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,068
This is hard.

749
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,739
He came late but he was
more intense than anyone else.

750
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,740
Yes.

751
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:43,618
I'm curious about
who Jin-young will choose.

752
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,995
Me too.

753
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:48,164
No one seems to know
what's going on inside his head.

754
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,375
♪ I'm gonna be the last one standing ♪

755
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,714
♪ I'm gonna be the last one standing ♪

756
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,136
♪ I'm gonna be the last one standing ♪

757
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:04,139
♪ Because you're never
Gonna bring me down ♪

758
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,600
♪ I'll be the last one standing ♪

759
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,811
♪ Because you're never
Gonna bring me down… ♪

760
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:14,107
He has to go pass Min-su
no matter what.

761
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,665
Let's talk some more when we get out.

762
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,793
You did great.

763
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,799
-You're not crying, are you?
-I cried all my tears yesterday.

764
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,384
See you on the outside.

765
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,607
The last one's coming now.

766
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,276
I think it will be Seul-ki.

767
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,158
This is intense.

768
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,661
Will it be Nadine or Seul-ki?

769
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:14,709
In my life, I strongly believe
in how I feel, how I sense things.

770
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,796
I don't think the decisions I've made
were ever hugely wrong.

771
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:27,514
-Hey.
-Hey.

772
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,778
You look nice today.

773
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,071
Oh, thanks.

774
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,620
-Is he staying?
-What?

775
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:51,788
I think he's staying.

776
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:01,423
What?

777
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,343
What?

778
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:09,055
-Is he standing next to her?
-No way, is this for real?

779
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,601
-I had fun.
-Yeah.

780
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,770
-It was nice.
-Same.

781
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:19,983
I'll always support you
until your dreams come true.

782
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,193
Yeah, thanks.

783
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:27,282
Thanks.

784
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,167
-Ah.
-Oh, jeez.

785
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,418
I mean…

786
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,506
I thought, because he stood next to her.

787
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,507
Me too.

788
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:56,019
When I see a woman, it takes
me only three seconds to feel sparks.

789
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,813
The person whose first impression
up until the very end

790
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,899
that I felt the strongest sparks with,

791
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:03,193
the person I enjoyed
my time with the most,

792
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,820
that person is definitely Seul-ki.

793
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,502
This is nice.

794
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,422
So we're all here.

795
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,051
Yeah.

796
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:44,025
You were there for a while
so I thought you weren't coming.

797
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,113
You didn't go around did you?

798
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,197
No.

799
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:13,179
-They all went where we expected.
-I know. Is this how they all end up?

800
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,932
Only the women's choices are left.

801
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:19,894
If the women's choice is one of the men
who's also chosen them,

802
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:23,398
then the woman will take his hand
and they'll leave Inferno together.

803
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:28,486
But if the man is not among those who
chose them, they'll be staying on Inferno.

804
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,919
I keep having you on my mind.

805
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,590
And I feel nervous

806
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:51,176
whenever you're out of my sight.

807
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:55,054
I chose you because I couldn't deny
I had feelings for you.

808
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,810
To be honest, before you came here, Oppa,

809
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,689
I was feeling very discouraged
and exhausted.

810
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:10,987
And I'm so thankful to you
for getting me out of that.

811
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:32,425
Does she choose him or not?

812
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,638
He could be someone she appreciates
but not someone she likes.

813
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:50,235
-Let's go.
-Yes, let's go.

814
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,656
Really?

815
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,993
-Wow.
-Wow, the end.

816
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,163
Thank you for your effort, So-e.

817
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,207
-Thank you for your efforts, Oppa.
-Yes.

818
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,710
So-e and Se-jun left.

819
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,798
-The two of them are wearing white.
-I know.

820
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,885
-I'm really going to visit.
-Yeah, come visit.

821
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,972
I think it would be cool.
Think it'll look cool.

822
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,265
Who, me?

823
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:24,060
No! I mean, where you work, Oppa.

824
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:26,396
-Not me?
-No.

825
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,857
You're cool, too,
but I meant where you work.

826
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,611
I fell here yesterday.

827
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:36,114
Show me, where did you fall?

828
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,241
-There.
-Oh.

829
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:40,910
I told you to be careful.

830
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,830
I'm amazed at how
you didn't get hurt even once.

831
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,292
See, this is why I get worried
when you leave my sight.

832
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:51,129
This is why I get anxious
when I can't see where you are.

833
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,047
Okay.

834
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:57,302
A line from a TV show.
"I told you to be careful."

835
00:59:57,385 --> 01:00:00,221
-The line they say at the end.
-Like Lovers in Paris.

836
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,390
It's like, "Let's go, baby."

837
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,560
-Cute couple.
-Yeah.

838
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:11,190
It feels different leaving
on this path with you.

839
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,116
I'm nervous.

840
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,118
Very.

841
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,464
No matter what you decide,

842
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:39,594
that's your answer
and I support your decision 100%.

843
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,644
Seo-eun,

844
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,981
I'd like you to be with me.

845
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:06,412
At first we started talking
by coincidence.

846
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,956
But after that I'm so thankful

847
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,751
that we got the chance
to make even more memories.

848
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,796
The time we spent here was happy.

849
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,513
Thank you, Han-bin,
for always putting others first

850
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:26,224
and for always having such bright energy.

851
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,813
I really support you, Han-bin,
just as you support my decision.

852
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,232
And I think you'll always shine.

853
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:47,745
So…

854
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,332
So…

855
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:55,002
Shall we go?

856
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,635
The weather's nice.

857
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,264
Are your feet okay?

858
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:08,683
-Yeah.
-Weren't you standing there for long?

859
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:12,270
I was but… It's so weird.

860
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:14,397
-What is?
-Doing it like this.

861
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,649
Why am I nervous?

862
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,236
It feels weird
to hold hands as we walk.

863
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,239
It's exciting and nice.

864
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,158
Same.

865
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,618
-This is nice.
-Yeah, very.

866
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:28,619
Very.

867
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:32,373
They're holding hands and walking,
it feels like they're dating now.

868
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:33,499
Yeah.

869
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:39,297
Let's go get some food
when we leave here.

870
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,506
All right.

871
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,633
-How about sashimi?
-All right.

872
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:45,386
I want to write down my number
and give it to you.

873
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:49,056
-We can have our phones now.
-Yes.

874
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:51,934
Oh, it really feels weird.

875
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:54,729
-Right?
-Yeah.

876
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:11,579
-Oh. They're so serious here, gosh.
-I wonder what will happen.

877
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,937
Seul-ki, thank you for making
heart-racing and exciting memories for me.

878
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,153
The reason I chose Seul-ki is

879
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,864
because Seul-ki was the only one
who moved my heart.

880
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:08,302
Seul-ki…

881
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,892
I think I like you.

882
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:21,524
Listen to him confessing
his feelings so plainly.

883
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,318
But that's what moves the heart.

884
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,280
He saying it so simply
without adding anything unnecessary.

885
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:33,870
I think I like you.

886
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:45,089
I realize once again
that I'm not good at expressing myself

887
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:46,966
during my time with her.

888
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:51,596
And I'm sorry if she ever got stressed
or had a hard time because of me.

889
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,682
When we get out of here,

890
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,102
I want to take her out for dinner.

891
01:04:58,978 --> 01:04:59,937
Yes.

892
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:03,149
I want to try expressing
how I feel more actively.

893
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:23,628
Seul-ki…

894
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,175
would you like to go get coffee with me?

895
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,433
I thought I expressed
my feelings in my own way.

896
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,270
But if that doesn't fully reach her heart,

897
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,606
I still tried my very best.

898
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:50,196
I would feel quite hurt, but still,
I will respect Seul-ki's decision.

899
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,854
Thank you for taking
the courage first, Oppa.

900
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:28,651
And I'll cheer for the path you are on.

901
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:31,445
As much as you cheer for me.

902
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,668
Thank you for approaching me
with such sincerity.

903
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:49,171
From the beginning until the very end.

904
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,723
Remember how I told you that

905
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:03,602
no matter what you decide to do,
I want you to always follow you heart?

906
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:07,106
Thank you for choosing me.

907
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:14,447
And I want you to know
you really are an awesome person.

908
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,461
The person I would
like to leave Inferno with is…

909
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,731
Choi Jong-woo.

910
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:01,660
See, I told you! Oh, my gosh.

911
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,337
-Oh, my God.
-Is this for real?

912
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,298
Oh, my God.

913
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,683
This is amazing.

914
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:28,521
Can you imagine how Jong-woo
feels right now?

915
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:32,191
-Keep playing it.
-No.

916
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,652
Oh, my God.

917
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:43,244
Choi Jong-woo.

918
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,627
Choi Jong-woo.

919
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,387
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

920
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,142
Let's go get coffee.

921
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:15,609
Oh, gosh!

922
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,196
I feel really numb.

923
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,448
My hands are so sweaty.

924
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:25,035
I'm sorry about my hands.
Let me wipe them.

925
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:28,539
Aren't you glad you kept going?

926
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:32,710
Yeah. I'm relieved
you were able to feel how I feel.

927
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:37,089
We'll have coffee for dessert.

928
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:41,594
-We'll go to a nice restaurant first.
-Sounds good.

929
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:44,597
-Did you know?
-About what?

930
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,266
-That I'd choose you?
-I had no idea.

931
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,102
-I was so nervous.
-I know.

932
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,062
My lips are trembling.

933
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,191
You said you made your decision yesterday.

934
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:58,152
-Yeah.
-Did you really decide yesterday?

935
01:09:58,235 --> 01:09:59,403
Yeah.

936
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:05,034
If I set this standard of whether I should
be with a guy who I like

937
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:07,828
or with a guy who likes me,

938
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,832
I've always dated the person who I liked.

939
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:18,547
But, while I was here,
Jong-woo has treated me so sincerely

940
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,633
since the beginning till the very end

941
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:24,845
and the feelings he expressed
to me felt very sincere.

942
01:10:26,096 --> 01:10:28,265
So, I think Jong-woo is the person

943
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:31,185
who broke the standards
I had set for myself.

944
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:36,899
I thought the person I could hang out with
like a friend and who makes me comfortable

945
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:40,778
to be the person
whom I can show my real self.

946
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:45,115
He always approached me first.

947
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:50,788
So now I want to tell him
that I want to approach him.

948
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:56,919
Jong-woo defeated me at the game,
he defeated me at love.

949
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,880
He defeated me at everything.

950
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,466
Jong-woo completely defeated me.

951
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:06,679
Escape! We're leaving.

952
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,391
I'm really leaving with you.

953
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:14,812
Feels like a dream to me.

954
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:16,689
Wonder how dreamy it is for Jong-woo.

955
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,524
Can't believe it ourselves right now.

956
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:23,570
My hand keeps sweating.

957
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:26,282
My hands usually don't tend to sweat.

958
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:29,243
I like it.

959
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:30,369
Really?

960
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,794
I think we've just witnessed
how if you keep knocking,

961
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:40,296
a door will open for you.

962
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:44,300
Why were you crying like that?
What made you tear up that way?

963
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,844
The way Jong-woo has been from the start.

964
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,514
Just endlessly vulnerable
and endlessly waiting for someone

965
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:52,766
had me really cheering for him.

966
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:56,103
I wasn't expecting this outcome at all.

967
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:59,732
-When it happened so unexpectedly…
-You two were sobbing your eyes out.

968
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:02,860
For me it was about how
when you get a little bit older,

969
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:04,862
you've lived your life to some extent,

970
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:08,532
it can be hard to love someone
just for who they are.

971
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:11,535
When you're young,
you go straight for the person you like.

972
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:13,787
But as you get older, you can't help

973
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:17,374
but start to consider the person's
circumstances and things like that.

974
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,209
Watching Jong-woo,

975
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:22,546
his unconditional love that
keeps him going toward Seul-ki,

976
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:26,175
with his eyes and his heart
only on Seul-ki,

977
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:28,761
it was something I wanted to cheer for.

978
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:31,347
I was like that when I was younger.

979
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,432
And it feels like I'd forgotten about it.

980
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,310
He reminded me about it once again.

981
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,480
Which is why I wanted to cheer
for him even more.

982
01:12:39,563 --> 01:12:41,148
This was a happy ending.

983
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:43,484
I'm sure lots of people cried,
not just us.

984
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:46,111
-I'm sure they cried a lot.
-It's a sea of tears.

985
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:50,574
Jong-woo's steady and quiet love
even changed Seul-ki's values.

986
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:54,578
-At the end, sincerity prevailed.
-Sincerity really does prevail.
