Uh, the person I would like
to go to Paradise with is…

15
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:12,489
The person I would like
to go to Paradise with is Han-bin.

HANHAE, HONG JIN-KYUNG,
LEE DA-HEE, KYUHYUN

00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,077
What?

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,039
She gave up.

19
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,540
Huh?

20
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,503
The person who
Lee So-e has chosen is

21
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,713
Kim Han-bin.

22
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,008
Kim Han-bin.

23
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,011
Kim Han-bin.

24
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,387
Kim Han-bin, please come outside.

25
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,266
-Guess she wanted to have fun.
-…and leave for Paradise with Lee So-e.

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,727
See you. You remember
how to make rice in the cauldron?

27
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,938
-Just like you.
-Oh, we have a problem.

28
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,528
So-e's choice is quite…

29
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,490
unexpected, very much so.

30
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,746
Hi.

31
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,083
-Let's go have fun.
-Yeah.

32
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,545
-Can you carry it?
-Yeah, of course.

33
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,797
-Thanks. Let's go.
-There's a lot in this small bag.

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,298
-Yeah, it's heavy.
-Let's go.

35
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,804
-Oh, we're wearing the same colors.
-Yeah.

36
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:18,847
What a coincidence.

37
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,433
-Let's have fun. We'll swim…
-Good.

38
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,227
…and eat crazy amounts of delicious food.

39
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,897
I can't believe I get this
because I won first place.

40
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,359
Yeah, if you'd been in third,
I wouldn't have been able to go with you.

41
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,070
-Let's have a good time.
-Okay.

42
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,285
They don't think of themselves
as a couple.

43
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,452
-Yes.
-Huh?

44
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,538
No, this is…

45
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,583
She's fooling herself.

46
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,501
I mean, this was really unexpected,

47
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,629
but I think this is a very good choice.

48
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,339
Me too. I feel better now.

49
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,842
-I can relax and watch.
-No, this is So-e lying to herself.

50
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,218
I don't think this is it either.

51
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,096
I mean, she already expressed herself
so much to Yoong-jae,

52
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:03,099
should she once again cling on
to someone who said no to her?

53
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:07,020
But before, she was like, "Jo,"
but then went with Han-bin.

54
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,814
She was going to say "Jo,"
as in Yoong-jae, really.

55
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,649
-That was only way for her.
-Right.

56
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,526
-She wouldn't have wanted to burden him.
-But--

57
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,613
She might not have wanted to show herself
clinging on to him anymore.

58
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,115
Yeah, no, but I think this is sadder.

59
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,158
Me too.

60
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,538
Next up is
second-place winner, Lim Min-su.

61
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,582
Lim Min-su, please say the name

62
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:31,294
of the person you would like to go
on a date in Paradise with.

63
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,175
I was in third place.

64
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,217
LEE NADINE

65
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,511
I do have first, second, and third choice.

66
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,389
But I don't have feelings for
the second and third.

67
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,266
I don't have feelings for them, no.

68
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,270
If I was in first place, yes,
I would have chosen Jin-young.

69
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,731
I'm just so curious

70
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,693
about everything about Jin-young.

71
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,466
I'm anxious.
I think it's going to be Jin-young.

72
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,177
I think she's going
to choose someone else.

73
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,521
The person I want
to be in Paradise with is

74
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,107
Kim Jin-young.

75
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:36,776
Kim Jin-young.

76
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,076
Lim Min-su
has chosen Kim Jin-young.

77
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:50,999
Kim Jin-young, please come outside
and leave for Paradise with Lim Min-su.

78
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,126
Nice.

79
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,086
Kim Jin-young.

80
00:04:55,169 --> 00:05:00,174
Kim Jin-young, please come outside
and leave for Paradise with Lim Min-su.

81
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,926
You can choose the same person again?

82
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,263
That means she likes him enough
to go with him two days in a row.

83
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,889
She's pursuing him.

84
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,103
That much?

85
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,332
Let's go.

86
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,220
-Let's drink alcohol today.
-Okay.

87
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,347
Drink and have
an honest conversation.

88
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,767
-I'd like that. Yeah.
-You'd like that?

89
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,853
In a way, Jin-young kind of
beat around the bush

90
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,813
when he expressed what he wanted.

91
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,649
But in the end, she still chose Jin-young.

92
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,943
-Min-su is very strong-minded.
-Right.

93
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,114
But in a way, this is the best
Min-su can do to get the person she likes.

94
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,201
-Yeah. And Min-su's honest.
-Yeah.

95
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,747
I did think they'd get along
in terms of personality.

96
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,707
Yeah?

97
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,584
They play around a lot.

98
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,046
Yeah. The both of them
must be really playful.

99
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,382
The way they get along is,
when they play around, they're like…

100
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,551
Yeah.

101
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,810
Lastly,
third-place, Lee Nadine.

102
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,438
Lee Nadine, please say
the name of the person

103
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,941
you'd like to go on a date
in Paradise with.

104
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,117
-Oh, Nadine.
-Oh.

105
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,077
Oh, my. What's she going to do?

106
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,745
Who is Nadine going to go with?

107
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,790
I don't even know who she should choose.

108
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,459
Nadine will choose Se-jun or…

109
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,754
I don't think she'll choose Se-jun.
No, not Se-jun.

110
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,674
-No, it's either Jong-woo or Dong-woo.
-I don't know.

111
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,261
-Not Jong-woo.
-Please, I feel weird.

112
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,097
Don't say that.
Why would you say that, Seul-ki?

113
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,850
Nadine's the hardest one to predict.

114
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,393
What if she goes with Jong-woo?

115
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,687
-Never.
-But you're the most likely.

116
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,105
-The most likely.
-Never.

117
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,816
-Wait.
-Jong-woo's hoping it's anyone but him.

118
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,652
Yeah. Nadine, don't choose Jong-woo.

119
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,371
The person I want to go
on a date in Paradise is

120
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,540
Yoong-jae.

121
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,751
Oh.

122
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,338
Yoong-jae?

123
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:50,094
The person Lee Nadine
has chosen is… Jo Yoong-jae.

124
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:55,558
Jo Yoong-jae, please come outside
and leave for Paradise with Lee Nadine.

125
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,726
Have fun.

126
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,314
We haven't really talked much.

127
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,900
Jo Yoong-jae.

128
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:09,363
Jo Yoong-jae, please come outside
and leave for Paradise with Lee Nadine.

129
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,010
-You want me to carry it for you?
-No, I'm fine.

130
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,261
-Is it heavy?
-I got it.

131
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,639
-You were shocked, right?
-I was a little surprised.

132
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,060
-Give it to me. I'll carry it.
-I'm fine.

133
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,811
-Give it to me.
-It's heavy.

134
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,105
It's fine. Let's go.

135
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,194
You took a very long time to decide.

136
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,279
-I was really--
-Conflicted?

137
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,990
-You and I have talked the least.
-Right.

138
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,034
It's like… Yeah.

139
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,038
This is really all tangled.

140
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,793
I'm thinking that at least these two
could have chemistry the more they talk.

141
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,169
But--

142
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:09,340
And Nadine knows that Jong-woo
already has feelings toward Seul-ki.

143
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,424
Yes.

144
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,718
She wanted to go
with Jin-young, but he left.

145
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,846
-That leaves Se-jun and Yoong-jae.
-Right.

146
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,432
But Se-jun is still a bit shy, so,

147
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,394
-there was no other choice but Yoong-Jae.
-Yes.

148
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,691
What's for sure is these three couples
will be drinking a lot in Paradise today.

149
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,693
Ah.

150
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,866
That concludes the matching
of the couples to go to Paradise.

151
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,749
-Shall we just go to sleep?
-Might as well. Even the weather's gloomy.

152
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,626
This is fun.

153
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,423
Honestly, I don't think
I'll be able to eat today.

154
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,845
It's going to be fun today, though.
We'll make some good food.

155
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,686
You smell like Yoong-jae.

156
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,063
-Is that Yoong-jae's?
-Yeah.

157
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,402
Shall we change into
comfy clothes?

158
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,405
-Comfy.
-Comfortable.

159
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,079
Let's go and eat.

160
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,502
Why is the weather so gloomy?

161
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,296
-Right.
-So gloomy.

162
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,006
-What's wrong with you?
-Why am I so sad?

163
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,091
But I like it, the rain.

164
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,052
He likes everything.

165
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,263
-Even if there was a typhoon.
-Why is Jong-woo so funny?

166
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,266
-I wonder what the ingredients are today.
-I know.

167
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,934
It's pork belly!

168
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,519
-What?
-No way.

169
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,729
This is amazing.

170
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,814
-Wow!
-Is this for real?

171
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,774
What?

172
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,192
-Wait.
-Really?

173
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,236
This looks so good.

174
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:00,534
Should we do that? One plain pork belly
and one gochujang pork belly?

175
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,162
-Who wants to cut up the pork?
-I'll do it.

176
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,122
-I'll cut the pork.
-Okay.

177
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,085
-Small knife.
-Watch your hand.

178
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,462
Where are the latex gloves?

179
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,798
Wait.

180
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,221
-How do I cut this? Just like this?
-You're good at that.

181
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,225
You could cut your hand, so be careful.

182
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,727
-The smell will stick to your hands.
-You okay?

183
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,813
-I should do it too.
-Yes.

184
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,898
Seul-ki, are you
good at cutting with a knife?

185
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,525
I am pretty okay.

186
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,989
Your hand is so wet,
it won't go in the glove.

187
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,157
Let me see.

188
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,826
Put it on. I'll do it for you.

189
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,286
You have to cut it more thinly.

190
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,084
Move your fingers.

191
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,295
Okay, good.

192
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,592
It won't go in.

193
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,344
Watch your hand.

194
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,390
I can cut it in cubes like this, right?

195
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,308
Yeah. I think that should be good.

196
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,103
He's so sweet.

197
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,897
Jong-woo really only sees Seul-ki.

198
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,860
At times like this, I miss the chef.

199
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,822
-Right, but we're capable of doing this.
-I think we can do it, yeah.

200
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,408
I heard Jin-young is a good cook.

201
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,534
Really?

202
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,786
Yeah, he was
supposed to show me, but…

203
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,914
-But he's never here.
-No, he's never here.

204
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,041
-He said he would?
-Maybe he's all talk?

205
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,465
-Is that gochujang pork belly?
-Yes, it is.

206
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,217
-It won't be too hot, right?
-It's a little spicy.

207
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,679
I feel like eating something hot today.

208
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,264
Spicy.

209
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,267
They say people crave
hot food when they're angry.

210
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,019
No, when I want to feel good.

211
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,813
Yeah?
So I guess you feel bad right now?

212
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,197
It smells so good, though.

213
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,282
It's been so long
since I've had meat.

214
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,201
-Let's eat.
-Enjoy the food!

215
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,328
-Enjoy the food!
-Enjoy the food!

216
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,954
Enjoy the food!

217
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,291
This is good, Jong-woo.
Good job cooking it.

218
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,334
Oh, yeah?

219
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,461
-Yeah.
-It's okay even without the rice.

220
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,254
-Right.
-I'm full.

221
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,839
Are those pictures of us?

222
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,050
-Me and Seul-ki.
-Friendship pictures.

223
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,886
-Oh, they're nice!
-Oh, let's take some today.

224
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,763
Shall we take them right now?

225
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,848
We have to gather a bit.

226
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,354
Now, one, two, three.

227
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,356
Came out okay?

228
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,409
Oh, I wasn't looking at the camera.

229
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,286
I had my eyes closed.

230
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,580
Let's pretend that was a theme then.

231
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,375
Let's take one together.
How do we do this?

232
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,419
That's nice.

233
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,300
This is paradise for Jong-woo.

234
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,761
-There's no need to go elsewhere.
-Yes.

235
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,763
One, two, three.

236
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,349
-Oh, you two look nice.
-You two look nice.

237
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,977
Shouldn't we
be taking it vertically?

238
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,145
We're taking another one?

239
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,815
Just you two? Okay.

240
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,693
You're going to use up all the film.

241
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,861
Wait, it went off
when I was looking at her.

242
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,197
-That's when it comes out pretty.
-It's natural.

243
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,116
-Natural.
-That's funny.

244
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,243
The vertical one's prettier.

245
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,078
Yeah. I like this picture.

246
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,621
-Me too.
-Yeah.

247
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,130
PARADISE
SO-E AND HAN-BIN

248
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,842
Enjoy the food!

249
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,635
-Let's eat.
-Yeah.

250
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,890
-I knew it.
-I'll pass you the sauce.

251
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,099
Okay.

252
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,815
I've felt this while living in Inferno,

253
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,527
but I think you're a person
who's just naturally well-mannered.

254
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,362
-Yeah?
-Yeah. I've felt it a lot.

255
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,697
Oh.

256
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,577
At first, I thought
since you like Seo-eun,

257
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,829
it was just for Seo-eun.

258
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,750
But I think you do it for everyone.

259
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,753
-Mmm.
-I just wanted to tell you that.

260
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,546
That's good.

261
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,216
-Do you know why I chose you?
-Why did you?

262
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:30,304
-You wanted to have fun?
-That too, yeah.

263
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,681
I did think I would have
the most fun if I came with you.

264
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,599
Mmm.

265
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:41,148
After thinking about it,
I knew if I came with Yoong-jae,

266
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,610
-as expected…
-We would both--

267
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:48,113
Be uncomfortable. Of course,
I'd try not to be uncomfortable.

268
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,700
But I know I would feel,
how should I put this…

269
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,203
Just weird. Yeah.

270
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,205
I think you would have been hurt.

271
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,919
Everyone, when you went to Paradise
with Se-jun yesterday…

272
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,588
-Yeah?
-Everyone was clapping.

273
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,589
Even in the men's tent.

274
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,882
-Really?
-"So-e's going!"

275
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,635
-I was worried even about that.
-Why?

276
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,138
I thought that it might not be

277
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,891
the Paradise you really wanted.

278
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,602
So everyone was like,
"So-e must be thrilled."

279
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,563
"She's finally going."
Saying these things.

280
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,443
And since I thought that it
might not be such a good thing for you,

281
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,279
-I said I was worried for you.
-Mmm.

282
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,991
-Yeah.
-Right.

283
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,035
You don't have to
come to Paradise for things to be good.

284
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,204
Right. And I felt it myself.

285
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,707
It'd be harder after going to Paradise.

286
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,958
-So…
-Yeah.

287
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,336
-I was here with Se-jun.
-Yeah.

288
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:49,842
But I thought that, like,
I would keep thinking about Yoong-jae,

289
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:54,054
or would be, like, disappointed, or

290
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:59,435
those feelings might come rushing at me,
but it wasn't like that.

291
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,978
-No?.
-No.

292
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:07,276
I don't know how much of that feeling
is left anyway. It was really short too.

293
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,613
So I think I did it for myself
to shake it off quickly.

294
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,241
Ah.

295
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,247
-What about you?
-It was hard for me too.

296
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,583
-Right. I know.
-Yeah.

297
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,878
I'm not sure where things went wrong.

298
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,756
-I'm not sure if it did go wrong.
-Hmm.

299
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,383
It's hard.

300
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,426
It is hard.

301
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,470
PARADISE
NADINE AND YOONG-JAE

302
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,514
-Is champagne all right?
-Yeah. I like all alcohol.

303
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,608
Mmm.

304
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,818
I…

305
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,405
Is it weird if I say this?

306
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,575
-Just say it.
-About Jin-young.

307
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,999
You're not interested
in me like that anyway, Nadine,

308
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,169
and we came here
to talk like this as friends.

309
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,128
Yeah.

310
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,672
What are you going to do from now on,
about Jin-young?

311
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,007
I don't know.

312
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,885
You don't know?
Are you going to approach him?

313
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,014
-I don't know.
-Oh, you don't know?

314
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,225
I really don't know.

315
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,477
But I'm curious about him.

316
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,230
I have fun when we just talk.

317
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,026
I think he just has this unexpected charm.

318
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,404
I think that's a huge charm of his.

319
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:38,117
It's so comfortable to be around him.
And I'm curious about him.

320
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,328
I think it would be fun
to come to Paradise with him.

321
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,539
So what are you going to do then?

322
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,792
I know. What am I going to do?
I really have no clue.

323
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,128
I really don't know.

324
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,882
I'm just here.

325
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,761
That's why I'm here with you,
Yoong-jae, in Paradise.

326
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,139
Okay.

327
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,392
Yeah.

328
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,687
Then you must've been very flustered
trying to make your decision.

329
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,022
Yeah, when I was standing there.

330
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,401
I mean, I had a feeling
Min-su was going to choose Jin-young.

331
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,364
Then I imagine you were wishing
you'd been in second place in the game?

332
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,492
-Second place?
-Yeah, instead of third place.

333
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,829
Of course. I wish was first place. Yeah.

334
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,748
If you'd been in first place,
would you have chosen Jin-young?

335
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,250
-Yeah.
-Oh.

336
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,504
Then you and I should put
our heads together and think about it.

337
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,382
-Okay.
-I'm very good at that.

338
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,927
I'm good at strategizing
and things like that.

339
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,097
-He's just giving open consultations.
-Right.

340
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,851
I think Han-bin and So-e can join them
and the four of them can just hang out.

341
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,228
-Right. They had lots of chairs.
-Yes.

342
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,105
PARADISE
MIN-SU AND JIN-YOUNG

343
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,860
You were good
in the game today.

344
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,278
Thanks.

345
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:12,419
From Inferno to here,
today went by really fast.

346
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,297
I think It'll continue to go by quickly.

347
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,632
-Yeah? It will?
-Yeah.

348
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,426
When you first saw me,

349
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,013
what was your first impression of me?

350
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:27,684
Um… I thought
you were going to be a bit uptight.

351
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,314
-And that we probably wouldn't get along.
-Really?

352
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,316
But when we talked, it was so comfortable.

353
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,111
-Mmm.
-Talking to you felt very comfortable.

354
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,614
And also, I felt kind of unreserved.

355
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,951
Yeah. Just comfortably getting along.

356
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:48,247
What really surprised me was that
time goes by fastest when I'm with you.

357
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,414
Mmm.

358
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,710
-So I kept thinking about those things.
-Mmm.

359
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,633
The kind of romantic relationship
that I prefer is

360
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,346
one where things feel a bit
uncomfortable rather than comfortable.

361
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,305
Mmm.

362
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,184
I think that's what I want
in a romantic relationship.

363
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,939
So, like, me as a person,

364
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,734
I tend to feel comfort
in being in situations

365
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,320
-where it's a little uncomfortable.
-Mmm.

366
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,532
But when I'm with you,
I'm too comfortable.

367
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,700
-Yeah.
-That…

368
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,576
Mmm…

369
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,497
So I feel like that made it hard for me

370
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,042
to have you cross this
certain boundary as a romantic partner.

371
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,045
To be honest, it wasn't like that
from the beginning.

372
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,716
I said I don't like being comfortable
when I'm in a relationship,

373
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,427
but this was the first time
I felt comfortable.

374
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,388
I opened my eyes,
and three hours are just gone.

375
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,808
Things like that.

376
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,397
-"Isn't a little comfortability okay?"
-Mmm.

377
00:21:56,189 --> 00:22:00,027
That was what I started thinking. Mmm.

378
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:10,620
But eventually, one day, this kind of
relationship could… become ambiguous.

379
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,749
You know, even if it's nice now.

380
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,502
So I thought
I should take this occasion to

381
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,464
tell you honestly

382
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,092
-about how I feel.
-Mmm.

383
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,011
-Because time is short now.
-Mmm.

384
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,348
So, to be honest, when the two of us
were talking earlier,

385
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,769
I said, "I want to
talk to different people"

386
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,564
or things like that
to slightly let you know.

387
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,608
Mmm.

388
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:44,029
But you chose me again,
which I'm grateful for, of course.

389
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,657
But I think that's when
I became certain, "This…"

390
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,745
"I have to tell her today."
That's what I was thinking

391
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,372
So my heart's been feeling
a bit heavy since then,

392
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,958
but I didn't want to ruin your whole day.

393
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,379
-So now, at the end of the day…
-Mmm.

394
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,133
…I wanted to tell you this.

395
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,886
I just wanted to kind of
protect your mood until now.

396
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,810
-I think that's it.
-I understand.

397
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,981
Of course, when I first arrived,

398
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,859
I did have a somewhat
happy ending in mind. Right?

399
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,154
-Mmm.
-But as of right now, for me…

400
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,824
Hmm.

401
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,660
…making decisions without regret
at every single moment

402
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,495
and making memories without regret,

403
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,332
I think these just became my goals.

404
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,668
-Mmm.
-So…

405
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,005
If I chose someone else because I think
you don't have feelings for me,

406
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,383
I think that would've felt
less like Paradise

407
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,760
Mmm.

408
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,597
-That's just not like me.
-Mmm.

409
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,183
That's not who I want
or expect myself to be.

410
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,646
-Hmm.
-So…

411
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,317
I have no regrets about
what the results of that is.

412
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,570
Not yesterday, not today.

413
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,370
Yeah. Thank you for
thinking of it like that.

414
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,792
Thank you so much for coming here
and having fun.

415
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,713
-Yeah. And I really did have fun.
-Mmm.

416
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,424
Talking without knowing
time was flying by.

417
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,341
Yeah.

418
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,534
-They're being honest.
-So very honest.

419
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:58,288
But Min-su said that she always does
what her heart tells her to do

420
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,081
and that she has no regrets.

421
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,878
It feels like she's going to
keep choosing Jin-young.

422
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,464
RIght. I think Jin-young's charm
really shows a lot

423
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,382
in conversations like this.

424
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:13,386
He seems very blunt,
but he's very considerate and sensitive.

425
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,308
And he speaks so well
that it doesn't feel… unkind.

426
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,395
And Min-su took it well
and spoke honestly as well, so that…

427
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,858
I think this won't have been a hugely
regrettable date for either one of them.

428
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,946
So then does Jin-young
have feelings for Seul-ki?

429
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,784
It could be Seul-ki, or he may want
to get to know more people.

430
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,875
But until now, he only expressed himself
properly like that to Seul-ki.

431
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,045
But Seul-ki wants to do something.

432
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,381
-They keep missing each other.
-Yes. He keeps--

433
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,007
He was too popular. Yeah.

434
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:56,096
RIght now, to be honest, he used up
two out of nine days with only Min-su.

435
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,474
But wasn't Min-su honestly making
the best choice she could?

436
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,309
-Yes.
-Wanting to spend time

437
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,186
without regrets,
with the person she likes…

438
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,272
-Yeah.
-…is Min-su's honest feelings.

439
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,482
INFERNO

440
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,484
Let's light fireworks
in front of the tent.

441
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,152
Been so long since I did this.

442
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,364
Oh! This is scary.

443
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,825
Done, hurry,
come back! This is scary.

444
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,703
Did I set them too close to each other?

445
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,960
Which one blew up?

446
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:28,962
One isn't going--

447
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,047
There it goes!

448
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,758
What's that?

449
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,640
It's pretty!

450
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,684
Look at that!

451
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,520
Why did you scaredy cats want to do this?

452
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,772
You should've stayed in your rooms.

453
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,609
It's so pretty.

454
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,945
-It's done.
-Wanna draw a heart?

455
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,239
-We'll go this way. You do this way.
-Yeah.

456
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,074
-1, 2, 3.
-One side each.

457
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,993
What is this?

458
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,163
-Guys, do two each.
-Like this?

459
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,040
This is really pretty.

460
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,083
-Give me that for a second.
-This? Yeah.

461
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,627
I'll light one for you.

462
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,216
♪ Got my heart beating ♪

463
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,926
♪ Let's go traveling ♪

464
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,220
-It's going out now.
-That was fun.

465
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,221
That was fun.

466
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,643
-I'm curious.
-Yeah?

467
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,021
Is the person who
you had a good first impression of

468
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,774
and the person you like now the same?

469
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,733
They are.

470
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,862
Tell us who it is.

471
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,281
-So-e.
-So-e?

472
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,950
-So-e, who you went to Paradise with?
-Yes.

473
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,620
She's very small
and I keep having her on my mind.

474
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,163
You have her on your mind?

475
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,082
It's like a line from a comic.

476
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,125
"For someone so little,
you're on my mind a lot."

477
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,504
It's like I'm watching anime.
"I can't get the little one off my mind."

478
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,798
-She keeps kind of catching my eye.
-Oh.

479
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,801
But I have a question.
How do you feel, Se-jun,

480
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,844
about So-e going with someone else today?

481
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,930
I think it's good.

482
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,348
-Be honest.
-Really.

483
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,809
-You wish her happiness.
-Oh, happiness.

484
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,062
Well, she asked me something.

485
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,190
It felt like she'd been
thinking a lot about it,

486
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,526
so I just told her that she should.

487
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,945
If she did what she was
comfortable with, that's good.

488
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,280
-Right.
-But were you honestly disappointed?

489
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,324
-You didn't tell her how you feel?
-Even this much?

490
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,244
I just liked that she's doing
what she wants to do.

491
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,537
Aww.

492
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,581
I have a question.
Do you want to go to Paradise

493
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,000
with someone other than
who you've already been with?

494
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,337
-Yes.
-Yes! An honest answer!

495
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,426
Look at Jong-woo smiling.

496
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,386
He's happy. Yeah.

497
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,264
Did you make up your mind?

498
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,477
No, you haven't. Okay!

499
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,354
-I still have a question.
-Yeah?

500
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,439
-Yeah.
-You've had plenty.

501
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,358
Name one characteristic
of the person you like.

502
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,152
But…

503
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,572
-I'm going to pass.
-He has nostrils, yeah?

504
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,951
You asked me to name names,
but then you avoid everything?

505
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,370
Why are you being like that?

506
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,706
Because I can.

507
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,794
Fight! Fight! Fight!

508
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,380
These two
are masters at doing skits.

509
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:23,428
Those two really are playful, aren't they?
Playful, but nothing more than that.

510
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,766
I wonder if they're all
having fun in Paradise.

511
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,061
You really don't let others know
how you feel, do you?

512
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,605
Did you choose?

513
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,857
I think it'll depend on tomorrow.

514
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,317
-Tomorrow?
-Yeah.

515
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,069
It'll be very certain
once tomorrow's over.

516
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,696
-The result?
-Yeah.

517
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,783
-Honestly. How many do you have in mind?
-Just two?

518
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,868
-No.
-No?

519
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,496
-Hey, just tell us.
-We'll keep it between us.

520
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,206
Right now, it's two.

521
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,126
-Is it those two?
-Are they who we think they are?

522
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,213
But it's a bit…

523
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,716
-Both start with "J."
-Start with "J."

524
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,969
I don't know about that.

525
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,263
What do you mean you don't know?

526
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,725
But I really do wonder
how tomorrow will play out.

527
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,774
He's in Paradise right now
with the same person again.

528
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,778
Because… Min-su chose him.

529
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,531
She seems very forward.

530
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,949
I think she's into him.

531
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,077
But it looks like
they had a lot of fun together.

532
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,333
Seul-ki, I don't think you were there,
but earlier we were all talking together,

533
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:39,170
and we asked him how his date
with Min-su was,

534
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,089
and, well, it was fun and all that.

535
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,717
And he said, "It was
very impactful in a different way."

536
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,345
Something along those lines.
So everyone was surprised.

537
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,974
So, Seul-ki, I think based on that,

538
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,519
you will decide based on
the person's attitude towards you.

539
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,937
-Sincerity.
-Yeah, that.

540
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,481
Like, "How much more will he do for me?"

541
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,191
Yeah.

542
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,076
But when did you talk like that?

543
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,912
Just whenever there was time?
I don't know.

544
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:17,166
I… haven't seen Jin-young,

545
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,336
almost at all since we
came back from Paradise.

546
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,089
-Not even his face, almost.
-Oh.

547
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,842
I guess you kept missing him somehow.

548
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,179
-Because you keep talking to Jong-woo.
-Today…

549
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,226
-We were all together.
-Today, I haven't seen him, not even once.

550
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,519
-Really?
-Yeah.

551
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,940
That's right. He's here one minute
and gone the next.

552
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,400
He's just very popular.

553
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,195
People keep calling him outside
and talking to him separately.

554
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,532
You mean other guys?

555
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,367
No. It's other girls.

556
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,703
It happened earlier too.

557
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,502
Seul-ki is going through heartache
because of Jin-young right now.

558
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,341
Seul-ki definitely has two people
in her heart right now.

559
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:11,471
Yes. One man that sways her,
and one man that does everything for her.

560
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,597
Right.

561
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,308
The way I see Seul-ki right now is,

562
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,560
her saying her feelings
will become certain tomorrow

563
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,313
is just because Jin-young
returns from Paradise tomorrow.

564
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,230
Yes.

565
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,192
If Jin-young says something to Seul-ki
that makes her feel sure,

566
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,444
I think she's going to go Jin-young.

567
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,113
But won't Jin-young
express himself a little

568
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,032
once he comes back from Paradise?

569
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:31,950
Yes, I think he will.

570
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,952
Because he went with
the same person for two days.

571
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,411
So I feel bad for Jong-woo.

572
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,748
So the reason Seul-ki is saying
that tomorrow it'll be certain,

573
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:42,961
is that I think she wants to talk to him
when he comes back and feel sure.

574
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,673
So it feels like if Jin-young
doesn't do anything,

575
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,675
then she'll choose Jong-woo.

576
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:53,054
If it's really that, this will be
the last time we see Jong-woo smile.

577
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,932
-Don't say sad things like that.
-Okay.

578
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,642
-You're very cool-headed.
-Right.

579
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,269
She always thinks of
the worst possible situation.

580
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,854
-It'll be important.
-Yes.

581
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,606
-Yes. When he's back.
-Yeah.

582
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,212

-We're back.
-We're back.

595
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,227
Where is everyone?

596
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,232
They look like they're
wearing beach clothes.

597
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,656
-Get some rest. Yeah.
-See you later.

598
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,119
You did good. Get some rest.

599
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,128
Did you have fun?

600
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,590
Jin-young, it seems like there were
lots of fun incidents here yesterday.

601
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,635
-What kind of things?
-Fun things.

602
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,597
Right now, Paradise could be Inferno.

603
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,099
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

604
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,892
How was it, Jin-young?

605
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:04,936
Me, well…

606
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:10,316
I don't think my story is that important.
I'm just curious about what happened here.

607
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,485
Still, tell us what you did.

608
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,988
Yesterday? Yesterday, I had soju.

609
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,783
You must've had some
honest conversation though.

610
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,034
Not really.

611
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,454
Well, anyway, we talked.

612
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:28,835
Okay. That's it. Jong-woo?
Let's hear what you have to tell us.

613
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,380
Well, yesterday, we all
gathered together and played games

614
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,298
and talked about our inner feelings.

615
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,592
-Inner feelings?
-Inner feelings.

616
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,219
Because now, some time has passed,

617
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,721
so we thought it was time
to somewhat reveal our thoughts,

618
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,557
so we asked bold questions.

619
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,809
Oh!

620
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,937
I'm thinking Seul-ki got
a lot of questions.

621
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,896
She did.

622
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,358
I feel like the questions
would have been focused on Seul-ki.

623
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,443
-They were. Yeah.
-Carpet bombing.

624
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,570
Right.

625
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,697
Jong-woo, your facial expression
is very good.

626
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,990
Yeah.

627
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,826
Right now, your facial expression
looks the nicest ever.

628
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,995
-It's the best, yeah.
-Really?

629
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:09,083
So yesterday… Deep conversations?

630
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,127
What did Seul-ki say?

631
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,128
Seul-ki

632
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:16,799
confidently said that
there's someone she's interested in.

633
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,386
And when they asked
if her mind was made up…

634
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,805
-Yeah?
-…she wouldn't reply.

635
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,851
Yeah, she didn't answer that.

636
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:31,189
-Was the weather nice yesterday?
-Yesterday, there was a lot of night fog.

637
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,815
We lit some fireworks.

638
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,904
We took a whole lot of pictures
all together at the cafeteria.

639
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,448
They should be there, the pictures.
A whole bunch of them.

640
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,200
Shall we go and see the pictures?

641
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,118
-Yeah. Let's go now.
-Wait!

642
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,579
We're just going to go take a look.

643
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,957
Seul-ki and Jong-woo
took a lot of pictures together.

644
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,375
They're going to find out.

645
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,461
The day Paradise is jealous of Inferno.

646
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,214
I'm curious.

647
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,468
Whoa!

648
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:06,015
-There are a lot of pictures.
-I'm not in any of them.

649
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,685
-Just find the pictures taken yesterday.
-Hey, Seul-ki!

650
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,229
-Hi!
-Hi!

651
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,272
Did you have fun?

652
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,233
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I had fun.

653
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,109
You look well-rested.

654
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,613
You look well-rested too, Seul-ki.

655
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,532
Are you going to go tan?

656
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,118
-Tan?
-I think you can stop now.

657
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,039
Seul-ki, you're very pink today.

658
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,291
I wanted to look pretty today.

659
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,753
Suits the weather too.

660
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,630
I think you're giving me a hint, Seul-ki.

661
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,090
Yes, I am, a little.

662
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,472
This is hard for me to even watch.

663
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,015
The battle has begun.

664
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,478
Sounds like it was fun
here in Inferno yesterday.

665
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,022
-It was heaven.
-Did you have fun, Seul-ki?

666
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,899
-Staying here?
-Yeah.

667
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,527
-What was the most fun?
-Everything.

668
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,528
Any regrets?

669
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,572
Regrets? I'm not sure.

670
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,326
I'm not sure.

671
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,869
-"Not sure"?
-"Not sure."

672
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,996
"Not sure" is too vague.

673
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,665
But I did feel this.

674
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,877
That depending on who I'm with,
this place could be either heaven or hell.

675
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,671
Hmm.

676
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,091
That must mean that yesterday was heaven.

677
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,219
-Yeah.
-I liked it here yesterday.

678
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:30,808
Okay.

679
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,810
Did you
decide on your feelings?

680
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,103
Um…

681
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,773
I don't think so,
but I think it will be decided today.

682
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:38,816
-Today?
-Yeah.

683
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:40,901
Okay.

684
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,904
Hmm.

685
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,365
♪ Can you hear me now ♪

686
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,995
-So should we go for a walk?
-Yeah.

687
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,872
-Go for a walk?
-See you later.

688
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,248
The two of you? Okay.

689
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,209
♪ Yeah, I feel it in my bones ♪

690
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,504
♪ I can do this on my own
Don't hear what they say… ♪

691
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,883
I can see what people
are thinking now.

692
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,844
-Like, every single word.
-Yeah.

693
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,473
I think I can read them. The feelings.

694
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:15,061
The game.

695
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,688
You don't have to be nervous.

696
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,067
Okay.

697
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,031
I feel like I can't see a gap
that I can fit into.

698
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,867
-Hmm?
-Between those two.

699
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,246
Looks like it's going to be hard
unless I make one.

700
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,166
Well…

701
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,836
He's made the same choice
since the beginning.

702
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,962
Yeah.

703
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,298
But if there's still nothing going on,

704
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,218
she must not have feelings for him.

705
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,222
That's why it could be
an unstable relationship.

706
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,601
Let's not be too impatient.

707
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,982
We only have
three days left now.

708
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,777
The time's so short.

709
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:09,824
I want to get to know you more,
and my feelings have gotten stronger.

710
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,119
I need to express my feelings more,

711
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,413
during the time we have left here.

712
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:21,043
Because there are too many people
who are aiming for you.

713
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,798
Because you're so charming.

714
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,761
Since you're receiving
so much attention from so many people,

715
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,722
you must feel a little bit pressured.

716
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,600
Yeah.

717
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,478
I want you to wrap things up
without having a hard time.

718
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,692
Whenever we talked, I really feel that,

719
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,654
Jong-woo, you really are
considerate of me.

720
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,824
And I can tell that you are
saying these things

721
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,742
because you really care about me.

722
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,204
If I were you, Jong-woo,

723
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,666
I don't think I could have done that.

724
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,418
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

725
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,045
You're awesome.

726
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,882
Thank you so much for saying that.

727
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:20,227
There could be someone else
who you want to talk to,

728
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,731
so I think I should be
considerate of your time.

729
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,194
-No, go ahead and talk.
-No.

730
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,236
Keep talking

731
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,490
-We can talk together.
-You need time to talk too, so…

732
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,867
No, you can join us.

733
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,540
But if you're going to be
so considerate, I won't refuse.

734
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,001
-So I see.
-Yes, well…

735
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,674
Gosh, it's been a while.

736
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,931
-The weather's really nice today.
-It is.

737
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,654
It seems like you
talk to Jong-woo so much.

738
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,614
What is there to talk about like that?

739
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,658
You don't say a word when you're with me.

740
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,077
When you're with me,
it's silence, like this.

741
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,330
How do you endlessly talk
with Jong-woo like that? Huh?

742
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,958
Are you discriminating, right now?

743
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:31,006
If you were told to talk to Jong-woo
for three nights and four days, you would.

744
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,595
That's adorable though.
He's being jealous.

745
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,143
I should have been
on Inferno instead, huh?

746
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,232
What?

747
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,610
Did you have fun?

748
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:02,538
You just… said that so abruptly.

749
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,293
What did you do yesterday?
What did you eat?

750
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,377
Yesterday?

751
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,755
-Did you eat delicious food?
-Delicious food? I did eat delicious food.

752
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,799
-Did you eat meat?
-I did eat meat.

753
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,593
I ate meat too.

754
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,429
-I heard. Pork belly?
-Yeah.

755
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:19,847
Well…

756
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,308
I had soju yesterday.

757
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,893
Yesterday was a day for soju.

758
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,271
Yesterday wasn't a day for champagne.

759
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,774
So I got a bit drunk.

760
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,735
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

761
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,287
Oh. I want more.

762
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,750
This was a very short conversation
with Jin-young.

763
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:52,046
But with Jin-young, Seul-ki seems
like a very curious person.

764
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,257
Right. When she talks to Jong-woo,
they talk about way deeper things.

765
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,175
Yes.

766
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,927
But why do her conversations
with Jin-young,

767
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,014
which are way lighter, excite me?

768
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,140
It's like…

769
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:06,352
And Seul-ki's face
when she is with Jin-young

770
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,396
is this sweet, heart-fluttering image

771
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,690
-of a woman in love.
-Hmm.

772
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,693
-It's as if I can see her feelings, yeah.
-A woman in love.

773
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,656
I don't think Jong-woo
stands a chance against Jin-young.

774
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,366
Hmm.

775
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,661
The way I see it, I think Seul-ki
really has feelings for Jin-young.

776
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,458
But I think Seul-ki herself is confused.

777
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:33,087
-Right.
-About which one she is drawn to.

778
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,591
What do you weigh,
80 kilos, Jin-young?

779
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,385
I have
skinny muscles though. 77.

780
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,095
-77?
-77.

781
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,347
Jong-woo, if either one of us goes,

782
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,683
before they go,

783
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:49,186
want to agree that the one who
doesn't go can talk to Seul-ki?

784
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,188
Yeah, that would be nice. Very nice.

785
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,399
-Yeah.
-Huh? I didn't hear what you were saying.

786
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,025
It's okay for you not to hear.

787
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,486
Okay. Okay.

788
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,948
-Oh.
-Oh!

789
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,533
It has begun.

790
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,493
He's keeping him in check.

791
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,873
I can't be here. It's too scary.

792
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:13,419
If you're going to be like this,
I'll just go to the women's tent.

793
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:17,506
Se-jun's funny.

794
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,801
If you're going to be like this,
I'll just go to the women's tent.

795
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,680
Oh, that really
was a bit much, wasn't it?

796
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,515
Sparks flying.

797
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,310
We should've done this yesterday.

798
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:34,690
Everyone's exhausted from holding in
all this tension all this time.

799
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,777
It stressed me out every time I watched.

800
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,614
-Why? Because you don't want to lose?
-Yeah. I don't want to lose.

801
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,954
Is it just that you don't wanna lose or--

802
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,789
No, it's also because…

803
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,959
Does it
have to do with a woman?

804
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,463
Of course. Without that,
I don't care if I win or lose.

805
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,882
-Right.
-I could just go to sleep.

806
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:04,511
But if there's the opportunity
to go to Paradise like yesterday,

807
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:06,972
then I can't ever lose.

808
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,900
The hottest inferno
in the world, Single's Inferno.

809
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:21,111
Today, you will play another game
to win an opportunity

810
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,613
to go on a date in Paradise.

811
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,533
Participants, please come to the beach.

812
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,702
Let's go!

813
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,288
Let's go. We got this.

814
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,549
Look over there.

815
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,803
I'm already nervous
just seeing that. Aren't you?

816
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:47,721
I know.

817
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:51,016
I wonder what's
going to happen in there.

818
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,477
-I think it's gonna be really intense.
-Yeah.

819
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,312
They're coming. Here they come.

820
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,856
-I think they'll be scared.
-Yeah, I know.

821
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,661
♪ I'm about to run through this game… ♪

822

00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,790

826
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,088
Let's go.

827
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,925
-Why am I nervous?
-Me too

828
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,635
I'm nervous because I'm scared.

829
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,098

831
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,400
Now, we will begin
the male singles' game

832
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:44,069
to win a chance to go
on a date in Paradise.

833
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:49,783
Like yesterday, only the first, second
and third place winners of the game

834
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:53,996
can choose a female single they want
to go on a date with in Paradise.

835
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:01,044
Now, I will explain today's game.

836
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,505
All six men will enter the pit,

837
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:08,093
then, at the sound of the whistle,
attempt to push the others out.

838
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:14,600
The second a contestant's legs are both
outside the pit, he is eliminated.

839
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:18,478
The last one remaining person
will be the first place winner.

840
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,647
Okay, let's do this.

841
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,484
I can't watch.

842
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,864
-This is really intense.
-Yeah.

843
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:32,159
-There's going to be blood today.
-You don't just win because you want to.

844
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,994
-You need luck.
-Yes.

845
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,412
And you need strategy.

846
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,832
Now, male participants,
please step into the pit.

847
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:48,133
-I'm nervous for them.
-I'm more nervous than I thought.

848
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,885
Oh, my god.

849
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,484
Look at them lowering into position.

850
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,361
-Oh, my gosh.
-It's going to happen.

851
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,702
This is so nerve-wracking.

852
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,704
Look at their faces.

853
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,888
-Oh.
-They're really being rough.

854
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,974
They're getting serious
because time is short.

855
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,142
I know, right?

856
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:23,895
Oh, no.

857
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,251
Oh, I can't watch this.

858
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,295
I can't watch.

859
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,089
No fair staying sitting down.

860
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,752
-You were almost out. Be careful.
-Be careful.

861
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,424
He went for it, but he slipped away.

862
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:38,512
-You were almost out. Be careful.
-Be careful.

863
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,140
He's lifting you!

864
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,149
Oh, my gosh.

865
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,367
Dong-woo keeps only attacking Jong-woo.

866
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,702
I know. Because they're both
going for Seul-ki.

867
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:03,787
Yeah.

868
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,793
-Getting harder to breathe.
-I really don't want to do this.

869
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,696
Damn. I give up.

870
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,741
He's so funny.

871
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,327
Se-jun…

872
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,799
Kim Se-jun is eliminated.

873
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,680
-I like you, Se-jun.
-He went out in such a cool way.

874
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:06,224
-I like you.
-They dragged him around. "Oh, I give up."

875
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,310
You have to like Se-jun.

876
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,061
-I like Se-jun.
-Se-jun.

877
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,524
I'm exhausted.

878
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,037
Ah, this is fun.

879
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,416
Look, his body's turned red.

880
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,251
-His body's all red.
-His body turned red.

881
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,345
If you attack too soon, you lose strength.

882
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,312
Why are you coming at me?

883
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,004
Let go!

884
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,010
Shin Dong-woo is eliminated.

885
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,553
I can't watch this.

886
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,141
Jin-young seems really strong.

887
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,353
This is intense.

888
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,738
If one more person
gets out, it's over.

889
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:44,739
Right.

890
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,965
-Han-bin!
-Han-bin!

891
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,802
Oh, Han-bin!

892
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,684
♪ We're about to take it up a level
About to take it to another level, level ♪

893
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,110
♪ About to take it up a level
About to take it to another level, level ♪

894
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,030
Whoo!

895
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,948
Kim Han-bin is eliminated.

896
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,410
♪ About to take it to
Another level, level ♪

897
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,704
♪ I'm gonna take it up a level… ♪

898
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,637
Now these three are the finalists.

899
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:53,224
Interestingly, the three left
are the people who want to go the most.

900
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,393
But there's no one Yoong-jae
overlaps with.

901
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:58,104
So it's really a battle
between Jin-young and Jong-woo.

902
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,654
I really can't watch this.

903
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,411
Here they go.

904
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,051
Those two… Be careful.

905
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,816
-This is hard.
-Yeah.

906
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,989
Yoong-jae is just
kind of watching.

907
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,496
I'm scared.

908
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,082
Let's go.

909
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,216
-Oh, are you all right?
-Yeah.

910
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,865
I'm sorry.

911
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,035
What are they going to do?

912
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,204
This might not get settled here.
So what then?

913
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,087
Let's just do it together.

914
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:50,800
He was gonna leave it to the two of them,
but he doesn't think it'll work.

915
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,969
Yeah, they can't end it,
so now he's joining them.

916
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:56,264
We don't know what will happen.
It'll depend on who they gang up on.

917
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,187
No hard feelings, right?

918
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,699
Is it Jong-woo?

919
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,076
It's Jong-woo?

920
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,456
No!

921
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:23,750
No!

922
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,793
Oh, no. Oh, my gosh.

923
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,094
Please.

924
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:38,556
Hold out!
Shake it! Shake your body!

925
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:42,727
-Yes! Hold out! Hold out just this once!
-He's holding out!

926
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,896
Shake your body!

927
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,317
He held out!

928
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,364
Push your body to get away.
Shake your body!

929
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:04,541
Again?

930
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:34,445
-I think this is going to make me cry.
-Just this once. Please, just this once.

931
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,001
Let's go.

932
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,133
Let's go.

933
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:06,060
Choi Jong-woo
and Kim Jin-young are eliminated.

934
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,610
-What happened?
-Video replay.

935
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,486
-Right.
-He went over as he was flipping him.

936
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,780
-Jin-young went over first?
-We don't know yet.

937
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,826
I have no idea
how this will turn out.

938
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,372
What on earth happened?

939
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:30,168
The way I saw it, I think
Jin-young's legs went outside first.

940
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,419
What was the rule?

941
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:34,797
Both legs have to be outside of the pit
for someone to be eliminated.

942
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,174
Not one leg, but both legs.

943
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:38,217
-Then Jin-young went out first.
-Yeah.

944
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:41,471
The way I see it, I think the butt part,
this part touched it first.

945
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:44,557
-The thigh part to the back.
-What are the results of the video replay?

946
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,893
-Is it playing? Show us.
-Why is it so interesting,

947
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,311
when it's not even the Olympics?

948
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,979
-Right, what is this?
-Just…

949
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:52,732
Look watch that.

950
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,067
Right, first…

951
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,195
-Jin-young's legs were inside.
-I think it's Jong-woo.

952
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,072
Yeah, his legs were inside.

953
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,198
JIN-YOUNG
JONG-WOO

954
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:04,077
-His two legs came out first.
-Jong-woo's leg's on one side!

955
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,787
-It's hanging.
-Yes!

956
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:08,706
-Right under Yoong-jae's butt.
-Yes!

957
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,626
-That's his leg, next to it.
-Is this the Olympics or what?

958
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,378
Right under the light green.

959
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:16,881
-This is amazing.
-This is amazing.

960
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,384
So the sky answered!

961
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:23,221
-Knock and a door will open.
-It answered to he who hoped.

962
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,267
Now,
to announce the final results.

963
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:31,312
Here are the rankings
for the male participants' game

964
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,940
to win an opportunity
for a date in Paradise.

965
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,484
First place, Jo Yoong-jae.

966
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,152
-Whoo!
-Thank you.

967
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,157
Second place…

968
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,086
Choi Jong-woo.

969
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,886
Third place, Kim Jin-young.

970
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,142
Great job, everyone.
