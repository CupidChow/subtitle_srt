SE-JUN AND MIN-SU PARADISE COUPLE MATCHING

LIM MIN-SU

20
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,127
The person who I was
most interested in in the first day,

21
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,671
who I had the most feelings for
was Se-jeong.

22
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,883
-Are you a positive person?
-I do tend to be positive.

23
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,177
There's a saying,
"You can do all you can as human,

24
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,513
-but the rest is up to the heavens."
-Me, too.

25
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,431
-Interesting.
-Yeah.

26
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,142
We have similar values
so I'm curious about her.

27
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,895
If we get to talk more,
we might find a lot in common.

28
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,230
That's what I was thinking.

29
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,482
There was a lot to think about…

30
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,737
because I had already been 70% sure
that I was going to go with Se-jeong.

31
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,741
But that changed someway after we talked.

32
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,537
5 HOURS EARLIER

33
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,414
Kim Se-jun, Lim Min-su,

34
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,292
take some time
with the people of the opposite sex

35
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,753
and get to know each other one on one.

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,091
After having conversations
with the women,

37
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,968
there were some who were memorable.

38
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,180
The more I talk, the more unsure I become.

39
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,017
I keep having her on my mind,
and she keeps catching my eye.

40
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,856
I felt it so much that I was
really conflicted, to be honest.

41
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,317
They all got to talk to each other.

42
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,611
Yes, they were given the time.

43
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,321
-He must be conflicted…
-Yes.

44
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,823
-…about who to go with.
-Yes.

45
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,998
Do you have any idea about
who Se-jun would choose?

46
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:45,999
I think maybe…

47
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,543
Se-jeong or Nadine.

48
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,962
-I think…
-Right. Because…

49
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,922
Right? Something tells me.

50
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,718
He did say he was most curious
about Nadine when he talked with me.

51
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,095
What? No way!

52
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:02,807
And he said
he felt comfortable with Se-jeong.

53
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,059
Beause they talked yesterday.

54
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,811
But I asked Se-jun, too.

55
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,440
He said he thinks he'll choose
someone who's been on his mind.

56
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,902
-It's a unique way to put it.
-Someone who's been on his mind?

57
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,904
Hmm. Someone who's been on his mind.

58
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,239
Ah, the way he worded it
makes my heart pound.

59
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,411
The person
I would like to go to Paradise with is…

60
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:28,124
The person Kim Se-jun
would like to go to Paradise with is…

61
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:36,799
I choose…

62
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,177
Lee So-e.

63
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:44,849
So-e?

64
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,687
Kim Se-jun has chosen Lee So-e
to go with him to Paradise.

65
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,730
Huh?

66
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:54,567
Lee So-e, pack your things
for Paradise, and come out…

67
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,486
…to the front of the campfire.

68
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,448
Lee So-e?

69
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,368
Really?

70
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,997
Woah.

71
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,083
That was really unexpected.

72
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,918
He said his type
is someone who looks sharp.

73
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,712
-He just chose the complete opposite.
-Yes.

74
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,339
-Amazing.
-So-e!

75
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,758
-Let's go.
-Way to go!

76
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,718
-Way to go!
-High-five!

77
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,679
Have a good time.

78
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,473
-You're going to Paradise.
-Have fun!

79
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,641
Have a good time.

80
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,269
Have a good time, So-e.
Eat lots of delicious food.

81
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,437
-Bye.
-Bye.

82
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,364
-Se-jeong, left again…
-It's not going well for her.

83
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,450
-Se-jeong expected it to be her.
-Yeah, I agree.

84
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,187
-Do we go out this way?
-Yeah, I think we go out this way.

85
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,189
You look nice.

86
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,649
Thank you.

87
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,484
So…

88
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,280
There are two reasons why I chose you.

89
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,824
-Yeah?
-I'll tell you about them later.

90
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,326
Okay.

91
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,245
-Do you want me to carry your bag?
-Mine, too?

92
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,334
"Want me to carry your bag?" Ah, So-e.

93
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,626
She's bewildered.

94
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,962
She's like, "Should I be thrilled or not?"

95
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,423
I think that's what she's feeling.

96
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,260
But since So-e expressed her feelings
to Yoong-jae to the extent she did,

97
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,596
just because she
gets to go with someone else,

98
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,474
for her to be like, "Yay,"
that would be a bit too much.

99
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,060
It would have been
a little weird if she did that.

100
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,987
My first impression of Yoong-jae was good,
so before we had the conversation,

101
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,114
I was thinking
that I should go with Yoong-jae.

102
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,868
But after talking with all five men,
I changed my mind.

103
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,080
So now the person I want to go with
is the person who I thought

104
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,249
wouldn't be a good match for me
based on first impressions.

105
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,584
But after talking to him,

106
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,253
there were moments where
we unexpectedly connected well.

107
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,588
So I thought we could have fun

108
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,341
if we could speak with each other
for a longer period of time.

109
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,592
That's why I chose him.

110
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,680
The person I would like to go
to Paradise with is…

111
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,058
Jong-woo or Han-bin.

112
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,976
-Han-bin.
-Yes.

113
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,150
Something tells me
it's going to be Jin-young.

114
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:47,406
The person Lim Min-su
would like to go to Paradise with is…

115
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,455
Kim Jin-young.

116
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,502
Kim Jin-young, pack your things
for Paradise and come out to the campfire.

117
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,634
What?

118
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,304
-Have fun!
-You said you would do it.

119
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,349
-That's wild.
-Wow.

120
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:16,310
Wow, as soon as he got here.
What secret charm has he got?

121
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,355
-Yeah.
-He's Mr. Popular.

122
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,273
Jin-young…

123
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,358
All he does is go to Paradise.

124
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,526
He's really popular.

125
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,569
Really.

126
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,966
I seem to have
sandbags attached to my feet.

127
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,136
-I couldn't get my shoes on.
-Because your shoes are stuck?

128
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,221
Yeah.

129
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,099
I really didn't imagine this.

130
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,311
-I don't think anyone would have.
-Really.

131
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,731
-How was the reaction inside?
-Inside?

132
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,524
I didn't know it would be public.

133
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,985
-The reaction inside was, well…
-Yeah.

134
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,820
-Yeah, of course, everyone…
-Yeah.

135
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,071
…was surprised.

136
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,365
I was surprised, too.

137
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,578
Are you okay?

138
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,537
Yeah.

139
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:20,333
This is actually making me
feel more… contemplative.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,420
It's so nice to be able to
take a step back and think about it again.

141
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:30,927
I think if Jin-young goes to Paradise and…
doesn't really hit it off with her, then…

142
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,346
-We'll know when they get back.
-Yeah.

143
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,974
He said it before,
when he went to Paradise with Seul-ki…

144
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,976
Were you there, Seul-ki?

145
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,814
-Wait, do you not know this?
-What?

146
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:48,861
Jin-young said that
when he went to Paradise with Seul-ki…

147
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,241
-It was impactful? Impact.
-Yeah, impact.

148
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,158
No.

149
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,160
You didn't know this?

150
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,204
-The impact was--
-Seul-ki wasn't there.

151
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,082
The impact was so huge that…

152
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,126
-Unless someone exceeds that--
-unless someone exceeds it…

153
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,295
-His feelings…
-Won't change?

154
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,797
Won't change.

155
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,298
Gosh.

156
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,009
-When?
-When was this?

157
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,096
-Was it when we were here?
-Yeah, that's right.

158
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,598
-Right? I remember.
-But he told me that…

159
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,978
whenever he was asked questions like that
he'd just say, "It was fine."

160
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,855
Yeah, he did say that, too.
But then that came out.

161
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,190
Oh, really?

162
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,275
Impact.

163
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:28,859
Impact.

164
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,362
Impact. Impact.

165
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,573
Can I say something else that's important?

166
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,241
Yeah.

167
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,909
That's what he said.

168
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,996
The last night when we were all
drinking together he said,

169
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,416
"To be honest, I thought
that the impact was huge,

170
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,003
that I thought it wouldn't change
unless someone exceeds it."

171
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,758
"But now that I've thought about it,
if little things keep piling up,

172
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,178
I think that could also end up
having a huge impact."

173
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,096
Ooh.

174
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:04,145
I think this could be a huge point
in how things play out from now on.

175
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,858
Where is his mind at?
I don't know.

176
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,527
-He's so…
-Can't tell what he's thinking.

177
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,404
-I don't know.
-Can't figure him out.

178
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,032
Do you think he knows
you can't tell what he's thinking?

179
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,575
-This is war.
-"War"?

180
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,201
She's laughing.

181
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,453
"This is war."

182
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,496
While laughing she said, "This is war."

183
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,917
This is fun.

184
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,753
-Yeah.
-Really fun.

185
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,716
I'm actually glad.

186
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
Actually glad.

187
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,263
One's gone, she's here.

188
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,894
Even if I had been
chosen to go and Seul-ki stayed,

189
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,771
-Yeah.
-…and if they stayed behind together,

190
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,981
I think we'd grow even further apart.

191
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,276
Right now, there's not much time left.

192
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,280
I feel like everything
could be taken away from me.

193
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,786
Really, it's a relief.

194
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,913
What's your plan for today?

195
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,416
Me? Take care of her and stay by her side.

196
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,169
That's right.

197
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,005
-This is an opportunity for him.
-It really is.

198
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,298
He's very single-minded.

199
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,635
Yes. But while Jong-woo
is thinking about Seul-ki like that,

200
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,096
Seul-ki is saying, "This is war."

201
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,097
I know.

202
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,015
And he doesn't know that.

203
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,017
Feelings are hard.

204
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,522

212
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,675
Is he holding her hand?

213
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,260
-What?
-Yes.

214
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,152
-He's natural at this.
-The other two are startled.

215
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,363
-Jin-young was startled.
-Yeah, he was.

216
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,742
PARADISE

217
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,996
-It's so nice.
-It is.

218
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,498
What is this place?

219
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,126
Look at this. This is crazy.

220
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,169
SAUNA

221
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,422
This is unreal. It's so nice.

222
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,466
This is very nice.

223
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,383
-Right?
-Yeah.

224
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,388
-This must be the pool.
-Yeah.

225
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,308
I'm so happy.

226
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,437
Oh, a menu.

227
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,148
That looks great.

228
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,816
Order everything.

229
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,612
I'm getting dizzy.

230
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,031
Here's something they told me about.

231
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,200
-Yeah? What is it?
-I think it was this.

232
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,160
-They said this is good.
-Yeah.

233
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,536
-Lamb chops?
-That's good.

234
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,330
-This.
-I heard this is good.

235
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,956
I heard the sashimi's good.

236
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,751
They told me I have to try this.

237
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,044
-Oh, the--
-Did you know?

238
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,795
-Yeah.
-Now that we've been to Paradise?

239
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,299
-Yeah. That's understandable.
-May I take a look at the desserts?

240
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,009
I can eat a lot of desserts.

241
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,970
-Me, too. Then should we order these two?
-Let's get that.

242
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,680
-Should we order these two?
-Yes.

243
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,599
-Number 63, too? Yes.
-Number 63?

244
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,351
-Let's order them all.
-Yeah.

245
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,435
Good.

246
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,270
So-e is happy.

247
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,231
So-e was famished.

248
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,526
-Se-jun looks like he owns the place.
-Yeah.

249
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,819
-He looks like he's the hotel owner's son.
-Yeah.

250
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,072
I've never seen anyone like Se-jun before.

251
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,657
MIN-SU AND JIN-YOUNG

252
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,117
-Shall we talk while we eat?
-Okay.

253
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,703
-I'm hungry.
-Enjoy the food.

254
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,372
You did well.

255
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,706
Yes.

256
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,834
Although I don't think I did anything yet.

257
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,547
Cheers.

258
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,850
Oh! Everything's a shot to you.

259
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,436
-Is this not how you drink this?
-You just tossed it all down.

260
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,272
-I've only had soju, so…
-It's okay.

261
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,315
No, I was…

262
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,151
While drinking, I was like,
"Am I doing it right?"

263
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,112
-Yeah.
-This… drinkers' etiquette?

264
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,198
-Sorry.
-I've never seen that before.

265
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,368
-Never had anything like this.
-Drink how you want. Do what you want.

266
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,412
-Okay.
-You're very passionate.

267
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,998
-This was my first time drinking it.
-You're funny.

268
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,292
You're supposed to
take shots of alcohol, so…

269
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,252
Yeah.

270
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,090
So how should we eat this?

271
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,341
This?

272
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,468
This burger
that we have to assemble.

273
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,720
Oh, I'll do it for you.

274
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,314
Thank you.

275
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,614
You enjoying the burger?
Want another bite?

276
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,157
-Do you want some more?
-Yeah.

277
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,701
It tastes so good
the second I put it in my mouth.

278
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,880
So what do you do? I was so curious.

279
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,548
-I…
-Yeah?

280
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:28,761
-…used to be in the army.
-Really?

281
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,679
-I was part of the UDT.
-Ah.

282
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,098
-Do you know about the UDT?
-I've heard of it.

283
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,309
Yeah, I served there and got discharged.

284
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,644
And I'm a YouTuber.

285
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,229
-Oh, really?
-Yeah. Now.

286
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,149
-That was really unexpected.
-Oh, yeah?

287
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,067
-Yeah.
-So…

288
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,861
What about you, Min-su?

289
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,698
I recently started an online store
and I'm running it.

290
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,991
And I also model.

291
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,910
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

292
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,790
I'm currently working
as the CEO of an online clothing store

293
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,458
and a freelance model.

294
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,293
I am 26 years old.

295
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,838
I do everything there is to do
at the online store that I run,

296
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,215
from start to finish.

297
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:10,386
I style the clothes myself, model them,
take pictures, and upload them.

298
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:15,015
LIM MIN-SU, 26
ONLINE CLOTHING STORE CEO, FREELANCE MODEL

299
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,394
-That's amazing.
-That's what I do.

300
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,604
So you're the owner
of an online store at age 26?

301
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,897
Yes, I am the owner.

302
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,571
Another thing I'm curious about is why?

303
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,533
Why did I choose you?

304
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,244
I really did think a lot about it.

305
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,372
It's not like I was conflicted
between many people.

306
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,834
I thought I should choose and focus
because time is short.

307
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,255
And if the lines are being set in place,
I thought I should choose quickly.

308
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,133
-Yeah, time is short.
-Yeah.

309
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,801
And there aren't many options.

310
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,471
So right now,
which woman are you closest to?

311
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,181
-Me?
-Yeah.

312
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,391
-Close?
-Yeah.

313
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,602
"Close," is close,
like, what, comfortable?

314
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,939
The person you feel like you know
a decent amount about.

315
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,066
Relatively.

316
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,317
It would be Seul-ki.

317
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,738
I guess I'd have to say
I'm closest to Seul-ki.

318
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,117
I see.

319
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,789
Do you eat your food salty or bland?

320
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,042
I eat a bit salty.

321
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,089
-How is it?
-Like water.

322
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,468
I think that's because it's cold.

323
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,886
-Yeah, it's water.
-Yeah.

324
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,221
There's something wrong with this.
I'll make it right.

325
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,348
-You're so funny.
-Why?

326
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,059
Just the way you talk is funny.

327
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,436
-I should make this right.
-Let's do it.

328
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,732
Definitely something wrong with this.

329
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,694
PARADISE
SE-JUN AND SO-E

330
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,781
-Let's eat.
-This looks great.

331
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,533
Enjoy the food.

332
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,286
This looks great.

333
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,038
-Eat this.
-Okay.

334
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,916
Eat this.
It won't take me long to cut this up.

335
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,211
-What I'm most…
-Yeah?

336
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,420
curious about…

337
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,423
-I'm most curious about your age.
-My age? Guess.

338
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,885
After I have a bite of this first.

339
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,890
After I have a bite, then I'll guess.

340
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,060
-I'll answer after eating this.
-Okay.

341
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,315
-This is really good.
-Yeah.

342
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,486
It's so good that I feel tingles.

343
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,908
-The age-guessing game.
-Yeah, the age-guessing game.

344
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,078
-Can I take a guess first?
-Yeah.

345
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,454
Twenty-seven?

346
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,085
-Correct.
-Really?

347
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,253
-Yeah.
-Really?

348
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,170
Yeah.

349
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,798
That's correct. How did you know?

350
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,633
It was just my instincts.

351
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,345
People don't usually know my age.
They really can't guess.

352
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,888
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, really.

353
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,806
How old are you?

354
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,101
-Are you 25?
-No.

355
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,602
Twenty-three?

356
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:07,855
Twenty-three?

357
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:13,944
Too young?

358
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,530
You're so young. Wow.

359
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,490
It's only a four-year age difference.

360
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,910
I have lots of friends
who were born in 1996.

361
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,665
If you're 23,
then you must still be in university.

362
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,542
Yeah, I'm a senior.

363
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,462
What school do you go to in Seoul?

364
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,756
-Hanyang University.
-Hanyang University?

365
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,552
I'm an acting major
at Hanyang University.

366
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,346
Really? Gosh, be careful.

367
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,975
At first, I joined the theater
and film department out of curiosity.

368
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,855
But I fell in love with the process
of getting to know a character,

369
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,194
and the vibe of being on set
with other actors.

370
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:01,742
LEE SO-E, 23,
HANYANG UNIVERSITY, THEATER AND FILM MAJOR

371
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,826
Ah!

372
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,411
So that's why she's like that.

373
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,663
Right, the way she talked,
the way she said things.

374
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,582
-She was sentimental.
-Her expressiveness.

375
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,250
-Expressions were good.
-Now I get it.

376
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,837
That's cool.

377
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,839
I think it suits you.

378
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,798
-Really?
-Yeah.

379
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,593
-And you…
-Yeah?

380
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,179
You seem to have good taste in fashion.

381
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,848
So something like the clothing business?

382
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,642
I'm a tailor.

383
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,644
-Really?
-Yeah.

384
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,479
-Jin-taek?
-A tailor?

385
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,231
-Jin-taek.
-Jin-taek's here.

386
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,816
Wow, he is! There has to be
one person from a tailor shop.

387
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,944
1 YEAR AGO

388
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,237
Is this Jin-taek's shop?

389
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,323
OH JIN-TAEK AND KIM SE-JUN

390
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,574
Is that him?

391
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,451
-He used to have long hair?
-Huh?

392
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,954
-That's Jin-taek?
-He works at Jin-taek's shop?

393
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,706
-The long-haired man in the shop?
-The long-haired guy.

394
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,749
That's him?

395
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,542
Wow!

396
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,255
I work as a garment cutter
at a tailor shop.

397
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,550
I think I look the coolest
when I wear a suit,

398
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,594
and that's also when I'm the happiest.

399
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,558
So I was like, "Let's try making suits,"

400
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,145
which is how I chose
to work as a garment cutter.

401
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,607
KIM SE-JUN, 27,
TAILOR

402
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,694
No wonder he wore that when he arrived.

403
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,487
It was no ordinary suit.

404
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,447
-Yes.
-This is fun.

405
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,157
-I didn't expect that.
-No?

406
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,826
It suits you, your job.

407
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:26,952
Oh, yeah?

408
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,497
Yeah. Oh, then did you make
the clothes that you're wearing here?

409
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:31,915
Yeah.

410
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,584
That's cool.

411
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,628
I kinda made a few things to wear here.

412
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,963
-Really?
-Yeah.

413
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,047
That's really cool.

414
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,799
I see.

415
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,969
-I was also going to ask you this.
-What?

416
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,681
Why did you choose me?

417
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,058
First of all…

418
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:56,315
I originally, uh,
at the beginning, at the cafeteria,

419
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,275
right away, I thought you were nice.

420
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,902
You were cute and just very nice.

421
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,239
Was your journey here all right?

422
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,658
It's further away than I thought.

423
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,453
Right? If you're uncomfortable
with anything, just ask away.

424
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,370
Thank you.

425
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,541
You came up to me all of a sudden
and said you'd take care of me.

426
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:20,088
It's nice to see someone be adorable
and bright like that all the time.

427
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,801
After talking to you, I just thought…

428
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,474
it would be fun to go with you.

429
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,604
Also, when we talked…

430
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,108
Now, I'm kind of
just friends with everyone here.

431
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,780
And I was kind of sad about that at first.

432
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:49,618
But I don't think my position is that bad,
though I'm still a little sad about it.

433
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,163
You said you're all friends.

434
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,083
You've become friends with them
and they all treat you comfortably.

435
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,629
At first, you were a bit sad about it,
and well, you said these things.

436
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:05,092
So I brought you because I wanted
to show you that I don't feel that way.

437
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:07,969
-Really?
-Yeah.

438
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:08,887
I'm touched.

439
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,099
Oh, my gosh.

440
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,101
-Se-jun is adorable.
-Yes.

441
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,728
-I've never seen him like this.
-Talking shyly.

442
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,315
How was it before I got here?

443
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,942
Like, for you.

444
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,777
Did you have someone you liked, or…

445
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,694
Um…

446
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,655
Yes.

447
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,407
A little.

448
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,160
I should be honest.

449
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,459
Originally, I…

450
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,462
Um…

451
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,925
So far, we've gotten to choose
a few times like this,

452
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,177
-but my choice never changed.
-Mmm-hmm.

453
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:54,432
Because if I kind of
feel a certain way once,

454
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,810
my thoughts tend to not change.

455
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:57,769
Hmm.

456
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:05,569
Then there was an incident
that kind of settled things.

457
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:10,615
The other night,
when I expressed my feelings as they were,

458
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:15,245
the person was like, "Yeah,
but I don't think I can accept that."

459
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,707
And so I became friends with everyone.

460
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,126
Well, but that…

461
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,546
doesn't matter, though.

462
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,549
Hmm.

463
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,135
None of that matters to me.

464
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,679
I was just curious.

465
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,409
-Besides eating food here…
-Yeah?

466
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,456
have you talked to the others
who have been here?

467
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,499
Did you ask what else they did here?

468
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,794
-An amusement park.
-They went to an amusement park?

469
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:08,506
Yeah, that or they went swimming
or they talked and went to sleep.

470
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:10,967
But that would be a waste.

471
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,304
I want to enjoy this whole place
even if I have to stay up all night.

472
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,683
Yeah? Do you have the energy for it?

473
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,603
-Whatever you want.
-Yay!

474
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,230
I'll do whatever you want.

475
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,525
Good. Let's just enjoy everything.
All of it.

476
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:36,034
-I think Se-jun's a bit nervous.
-Yeah.

477
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:40,038
So-e seems like she's having
a pretty good time with Se-jun so far.

478
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:44,668
Earlier, when she left, I did think
that she didn't look very happy.

479
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:49,256
But seeing her go and talk and
now seeing the conversation going well,

480
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:54,886
now I think that maybe there could be
some kind of a hopeful result for the two.

481
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,973
So-e doesn't seem like
she has strong feelings for him.

482
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:02,894
But Se-jun seems very nervous,
more than I thought he'd be.

483
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:07,482
And his nervousness and shyness
are making me nervous just watching.

484
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,693
PARADISE
MIN-SU AND JIN-YOUNG

485
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,903
Have you been
anywhere like this before?

486
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:12,821
No.

487
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,658
Wow.

488
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:22,080
-This is amazing.
-Am I really seeing this?

489
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,291
Being the only ones here
really makes this…

490
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,167
-We are so…
-All just for us.

491
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,504
-Amazing.
-It is.

492
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,507
Wow. Should we go in?

493
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,467
-Yes.
-Oh, it's…

494
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,593
Is it deep?

495
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,558
Slowly.

496
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,186
-You sound like a swim instructor.
-This way.

497
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,314
Well…

498
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,941
this is very nice.

499
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,278
Do you know how to swim?

500
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,155
Just the basics.

501
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,197
Reach out an arm.

502
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,575
Now we'll start the lesson.

503
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,577
-You trust me, right?
-Yeah.

504
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,786
Relax your body.

505
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,830
Yeah, that's good.

506
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,999
-Yeah, keep going.
-Don't let go.

507
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,300
-You're doing great.
-This is my first time.

508
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,302
Okay, stand up.

509
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,763
That's the extent of my swimming.

510
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,015
No, you're really good. I'm not lying.

511
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,685
-I have the official certification.
-Right.

512
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,228
Life Sports Leader Level 2.

513
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,815
Want me to show you how?

514
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,699
♪ If you really wanna fly
Then we gonna get high tonight ♪

515
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,118
♪ Imma try
To have a really good time tonight ♪

516
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,329
♪ Rolling up with the boys
And the girls in the back ♪

517
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,331
♪ We're gonna turn it up ♪

518
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,209
♪ If you're shy then I get it

520
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,422
♪ If you really wanna fly

521
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,841
They're both laughing a lot.

522
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,137
They seem close already.

523
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:05,100
For me, Min-su seems like
she really likes Jin-young.

524
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,851
She laughs whenever he says anything.

525
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,478
-That's how she expressed it.
-Right.

526
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:12,357
"I don't have much time."
So she has to hurry and choose a person.

527
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,734
-I think she expressed it.
-Yes.

528
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,238
-I didn't feel any chemistry.
-Something doesn't feel like it clicks.

529
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,739
While I was watching--

530
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,242
Jin-young is on another pool date,
this time with Min-su.

531
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,994
But the vibe is different
from his pool date with Seul-ki.

532
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,205
Right. Before, it was
like a scene from a movie…

533
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,999
-Very sexy with Seul-ki.
-The same swimming scene, but…

534
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,461
Do you know why?
Jin-young's eyes are different.

535
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:38,341
When Jin-young was swimming with Seul-ki,
he looked at her very intimately.

536
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,719
But he's all over the place here.

537
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,805
He's just swimming,
doing the butterfly stroke.

538
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,640
-Having fun.
-They just seem friendly.

539
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,309
-It's like two close friends hanging out.
-Right.

540
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,061
INFERNO

541
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,313
There's so much
I'm curious about.

542
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,400
-Shall we ask one at a time…
-Some questions?

543
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,736
-O, X, right?
-Yeah.

544
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,279
-Okay.
-And one pass.

545
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,407
Shall I go first?

546
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,327
Going back to the original intention,
do you have someone you like?

547
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,246
Pass.

548
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:09,914
Pass?

549
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,335
-Is there someone you're curious about?
-O.

550
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,379
What are you curious about?

551
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,508
If the person is curious about me too.

552
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,930
Then why are you curious?

553
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,392
There must be a beginning.
What triggered it?

554
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,394
What got you interested?

555
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,230
It was really fun when we talked.

556
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,985
Do you plan to act on that?

557
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,029
Are you going to try?

558
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,531
Yeah, I'm a bit already.

559
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,743
It's so not fun for me right now.

560
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,287
It's like…

561
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,291
I feel like I have to do something.

562
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,460
When are you going to out it into action?

563
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,878
What?

564
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,965
She means when are you going
to try to make it more fun for yourself?

565
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,343
-Soon.
-Really?

566
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,845
-Yeah.
-This is going to be so much fun.

567
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,056
I'm curious.

568
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,228
-Seul-ki shouldn't find this fun.
-Right.

569
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,231
She liked Jin-young a lot.

570
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,524
Nadine.

571
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,777
Right now, three of the women
like Jin-young.

572
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,362
Right, he's Mr. Popular.

573
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,907
Questions for Seul-ki.

574
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:30,119
-What could you want to ask me?
-There's a lot to ask you.

575
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,998
Should be
a lot of fun questions.

576
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,542
Right.

577
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,127
Is there one person for you?

578
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,380
-That's on my mind?
-Yes.

579
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,509
O, X, triangle.

580
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,344
-Triangle.
-Triangle?

581
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,891
Is the person you're interested in
currently on Inferno right now?

582
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,688
What?

583
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,357
Is the person you're interested in
currently on Inferno?

584
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,567
Yes.

585
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:13,705
If you have feelings,
do you tend to express them?

586
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,542
Yeah.

587
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:27,093
I have a tendency to go
straight at something if I'm hooked.

588
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,055
But I haven't had that feeling yet.

589
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,856
Then do you think you'll be
drawn to someone who's nicer to you?

590
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:40,815
No.

591
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,403
-Your heart has to feel it.
-Yeah.

592
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,615
-So Seul-ki.
-Yeah?

593
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,951
You're trying to choose someone
who your heart goes to?

594
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,872
Have you…

595
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,500
-almost made a decision?
-No.

596
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,920
Okay.

597
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,422
Okay.

598
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,506
Let's go!

599
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,383
I don't wanna play anymore.

600
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,802
I'm just going to watch.

601
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,807
-This is really hard.
-They're going back and forth.

602
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,808
This is hard.

603
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,228
But Seul-ki, unexpectedly,
when she was asked

604
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,356
if there was one person
she was interested in,

605
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,523
she said, "Triangle."

606
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,985
And when asked if the person
she's interested in was on Inferno,

607
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,320
she said, "Yeah."

608
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,698
Isn't this tremendous hope for Jong-woo?

609
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:35,578
Seul-ki felt a lot of pressure
from Dong-woo.

610
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,496
Yes.

611
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,040
But she was very kind
about Jong-woo's sincerity.

612
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:39,999
Right.

613
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,336
So it seems like she knows pretty well
about how he feels.

614
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,756
I think it's just that Seul-ki also
thinks of Jong-woo positively.

615
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,342
But what's important is when asked

616
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,011
if she wants someone to
express his feelings for her more,

617
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,096
she said, "No."

618
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:57,225
-So Jong-woo is like, "Oh, should I…"
-Right.

619
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,519
"…approach her more or what do I do?"

620
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,937
I think he's confused now.

621
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,940
Jong-woo was going back and forth
during that conversation.

622
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,874
It's charming in its own way.

623
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,544
Can we come in?

624
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,504
-Oh, yeah.
-Of course.

625
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,840
Of course.

626
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,050
Can I sit here?

627
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,844
Yeah. Sit on the pillow.

628
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,597
-You can sit.
-Yeah.

629
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,397
They should be back soon.

630
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,444
Right. How should we greet them?

631
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,697
-Let's not greet them.
-Don't look them in the eye.

632
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,199
I'm curious about
the looks on their faces.

633
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,660
-I'm most curious about So-e's feelings.
-Right?

634
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,204
-Could there be a change?
-I wonder how it was.

635
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,122
So-e?

636
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:09,505
You've all talked to Min-su.
What did you think of her personality?

637
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,884
She said her heart flutters
amidst comfort.

638
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,096
When she's with a guy,
and she has good chemistry

639
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,141
and is able to talk to them,
and when she feels comfortable

640
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,517
is when her heart pounds.

641
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,105
After they left,
I thought about it.

642
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,108
I think Jin-young is a good match for her.
The two of them.

643
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:32,070
I felt that they would
suit each other pretty well.

644
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,450
After I came back
from Paradise with Jin-young,

645
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,745
I felt like we became close the next day.

646
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,415
So if he hadn't gone to Paradise,

647
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,210
maybe we could have
spent more time together.

648
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:51,506
I would be lying if I said
I'm not disappointed at all.

649
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,010
But just because I'm disappointed
doesn't mean

650
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,222
that I want to change
the situation or anything like that.

651
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,357
It's warm.

652
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,713
That's the book Jong-woo gave her.

653
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,219
DON'T GET TOO NERVOUS
WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE

654
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,721
IF YOU KEEP TENSING UP
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TOO HARD

655
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,932
SO STOP TRYING SO HARD
THINGS WILL WORK OUT EVENTUALLY

656
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,760
Ah.

657
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:21,888
Hmm.

658
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:26,559
For what it's worth, she's shedding tears
after reading the book Jong-woo gave her.

659
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,103
-That's a great sign, right?
-Yes.

660
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,190
I think it's being interpreted differently
from how Jong-woo intended.

661
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,066
She wasn't reading it thinking about him.

662
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:39,113
Jong-woo gifted the book to her because
he wanted her to know how he feels.

663
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,823
That's why he gave her the book.

664
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,368
But I think she interpreted it

665
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,455
by applying those words
towards Jin-young, so it's a bit sad.

666
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,291
Really? Well, we don't know why she cried.

667
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,417
The content.

668
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,503
That's Jong-woo feelings

669
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,715
but to Seul-ki,
it's the same as how she feels.

670
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:58,674
Right.

671
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,846
-It's suddenly humid.
-Yeah.

672
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,724
-I felt it when we got here.
-The door got me. This tore.

673
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,392
Watch out for that twig.

674
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,689
I got hit
as soon as you let go.

675
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,611
-It was unnecessary kindness.
-Yeah, thanks.

676
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,954
Why is it so quiet?

677
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,166
-You were great.
-You were, too.

678
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,503
Yeah, it was fun.
See you later.

679
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,671
Yes, it was fun.

680
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,838
Yeah, it was fun.

681
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,223
Wow. Who is it?

682
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,727
-Look who it is.
-Welcome back.

683
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,605
So-e and Min-su,
did you have a good time?

684
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,858
Wow.

685
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,195
What's that jacket?
Haven't seen it before.

686
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,697
I just bought it.

687
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,615
-You went shopping?
-Is it Se-jun's?

688
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,117
It's Se-jun's.

689
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,328
-How was it?
-I'm curious.

690
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,163
You look so nice, though.

691
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,668
I slept really well, so that was nice.

692
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:19,547
And we both like dessert so much
that we ate three cakes.

693
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,257
And had fruit.

694
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,843
-Did it all, ate it all.
-I ate it all.

695
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,970
-You both love desserts.
-Yeah.

696
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,222
It was comfortable.

697
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,683
The bed was soft.

698
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,102
Right?
It's like sleeping on a cloud.

699
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:36,355
-Did something form a bit more?
-A bit more.

700
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,609
We were close here, too, so…

701
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,528
It's only been a day.

702
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,865
Yeah. We hung out.
It was comfortable and fun with her.

703
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,199
-I see.
-Yes.

704
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,619
We talked a lot, and now that I'm back,

705
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:55,541
I think I feel a lot more comfortable
about being here.

706
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,171
Good for you.

707
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,507
Why are you clapping?

708
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,260
Now, then. Min-su?

709
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:10,890
Me, too.
I think it was comfortable and fun.

710
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:14,810
We ate, and we swam.
We came back and talked.

711
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,146
Did you talk a lot?

712
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,566
I think we did. We just kept talking.

713
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,652
The most memorable moment?

714
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,280
The swimming pool.

715
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,283
Or the moment
you were most excited?

716
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,869
Aren't they the same thing?

717
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,537
The swimming pool!

718
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,875
-Did you swim?
-Yes, we swam for a while.

719
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,710
You didn't actually swim, did you?

720
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,170
I did.

721
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,297
-You actually did?
-Battle swimming.

722
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,801
What did you do yesterday?

723
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,011
-Yesterday?
-Yes, I'm curious about that.

724
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,846
It's our secret.

725
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,100
-Won't tell you.
-What did you do?

726
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,060
Punishment
for going to Paradise.

727
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,812
We'll talk if you don't go.

728
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,272
You saw each other's chemistry
with the guys.

729
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,942
How was it, do you think?
Your couples' chemistry.

730
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,111
Did you feel anything?
Almost nothing, no?

731
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:08,697
When we first left, I felt like
that the two of them were very awkward.

732
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:12,535
But on our way back, I could see that
the two of them had gotten very close.

733
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,745
He kept taking care of her.

734
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,790
I could feel that.

735
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,920
But wait. Se-jun and I
just gave you lots of information.

736
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,463
You should give us some, too.

737
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,924
The person who
came back from Paradise should talk.

738
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:27,842
Or don't go.

739
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,178
You tell the Paradise stories.
You went on a good date.

740
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,556
You already
went and came back,

741
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,766
so what are we doing here right now?
Smelling nice.

742
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,851
You being territorial?

743
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,562
Dressed in white like someone
who's been to Paradise.

744
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:45,443
The hottest inferno in the world,
Single's Inferno.

745
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:50,698
Soon, you will play a game to win an
opportunity to go on a date in Paradise.

746
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,159
Participants, please come to the beach.

747
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,743
Let's go.

748
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,036
Here we go.

749
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,706
I'm not confident.

750
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,833
I really want to win.

751
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,752
Me, too. I really want to win.

752
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,795
Se-jeong…

753
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,255
We have to credit Se-jeong.

754
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,299
-Please.
-Please.

755
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,134
All right, Se-jeong. You got this.

756
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,684
We must be
doing something similar.

757
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,812
-Women or men?
-Getting teamed up is a problem.

758
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,647
-Wow.
-Wow.

759
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,691
What is this?

760
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,528
What is this? What will we be doing?
I'm curious.

761
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,322
Water here, and this is…

762
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,366
It's water.
Maybe it's a kind of pushing game.

763
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,784
A duel in the mud?

764
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,286
A duel in the mud.

765
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,964
-Now what?
-Right?

766
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,512
Now, we will begin
the female contestants' game

767
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:58,432
for the chance to win an opportunity
to go on a date in Paradise.

768
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,476
-What?
-Female contestants'?

769
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,019
Females.

770
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,271
Not a mixed-gender game? Just the women?

771
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,857
-Didn't expect this.
-Didn't think it would be just the women.

772
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,569
Only the first, second,
and third-place winners of the game

773
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,865
can choose a male participant they would
like to go on a date in Paradise with.

774
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:16,825
Three of get to go?

775
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,495
If there's an overlap, we can't go?

776
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,705
With an overlap,
you don't get your choice.

777
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,041
First place will choose first.

778
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:29,046
If you came in second place and the
person you wanted has gone already,

779
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,548
-Yeah.
-then what happens?

780
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:31,799
Go with another person.

781
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,176
Go with another person.
Do you just go with anyone?

782
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,720
-Well, like--
-So the person you're interested in.

783
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,098
The person
you want to get to know.

784
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,933
Today's game is…

785
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,435
Korean wrestling.

786
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,312
Korean wrestling?

787
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,689
Korean wrestling.

788
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:47,856
-No way.
-Korean wrestling?

789
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,776
-Oh, my gosh.
-I've never done it before.

790
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,445
-Never done it before.
-Me neither.

791
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,239
Korean wrestling?

792
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,283
First, the female contestants

793
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,494
are to choose a ball
from the black box in front of you.

794
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:05,040
People who choose the same-colored ball
will be dueling each other.

795
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,542
-Oh!
-That's tough.

796
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,504
I want either So-e or Seul-ki.

797
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,719
The rules of the game are

798
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:21,348
if any body part above the knee
touches the ground, you lose.

799
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,437
First, second and third place
will be determined by

800
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,939
how fast the winners
eliminate their opponent.

801
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,402
The person who wins the fastest
is first place.

802
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,070
End the match quickly.

803
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,656
So they have to be aggressive.

804
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,992
Now choose your ball.

805
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,330
Size will be important for this
in the beginning.

806
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:48,042
Physically, wouldn't it be
Seo-eun or Nadine?

807
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,543
Ah, there's also Se-jeong.

808
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,628
Yeah.

809
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,172
Se-jeong, yes.
She'll go at it hard this time, right?

810
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,427
I'm nervous. Oh, my God.

811
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,767
-Red.
-I'm nervous.

812
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,147
It's red! Woah!

813
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,232
They kind of match.

814
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,110
-Yes, it's a size competition. They match.
-They do.

815
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,403
-What do we do?
-Wait.

816
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,238
We have to do it amongst ourselves.

817
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,408
I'm so nervous.

818
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,368
Green.

819
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,870
No. I'm scared.

820
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,209
-Green.
-Both are green!

821
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,377
Wow!

822
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,921
Both are green.

823
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,714
-Choose.
-Together?

824
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:36,799
Yeah.

825
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,259
Oh, the two of you.

826
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,636
I'm going to lose again.

827
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,056
-How did that happen?
-This is fun.

828
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:47,017
-Is that possible?
-This will be amazing.

829
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,812
They matched as per size.

830
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,939
Maybe their first time
doing Korean wrestling.

831
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,524
No reason for them to wrestle.

832
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,151
They don't do this
after elementary school, do they?

833
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,987
It's embarrassing to do
in front of the guy you like.

834
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:02,116
-But then they should.
-For a trip to Paradise.

835
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,617
They need to earn it.

836
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,203
Are you using your strength? I'm scared.

837
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,205
I've never done it, so I don't know.

838
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,416
Here we go.

839
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,459
Nadine, I'm scared.

840
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:13,877
I'm scared.

841
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,381
I want to go to Paradise.
I've only been there once.

842
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,678
-Let's go.
-I'm so nervous.

843
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:26,432
You two are lucky
that you're going against each other.

844
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,643
You almost had to
face the tall people.

845
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:34,815
Now, Shin Seul-ki and Lee So-e,
who chose the red balls,

846
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,984
please step inside the ring.

847
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,402
-Wow!
-Wow!

848
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,321
It's nerve-racking since I'm not doing it.

849
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:45,033
It's more nerve-racking
to watch others compete.

850
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,911
It is. Wow, why am I so nervous?

851
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,333
I'm already out of breath.

852
00:45:56,753 --> 00:46:00,299
Oh, my God. They must really be nervous.
Both have stone faces.

853
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,594
Look, their faces
have hardened.

854
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,388
-What do they do?
-That's how you hold it.

855
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,849
They have to
get in a good position.

856
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,063
-You can do this.
-You can do this.

857
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,565
You got this!

858
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,817
-Don't be nervous.
-You got this!

859
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:23,906
Ready.

860
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,160
It's tight.

861
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,288
They're straining already.

862
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,003
Oh, I can't watch.

863
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,399
Oh, look! Look!

864
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,735
The outer leg. That's the outer leg.

865
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,202
She's holding on.

866
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,496
-So-e's not going over.
-She's not.

867
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,456
So-e did well at the chicken fight, too.

868
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,792
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

869
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,418
Wait.

870
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,673
She's holding on.

871
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:24,716
Wait!

872
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,177
Wait!

873
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,012
Wait!

874
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,021
Wait.

875
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:43,569
Wait.

876
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,281
Oh, my God!

877
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,991
-Oh, my God! So-e won!
-So-e won.

878
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,242
Oh, my God!

879
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,412
She lost her balance
trying to interlock legs.

880
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:56,665
-Seul-ki tried her best. Gosh!
-She pushed.

881
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,333
Are you okay?

882
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,920
Lee So-e wins in 6.40 seconds.

883
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,673
So-e was good.

884
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,467
-So-e.
-So-e is not ordinary.

885
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,012
-Good job.
-You did great. So-e is tough.

886
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,388
-She's very strong.
-Yeah.

887
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,266
-She really just wouldn't go over.
-Right?

888
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,976
So-e wouldn't give in at all.

889
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,187
The second match is between

890
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,899
Lim Min-su and Park Se-jeong
who chose the green ball,

891
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,818
please step inside the ring.

892
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:32,618
I want Se-jeong to win, personally.
She's never been yet.

893
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:36,413
-I want to root for Se-jeong, yeah.
-Right.

894
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,206
I want her to go at least once.

895
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:42,586
-Se-jeong's expression…
-They're both not playing.

896
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:44,963
They're determined.

897
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:46,965
Big match.

898
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,889
-You got this!
-You got this!

899
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,099
-You got this!
-Don't be nervous.

900
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,228
-I can tell they're nervous.
-They are.

901
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,690
Look at their posture.
They're getting ready.

902
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,275
It looks intense.

903
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:18,997
That strength.

904
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,792
Whoa, whoa.

905
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,677
No!

906
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,220
-Se-jeong!
-Se-jeong!

907
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,430
Se-jeong, let's go today.

908
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,641
-Let's go!
-Se-jeong, go, please!

909
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,071
Whoa!

910
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,407
So close!

911
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,334
-Oh, why?
-Oh, gosh!

912
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,712
Oh, gosh.

913
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,755
Oh, my gosh.

914
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:11,258
Oh, I can't watch.

915
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,718
I'm going to cry.

916
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,678
Why don't things work out for her?

917
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:18,223
Lim Min-su wins in 7.24 seconds.

918
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,600
You did good. But it's a shame.

919
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:26,189
What's ironic is that all the people
who worked hard lost.

920
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:29,526
Min-su and So-e got good sleep
last night at the hotel.

921
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,740
Se-jeong, on the other hand,
was on Inferno for six days straight.

922
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,950
Don't get hurt.

923
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:42,164
The last match, Choi Seo-eun and
Lee Nadine, who chose the yellow balls,

924
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,040
please step into the ring.

925
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,543
-Let's go!
-You got this!

926
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,212
-You got this!
-Don't get hurt.

927
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:50,922
You got this.

928
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:09,608
Seo-eun could be good at this.
Her center of gravity is nice and low.

929
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,737
Yes, but I think Nadine
plays a lot of sports, too.

930
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,532
She may look thin, but she can be strong.

931
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,534
But her center of gravity looks good.

932
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:23,455
Yoong-jae keeps saying she's doing good
when she hasn't done anything.

933
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,541
It's cute.

934
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,631
No idea who'll win this one.

935
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:33,590
Ready.

936
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,719
-They got up right away.
-This is different.

937
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,480
Wow, look at her hold out.

938
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,899
-Nadine has the height.
-She's the tallest.

939
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:51,817
Yes.

940
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,587
With technique.

941
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,354
Who won this?

942
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,818
-Who won this?
-I fell first.

943
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,488
Lee Nadine wins in 7.68 seconds.

944
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,700
-What? I won?
-When I did this, I fell first.

945
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,869
-Nadine wins.
-Good job!

946
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,370
Great job!

947
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,664
Great job!

948
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,249
This was a great match.

949
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:52,043
It was.
It was a real Korean wrestling game.

950
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,301
-Good job. Your leg strength.
-You're very strong.

951
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,303
The results of the women's game

952
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:04,431
to win an opportunity
to go on a date in Paradise are…

953
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:08,059
First place at 6.40 seconds, Lee So-e.

954
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:11,938
You won again.

955
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:16,192
Second place is Lim Min-su
at 7.24 seconds.

956
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,903
She's going again.

957
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:23,241
Third place is Lee Nadine
at 7.68 seconds. Congratulations.

958
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,951
That was really cool.

959
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,538
I think there will be an overlap.

960
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,415
There is an overlap, I think.

961
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:34,252
-Min-su and Nadine are both for Jin-young.
-Right.

962
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,171
-As we predicted.
-Yes.

963
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:39,257
Min-su will go for Jin-young again.

964
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,509
-I think they'll definitely go.
-Really?

965
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,054
-By the way--
-The others, yes.

966
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:47,182
-So-e…
-She won't choose Yoong-jae, will she?

967
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,225
-It worries me.
-That would be very…

968
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,937
The So-e I know would choose Yoong-jae.

969
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,314
-Yeah, but…
-I mean…

970
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:57,067
The old So-e would have chosen Yoong-jae.

971
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,402
-But she said she's over him now.
-Right.

972
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,864
But because So-e might want to,
at least once,

973
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,867
talk in a nice place with good vibes
like Paradise…

974
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,494
I think she would.

975
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:10,538
You're right. She would.
See? You think she would.

976
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,791
Think about it.
What other choice is there?

977
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,709
-No.
-This is it.

978
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,130
Did everyone choose
who to go with?

979
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,424
I hate this.

980
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,219
Why? Because there are too many options?

981
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,679
Or that you have to choose?

982
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,015
Because I have more options.

983
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:29,933
Right.

984
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:35,105
But we just got back
and now we're going again, so…

985
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,940
Will you make the same choice?

986
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,274
I don't know, but…

987
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,275
-Will you?
-Will I?

988
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,027
-Will you?
-I'm not sure.

989
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,116
This is important.

990
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,827
This is important to Nadine.

991
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,705
-It's important to Seul-ki, too.
-Yes.

992
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,625
I'm going to have to think about it more.

993
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,044
Did you say there are people
you haven't spoken to?

994
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:58,962
Yes.

995
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:03,133
-People I haven't spoken with.
-That's something else you thought of.

996
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:07,053
-Someone I haven't talked to.
-And someone I'm curious about?

997
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,055
That's the whole point
of going to Paradise.

998
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,849
-Right.
-It's to get to know…

999
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,142
…them better.

1000
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,436
-Yeah.
-That's what it's good for.

1001
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,021
You could go if you…

1002
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,984
Ask the person
who finished before the last…

1003
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,028
-Encouraging her.
-Go with someone else.

1004
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,529
-Go with someone else.
-Yeah.

1005
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:25,488
That's very cute.

1006
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:31,369
Won't there be some kind of restrictions
the way they had before?

1007
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,873
Like you can't go with the same person
you went with yesterday?

1008
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,875
You can't pick the one
you went with before…

1009
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,168
I don't think so.

1010
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,962
Because this was won through a game.

1011
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,257
I think Jin-young will go.

1012
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,596
But I want to stay here today.

1013
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,976
Too many business trips? Right.

1014
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,313
No. I don't mean it like
I think I'm going to be chosen.

1015
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:00,315
There's this specific cool vibe here.

1016
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,234
But I keep going to this place
where everything's all perfect.

1017
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,570
That's interesting psychologically.

1018
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,405
It's just hard for someone like me.

1019
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,208
What's up?

1020
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:22,045
I have a lot to talk about.

1021
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,130
-With me?
-Yes.

1022
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,632
-Shall we?
-Yes.

1023
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,634
Now?
Do you want to talk for a bit?

1024
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,512
Is she going
to talk about Yoong-jae?

1025
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,847
Of course it's about Yoong-jae.

1026
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:33,932
-Stop.
-No way.

1027
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:36,226
What do you mean "no way"?
You all know this.

1028
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:44,651
Right now…
I'm conflicted between two choices.

1029
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,571
One is someone I appreciate,

1030
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:54,744
and the other I would choose
to just let go of lingering feelings.

1031
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,331
I don't know what to do.

1032
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,376
But you're wise, so I want your advice.

1033
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:04,420
I'm wise? I'm wise? Aw.

1034
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,097
You went yesterday too.

1035
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:19,352
How do you think…
yesterday's Paradise felt to you?

1036
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:20,603
You and Se-jun.

1037
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:26,359
Se-jun and I… We had fun,
and I enjoyed it.

1038
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:31,573
My heart really felt so much better…
while talking to him.

1039
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,909
But somehow, I feel more thankful.

1040
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:39,164
That kind of feeling, like,
in this time of feeling lost,

1041
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:42,750
-he helped by taking me to Paradise.
-Yeah.

1042
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,922
But then if I go with the other choice…

1043
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:53,386
I'll be choosing him while knowing
my chances are very slim

1044
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,013
from things that he said.

1045
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,145
But to be honest…

1046
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:09,235
in the end, Paradise,
the time spent there should be so fun.

1047
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:17,494
If it were me, I would maybe want
to gift myself a Paradise.

1048
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,539
That's a different situation
than yesterday.

1049
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,337
Because it's something you earned.

1050
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,671
It's an opportunity.

1051
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,425
Nobody can say anything. Right?

1052
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,304
I think you're right.

1053
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,432
It's like a gift to myself.

1054
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,185
That phrase just sounds exactly right.

1055
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,111
This situation is ironic.

1056
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,947
And So-e will be encouraged.

1057
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,323
-Right.
-Yes.

1058
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:58,284
But if I take someone
who doesn't have feelings toward me,

1059
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,662
will the place really be a gift to myself?

1060
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:03,498
The time won't be a gift to myself.

1061
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:07,460
But she still has a lot of
lingering feelings for Yoong-jae.

1062
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,254
She does have to get rid of them.

1063
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:12,298
If she's going to get rid of them,
she'll be checking how he feels

1064
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,509
once, twice, three times, four times.

1065
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:17,470
So she's going to keep checking
over a night and two days?

1066
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,430
Isn't that such a cruel trip for her?

1067
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,015
Bus this…

1068
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:24,477
I think So-e saying she wants
to get rid of lingering feelings is a lie.

1069
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,647
-Right.
-It's just a justification to go.

1070
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,526
Gosh, I don't think I'll be able to watch
Yoong-jae's face when he's there.

1071
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,903
-It's hard.
-And Seo-eun seemed so relaxed.

1072
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:37,490
-Right, why is Seo-eun so relaxed?
-Maybe she's that kind of person.

1073
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:41,578
If I were Seo-eun, I think I'd be like,
"Sure, do whatever you want. Go ahead."

1074
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:45,206
If So-e is the type to express
her feelings to that extent,

1075
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,499
then go with Yoong-jae.

1076
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,627
I want to say this to her.
Just go. So-e, go.

1077
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:53,089
Because we all know So-e had
the hardest time because she liked him.

1078
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,425
Yeah. Go swim. Do whatever you want to do.

1079
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,468
-Absolutely not.
-So-e, no.

1080
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,096
Oh, no, no. They have to go.

1081
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,264
No, So-e. Go.

1082
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:03,808
-Better to go.
-Whatever you want.

1083
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,812
-Nadine.
-Yeah?

1084
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:09,522
Do you have someone in mind?

1085
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,649
-I do.
-You've decided?

1086
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,359
-Yeah.
-Really?

1087
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:18,698
I'm not sure if I should go
with the person I feel strongest about.

1088
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,450
Or if I should try someone else.

1089
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,285
This is hard.

1090
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:24,954
It's too early.

1091
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,915
You came in the middle,
and since you came later,

1092
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:32,503
getting to know other people… honestly…

1093
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,883
I'm going to go get a jacket.

1094
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,217
Aren't you cold?

1095
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,927
-No.
-No?

1096
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,974
Nadine is so adorable.

1097
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,643
-So adorable.
-So adorable.

1098
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:47,769
I like Nadine.

1099
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,438
Trying to get her
in that direction somehow.

1100
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,733
-Want to play a game of cubes?
-Huh?

1101
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,777
-Do you want to play cubes?
-Do it by yourself.

1102
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,861
-Do it by myself?
-Yeah.

1103
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,780
I have so much on my mind right now.

1104
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,531
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

1105
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:01,908
I don't know what to do.

1106
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,911
I needed to win first place.

1107
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,705
I should've gotten first place.

1108
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,959
So now you must have
some choices in mind, then?

1109
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:17,215
I mean, I want to go
with someone who I really want to go with.

1110
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,257
Right.

1111
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,385
But that might not be possible.

1112
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,970
So I'm a bit worried right now.

1113
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,889
Because he could go first.

1114
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,309
-I'm pretty worried.
-Yeah.

1115
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,193
Is this Seul-ki's spot?

1116
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,195
Yes, it is.

1117
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,489
She must've read the book.

1118
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,825
Did she read it?

1119
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:45,493
-I think she did.
-She did.

1120
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:46,661
-She did?
-She did.

1121
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:47,578
Oh, she did.

1122
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,081
She read it.

1123
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,666
You're way too happy about it.

1124
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,294
She said she didn't read it the first day.

1125
01:01:56,337 --> 01:02:00,967
Jong-woo, your feelings are
toward one person with such certainty.

1126
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:01,884
Yes, I--

1127
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,011
-You don't get swayed, do you?
-I don't.

1128
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,598
I think everyone tries to be like that.

1129
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:12,311
I think I can try to be more brave here.

1130
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,777
Hello.

1131
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:21,446
-Sorry.
-Hi.

1132
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:22,613
Is he still in there?

1133
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,283
Yeah, I think so.
I haven't seen him come out.

1134
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,286
Why?

1135
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,204
I want to talk to Jin-young.

1136
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,124
What should I do?

1137
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,381
What should I do?

1138
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:42,091
Should I wait?

1139
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,888
-What should I do?
-What? It's all decided.

1140
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:50,183
-Should I just talk to him?
-I'll go in with you.

1141
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:53,186
-Hi.
-Hi.

1142
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,687
-For it to go well--
-Hi.

1143
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,605
Hi.

1144
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,441
You know those things we get from temples?

1145
01:02:58,524 --> 01:02:59,358
Yeah.

1146
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,155
Do you want to go get water?

1147
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,116
Okay.

1148
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,791
Se-jeong was also trying.

1149
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,376
He's so popular.

1150
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,629
-Four people like Jin-young?
-Yes.

1151
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:23,257
Yeah, things aren't working out.
They're all tangled up.

1152
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:26,260
Wow, Jin-young really shook things up.

1153
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,178
Right?

1154
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,896
This is the first time
we've talked in a while.

1155
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,232
Thank you for coming.

1156
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:41,818
Yeah, all right.

1157
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:45,738
Okay.

1158
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,490
How was Paradise yesterday?

1159
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:49,325
Paradise? Yesterday?

1160
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,369
Well, I think Paradise is just…

1161
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:53,496
-Always nice?
-It's a nice place.

1162
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:54,789
A nice place.

1163
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:58,626
What are your feelings?

1164
01:03:58,709 --> 01:03:59,794
My feelings…

1165
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,841
It wasn't exactly a comfortable situation.

1166
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:06,509
I think that's how it was.

1167
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,847
The flow keeps getting cut off
also plays a part

1168
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,558
when you keep going off
somewhere else like that.

1169
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:17,353
People weren't like this at first.

1170
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,856
It became like this once you got here.

1171
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:21,190
-Really?
-Yeah.

1172
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:27,029
People actively go up to others now.
Like this.

1173
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:30,575
That cuts off the flow, too,
while people are talking.

1174
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,411
It's a bit like you mixed everything up.

1175
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,705
Yeah, everything like this.

1176
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,666
-It's hard.
-That's so difficult.

1177
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:39,917
It's really difficult.

1178
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:43,212
So difficult.

1179
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:50,636
Things were very uncomplicated
for me here this whole time.

1180
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,388
Just having fun with friends.

1181
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,604
But I keep feeling like I shouldn't be.

1182
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,189
Especially today.

1183
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,525
Starting today, I think that's…

1184
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,153
how I'm thinking.

1185
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:12,742
I think the situation
is more complicated than I thought.

1186
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:14,744
-The situation?
-The situation here.

1187
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:19,540
But it's not complicated for you, is it?

1188
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,126
Me? It's complicated for me, too.

1189
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:23,544
-Oh, it is?
-Yeah, it is.

1190
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,505
What's complicated? Can you tell me?

1191
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,552
Whenever I talk to someone new,

1192
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:33,721
these feelings I get
are all a bit different.

1193
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:34,764
So I don't know…

1194
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:39,602
if it means that I like a person
who makes me curious,

1195
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,980
or if I like a person
who makes my heart race,

1196
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,817
or if I like a person
who I just have fun with.

1197
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:50,529
I don't think I've set the standards yet.

1198
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:54,575
So there are just three?

1199
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,495
Uh…

1200
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:02,792
I'm curious.

1201
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,798
Nadine, you're kind of
who I'm curious about.

1202
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,134
-Me?
-Yeah.

1203
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,768
And I think you're a charming person.

1204
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:36,075
The ocean's nice even though
the weather is a bit not good, but…

1205
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:39,495
The water's nice!

1206
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:40,538
Yeah, it is.

1207
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:42,498
Do you know Jurassic World, that movie?

1208
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:45,292
-Jurassic World?
-Yeah, Jurassic World.

1209
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:48,379
Look behind you.
It's totally like Jurassic World.

1210
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:51,882
Oh, right!

1211
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:53,426
That vibe.

1212
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:59,306
Do you know a film called If Only?

1213
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,266
If Only?

1214
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,475
-Yes.
-No.

1215
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,852
You don't know the film?

1216
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,395
Kind of like,
how should I put this?

1217
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:06,397
It's like a melodrama, but…

1218
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,398
I like melodramas.

1219
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:09,316
Romance and melodrama are different.

1220
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,776
-Are they different?
-Yeah.

1221
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,029
How so? I'm not sure
what the difference is.

1222
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,613
Melodrama is like…

1223
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,158
Romance and melodrama?

1224
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,827
Doesn't the "melo" part mean romance?

1225
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:25,791
Hello.

1226
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:29,879
Welcome, hi.

1227
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:39,013
-Aren't you cold?
-I'm so cold.

1228
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:40,681
-Take my blanket.
-No, I'm fine.

1229
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,641
-Use it. I'm going.
-You are?

1230
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,602
-There's one more.
-Oh, yeah.

1231
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:45,936
I'm going to run.

1232
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:46,896
Bye.

1233
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:49,190
-Bye.
-See you.

1234
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:52,610
You're here.

1235
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:53,903
Yes, I'm here.

1236
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:54,820
Min-su.

1237
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:01,202
Nadine.

1238
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:02,703
Where have you been?

1239
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,664
Me? Beach.

1240
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,209
-Beach.
-It's warm in here.

1241
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,503
Where's Jin-young?

1242
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:15,132
-He's talking to Min-su.
-He went to talk to Min-su?

1243
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:17,510
He was talking with me
but then Min-su came.

1244
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:22,348
-You were talking to Jin-young?
-Yeah.

1245
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,516
With Jin-young.

1246
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:33,359
To be honest,
I don't know what Jin-young is thinking

1247
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,069
and what…

1248
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:36,695
he's not thinking!

1249
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,075
I think he's someone
who's mind I can't figure out.

1250
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:45,913
I can't figure him out,
and I think he's confusing me,

1251
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,792
so my feelings are a bit complicated.

1252
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,503
And I think it's only
becoming more complicated.

1253
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,506
She seems really frustrated.

1254
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:58,092
This means Jong-woo has a chance.

1255
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:01,303
This is Jong-woo's
"this is my chance" time.

1256
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,221
Yeah, could be.

1257
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,349
Jong-woo.

1258
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,685
Can we talk for a bit?

1259
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:10,688
I heard you read the book.

1260
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,815
-Yeah.
-Nadine told me.

1261
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:19,363
I opened it yesterday and today.

1262
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:22,700
-You opened it just like this?
-Yeah, but…

1263
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:25,411
But I saw this side today…

1264
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,623
…and it had me thinking a lot.

1265
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:31,500
Yeah?

1266
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:45,097
Here, first,
let's wipe away the tears a bit.

1267
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,187
Wet wipes?

1268
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:54,106
Why would you give me wet wipes
when I'm crying?

1269
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,191
Oh, I'm sorry.

1270
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:58,903
He should have given her tissues,
not wet wipes. That's what I thought.

1271
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:00,696
That's Jong-woo's charm.

1272
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,949
That's Jong-woo's charm.
His awkward charm.

1273
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,412
Why would you give me wet wipes
when I'm crying?

1274
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:09,747
Oh, I'm sorry.

1275
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:12,917
I mean, I'm a little flustered.

1276
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:16,879
Let me try again.

1277
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:18,172
Here.

1278
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:21,634
Talk while looking at the mirror.

1279
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:23,802
I'll hold it for you.

1280
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,804
You don't want to mess up your makeup.

1281
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:38,484
For most of the time
that I've been here, there weren't

1282
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,903
a lot of hard moments.

1283
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:41,820
But…

1284
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:46,033
today, for the first time, it felt hard.

1285
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:50,079
In my life…

1286
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:56,543
I've always done everything
I wanted to do how I wanted to do it.

1287
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,212
And all the things I've wanted,

1288
01:10:58,295 --> 01:11:01,465
I've always accomplished
through my hard work and my will.

1289
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:04,843
I've accomplished everything.

1290
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:09,306
But here, things aren't working out
the way I want despite my efforts.

1291
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,561
Then I thought of you, Jong-woo.

1292
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:15,980
Ah!

1293
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:17,690
It really…

1294
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,611
must have been hard for you.

1295
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,154
More than I could've thought.

1296
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:26,740
Yeah.

1297
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:33,747
To be honest, I can see…

1298
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,126
the effort you're making with me.

1299
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:38,585
Yeah, that's right. I am.

1300
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,380
I would be lying
if I said I don't feel it.

1301
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,298
Hmm.

1302
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:47,303
But just because I try hard doesn't mean
I expect something in return.

1303
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:48,220
I'm just…

1304
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:53,475
following my heart
and doing what my feelings tell me to do.

1305
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:56,854
From the beginning…

1306
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,983
I just kept… choosing you.

1307
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,819
I couldn't see anyone else.

1308
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:10,617
I don't know why.
Just that feeling, you know.

1309
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,414
You doing that from the beginning…

1310
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:18,667
is a bit surprising.

1311
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,422
I kept wanting to go with you…

1312
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:27,843
so it was very hard, but…

1313
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,517
Here. Take this.

1314
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:39,396
Wait.

1315
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:42,316
It's gone.

1316
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:46,737
-Don't cry anymore.
-I wanted to win the game today.

1317
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:48,781
And with that opportunity…

1318
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:52,493
I wanted to use the opportunity on you.

1319
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:56,455
Today…

1320
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:00,584
I really wanted to go with you, Jong-woo.

1321
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:04,463
-Really?
-When we did Korean wrestling.

1322
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:12,012
If I cry here, it'll be weird,
so I'm going to hold it in.

1323
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:13,597
I do tend to cry.

1324
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,015
I'm very sentimental.

1325
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,228
-Let's just cry here together.
-Should we?

1326
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:21,480
Gosh.

1327
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,652
I'll win the next game. Really.

1328
01:13:28,278 --> 01:13:30,406
All right? I'll win no matter what and…

1329
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:40,040
But if you get chosen,
just go and have fun for me.

1330
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:42,751
Will that work?

1331
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:44,503
I'd be anxious.

1332
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:49,967
I want to go with you, Seul-ki.
I don't think I could do that.

1333
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,137
I really couldn't do that.

1334
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:57,099
And I'm thankful that you told me this.

1335
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,727
This is the happiest I've been
since coming here.

1336
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,521
-Really?
-It's like my face…

1337
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:07,901
My face is a bit… lagging behind.

1338
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:09,236
-Really?
-Yeah.

1339
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:14,032
Did you finish your book?

1340
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:16,702
I did. I finished all the books I brought.

1341
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:18,954
-You read everything you brought here?
-Yes.

1342
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,248
You just read?

1343
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:22,916
It's all I did.

1344
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:26,420
I read a lot of books,
and made a lot of fires…

1345
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:28,839
…and waited for you.

1346
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:31,925
Then when you came back

1347
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:35,429
I was curious about what you had done,
so I'd ask you.

1348
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:36,388
Hmm.

1349
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:39,224
I can't wait to go on a date with you.

1350
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:47,232
For Jong-woo, this is such a nice moment.
Even if he doesn't go.

1351
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:52,821
But Seul-ki read the book
and says today was the hardest day.

1352
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:57,034
All the circumstantial things and feelings
were all read into that passage.

1353
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:58,118
Right.

1354
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,162
But if a person
is going through a hard time,

1355
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:03,373
thoughts about dating
and things like that could change a bit.

1356
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:07,669
Jong-woo is by Seul-ki's side when
she's going through a hard time.

1357
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:10,672
He was there for her from the beginning.
He's always there.

1358
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:15,677
The way I see it, Seul-ki didn't say,
"Jong-woo, I like you, I love you."

1359
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:19,890
She just said, "This time, I really wanted
to go to Paradise with you"

1360
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:22,518
I think we should just take it how it is.

1361
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:25,187
Do you know what the flaw
in this whole scenario is?

1362
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:26,563
What's that?

1363
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:29,816
The moment Jin-young
expresses his feelings to Seul-ki again,

1364
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,443
all this will fall apart.

1365
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,447
All of that, the passage
and tears and everything,

1366
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:39,159
holding a mirror up for her and wiping
the tears, all this will be gone?

1367
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:40,661
Right. Wouldn't it?

1368
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:44,373
-No. I think she'll be able to feel it.
-That's fair.

1369
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:46,750
I think it's possible
for something to form.

1370
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:52,714
You'll be going again.
Two days in a row. Isn't that a record?

1371
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:53,840
This frequent?

1372
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,599
Do you want to get to know the other men?

1373
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:10,566
Yeah. So I'm going to talk some more
before I choose.

1374
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:14,236
It's not often
that you get opportunities like this.

1375
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,114
You should carefully think things through.

1376
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:20,617
I think I'm conflicted.

1377
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,999
Yeah. I still have to
talk to a lot of people too.

1378
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,422
So now you want
to talk to different people?

1379
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:39,094
I guess, well…

1380
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:42,556
I didn't really have many chances
to compared to other people.

1381
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,268
I have to think about things carefully.

1382
01:16:47,811 --> 01:16:48,645
Well…

1383
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,654
At this point, Min-su, to be honest,

1384
01:16:57,738 --> 01:17:00,741
it might not be easy for her
to choose Jin-young.

1385
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:03,994
But when I ask myself
is Min-su were to not choose Jin-young,

1386
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:05,787
who would she choose instead?

1387
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:08,248
-There's no one who comes to mind.
-No one.

1388
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:12,085
Nadine's choice
will depend on who Min-su chooses first.

1389
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,003
Right.

1390
01:17:13,086 --> 01:17:15,422
I still feel like Min-su
will choose Jin-young.

1391
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:18,467
Wow, I'm really curious about this.
Who will they choose?

1392
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:19,843
So-e…

1393
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:23,013
seems like she'll be choosing Yoong-jae.

1394
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:26,683
I know you don't want
to believe that, Jin-kyung,

1395
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,352
but you know that'll happen.

1396
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:29,353
Yes.

1397
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:37,653
We will now match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

1398
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:41,698
Those who won the chance to go on a date
in Paradise through the game earlier,

1399
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:45,369
Lee So-e, Lim Min-su, and Lee Nadine,

1400
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,496
please come out to the campfire.

1401
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:53,126
What if I haven't decided yet?

1402
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,962
I haven't decided yet, either.

1403
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:59,466
I wonder who Nadine's going to choose.

1404
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:01,677
Nadine's going to choose Jin-young.

1405
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,928
Me?

1406
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:06,682
But Min-su…
Min-su might choose Jin-young again, too.

1407
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:10,352
-That could happen.
-Then the order may get weird.

1408
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,826
LEE SO-E

1409
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:28,620
LIM MIN-SU

1410
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,331
LEE NADINE

1411
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:37,838
Now, Lee So-e,
who won first place,

1412
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:42,134
shall choose the person she wants
to go on a date in Paradise with.

1413
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:53,729
To be honest, I haven't decided yet

1414
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:58,984
because Yoong-jae
is the person I was interested in,

1415
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:02,612
and Se-jun is the person
I am thankful for.

1416
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:06,575
When faced with the situation
where all of a sudden, I have to choose,

1417
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:08,994
honestly, it's a very difficult decision.

1418
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:17,753
What should I do?

1419
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:27,763
Se-jun, go get your jacket.

1420
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,598
No, I don't think so.

1421
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:32,601
I really think…

1422
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,814
She's going to choose someone else.
Someone unexpected.

1423
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:42,027
But you never really know
a person's thoughts.

1424
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:50,160
-You can do this.
-I'm sorry.

1425
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:55,207
Do whatever your heart wants, So-e.

1426
01:20:01,421 --> 01:20:03,507
-She can't seem to say it.
-No.

1427
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,884
She should do
whatever she feels like.

1428
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,970
Does she choose gratitude or passion?

1429
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:19,689
Is she still deciding?
Why isn't she saying anything?

1430
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:32,494
The person I'd like
to go to Paradise with is…
