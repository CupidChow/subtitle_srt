Single's Inferno, is finally back.

That was a very brief clip,

54
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,569
but didn't it already feel hotter
and more stimulating than last season?

55
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,030
What did you guys think
about the first video we saw?

56
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:21,743
It's hard to say because I couldn't really
see the cast's faces, not very much

57
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,912
but the bodies were definitely
like last season.

-Oh, earlier when…
-Yeah?

59
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,834
…when they showed this one part,
I was just so shocked.

60
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,546
-In that case, Single's Inferno succeeded.
-This is the hottest Inferno.

61
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,089
-[Da-hee] Yes.
-[Hanhae] For sure.

62
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,091
And I caught
a quick look at Paradise

63
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,969
and whereas they showed
one room last season,

64
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,388
here, it feels like
they showed us the whole hotel.

65
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,556
There was a merry-go-round.

66
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,309
I heard that
Single's Inferno Season One

67
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,145
actually ranked fourth place
internationally on Netflix.

-In the whole world.

70
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,360
…apparently got a great response
in Europe and South America.

71
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,862
I saw on a foreign platform I follow

72
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,449
where foreigners left ratings and reviews
on Single's Inferno

73
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,994
and I realized this show is watched
by people all over the world.

74
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,120
-Oh, for sure.
-Yes.

75
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,624
I remember when the season one episodes
were originally released,

76
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,543
I had people asking me about it
within a couple of hours.

77
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,544
-Right.
-[Jin-kyung] Yeah.

we have this season?

would be my eyes.

00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,157
I used to be a soccer player.

159
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,534
so I've been playing soccer
since elementary school.

160
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,288
But now I play soccer or futsal as a hobby

161
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,873
on teams with my friends.

162
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,085
Since I was an athlete,

163
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,504
I tend to be very competitive.

164
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:16,467
I'm quite confident
about my strength during games.

165
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,013
I usually go for women with pretty eyes.

166
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,809
If I meet someone who's my type
on Single's Inferno,

167
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,270
I think I'll try to express myself a lot,
even if it's nerve-wracking,

168
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,357
and try my best so that she'll like me.

169
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,153
I think what makes me attractive
is my empathy and my sensitivity,

170
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:40,408
and also how the corners of my mouth
naturally curl upward.

171
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,412
Wow, he has a nice smile.

172
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,497
-Pretty smile, right?
-Yeah.

173
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,296
This is awkward.

174
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,715
It is very awkward.

She's adorable.

Hello, my name is Lee So-e.

I like to think I have a calm personality,
and I'm quite honest.

I really like to dance.

191

Dancing relieves stress,
and it's good for losing weight.

192
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:14,001
My type is someone
who is generous and stable.

I think I'm into guys who are tall
and have strong features.

I think there's something about
being in their arms and feeling safe.

195
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:27,306
What makes me attractive is that
I laugh a lot, I'm a good listener,

196
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,391
and this is a little embarrassing,

but I think I'm quite popular.

198
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:37,942
I did have a crush on a guy once,
and I succeeded in dating him.

199
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,737
It was just that one time,
so I guess my success rate is 100%.

Even if the person doesn't like you,

My name is Jo Yoong-jae.

222
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:29,053
Many people think I'm an athlete
when they first see me,

223
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,972
maybe because I have a big build.

224
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,933
Well, I'm curious.

225

He's cool.
There's something natural about him.

00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,313
[Yoong-jae]
I think strength is very important,

227
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,567
so I do regularly CrossFit
and I go hiking.

228
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,154
Even if someone stronger than Season 1
comes on the show,

229

I'm confident I'll win.

Honestly, I think I'm quite popular
with the opposite gender.

When I was in college,

232

there was a post
on the school's online community

"the shoulders of the business school."

I have a cold and honest personality.

I think I sound different
when I speak English versus Korean.

I think I've decided to come on
to Single's Inferno

because I wanted to make some
new special memories,

[in Korean] I like playing soccer
and lacrosse.

[in Korean] my narrow waist.

263
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:49,485
I'm on the taller side,
so my ideal guy would be tall as well.

Also, they should drive better than I do.

It's very refreshing

I tend to fall head over heels.

477
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,874
[Master] Hello, singles.

478
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,337
The hottest Inferno in the world,

479
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,632
Single's Inferno is back.

480
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:45,265
I'm the Master of Single's Inferno,
and I'm here to help you find love.

00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,224
Wow…

[upbeat music playing]

483
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,855
First, I need to tell you
the rules of Inferno.

484
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,860
Inferno is isolated from the world.

485
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,571
You will not be able to use
any electronic devices.

486
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,325
For food, you must cook for yourselves
with the ingredients provided.

487
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,619
Professions, ages,

488
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,497
and places of residence
must not be revealed.

489
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,962
Using only your natural charms,

490
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:20,049
you must actively win over each other's
hearts to become a couple.

491
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,344
Okay.

492
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,098
[Master] Those who become a couple
will spend a night in Paradise.

493
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,269
In Paradise,
luxurious suites await you.

494
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:37,066
And there, you can reveal to you partner
your profession, your age,

495
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,568
and your place of residence.

496
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,824
Whatever information you hear
during your stay in Paradise

497
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,912
must not be revealed
in Inferno under any circumstances.

There are maps of the island
on the table in front of you.

into teams of three

502
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:05,136
in the order you are seated,
and begin exploring the island now.

503
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,432
I think this is where we are.

[Nadine] I'm hungry suddenly.

[Seul-ki] Look at those cauldrons.

522
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,553
[Jong-woo] The ingredients
should be there?

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,514
Look at all those daikons.

524
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,766
[Jong-woo] So many daikons…

525
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,227
[Seo-eun] We should
do something with them.

526
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,563
They don't expect us
to cook with just these?

527
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,190
One daikon per person.

528
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,692
There should be a cook.

529
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,485
I wonder who it is this time.

530
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,029
Is there water here?

531

Empty, right? We have to go get it?

532

[Nadine] Oh, we have to get it ourselves.

533
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,163
I guess we're supposed to carry
the water with these.

-Yes.

Yes.

00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,984
Do you work out?

547
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,988
-Well, I like sports better.
-Ah, sports.

-But not something like Pilates.
-Working out?

-Weight training.
-Yeah. Weights.

I thought you were talking about
going to the gym and working out.

-Yes. Soccer.

-Yes.

-Hobbies.

I played soccer for almost ten years,
but now I'm not that good.

[Han-bin] Good guess.
She actually plays soccer.

To be honest, it was just a random guess,
but getting it right isn't easy.

565
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,454
Her reaction felt like,
"As if I would play soccer."

-Thought she'd say that.
-[Dong-woo] Yes.

567
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,584
So it's soccer, right? Not football?

-Yes.
-Soccer.

Do you know lacrosse?

-The thing where you use a stick.
-Yes, a stick.

I have no idea what that is.

575
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,683
I guess, it's kind of like polo.

with something like a hockey stick.

I don't want to say.

-But didn't you just tell us?

it probably has a nice view.

00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,601
Hold on a second.

635
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,895
[melodic drill instrumental playing]

636
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,690
[So-e] Where is it?

637
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,615
Is it all right with you
if I try to take it out?

638
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,616
Yes.

639
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,417
[Se-jeong] Is it out?

640
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,752
Wait.

641
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,172
Wait. Is it out?
It kind of feels like it's out.

642
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,924
[Yoong-jae] How does it feel?

643
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,550
-I think it's out.
-Oh.

644
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,887
-[So-e] That's good.
-[Se-jeong] Thank you.

645
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,264
Trivial incidents like that

646
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,058
-can lead to something bigger.
-[Kyuhyun] That's true.

647
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,101
I bet So-e is looking for a splinter too.

648
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,312
[laughing]

649
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,022
Yoong-jae seems nice.

650
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,233
-He does things very calmly.
-Yes.

651
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,236
[Yoong-jae] I think you should walk
as carefully as you can.

652
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,153
[Se-jeong] Yes.

653
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,781
[Yoong-jae] The road is kind of rough.

654
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,617
So we should just take it slow.

655
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,743
[Se-jeong] Good idea.

656
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,079
This place could be good later on.

657
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:28,996
For what?

658
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,499
[chuckles] For when I am alone
with someone.

659
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,043
-[Se-jeong] So they could hold on to you?
-[Yoong-jae] Yes.

660
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,836
[Se-jeong] That's true.

661
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,133
Gosh, the three of them here,
these three. It's like destiny.

662
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,427
-How they were split.
-Way they were seated.

663
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,471
During the tour, did you notice

664
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,140
any of them showing an interest
in anyone in particular?

665
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,434
-Jong-woo.
-[Jin-kyung] Jong-woo?

666
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,603
Jong-woo asked Seul-ki
a lot of questions.

667
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,729
Ah!

668
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,481
Even if they asked some question,

669
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:58,025
didn't you feel any difference
in their eyes?

670
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,568
-I kind of felt that.
-[Kyuhyun] Right.

671
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:04,824
I think Se-jeong is interested
in Yoong-jae.

672
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,741
Yeah?

673
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:09,078
Because if it were me,
and I don't really like the person,

674
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,830
then I wouldn't ask him to help me.

675
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:15,501
I'd wait a bit even if it gets infected
and limp towards the guy

676
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,420
whom I like and then I'd…

677
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,754
[mimics groaning]

678
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,507
-[Hanhae] So you'd just suffer?
-Yeah, for a bit.

679
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,720
Yoong-jae also seems
to be easygoing and he responds well.

680
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,973
Taking care of someone
could be too much for some people.

681
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,599
True.

682
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,977
-But he does it without pressure.
-Right.

683
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,521
He's attentive but he's easygoing
going about it.

684
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,522
Good observation.

685
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,483
I saw Da-hee react to someone
for the first time today.

686
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,193
-She was like…
-[Hanhae] She started whispering.

687
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,904
"I think I get why you brought up
Yoong-jae earlier."

688
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,365
-And I'm like, "Go away."
-[Da-hee laughing]

689
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,326
[Hanhae laughing] "Go away."

690
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,870
[Jin-kyung and Da-hee laugh]

691
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,751
[Seo-eun] Wow. This is so cozy.

692
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,711
How was the tour?

693
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,338
-It was fun.
-It was fun?

694
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,630
[both laugh]

695
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,841
You sure you had fun?

696
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,968
I mean, we walked so much.

697
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,262
[Seo-eun] The island is a lot bigger
than I thought.

698
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,806
-It is.
-[Seo-eun] Did you see the cafeteria?

699
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,559
-Where we're supposed to cook?
-The 30 daikons?

700
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,353
There's 30 of them?

701
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,313
It seemed like it.

702
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,442
-[Dong-woo] Are you a good cook?
-[Jong-woo] Yes, I can make fried rice.

703
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,361
Chicken breast fried rice

704
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,945
-for when I'm on a diet.
-I see.

705
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,947
That's about it.
Nothing professional.

706
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,492
I like cooking and making food.

707
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,619
That's good. I was worried.

708
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,912
You could just tell us what to do.

709
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,705
[Jong-woo] Yeah and
we'd follow your orders.

710
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,790
[unzipping]

711
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,917
You're here.

712
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,627
-[Jong-woo] Gosh, you must be tired.
-Good job.

713
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,128
How was it?

714
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,756
-What did you learn?
-Yes.

715
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,885
So Nadine actually speaks English
better than she does Korean.

716
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,430
-Her responses were very short.
-[Yoong-jae] Yes.

717
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,140
She speaks English really well.

718
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,935
But not something like Pilates.

719
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,353
And she loves to exercise.

720
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,270
[men exclaim]

721
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,232
She likes sports like, soccer.

722
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,316
Oh!

723
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,945
It sounded like she played professionally.

724
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,905
She doesn't seem too talkative.

725
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,198
[Jong-woo] Surprising.

726
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,867
The two of you each went on a tour
with two women.

727
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,035
[Yoong-jae] Right.

728
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,704
Well, I went with Park Se-jeong

729
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:19,500
and Lee So-e
who were sitting on either side of me.

730
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,961
They both have good personalities,

731
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:25,714
and, as we were talking,
I found myself becoming interested.

732
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,968
How was it for you?

733
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,511
-Seul-ki?
-[Han-bin] Yes.

734
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,889
She seems very quiet,
but doesn't hold back her words.

735
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,350
-I see.
-[Jong-woo] She's that kind of person.

736
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,812
-It'll be fun once we get closer.
-[Yoong-jae] Once you're close.

737
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,982
[Jong-woo] And Seo-eun
is a great listener.

738
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,900
She makes good eye contact.

739
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,110
That kind of person.

740
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,987
Were you attracted to anyone?

741
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,197
Do I have to answer that? [laughs]

742
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,033
[Han-bin] You can say "no comment."

743
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:57,705
-Yes.
-Gosh, then it must be one of the two.

744
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,874
[Han-bin] Wow, come on.

745
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,877
Thank you. I mean,
I still have to talk to everyone.

746
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,337
-[Yoong-jae] Right.
-[Han-bin] Thanks for the honesty.

747
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,047
He's very kind.

748
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,967
We went on the tour with Yoong-jae…

749
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,761
-I see.
-[Se-jeong] …and he's very nice.

750
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,514
-They're all so nice.
-[Seo-eun] Choi…

751
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,016
[Seul-ki] And Choi Jong-woo.

752
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,642
He was extremely nice, too.

753
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,478
And Han-bin is so funny.

754
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,230
-It's almost as if he's the host…
-The host.

755
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,191
[Nadine] He was our tour guide.

756
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,942
-This way.
-[Kyuhyun laughs]

757
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,696
-I want to go on a trip with Han-bin.
-[Da-hee laughs]

758
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:34,658
Was there anyone
you thought was your type?

759
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,952
-How about you?
-I'm not sure.

760
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,162
[women chuckle softly]

761
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,663
And you?

762
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:43,626
No, I haven't talked to most of them.

763
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,170
-True.
-[Se-jeong] Just appearance-wise, though.

764
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,922
[Seul-ki] What about looks?

765
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,923
[Seo-eun] Looks…

766
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,344
I'm not sure.

767
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,513
"I'm not sure." Wait, what?

768
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:03,103
To be honest, I think Yoong-jae
made the best first impression.

769
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,898
I'm very sensitive
when it comes to scents,

770
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,525
and he was wearing cologne.

771
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:12,696
I was sitting right next to him,
and I remember him smelling nice.

772
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,242
The person who made
the best first impression is Yoong-jae.

773
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,159
PARK SE-JEONG

774
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,203
He kept taking care of me.

775
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,871
[Yoong-jae] Are you cold?

776
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,207
-I was a little but I'm fine now.
-You're okay now?

777
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,752
-[Yoong-jae] Your foot's okay?
-[Se-jeong] Yes.

778
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:30,589
You should sit here next time.
It has a good view.

779
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,258
Are you okay?

780
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,887
Is it all right with you
if I try to take it out?

781
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,516
[Yoong-jae] To me, the person
who made the best first impression…

782
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,433
JO YOONG-JAE

783
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,935
…is Park Se-jeong.

784
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,937
She started conversations.

785
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,855
Earlier, it suited you so well.

786
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,065
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

787
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,526
And she seems like a good listener.

788
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,778
So I became interested.

789
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:55,823
Wow, that's a love triangle right there.

790
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:56,824
LEE NADINE

791
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,077
When we were on the tour earlier,

792
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,871
Dong-woo asked a lot of questions,

793
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,583
so I think he helped make
the vibe very relaxed.

794
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,126
Are you a professional soccer player?

795
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,919
[Dong-woo] When I first saw everyone,

796
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,755
Se-jeong's the one
who really caught my eye.

797
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,673
SHIN DONG-WOO

798
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,718
She had a healthy, attractive charm.

799
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,637
So I think she kind of fits my ideal type.

800
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,641
I think the person who made
the best first impression

801
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,852
is Choi Seo-eun.

802
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,896
She stood out to me
even from very far away.

803
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,773
I think that's why
I found myself staring at her.

804
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,691
Wow.

805
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,986
The person who made
the best first impression

806
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:37,406
is Choi Jong-woo,
who I went on the tour with.

807
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:40,951
I was able to talk to him a lot,

808
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,120
and he was so comfortable
when he was leading us.

809
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,538
-For your back.
-Oh. Thank you.

810
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,125
Jong-woo, who accompanied me today.

811
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,043
SHIN SEUL-KI

812
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,461
I talked to him the most,

813
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,838
and he's the most memorable.

814
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,842
The woman who made
the best first impression is…

815
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:57,760
CHOI JONG-WOO

816
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:01,263
Well, out of the two,
the person who's closer to my type.

817
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,641
Well, Seul-ki is kind of
closer to my ideal type.

818
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:10,731
And I think that's why I sat next to her,
right when I first saw her.

819
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,361
Hello.

820
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,033
Oh, in that short moment.

821
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,951
He made a choice, right?

822
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,286
Starting already…

823
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,707
[Han-bin] Let's go make food.

824
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,336
[Seul-ki] Is anyone good at cooking?

825
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,629
[Jong-woo] Han-bin.

826
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,089
-[Seul-ki] Oh, really?
-[all laughing]

827
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,465
[Han-bin] No, I can't cook.

828
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,842
-[Seul-ki] That's good.
-[Jong-woo] The pressure is on you now.

829
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,305
[Han-bin] Let's cook up a delicious meal.

830
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,642
-[Se-jeong] It's just a lot of daikons.
-[Nadine laughs]

831
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,061
[Jong-woo] I only see daikons.

832
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,688
[Han-bin] I'll make shredded daikon.

833
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,817
[Han-bin] We'll need wood to start a fire.

834
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,276
[Jong-woo] Right, we have to start a fire.

835
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,112
[Jong-woo] This is survival.

836
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,698
[Jong-woo] We should
get some water, right?

837
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:02,825
[Dong-woo] Really? Okay.

838
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,119
[Jong-woo] Is there anyone
who wants to get water with us?

839
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,703
-[Seul-ki] Me.
-[Jong-woo] Shall we go?

840
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,705
[Seul-ki] I want to go.

841
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,707
[Jong-woo] Make us some good soup.

842
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,335
-[Jong-woo] Shall we go?
-[Seul-ki] Let's go.

843
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,214
[Seul-ki] What should I do to help?

844
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,466
-[Jong-woo] Um, cheer for us.
-[Dong-woo] Pour the water in.

845
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,592
[Seul-ki] I'll pour the water in.

846
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,052
[Dong-woo] Or we can do
rock, paper, scissors?

847
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,554
[all chuckling]

848
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,681
[Seul-ki] You must be starving.

849
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,516
-[Jong-woo] Oh, I'm starving.
-[Seul-ki] Right?

850
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,851
[Dong-woo] Did you have lunch?

851
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:31,770
-[Seul-ki] No, I didn't get to have lunch.
-[Dong-woo] Gosh.

852
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,106
-We have a chef, so…
-[all laughing]

853
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:35,983
-We should trust him.
-[Jong-woo] Let's leave it to him.

854
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,651
[Seul-ki] Did he really say
he's good at cooking?

855
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,278
[Dong-woo] Yes, it seems like
he's quite talented.

856
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,195
[Seul-ki] Mm.

857
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:44,533
[Dong-woo] I want to make Seul-ki
to carry this once it's filled with water.

858
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,868
[Seul-ki laughs]

859
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,453
[Dong-woo] Just for fun.
Just for a sec.

860
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,413
[Seul-ki] I'm strong. I can carry it.

861
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,998
[Dong-woo] You're strong, huh?

862
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,420
[Seo-eun] We'll try preparing these.

863
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,005
[Han-bin] Let's wash the ingredients
first.

864
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,047
[Seo-eun] All right.

865
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,633
-[Han-bin] Okay.
-[Seo-eun] So we each take a daikon…

866
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:08,515
[Yoong-jae] I heard you're
in charge of making something

867
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,643
-like daikon soup…
-Before you start, put on this apron.

868
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,021
-Because you're wearing white.
-Thank you.

869
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:15,814
[Seo-eun] Thank you.

870
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,941
[Seo-eun] Are there
any more aprons?

871
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,193
No, but you go ahead.

872
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,360
No, but you're wearing white.

873
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,321
-Oh, but you're washing the daikons.
-It's okay.

874
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,783
[women laughing]

875
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,577
-Do you want this one?
-No, you wear it

876
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,329
-since you're wearing white.
-It's okay. I'm fine.

877
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,955
-You're fine?
-Yes. Put it on.

878
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:32,956
-But I'd feel bad--
-Put it on.

879
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,459
[Seo-eun] Then I'll do
even more of the cooking.

880
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:37,920
Ah, yes.

881
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:38,837
Thank you.

882
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,091
-Thank you.
-The back…

883
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,092
Oh.

884
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,802
-Want me to do it for you?
-Yes.

885
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:52,559
-So until then, we're going to…
-Think about a different dish…

886
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,603
Or we also talked about doenjang-jjigae.

887
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,480
-I tied it in a bow.
-Thank you.

888
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,690
Put daikons in doenjang-jjigae.

889
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,740
While you do this,
I'll go get the fire started.

890
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:07,908
[Seo-eun] Okay. Sure.

891
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,702
-You have to use the water here, right?
-[So-e] Yes, kind of.

892
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,912
[Seo-eun] Right? Okay then…

893
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,705
-Scoot over a bit?
-Okay.

894
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,749
-Come here.
-[So-e] Thank you.

895
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,671
[Seo-eun] I don't think
I've ever seen this many daikons

896
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,673
unless it's kimchi-making season.

897
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,801
How's your cooking?

898
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,263
-I think I'm really a beginner.
-Oh, really?

899
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,765
So are you just able
to make stuff like instant noodles?

900
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:33,892
I can cook things following a recipe.

901
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,060
Yeah, I get it.

902
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,312
Yes, but I can't make anything on my own.

903
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,855
Oh.

904
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,108
-[Yoong-jae] I think I'm at that level.
-[Seo-eun] Got it.

905
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,988
[Seo-eun] Am I the only one
having trouble?

906
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,282
-No, I am too.
-It's like… [laughs]

907
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,325
Why are there so many holes?

908
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,160
[Yoong-jae] Right?
Be careful with your hands.

909
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,204
[Seo-eun] Yes.
Be careful with your hands.

910
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,082
Ah, it always ends up looking like
So-e's just listening in.

911
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,834
The way they're placed is not good.

912
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,002
[Kyuhyun] Yes, it's not good.

913
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,880
Is this right?

914
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,966
[laughs] Is this right?

915
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,510
Should I peel the skin off the daikons?

916
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,221
-Vegetables…
-Do you handle vegetables well?

917
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,682
-Yes, I handle vegetables well.
-Is that so?

918
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,602
Then shall I handle the rice?

919
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,687
Can we switch places?

920
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,607
-Okay.
-But what if I'm not good at it?

921
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,067
Then I'll finish this one first.

922
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,152
[So-e] Okay.

923
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,530
I should be responsible
and finish what I started.

924
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,741
-[So-e laughs]
-You're good at this.

925
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,451
I'm okay at peeling fruit, too.

926
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,077
[So-e] Right, you're good at this.

927
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,500
-[Dong-woo] Okay, so…
-[Jong-woo] Shall we put these on?

928
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,337
Seul-ki, would you like to feel
how heavy this is?

929
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,630
-Me?
-[Dong-woo] Yes.

930
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,674
[Seul-ki] It'll be your fault
if I get a stiff neck tomorrow.

931
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,052
-[Dong-woo] Of course.
-[Jong-woo] Like it's a backpack.

932
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,429
-[Seul-ki] Oh, like going to school?
-[Jong-woo] Like going to school.

933
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,681
-[Dong-woo] I'll put them on one by one.
-[Seul-ki] Got it.

934
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,849
[Dong-woo] Here, turn around?

935
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,769
-I don't think I'll be able to stand up.
-[Jong-woo] Wait.

936
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,272
-Oh, my God.
-[Jong-woo] Okay.

937
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,774
-Should I get up?

-Did you let go?

945
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,996
-[Dong-woo] Yes, we let go.
-[Jong-woo] Try taking a few steps.

946
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,414
This isn't that heavy.

947
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,167
-Wow. Then we'll head back like this.
-Just like this.

[Seul-ki] Ah, no, no.

-[Jong-woo] Take off the backpack.
-[Dong-woo]Take off the backpack.

[Jong-woo] We'll do rock, paper, scissors.

952

You're really good at this.

955
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:41,895
It's because I live alone.

-But here's it's very useful.
-I know, right?

969
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,219
What should we do?
Should we try this again?

[Se-jeong] Two women starting a fire…

[Nadine] It must be so heavy.

989
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:43,183
[Jong-woo] It's not really heavy.
Balancing it is the hard part.

just fills up here.

-Ah!
-Oh, no. We shouldn't use too much water.

1004

That's why the water isn't draining.

1005

-We'll have to throw this out.
-How should we do that?

1006
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,094
I'll go throw it out.

1007
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,429
Really? It'll be too heavy.

00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,998
-Is it delicious?
-Yes, of course.

1091
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,000
-This is so good.
-Yes.

1092
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,837
-You might get an upset stomach tomorrow.
-Really?

1093
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,049
Do you like the food?

1094
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,136
[Nadine] It's good.

1095
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,931
[Nadine] The rice is really good, too.

1096
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,974
[Se-jeong] Right.
The rice turned out well.

1097
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,607
I've been wanting to say this,

1098
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,859
but what you're wearing
goes really well with pajeon.

1099
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:45,902
This sweater?

1100
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,905
I wanted a nokdujeon look.

1101
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,573
It's so…

1102
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:53,326
[Dong-woo] Maybe you worked so hard
that the color got on your sweater.

1103
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,369
Maybe?

1104
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,497
I do remember this being a shade lighter.

1105
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,540
[laughing]

1106
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,043
[Dong-woo] You react to jokes well.

1107
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,837
[Seo-eun] You're right.

1108
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,840
I didn't think that was really funny.

1109
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:07,882
[crew laughing]

1110
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,134
They're easily amused.

1111
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,553
Don't be jealous, Hanhae.

1112
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:14,514
[sighs] This is it. It's begun.

1113
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,392
-You can feel the romance, right?
-[Da-hee] Yeah.

1114
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:21,729
I think So-e is showing
a bit of interest in Yoong-jae.

1115
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:22,981
More like a lot.

1116
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,065
-[Jin-kyung] Right?
-Yes.

1117
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,819
-She was watching him from afar like this.
-That's when I knew for sure.

1118
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,404
You don't do that
if you're not interested.

1119
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:32,031
Se-jeong seems
interested in Yoong-jae too.

1120
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,868
-She kept telling him to try the daikon.
-[Jin-kyung] Yes.

1121
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,328
Dong-woo seems
like he's interested in Nadine.

1122
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:40,540
I agree. Seeing the way
he kept asking Nadine questions,

1123
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,459
I think he's interested.

1124
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,961
Wow, soon it'll be time
for the postcards.

1125
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,629
They have to write the postcards.

1126
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,631
-About first impressions?
-Yes.

1127
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:52,886
For now, I think Yoong-jae will receive
the most votes, I mean, postcards.

1128
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,597
The way Yoong-jae talks seems…

1129
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,682
How should I put this? It's strangely…

1130
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,518
-It's charming even to a guy, isn't it?
-It really is.

1131
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,228
It's like he's subtlety kind.

1132
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,522
-And he uses his words really well.
-Exactly.

1133
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,150
I think he's a no-nonsense type of person.

1134
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,444
-Right.
-He's not a show-off.

1135
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:11,362
That's what I was going to say.

1136
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,741
So like, if a show-off
succeeded in starting a fire,.

1137
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:18,786
-he'd be like, "I did it!"
-[Da-hee] Yoong-jae is not like that.

1138
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,706
Like how he just throws out the water
without a fuss.

1139
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:24,792
So, I think Yoong-jae will receive
at least two votes.

1140
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,754
But who do you think
Yoong-jae will vote for?

1141
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,507
I first thought
he was interested in Se-jeong,

1142
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,884
but then after seeing how So-e reacted,

1143
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:36,429
I now think he could choose So-e.

1144
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,847
That's what I thought.

1145
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,099
-So-e is the type…
-I'm rooting for them.

1146
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,936
-…who all of a sudden catches your eye.
-[Da-hee] Yes.

1147
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,980
-"Wait? Why do I keep thinking of her?"
-Right.

1148
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,607
-She will only have eyes for you.
-Yes.

1149
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,609
-Let's keep watching.
-Yes, I'm curious.

1150
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,903
-Right. I'm so curious.
-I'm so impatient right now.

1151
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,952
How was it? After eating together
and talking like this…

1152
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,372
Some people seem different
once you talk to them.

1153
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,998
Right.

1154
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:07,252
They all seem a bit different
from how I first perceived them.

1155
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,586
Just a little.

1156
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:09,712
Kim Han-bin.

1157
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,005
Kim Han-bin?

1158
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,799
Great job today.

1159
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,592
-Thanks for everything.
-[Dong-woo] You saved us.

1160
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,428
If it weren't for you, things
could've went downhill.

1161
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,348
-[Yoong-jae] Yes, really.
-[Dong-woo] Could have been a disaster.

1162
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,058
He's so good at cooking.

1163
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,561
-He's serious when he cooks.
-[So-e] Didn't think he could be serious.

1164
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,605
Everything really worked out
under his leadership.

1165
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,858
What did you talk about
when you went to get water?

1166
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,860
Ah, we talked about MBTI,

1167
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:36,322
and then they told me
to carry the water all of a sudden.

-And then…
-[intercom chiming]

1171
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,707
[Master] Now, we will begin
the likeability selections

1172
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,127
where you can express your feelings
to the person you like.

1173
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:52,088
Oh, what do I do?

1174
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,427
I can hear my heart beating right here.

1175
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,056
[Master] On the postcards that have
been placed in your quarter,

1176
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:05,935
write down how you feel
about the person you decided you like.

1177
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,061
Wow.

1178
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,815
Why am I so nervous?

1179
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,901
I barely talked to the guys.

1180
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:18,948
Then put the card in the mailbox
of the person you've chosen to write to.

Please start making your choice now.

Oh, my gosh.

1184

This is hard.

You're all thinking hard about this.

1188
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:47,143
But we can change our choice
later on, right? After this is sent.

1189
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:50,104
-[Seo-eun] This is just first impressions.
-First impression.

1190
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,397
It's really nothing…

1191
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,107
So what's important
isn't the first impression

1192
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:55,568
from the very beginning
but how I feel now, right?"

1193
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:57,487

Why is this so nerve-wracking?
Why am I so nervous?

1197
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:17,715
One of us won't be
getting anything at all.

1198
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,550
You're right.

1199

But if the four of them
choose the same person…
