1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm not afraid...

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
of you.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Li Wei.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Goodbye.

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,460
Me?

23
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,440
You...

24
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,880
Master Li,

25
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,140
we've known that you would leave us for no reason.

26
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,000
Are you worried that my grandmother might kill me?

27
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,360
What?

28
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,320
You are unable to bear to let go of me?

29
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,100
Why do you want me to travel the land?

30
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,980
My wife...

31
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,280
I have've been here already for a certain period of time.

32
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,280
I should have come back to Chang'an to report my investigation to His Majesty.

33
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
What about you?

34
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,280
I want to go back to Suzhou to see my old aunt.

35
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Okay, I'm fine. I'll take you back.

36
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,280
Really?

37
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,280
But I won't go into your house. I'm lazy to see that...

38
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Whatever.

39
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,280
The world is full of lies.

40
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Can you stop asking? You're making me angry.

41
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Cousin, Master Li has resigned.

42
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Goodbye, A-qi.

43
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Cousin, goodbye!

44
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,280
Let's go.

45
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,280
What do you plan to do after I return to Suzhou?

46
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,280
I'll go back to Yuhang Town to fight against the enemy.

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,280
I'll go to Langji Tianya if I'm in a good mood.

48
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,280
I want to go too.

49
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,280
You don't want to?

50
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Do you know how to be funny?

51
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
Actually...

52
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,280
I really don't know you.

53
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,280
What?

54
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,280
I think it's not a little.

55
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,280
It's a lot.

56
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Don't push me.

57
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,280
I'm serious.

58
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,280
I've been thinking about you for a long time.

59
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,280
And I know that you've been with me.

60
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,280
Don't you feel sorry for me?

61
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
You're here again.

62
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,280
I hate men like you.

63
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,280
We've been together for a long time.

64
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,280
You shouldn't be so reckless.

65
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,280
What do you mean?

66
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,280
I'm a normal man.

67
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,280
You know what kind of person you like.

68
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,280
I know.

69
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
That's good.

70
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Li Xiaoyao, I like you.

71
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
No.

72
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,280
I love you.

73
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,280
I'm not a chicken.

74
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,280
Do you think I can make you cry?

75
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
You taught me clearly.

76
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
I've seen it clearly.

77
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,280
Don't throw away those bad memories with me.

78
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,280
I know you're always so kind.

79
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,280
But I can let you have his existence.

80
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
Thank you.

81
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
Am I generous?

82
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,280
You're not like me.

83
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,280
You're kind.

84
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,280
Yes.

85
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Situ Dan, do you think our new world is going smoothly?

86
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Yes.

87
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
We need your help.

88
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,280
We've found the right place to deal with the demons.

89
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
We've saved a lot of time.

90
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,280
We've got many treasures and pearls.

91
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,280
Do you think it's a coincidence?

92
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,280
I think we've made a good arrangement.

93
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
Who's so brilliant?

94
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
I don't know.

95
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,280
Young people, help me.

96
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
I'll go.

97
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Thank you.

98
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Do you have a friend who looks like a student?

99
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
He's almost as tall as you.

100
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
How do you know?

101
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
Go save him.

102
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
There were some men following him.

103
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
What?

104
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,280
They're old and don't know martial arts.

105
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Where did they go?

106
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
Over there.

107
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,280
Cousin.

108
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Cousin.

109
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Cousin.

110
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,280
Cousin.

111
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Cousin.

112
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
Which direction is back to Chang'an?

113
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Over there.

114
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Cousin, back to Chang'an.

115
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,280
But the boss told us that way.

116
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
That's the direction of the inn.

117
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
How can it be like this?

118
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
What's wrong?

119
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,280
I feel a little bored, so I'll feel as I was.

120
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
How is it so happy?

121
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Is it a題?

122
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
It's also sounds like песile.

123
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,280
But when I suddenly heard the music,

124
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,280
I remember I acted in different ways

125
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
and got tired of me.

126
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Since then,

127
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
how do you know that?

128
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
Like an kolk,

129
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,580
an old

130
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
romance.

131
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,520
There are many strange things on this road.

132
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,000
Maybe we have become the pawns of others.

133
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,720
No way.

134
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,240
Why did they do this?

135
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,920
For Ling'er.

136
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,120
What did you say?

137
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,960
They may be the people of the Banyu Sect.

138
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,360
They want Ling'er.

139
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,440
The Banyu Sect is the national religion of the South Zhao State.

140
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,280
Ling'er is the princess of the South Zhao State.

141
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,800
They don't treat Ling'er well.

142
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,920
No matter what,

143
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,360
let's go to see Ling'er first.

144
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:55,960
Hurry up.

145
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,440
Go.

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,360
Go.

147
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,960
Hurry up.

148
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,360
Go.

149
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,640
Go.

150
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,200
Master. Master.

151
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,360
Princess, here.

152
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,360
Come on. Hurry up.

153
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,480
Hurry up.

154
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,040
Who are you?

155
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,520
I'm here to take her away.

156
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,560
No way.

157
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,600
Princess.

158
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,280
Master.

159
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,000
Master.

160
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,400
Princess.

161
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,160
Princess.

162
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,400
Ling'er is here.

163
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,480
It's safe for her.

164
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,840
Princess.

165
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,120
Wei.

166
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,680
Zhen.

167
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,000
Bing.

168
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,680
Bing.

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,840
They are all dead.

170
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,560
Where is Ling'er?

171
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,080
Where is Ling'er?

172
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,800
Go find them.

173
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Are you really grateful or being ridiculous?

174
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,520
No.

175
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,080
Is He being哭?

176
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,400
Is He rebelling?

177
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,360
Is he doing anything wrong or doing this dirty one?

178
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,200
Because his attack

179
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,200
No. I've never done this before.

180
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
How dare you say you didn't do it?

181
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,200
How can you explain everything you did in the camp that day?

182
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Stop, sir!

183
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Stop.

184
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Father, what you did was a good thing.

185
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
You killed someone.

186
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,200
This is the father and mother of the two kings.

187
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
They don't care about the others.

188
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Every time they go to war, they always have a good reputation.

189
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
This is the famous and famous high-ranking in the capital.

190
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
These people always escape to the battlefield.

191
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
They don't care about the others.

192
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
They deserve to die.

193
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,200
I've never done anything wrong like the answer I gave you.

194
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
You killed someone at the age of 15.

195
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,200
You didn't regret it.

196
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,200
You are not a person like that.

197
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,200
You killed ten people at a young age.

198
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,200
I'll let you pay for their lives.

199
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
These people are so cunning.

200
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
They are weak and they don't know how to attack.

201
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,200
This is not the reason why you killed them.

202
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
I didn't kill them.

203
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
The real people are not easy to deal with.

204
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
They don't know how to play the game.

205
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
I'm just a person who can do anything.

206
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
You are still so clever.

207
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
I didn't do anything wrong.

208
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
These people deserve to die.

209
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I'll do it.

210
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
I killed you.

211
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Father, you won't kill me.

212
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
I killed you.

213
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Father, you really kill me.

214
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Is the world a human being?

215
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
The world is a human being.

216
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,200
You really don't love me?

217
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
You should protect your child

218
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,200
as your father.

219
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm so ashamed of you.

220
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
I have nothing to say.

221
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Father, are you really not sad?

222
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,200
You killed my son.

223
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,200
I can't forget the pain

224
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,200
in my heart.

225
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Until now, you still want to kill my son.

226
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Are you not sad?

227
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Father.

228
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,200
You still feel that you didn't do anything wrong?

229
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
It's true.

230
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,200
You can't keep it.

231
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
You want to kill me?

232
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Come on.

233
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Be cruel this time.

234
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Don't be like the last time.

235
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,200
You hurt me.

236
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
I also hurt you.

237
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I can't face

238
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,200
a person who is pure and loving.

239
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,200
I'm a devil.

240
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
What can I do?

241
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,200
What can I do?

242
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,200
I'll kill you.

243
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,200
You have made me a devil.

244
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,200
You can only enter the world

245
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,200
as a evil thing.

246
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,200
What's the point?

247
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
It's not the point.

248
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,200
I'm to take revenge on you.

249
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
This is just the grudge between you and me.

250
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Don't be restrained.

251
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,200
I am willing to bear the responsibility of not taking responsibility

252
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Are you willing to bear the responsibility?

253
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Come on

254
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
This matter should have been solved long ago

255
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Ok

256
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,200
I am willing to bear the responsibility of not taking responsibility

257
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Are you willing to bear the responsibility?

258
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Come on

259
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
This matter should have been solved long ago

260
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Ok

261
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
I am willing to bear the responsibility of not taking responsibility

262
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Are you willing to bear the responsibility of not taking responsibility?

263
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Come on

264
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
This matter should have been solved long ago

265
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Ok

266
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
I am willing to bear the responsibility of not taking responsibility

267
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Are you willing to bear the responsibility of not taking responsibility?

268
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Come on

269
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
This matter should have been solved long ago

270
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Ok

271
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
I am willing to bear the responsibility of not taking responsibility

272
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Come on

273
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Father

274
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Don't move

275
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Or you will be broken into pieces

276
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Father

277
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
I just want to see

278
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
whether someone like you

279
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
will cherish you

280
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
If you do

281
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
then in this world

282
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,200
there might really be a love

283
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Do you know

284
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
If I am loved

285
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
I will learn to love others

286
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Yes

287
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Just like I am loved by others

288
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Father

289
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
I hope someone loves me

290
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Take care

291
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Father

292
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Master

293
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Master

294
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Master

295
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Let's go

296
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Master

297
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Don't come over here

298
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Don't hurry up, Master Zhang

299
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
He is injured

300
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
He can't move

301
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Otherwise...

302
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
What? I will break into pieces

303
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Master Zhang, don't move

304
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
I am not hurt

305
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
I am just a woman

306
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
I am just a woman

307
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
I am just a woman

308
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
If I do this

309
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
I will be killed

310
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Even if I die

311
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
I will not be punished

312
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Where are you?

313
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
You are always a good person

314
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
No

315
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,200
I personally raised a demon

316
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
but I didn't want to

317
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I let him do harm to the people

318
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
You?

319
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Master Bai Yue

320
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
is called Shi Jie Ren

321
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
He is your son

322
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Everything is because of me

323
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Master Zhang

324
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
You have to stop

325
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
I will find a way to save you

326
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
No need

327
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Listen to me

328
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Master Zhang

329
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
You can do whatever you want

330
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
We will do our best to help you

331
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,200
You can't let the princess go back to Nanzhao

332
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
It's all my fault

333
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
No, it's all my fault

334
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
You can't let the princess go back

335
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
I know

336
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Please apologize to the princess

337
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I can't protect her anymore

338
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
She will understand

339
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Master Zhang

340
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Do you have any orders?

341
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
I...

342
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Do you want to see Tang Yu?

343
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
Uncle

344
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Master

345
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Uncle

346
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Uncle

347
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,200
My son

348
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
The biggest regret in my life

349
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
is that I never have any regrets

350
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
What's wrong with you?

351
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Don't touch me

352
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
You are so selfish

353
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,200
You will be a great man in the future

354
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Uncle

355
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Remember

356
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,200
You should protect my son

357
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Uncle

358
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Master

359
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Don't cry

360
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Don't cry

361
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
My son

362
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
I am sorry to the country

363
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
I am punished

364
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Master

365
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Master

366
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Shizhang

367
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Master

368
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Uncle

369
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
Don't worry

370
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Do your best

371
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,400
In the universes, clap your hands

372
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,600
Ai Lian is from Anjia's family.

373
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,520
What a nail-shady she is!

374
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,960
She must be wearing a Husband's robe

375
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,480
where I haven't had any trouble with.

376
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,440
But our friends are from me.

377
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,760
From now on,

378
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,240
we'll end up seperately.

379
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,240
I will never forget the kindness that Father gave me.

380
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
We will never let him down.

381
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
The world is in heaven.

382
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
He will protect us.

383
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
We are in a different world.

384
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
I just went to Mount Shu.

385
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,240
I asked for the poison to cure the wound and let the princess out.

386
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
I will go with my daughter to save Qi and take her to Ping An.

387
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,240
We will meet at the mountain in the end.

388
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,240
Okay.

389
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Okay. We will continue to succeed and not fail.

390
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Mother, is there anything wrong?

391
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Hello.

392
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
Uncle Baiyue.

393
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Demon head, I want you to die in blood debt.

394
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,240
Uncle Baiyue, are you the big bad guy who killed the master?

395
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,240
I came here just to play a game with you.

396
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Now is the second meeting.

397
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,240
It shows whether there is anything in the world.

398
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Let us out.

399
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,240
Let us out or I will kill you.

400
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
Uncle Baiyue, why do you do this?

401
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
Uncle Baiyue.

402
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Uncle Baiyue, why don't you answer my question?

403
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,240
Goodbye.

404
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
Uncle Baiyue. Uncle Baiyue.

405
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
Let us out.

406
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
Master, will they continue like this?

407
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,240
Love is good for the old.

408
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,240
As long as they love each other,

409
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,240
they will be safe and sound.

410
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Just like they are in the bottomless cave.

411
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,240
Uncle Baiyue.

412
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Master, I am not a demon.

413
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
I am a queen.

414
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,240
I am the daughter of the manzhao kingdom.

415
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
The manzhao kingdom is now in hot water and hot water.

416
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,240
As a queen, I have the right to take my responsibility.

417
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,240
I will use the power given to me by god to save my people.

418
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
I will do as they say.

419
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,240
Are you done?

420
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
Master.

421
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,240
Master.

422
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
Master.

423
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
Master.

424
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,240
Master.

425
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
Master.

426
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,240
I am not a demon.

427
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
I am a queen.

428
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
You don't have to say.

429
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,240
Show your true identity.

430
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
Immortal Tao Lao Lao.

431
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Immortal Tao Wang Wang.

432
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,240
Immortal Tao Ne Xi.

433
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Immortal Tao Gui Sheng.

434
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
Immortal Tao Gui Zhou.

435
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
Immortal Tao Chang Si Qi.

436
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,660
Chief Brother!

437
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,300
First of all, the Nan bateries mobilize directly

438
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:38,160
Now the second average morality

439
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,860
Up to ten millions to 더 than sixty million

440
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,480
allocates to Donder incinerator

441
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,140
Did Mrs. Song will there be an emergency?

442
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,240
The Demon King is coming!

443
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
The Demon King is coming!

444
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
The lock-and-lock tower is closed.

445
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,240
We can't go back to the mortal world.

446
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
We're selling vegetables!

447
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Wait for me!

448
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,240
Wait for me!

449
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Look at the new vegetables!

450
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Look at the vegetables!

451
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,240
Look at the vegetables!

452
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Look at the flowers!

453
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Look at the flowers!

454
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
Look at the flowers!

455
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
Wait for me!

456
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,240
It turns out that this is how the world works.

457
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
It's so good!

458
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
It seems that I was so childish before.

459
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
Because I can use this sword to train.

460
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,240
I can cut off the demon and remove the demon.

461
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,240
I can go to the deep of the justice.

462
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,240
I can go to the unknown to kill.

463
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,240
I can become the great hero who is respected by the people.

464
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
I can become the great hero who is respected by the people.

465
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,240
I can become the great hero who is respected by the people.

466
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,240
But this world...

467
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,240
It's not like this at all.

468
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,240
Even if you're so good at martial arts,

469
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
you can't do anything in the future.

470
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
I know.

471
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,240
Don't think about it.

472
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,240
There are some things that can't be solved.

473
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
But there is one thing.

474
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
I know that he is right.

475
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
And I must do it.

476
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,240
We'll go to Mount Shu to save Ling'er.

477
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,240
Girl.

478
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,240
Don't say anything gross.

479
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,240
I must say it.

480
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,240
I'm with you.

481
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,240
So you said it.

482
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Is it a word of a gentleman?

483
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
It's hard to catch up.

484
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
I heard that the eye-catching man is ill.

485
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
He seems to be recuperating.

486
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,240
But...

487
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,240
Are you serious?

488
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Even the emperor's will is correct.

489
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,240
But it's not that big.

490
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
I'm not.

491
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,240
Did the man just tell you that it's true?

492
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
No way.

493
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,240
He is with Aqi and is not drunk.

494
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,240
He is still fine.

495
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,240
So, Cousin is near here.

496
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
Let's go see him.

497
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,240
OK.

498
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
Yunyi.

499
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
Yue Ru.

500
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
Is it really you?

501
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,240
This is cousin's mother, my aunt.

502
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,240
This is Li Xiaoyang.

503
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,240
And this is cousin's good friend.

504
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,240
Hello.

505
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
Hello.

506
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,240
Yue Ru.

507
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,240
You came to Chang'an.

508
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,240
You didn't come to the mansion to see.

509
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,240
We actually passed by here.

510
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,240
But we heard cousin's illness.

511
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
Is it true?

512
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
Yes.

513
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,240
Since the nth family came back from Jinyuan,

514
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,240
I've been getting strange disease.

515
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
I've been treating the doctor.

516
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,240
Even the imperial doctor came.

517
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
It's not possible.

518
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,240
Now his illness is getting worse.

519
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
I can't help it.

520
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,240
I'll go to the medicine temple to pray for him.

521
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,240
Yunyi, don't worry.

522
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
I have the Purple Gold Fox.

523
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
I can send the message to Yongcheng.

524
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
Really?

525
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
Since we found the doctor, it's useless.

526
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
We can't do anything.

527
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
That's great.

528
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,240
Yue Ru, we'll go back now.

529
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,240
Let's go.

530
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,240
Follow me.

531
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,240
Cousin.

532
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Cousin.

533
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
Sit down.

534
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
Qing.

535
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
Why are you like this?

536
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,240
I'm fine.

537
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,240
I'm fine.

538
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
You said you're fine.

539
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,240
You don't know how worried Yunyi is.

540
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,240
We heard a lot of people saying...

541
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
I just changed my mind.

542
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,240
I'm afraid that people will be mad at me.

543
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,240
Look.

544
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
I'm so confused.

545
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,240
I invited everyone here.

546
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,240
I'm a happy person.

547
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,240
You're kidding me.

548
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,240
I'd rather not come here.

549
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,240
But I want to know that Cousin is safe and sound.

550
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,240
Cousin, why are you getting more and more worried?

551
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
I'm really fine.

552
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,240
Husband.

553
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,240
The medicine is ready.

554
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,240
Hurry up.

555
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
You're married?

556
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
He's my wife.

557
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,240
Cai Yi.

558
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,240
Cousin, when did you get married?

559
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,240
I didn't mention it to you last time.

560
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,240
That's right.

561
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,240
I didn't even tell my master that I got married.

562
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
It's a big deal.

563
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
Please excuse me.

564
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,240
I got married a few days ago.

565
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
I didn't tell you.

566
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,240
Don't be so sad.

567
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
How did you know my cousin?

568
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
I should tell you.

569
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
You should ask the servants to make some good dishes.

570
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,240
I'll make a toast to my best friends.

571
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,240
Husband.

572
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
You should drink this medicine first.

573
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
By the way, where's Miss Ling'er?

574
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,240
Why didn't she come with you?

575
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,240
Chang'an has a lot of fun places.

576
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,240
I'll take you to have fun.

577
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,240
How are you?

578
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,240
After you left,

579
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,240
the people from Moon Sect came.

580
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
Master Shi.

581
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,240
He sacrificed himself to save us.

582
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,240
Such a good man.

583
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,240
Where's Miss Ling'er?

584
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
She was taken away by the chief of Mount Zu.

585
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Why?

586
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,240
We don't know where Xiaoyao and I are going.

587
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
Don't worry.

588
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,240
Mount Zu is a famous place.

589
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,240
The chief is very famous.

590
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,240
I believe Miss Ling'er is safe.

591
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
I'm relieved.

592
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240
Qi.

593
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,240
You're the one who's worried about Master.

594
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
It's great that you can stay here.

595
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,240
You're here and I'm coming.

596
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,240
Why are you still standing here?

597
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,240
Go cook.

598
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
Husband, it's almost cold.

599
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,240
Drink it first.

600
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,240
Get out.

601
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,240
What's wrong?

602
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
I'm worried about you.

603
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
I'm fine.

604
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,240
I'm fine.

605
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,240
Did you hear that?

606
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,240
I'm fine.

607
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
I know.

608
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,240
You're doing well.

609
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,240
Miss Tu Di.

610
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,240
I'm hungry.

611
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,240
Go cook.

612
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
I'll be back.

613
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,240
The doctor gets up early every morning.

614
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,240
I make medicine for Jingyuan.

615
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,240
She's the most likely to sleep at night.

616
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,240
Qi.

617
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240
Jingyuan is so lucky.

618
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,240
She's called Saivong.

619
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,240
She's a good cook.

620
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
Who's Ma?

621
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
You.

622
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
That's right.

623
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,240
I'm much better than you.

624
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,240
Aunt Yun, how did you know him?

625
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,240
I didn't know.

626
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,240
I was lucky to go to the toilet.

627
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,240
Cai Yi is a poor child.

628
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,240
About a month ago,

629
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,240
his parents and he went to Chang'an.

630
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
But one day,

631
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,240
his parents suddenly got sick and died.

632
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,240
He was unwell.

633
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,240
He was buried on the street.

634
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
His parents died.

635
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,240
I was passing by.

636
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,240
I saw him poor.

637
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,240
So I took him back to the mansion.

638
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,240
I didn't expect this child to be so smart.

639
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,240
After he got married,

640
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,240
he made a few shots of the family's ancestral medicine for Jingyuan.

641
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,240
I didn't expect Jingyuan to eat it.

642
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,240
But he's so healthy.

643
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,240
I saw Cai Yi

644
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,240
sincere to Jingyuan.

645
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,240
He took her back to our family.

646
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,240
Even if he's happy for Jingyuan,

647
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,240
he's not like me.

648
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,240
I'm sorry.

649
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
I'm sorry.

650
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,240
I'm sorry.

651
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,240
I'm sorry.

652
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
But Jingyuan is not like you.

653
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,240
She's been making trouble for this.

654
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
She's like this.

655
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
She's always been a good help.

656
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
She's always been a good help.

657
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,240
It's all my fault.

658
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,240
She's always angry.

659
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,240
During this time,

660
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
her illness

661
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
is not good.

662
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,240
Aunt Yun, don't do this.

663
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,240
Aunt Yun, don't do this.

664
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,240
Don't do this.

665
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,240
After so many years,

666
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,240
all the grudges and sorrows are false.

667
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,240
People's health is the most important thing.

668
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,240
I only hope

669
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,240
Jingyuan can be safe

670
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,240
and live a happy life.

671
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,240
Don't worry.

672
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,240
Since he's good to others,

673
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,240
he'll be good to others.

674
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,240
You said

675
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,240
Cai Yi came to our family.

676
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,240
Could it be

677
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,240
Jingyuan's kindness?

678
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,240
I'm sure it's Aunt Yun.

679
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,240
With her,

680
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,240
we can't use the golden gulud.

681
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,240
What? You want to leave?

682
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,240
We have to hurry.

683
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,240
Yue Ru,

684
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,240
I'm the only one

685
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,240
who can talk to you.

686
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,240
During this time,

687
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,240
you've been out there.

688
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,240
You've been suffering a lot.

689
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
Stay here for a few days.

690
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,240
Aunt Yun will cook you something delicious.

691
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,240
Okay.

692
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,240
But we still have to hurry.

693
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,240
Our family has raised more than ten horses.

694
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,240
You can rest here.

695
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,240
When you're well-groomed,

696
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,240
you can ride the horse.

697
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,240
I'll take care of it.

698
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,240
Then it's a deal.

699
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,240
But...

700
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,240
Can't you always

701
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,240
be my sacrifice?

702
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,240
I'll do it too.

703
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,240
And

704
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
Jingyuan is my good disciple.

705
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,240
He's my good friend.

706
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,240
Good.

707
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,240
Yue Ru,

708
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,240
you can sleep with me tonight.

709
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,240
We can talk.

710
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,240
Help.

711
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,240
Help.

712
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
Help.

713
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,240
Help.

714
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,240
Tang Yu Xiaobao, are you okay?

715
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,240
I'm fine.

716
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,240
Look.

717
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,240
The moonlight is so beautiful.

718
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,240
You're in a good mood.

719
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,240
You're making me mad.

720
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,240
Let's be quiet

721
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,240
so we can think of a way.

722
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,240
I...

723
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,240
I'm only thinking of one thing.

724
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,240
Forget it.

725
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,240
I'm not talking.

726
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,240
What's wrong?

727
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,240
Save your mouth for a while.

728
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,240
I'm thirsty.

729
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,240
I think you should cry.

730
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,240
Is it okay?

731
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,240
You can just

732
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,240
leave your eyes and mouth.

733
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,240
Then you can be free.

734
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,240
You want me to cry?

735
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,240
It's even harder

736
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,240
to leave here.

737
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,240
I'll tell you a story.

738
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,240
You might be crying.

739
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,240
No need, Tang Yu Xiaobao.

740
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
From the beginning...

741
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,240
Tang Yu Xiaobao.

742
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,240
From the beginning,

743
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,240
three people went on the road together.

744
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,240
They were going to a far, far away place.

745
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,240
They divided everything

746
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,240
into three small and medium-sized packages.

747
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,240
When the first person passed by,

748
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,240
he chose the biggest and heaviest package.

749
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,240
The other two people were smiling.

750
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,240
Silly.

751
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,240
Silly.

752
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,240
But when I saw you on the road,

753
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,240
I was so tired.

754
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,240
Okay, stop talking about it, Tang Yu Xiaobao.

755
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,240
But it's weird.

756
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,240
The package of that silly man

757
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,240
was getting lighter and lighter.

758
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,240
And the package of the other two people

759
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,240
was getting heavier and heavier.

760
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,240
Do you know why?

761
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,240
Because

762
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,240
the package of the two people

763
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,240
were getting heavier and heavier.

764
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,240
And that silly man

765
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,240
must have been your good friend.

766
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,240
He was packing the things

767
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,240
and the food.

768
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,240
The more he ate, the lighter he was.

769
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,240
The less he was packing,

770
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,240
the more he was carrying the food.

771
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,240
The more he was carrying,

772
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,240
the less he was carrying.

773
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,240
The more he was carrying the food,

774
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,240
the less he was carrying the food.

775
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,240
The more he was carrying the food,

776
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,240
the less he was carrying the food.

777
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,240
How is it?

778
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,240
It's funny.

779
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,240
It's not.

780
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,240
It's okay. I'll talk about it again.

781
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,240
Chongqing.

782
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,240
Tang Yu Xiaobao.

783
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
I know you miss your master very much now.

784
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,240
Don't say you anymore.

785
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,240
Even I...

786
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,240
I really miss her.

787
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,240
I haven't known my tears for a long time.

788
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,240
My tears...

789
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,240
are very bitter.

790
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
Very bitter.

791
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,240
I'm so sorry.

792
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,240
Look, there's water.

00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,540

00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:47,140

I finally understand.

825
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,240
I should let go.

826
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,240
