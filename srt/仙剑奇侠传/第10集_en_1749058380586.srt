1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Are you crazy?

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You've got all the money.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What are you going to eat?

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I like it.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Do you have anything to do with it?

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
How much money do you have?

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Just these.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Where do I sleep at night?

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't you want me to sleep on the street?

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You can sleep anywhere.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What about you?

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't care.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Think of something.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I won't sleep on the street.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Then you go to die.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You...

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Man-to-man-to.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Man-to-man-to.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hey!

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What are you buying these for?

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Are you eating?

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Are you eating for people?

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's right.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Miss Lin, how can you eat the vegetables?

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm telling you.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't eat anything except the noodles.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You're welcome.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, my God.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's been three days.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Where did the cousin go looking for the noodles?

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
He wants to kill me.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, my God.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This should be delicious.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's sweet and soft.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Man-to-man-to.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I love you.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I won't eat anything without the noodles.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I knew it.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You've said it twice.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Man-to-man-to.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I love you.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hey, eat it.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't do so many things.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I won't die.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hey, am I seducing you?

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Or you can't stand it?

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I won't eat anything like this.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Of course.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Miss Lin, you're so funny.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
How can you eat something without even a pig?

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So precious.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You can't even eat a pig like this.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You're so rich.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hey, don't be so serious.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't make me suffer when I'm hungry.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So precious.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll sleep with a nap.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I won't eat anything.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I won't sleep.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes, I won't sleep.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't do that.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Piggy.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm so hungry.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm so hungry.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm so hungry.

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm so hungry.

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm so hungry.

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Drink some water after eating the steamed buns.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Then you'll be full.

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Is it good?

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Is it sweet?

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Is it good?

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let me tell you.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't say that you won't eat this or that.

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't say that you're just a piece of cake.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't say that you're not a person.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Do you hear me?

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm telling you.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Not everyone in the world is like you.

97
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You're a man of your word.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And many people are hungry.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Remember.

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You must respect every grain of food.

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Eat it.

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Master, Yue Ruo is here.

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I've invited Master Su Zhu's ramen.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Brother, stop.

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm telling you.

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This is for stomach.

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Not for tongue.

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This ramen is really good.

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Master, sit down.

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Cousin.

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Brother, you've worked hard.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm very satisfied.

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you need my help?

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No need.

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Do you have chili?

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Master, I'm so tired.

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Can you come back to wash for me?

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What do you think?

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Xiaomi, let me help you.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay.

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Thank you for your kindness.

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I can wash it myself.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Thank you.

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll do it myself.

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'll do it myself.

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll do it myself.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll do it myself.

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll do it myself.

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You finally get to wash.

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I've said it before.

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I can understand what you mean.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You should tell me.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Are you ready for tomorrow?

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yes.

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I've washed my clothes.

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll take care of you.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Who told you to take care of me?

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I've prepared everything.

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll see if you can wash your belly.

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll do my best to wait for your news.

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll always be there for you.

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Xiaomi, don't go to the South.

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll buy some steamed buns.

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Or I won't be able to eat it tomorrow.

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll be there for you.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll be there for you.

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'll always be there for you.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Are you tired from sitting here?

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I like it.

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What do you think?

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What do you plan to do after we find Miss Zhao?

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll take her back to the South.

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Then...

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I won't tell you.

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What about Yue Ru's cousin?

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
She?

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's hard for her to get away from me.

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll kill her first.

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Why?

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm kidding.

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I know.

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Why do you pretend to be a bad girl?

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm begging you.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Please forgive me.

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm begging you.

166
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Please forgive Yue Ru's cousin.

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
She's still in the back.

168
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yue Ru's cousin is better than the outside world.

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Please don't hurt her.

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm telling you.

171
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
She's not a bad girl.

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
She's a bad girl.

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What do you want?

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
She's always suffering.

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No way.

176
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
She's a big girl who loves the doctor.

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
How could she suffer?

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't you want to live like us?

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You should support her.

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm just a little girl.

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You two are the same.

182
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I know you're not good-looking.

183
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But you can't insult me.

184
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
At least you've lost your close friend.

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
She?

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
She's been a bad girl since she was a kid.

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
How could you know her?

188
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
How could I not know?

189
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Do you know me?

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I've been suffering for years.

191
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I've been away since I was 8.

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's been 10 years.

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yue Ru's cousin is suffering.

194
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But she's never been through anything.

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
People were talking about her in the hall.

196
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I asked her why her mother died.

197
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
She didn't even look at me.

198
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I really understood that.

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I couldn't see the pain.

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But I knew her better.

201
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
She's as kind as you.

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
She was kind and kind.

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But she changed after she lost her close friend.

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But I knew her better.

205
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What are you talking about?

206
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
No one's here.

207
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The steamed buns are sold out.

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The steamed buns are sold out.

209
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I want 50 of them.

210
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'll beat you up if you keep talking.

211
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't want to eat this.

212
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Okay, I'll do it.

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What are you doing?

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Let go of me.

215
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'll tell you what.

216
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm the one who's going to be the next.

217
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You? You're so ugly.

218
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What did you say?

220
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I said I'm sorry.

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What are you talking about?

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Okay, I'll tell you the truth.

223
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I miss my mother.

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I've never seen her since I was three.

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm just a normal person.

226
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You're so stubborn.

227
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We're similar.

228
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't like you.

229
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But I don't hate you that much.

230
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Maybe we can be friends.

231
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
If I'm unlucky enough, I can be your friend.

232
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Shut up.

233
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Who would allow you to say that?

234
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll kill you.

235
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Okay, you can cry if you want to.

236
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't hold it back.

237
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
How is it?

238
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Better?

239
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What are you?

240
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why do you want me to cry?

241
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I won't cry.

242
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I've been happy and happy for the past ten years.

243
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm happy.

244
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I don't need your pity and sympathy.

245
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm different from you.

246
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm the eldest lady of the Lin family.

247
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You're just a bastard.

248
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You have no mother.

249
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm different from you.

250
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I hate you.

251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I hate you.

252
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I hate you.

253
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The night is far away.

254
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The night is clear.

255
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The night is full of nature.

256
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The night is full of nature.

257
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The night is full of nature.

258
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The night is full of nature.

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The night is full of nature.

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The night is full of nature.

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The night is full of nature.

262
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The night is full of nature.

263
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The night is full of nature.

264
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The night is full of nature.

265
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The night is full of nature.

266
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The night is full of nature.

267
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The night is full of nature.

268
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The night is full of nature.

269
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The night is full of nature.

270
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The night is full of nature.

271
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The night is full of nature.

272
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The night is full of nature.

273
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The night is full of nature.

274
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The night is full of nature.

275
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The night is full of nature.

276
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The night is full of nature.

277
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Qi.

278
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Qi, what did you write?

279
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
How can I know my name?

280
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Qi, come out.

281
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'll ask you.

282
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Cousin, I'm leaving.

283
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You fool.

284
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Cousin, you should go back to Chang'an.

285
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But I'm afraid to say goodbye to us.

286
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I can't bear it.

287
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Did he ask me to be his master?

288
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
How dare he?

289
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yes, how dare he?

290
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Qi.

291
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Stop.

292
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Cousin.

293
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Who told you to leave?

294
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm telling you.

295
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm sorry to say goodbye.

296
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I can't leave you.

297
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Don't leave.

298
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
How dare he?

299
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Who told you to leave?

300
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Master Li, I'm grateful to you.

301
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm grateful to you.

302
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm so happy.

303
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
After the trip to Suzhou,

304
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I should have gone back to Chang'an.

305
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But the situation is urgent.

306
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I can't go back to Chang'an.

307
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So, you mean

308
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
you don't want to be with us?

309
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You mean you feel sorry for us?

310
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's not that.

311
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I didn't want to leave you.

312
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Then stay and take care of me.

313
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I've thought about it.

314
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But I know

315
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Master Li will take good care of you.

316
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't have any reason to stay.

317
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'll give you the reason.

318
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm telling you.

319
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm bored.

320
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Stay and have fun.

321
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Master Li has opened the eyes of A'chi.

322
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Then stay.

323
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I can make your eyes bigger.

324
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What do you think?

325
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But Master Li needs to know one thing.

326
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Everyone has his own way.

327
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Please grant me.

328
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So you mean

329
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm not the only one who can do that.

330
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm not the only one who can do that.

331
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
A'chi, don't go.

332
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm not a good person.

333
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Why don't you say goodbye?

334
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Okay.

335
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Tell the old man

336
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
that he has a teacher named Li Xiaoyao.

337
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Don't be embarrassed.

338
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I want to do something for the country.

339
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I won't disappoint you.

340
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We'll go to Chang'an.

341
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll go to you.

342
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Then I'll ask Miss Ling'er to come with me.

343
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
We can have a drink together.

344
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You're looking for a person named Tang Yu in the letter?

345
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yes.

346
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I've been asking for Miss Ling'er's information.

347
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I know there's a man named Tang Yu in the town nearby.

348
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
He's looking for Miss Ling'er.

349
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I believe he can help you.

350
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
A'chi.

351
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Master, please take good care of my cousin.

352
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Okay.

353
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Brother, take good care of her.

354
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I want to take her too.

355
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'll be back.

356
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Brother, take good care of her.

357
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
She's the one I miss the most.

358
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Brother, you're much better than this bastard.

359
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You'll have to work hard to get A'chi's toy.

360
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Don't even think about it.

361
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Find Tang Yu.

362
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The toy?

363
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The toy?

364
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Excuse me.

365
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Where's Tang Yu?

366
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Is he a woman from Central Plain?

367
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I think he's been cheated by many women.

368
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I heard he's a little rogue who eats a big bowl of food.

369
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
He's a man of beauty.

370
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
If he knows this man, he'll be happy to see him.

371
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
He's the only one we have.

372
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What are you doing?

373
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You're not a woman.

374
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm his good friend.

375
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
He's a little...

376
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
He cheated my wife.

377
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
He's a good man.

378
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Is he a woman from Central Plain?

379
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Do you want to come out and pick a fight with me?

380
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You?

381
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Is it possible?

382
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'll be the one to pick a fight with you.

383
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll be the one to pick a fight with you.

384
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Let's go.

385
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You...

386
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Have you seen Tang Yu, a woman from Central Plain who was cheated by many women?

387
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You two beautiful girls.

388
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Can I have a cup of tea with you?

389
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You...

390
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
This boat is going to be broken.

391
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's two boats.

392
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Someone once said that when you're happy, your tears are sweet.

393
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
When you're sad, your tears are bitter.

394
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Your tears are sweet or bitter?

395
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I don't know your name.

396
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Tang Yu.

397
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Tang Yu from Central Plain?

398
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yes.

399
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Anu.

400
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Anu.

401
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Stop.

402
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Tang Yu, let go of me.

403
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I didn't expect to meet you here.

404
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm sorry for eating you. Don't be angry.

405
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Tang Yu.

406
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You're always in a mess.

407
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You're not well-behaved.

408
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Thank you.

409
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You should thank Aunt Sheng.

410
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
She made this shop for you.

411
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Even if you're on the way, your feet won't hurt.

412
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Aunt Sheng.

413
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm leaving.

414
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Then, will you be angry?

415
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
This is what Nanny Nan told me to do.

416
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Nanny Nan...

417
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
She said it's five times.

418
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Tang Yu, please don't do this.

419
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
No.

420
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Tang Yu loves Anu. Don't beat him.

421
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
No. You're being too playful.

422
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Tang Yu, how can you beat Anu?

423
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Tang Yu, what's wrong with you?

424
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Nanny Nan lost her hair on this whip.

425
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
If she didn't beat you, she would know.

426
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
She's her aunt.

427
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Don't say that.

428
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Forget my name.

429
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You're still playing with your head.

430
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Who told her to say my name to Nanny Nan?

431
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You're the most annoying one.

432
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Stop it.

433
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's dangerous.

434
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
When will you come back to Nanzhao?

435
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Why are you here?

436
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Nothing.

437
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I know. You're here to see the princess.

438
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Don't tell me. I know everything.

439
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Don't be so arrogant.

440
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
If the one who asked you to come, you'll be in trouble.

441
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Do you know where the princess is?

442
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
How would I know?

443
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Anu, if you know where the princess is,

444
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
you'll be in trouble.

445
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Let's go.

446
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Let's go.

447
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Here you are.

448
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Here you are.

449
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
This is raw fish soup.

450
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
This is chicken soup.

451
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
This is water-shrimp soup.

452
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
This is the best chicken soup for the old man.

453
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Please enjoy.

454
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You like these?

455
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I like everything.

456
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You must be hungry.

457
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You didn't bring money?

458
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Yes.

459
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
As long as I'm a little baby,

460
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

461
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I'm even more afraid of being hungry.

462
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Then you can eat it tonight.

463
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Let's go back together.

464
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
No.

465
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You're so annoying.

466
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You're so fierce.

467
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You're so bold all day.

468
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Why don't you stay with us?

469
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You two?

470
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'll tell you when you leave.

471
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Anu, you know it's impossible.

472
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Then I won't tell you.

473
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Is it the princess?

474
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
No.

475
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Anu.

476
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I won't tell you.

477
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I won't tell you.

478
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Where are you going?

479
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I've been looking for you all day.

480
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I've got all the sugar.

481
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But I don't have any sugar.

482
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Do you think Qi is lying to us?

483
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Brother Cousin will lie to us.

484
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
He's coming out of the west.

485
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
That's right.

486
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You're so bold.

487
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Give me my clothes.

488
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Are you blind?

489
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Who stole it?

490
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So you're a fool.

491
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
What?

492
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
He's a lunatic.

493
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
He stole something.

494
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
He doesn't shout or report it to the government.

495
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
What?

496
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
He's a lunatic.

497
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
He's a lunatic.

498
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
He's a lunatic.

499
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
He's a lunatic.

500
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
He's a lunatic.

501
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
He's a lunatic.

502
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
He's a lunatic.

503
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
He's a lunatic.

504
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What?

505
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
He's a lunatic.

506
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
He's a lunatic.

507
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Brother Cousin,

508
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
it's not easy to see.

509
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So you should be careful.

510
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Don't make a big difference.

511
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
My lord.

512
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's a big deal.

513
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's a big deal.

514
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'll take it.

515
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It's a big deal.

516
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You're a good boy.

517
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You're a good boy.

518
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You're a good boy.

519
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
You're a good boy.

520
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You're quite a fool.

521
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You...

522
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
you...

523
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You're a lunatic.

524
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
You're a lunatic.

525
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Oh, the end!

526
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Flare!

527
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Flare!

528
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Flare!

529
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Flare!

530
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Where are you going? Do you know that princess and baby are all hungry?

531
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
What are you doing?

532
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Go!

533
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Run!

534
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Hurry up!

535
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Tang Xiaobao, I can't even hear you!

536
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I just saw a thief stealing a pair of old clothes.

537
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
The master has lost something!

538
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Stop it.

539
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
The master has finally got his revenge!

540
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Where's the thief?

541
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
He ran away.

542
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
That's great!

543
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
When did you become a bad boy and like bad things?

544
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
My mother is always a bad boy.

545
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
She only bullies the master.

546
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
You love to be a bad boy.

547
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm still hungry. Let's go eat something.

548
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
There's a restaurant ahead.

549
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It's delicious.

550
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Anu, I've been out for too long. I have to go back.

551
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Are you afraid of being scolded by the master again?

552
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You can look for me if you want.

553
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You can look for me if you want.

554
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You can go now.

555
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You're so cute.

556
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You're so cute.

557
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I bought some red dates,

558
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
some fireworks and chicken soup.

559
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
These are good for your health and Xiaobao.

560
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Have a seat.

561
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Princess.

562
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Princess, you're so cold.

563
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You have to eat more and sleep more.

564
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You have to smile more.

565
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'll tell you something happy.

566
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Tang Xiaobao is also in Central Plain.

567
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Your father sent him to pick you up in Nanzhao.

568
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It'll be fun if he's around.

569
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I don't want to see him.

570
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But he's different from others.

571
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
He's Anu's good friend.

572
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
He's a disciple of his mother.

573
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
He listens to me.

574
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I don't want to see him.

575
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Can't he know that I've found you?

576
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I don't want to believe anyone.

577
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I don't want anyone to find me.

578
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
All right.

579
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I promise you.

580
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Tang Xiaobao.

581
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I don't want to see him.

582
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You hide first. Don't worry.

583
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Anu.

584
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Anu.

585
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Actually I...

586
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
All right.

587
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm late. What else do you want?

588
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm sorry.

589
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
All right. Don't go.

590
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Go back.

591
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Anu. I'm actually...

592
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
All right.

593
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Good boy.

594
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Go to bed early.

595
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
See you.

596
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
See you.

597
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
My mom.

598
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You should go.

599
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
If you don't go,

600
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Tang Xiaobao will find you.

601
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
You're the best.

602
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'll do it.

603
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Thank you.

604
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Why didn't you drink?

605
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Drink it on the way.

606
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Let's go.

607
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
The left is Tang Xiaobao.

608
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And the right is this hot spring.

609
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
What should I do?

610
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Princess.

611
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Hurry up.

612
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
What should I do?

613
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Go.

614
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Let's go.

615
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Princess.

616
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Princess.

617
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'll catch up with you later.

618
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Anu.

619
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Hurry up.

620
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
What's the sound?

621
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
What?

622
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I just heard it.

623
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It should be Ling'er.

624
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Ling'er.

625
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
How could it be?

626
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I didn't hear anything.

627
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Really?

628
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
He...

629
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
He...

630
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It seems to be Ling'er's dream.

631
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Ling'er.

632
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
What's wrong?

633
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm sorry.

634
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Is Ling'er inside?

635
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Be quiet.

636
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
What's wrong?

637
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It's a barrier.

638
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's a big crime.

639
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
What if Ling'er really gets caught?

640
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Let's follow them.

641
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Let's do it after we figure it out.

642
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I can't be found by them.

643
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Tang Xiaobao.

644
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It's not a big deal.

645
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Where did you go?

646
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
No.

647
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Is the princess inside?

648
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
What are you doing?

649
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Nothing.

650
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You make me disappointed.

651
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Elder.

652
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I deserve to die.

653
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Please punish me.

654
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Did you come to the Central Plains?

655
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You're so stubborn.

656
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It's the first time to find a princess.

657
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
We can't find her without a reason.

658
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
We can't find her.

659
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
We can't find her.

660
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Elder.

661
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The Central Plains are big and vicious.

662
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
We're afraid of being deceived.

663
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
We're afraid of being exposed.

664
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So we can't be exposed to outsiders.

665
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
That's why I'm confused.

666
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I don't listen to your explanation.

667
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You're all the most brave and courageous of the Miao Clan.

668
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
But you lost the face of the Miao Clan.

669
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I've always wronged you.

670
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'm willing to take the blame for my crime.

671
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Please give me more chances.

672
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Father.

673
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You all get out of here.

674
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Be confident.

675
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yes.

676
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
What's wrong with you?

677
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
There's news about the princess.

678
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
What?

679
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
The princess was attacked by the famous Miao Clan.

680
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Is this the trap set by the Moon Sect?

681
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Is the news reliable?

682
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Absolutely.

683
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Is the Miao Clan colluding with the Moon Sect?

684
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It's possible.

685
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Father.

686
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
The princess is not easy to get pregnant.

687
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Father.

688
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
The princess is not easy to get pregnant.

689
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Good.

690
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You didn't lose the face of a father,

691
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
and the face of a man.

692
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Nice son.

693
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm just worried about the princess's safety.

694
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Since I'm here,

695
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
we must leave the Miao Clan.

696
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
We must save the princess.

697
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,680
Come.

698
00:39:49,680 --> 00:40:02,880
Since the

699
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,400
Mission of the

700
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,080
No, not

701
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,120
I really know

702
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,640
Let me

703
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,000
Noble

704
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:18,880
we need this

705
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,400
But

706
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,400
How dare you come to pick up Yu Biao and find someone?

707
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,400
I don't need to tell you where he is.

708
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,400
It's that big frog and that flying star.

709
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
Yu Biao is the heaviest.

710
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
But he's not afraid.

711
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
What? You're afraid?

712
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
I'm afraid you're not.

713
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
You're going to get caught and be locked up.

714
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
Why are you here?

715
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
You're afraid you'll leave?

716
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
You...

717
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
You're stupid.

718
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
They're outside.

719
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,400
They're all ours.

720
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
Let's go.

721
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
Let's go.

722
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
Let's go.

723
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Hurry up.

724
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Hurry up.

725
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
Hurry up.

726
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Yifeng, they're the ones who stole your wallet.

727
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
You're so stupid.

728
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,400
Let's go.

729
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
Damn it. Princess.

730
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,400
Yifeng, we can't stay here for long.

731
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,400
We can leave here for three days.

732
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
No matter what.

733
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,400
Yifeng, I hate to sneak around.

734
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Let's go.

735
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,400
Let's go.

736
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
Let's go.

737
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
Let's go.

738
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
But Brother Yao...

739
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,400
Didn't you say you'd forget her?

740
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
But she's in danger now.

741
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
You're still worried about her?

742
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,400
She's thinking about the fortune of a person.

743
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Let's go.

744
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,400
Damn it.

745
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Zhongming is a real man.

746
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,400
He's a real man.

747
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,400
He's a real man.

748
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,400
He's a real man.

749
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
He's a real man.

750
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,400
He's a real man.

751
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,400
He's a real man.

752
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,400
He's a real man.

753
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Yifeng, we should get rid of the crime

754
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,400
in order to find the princess.

755
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,400
I've been thinking about it all my life.

756
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
I've been thinking about it all my life.

757
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,400
I've been thinking about it all my life.

758
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
What are you doing?

759
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,400
Yifeng, I think it's Li Xiaoyao

760
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
who took the princess away.

761
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,400
I'll find her as soon as possible.

762
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,400
Shut up.

763
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
You're a loser.

764
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,400
From the first day to now,

765
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,400
you've never done anything

766
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,400
that makes me happy.

767
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,400
You're looking for death?

768
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,400
Look at you.

769
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,400
What's this?

770
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,400
What's this?

771
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,400
If you don't mind, I'll kill you.

772
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,400
I don't want to understand

773
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,400
what you said.

774
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
At least I still have

775
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,400
a beautiful dream.

776
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
I don't want to understand

777
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,400
what you said.

778
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,400
I finally understand

779
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,400
that you should let go.

780
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,400
I don't want to understand

781
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,400
what you said.

782
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,400
I don't want to understand

783
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,400
what you said.

784
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,400
I don't want to understand

785
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,400
what you said.

786
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,400
At least I still have

787
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,400
a beautiful dream.

788
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,400
I don't want to understand

789
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,400
what you said.

790
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,400
I really don't want to understand

791
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,400
what you said.

792
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,400
I finally understand

793
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,400
that you should let go.
