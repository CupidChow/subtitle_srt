1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Grandpa, please teach me.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What?

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Who told you to call me grandpa?

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I said it.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If I regret it, I'll call you grandpa.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm more than one or two days older than you.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're just insulting me.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
One or two days?

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Ten years.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Forget it.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll just say it once.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Once.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
One last time.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
One last time.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm not afraid of you.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm not afraid of you.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let her see that she wants to kill me at some level.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let her see that you're stしょう me.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
She is a better girl than me.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
She was by my side.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm not afraid of her.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why can't she let me defeat her with this?

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can't get rid of her.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Please show her who I really like more.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Zhenn驾.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Please show them out.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Please show them out.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,560
I beg you.

44
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:25,640
I beg you.

45
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,640
You should take a move in the jade tree.

46
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,560
You should be able to walk the world.

47
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,200
You should win two rounds.

48
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,920
Two rounds?

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,960
What about the night round?

50
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,440
What about the night round?

51
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,280
You're so smart.

52
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,360
I'm warning you.

53
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,160
Don't pull it again.

54
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,880
Otherwise,

55
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,600
I'll cut your hand and foot.

56
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,200
You can't even do the basic moves

57
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,320
for eating and walking.

58
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,320
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,360
Come on.

60
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,120
Drink some wine.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm here to drink with you.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm not asking you to lie on my shoulder.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,880
Get up.

64
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm not in a mood.

65
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't pretend to be so.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I said

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I won't take you as my disciple.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't be so self-conscious.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm talking about my own business.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You brat.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're so stupid.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're so stupid.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're so stupid.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You brat.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You don't know the taste of the wine.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Really?

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I think I've done something.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But I forgot it.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Listen.

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's a big deal.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But I can't remember anything.

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Luckily,

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
you're better than me.

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You can forget about it

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
if you don't drink.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
still remember this.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What's your problem?

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm in a daze.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll give you a word.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Get up.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Get up.

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Get up.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Get up.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Right.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Go and have a good time.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I see.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sleepy.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Master,

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
can you live in my house?

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I hate rich people.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I hate high-rises.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
My house is poor.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's good for you.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, I hate poor people.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why are you so annoying?

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You don't have to care about me.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You've taught me martial arts.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll teach you a lesson.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're so annoying.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
There's a beauty over there.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Where?

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Master.

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm here to see you.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm here to see you.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Stop pretending.

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You're always like this.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
See you, little ghost.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Have you ever thought

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
life is like a chess board?

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Every step

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
should be in your mind.

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You're so smart.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I've sent people to do something for you.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But after the trial,

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
you'll be surprised.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What kind of a person is he?

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Are you okay?

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You bastard.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't be so serious.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You've already paid three times.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I didn't mean it.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Don't fight.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't fight.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't fight.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't you worry about those scoundrels?

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
They'll eat you.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm not allowed to go upstairs.

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I paid three times.

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But I need four people to eat.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I think the ghost court will open.

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Beauty.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
When did they put it in?

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Last night.

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
They put a big bag on it.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't know what the ghost is.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Who's that?

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Lieutenant Li.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They've ate my blood.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
My breathing vs. Immediately.

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Hello?

153
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
Miss.

154
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,000
Brother Xiang Yao.

155
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,400
Brother Xiang Yao.

156
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,400
Are you all right?

157
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,480
This is great.

158
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
I...

159
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,760
Lao Lao is still trapped there.

160
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,360
He is very dangerous.

161
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,800
We have to go back and save him, Brother Xiang Yao.

162
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Lao Lao?

163
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Do we know each other?

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Of course.

165
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,800
Don't joke around.

166
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
I see.

167
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,800
You are here to lie to me, right?

168
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Brother Xiang Yao.

169
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
What's wrong?

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,640
What are you talking about, Brother Xiang Yao?

171
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,960
I am Ling'er.

172
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Ling'er?

173
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,480
Yes, I am Ling'er.

174
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Have you forgotten?

175
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,520
The three people who were saved in the Moon Sect

176
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,200
tied me away in the Immortal Island.

177
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,920
But Lao Lao is very dangerous.

178
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,000
We have to go and save him.

179
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Don't cry.

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,360
I really don't know.

181
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
Oh no.

182
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,200
Brother Xiang Yao.

183
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
You have to take me away.

184
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
All right. Let's go.

185
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
What kind of shop is this?

186
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,560
The food is dirty.

187
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
I almost killed myself.

188
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
You bastard.

189
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
You don't want to live anymore.

190
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,040
These people tied me away.

191
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,560
Are you all right?

192
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,160
I am fine.

193
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Let's go.

194
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
This way.

195
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
It's all right.

196
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Don't run.

197
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
The Moon Sect is over.

198
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Let me do it.

199
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Miss, are you all right?

200
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
I am fine.

201
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
Let's go.

202
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Ximen.

203
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
Let me do it.

204
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
Who dares to hurt my monkey head?

205
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
You.

206
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Master.

207
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Old mother's work for more than ten years

208
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
is now useless.

209
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Stop talking nonsense.

210
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
Ximen.

211
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
You bastard.

212
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Are you all right?

213
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
I am fine.

214
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Ximen.

215
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
You bastard.

216
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
Are you all right?

217
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
I am fine.

218
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Ximen.

219
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
You are here.

220
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
You are here.

221
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,260
hahahaha

222
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:53,220
hahahahahaha

223
00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:00,800
hahahahahahahahahahahaha

224
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,840
Qin Xie

225
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,360
Have some over

226
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,480
I beg you, I beg you.

227
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,360
Hey, you brat.

228
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,520
You want to learn from our family.

229
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,800
Why do you want to learn from others?

230
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,160
You're so bold.

231
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,520
Who are you?

232
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,840
Listen up.

233
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,320
I'm Li Furong.

234
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,760
Li Furong?

235
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,160
I'm Li Furong.

236
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,200
I'm Li Furong.

237
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,480
I'm Li Furong.

238
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,680
I'm Li Furong.

239
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,720
I'm Li Furong.

240
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,920
I'm Li Furong.

241
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,120
I'm Li Furong.

242
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,080
I'm Li Furong.

243
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,680
What are you doing?

244
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,840
You are...

245
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,440
Li Furong, the daughter of

246
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
the most beautiful and beautiful

247
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,560
in the world.

248
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,520
Li Furong.

249
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,720
What's wrong with you?

250
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,360
You're still a beautiful girl.

251
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,240
Why are you doing this?

252
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,120
Say it.

253
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,040
You brat.

254
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,920
Listen up.

255
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,200
If it wasn't for you,

256
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,920
I'd be a million people.

257
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,000
Why are you all hanging on my head?

258
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,040
Shut up.

259
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,840
Shut up.

260
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,480
Shut up.

261
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,280
Shut up.

262
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,920
Luckily, you refused me.

263
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,360
Otherwise, I'd rather die with a gun.

264
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,080
You...

265
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,680
Little beauty.

266
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,280
Why did you come here

267
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,480
to worship the Moon Sect?

268
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,920
I don't know.

269
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,880
Senior, Brother Xiaoyao.

270
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,080
Please go to the Immortal Sect

271
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,040
to save my grandma.

272
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,160
Immortal Sect has wine?

273
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,160
Grandma never let me drink.

274
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,000
No wine.

275
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,800
No fun.

276
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,880
Master.

277
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,680
You haven't taught me

278
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,640
how to drink.

279
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,200
It's me.

280
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,480
I'm just a character.

281
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,920
What kind of person is he?

282
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,720
He's so crazy.

283
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,120
Brother Xiaoyao.

284
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,560
We have to go back to Immortal Sect as soon as possible.

285
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,440
It's dangerous.

286
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,800
Miss.

287
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
Why do you always call people to go there?

288
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,040
Immortal Sect is only for you.

289
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,640
Is he the fairy girl

290
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,760
who gave you the Immortal Sect?

291
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,520
I...

292
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,480
I don't know him at all.

293
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

294
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,520
What's wrong with you?

295
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,520
I'm Ling'er.

296
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,160
I know.

297
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,120
You're Ling'er.

298
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,720
You're Ling'er

299
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,920
that I don't know.

300
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,360
How is that possible?

301
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,880
Two days ago,

302
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,560
we got married.

303
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,480
That's impossible.

304
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,360
How is that possible?

305
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,200
Let me tell you.

306
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,720
The road is rough.

307
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,440
We're tied up.

308
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,720
It's a small matter for me.

309
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,240
If you want me to go to Immortal Sect

310
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,200
to save your grandma,

311
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,240
that's not a problem.

312
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,040
But...

313
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,760
But you're my wife.

314
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,200
How is that possible?

315
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,480
We really got married.

316
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,040
Really?

317
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,160
I've never seen you before.

318
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,360
How can that be possible?

319
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,320
Such an important matter.

320
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,960
You forgot it.

321
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,720
You bastard.

322
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,480
Tell me honestly.

323
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,760
What have you done in Immortal Sect?

324
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,000
I've been there.

325
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,560
Why don't I remember?

326
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,080
You haven't been there?

327
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,000
How can you eat me?

328
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,800
Did you bully them

329
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,760
in Immortal Sect?

330
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,800
Now you're acting like you don't know me.

331
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,160
I...

332
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,160
You're actually...

333
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,040
lying to me.

334
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,200
How can I be?

335
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,760
Then tell me.

336
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,400
What did I lie to you?

337
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:12,640
You...

338
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,840
What do you mean?

339
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,400
You can't tell me?

340
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,640
I think you're lying to me.

341
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,320
I'm not.

342
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,400
This is the night of our wedding.

343
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,120
You gave it to me.

344
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,360
Hey.

345
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,120
Isn't this your mother's?

346
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,840
You put it on me.

347
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,480
Why is it on you?

348
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,720
What did you say?

349
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,360
You're a fool.

350
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,520
If you didn't give it to them,

351
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,880
they would run away.

352
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,600
I really didn't.

353
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,160
You're holding my name.

354
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,080
You're the one who loves me.

355
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:01,920
Die.

356
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,960
There's nobody?

357
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,760
What's going on?

358
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,640
Only two days left?

359
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,880
You made me forget?

360
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
Come on.

361
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Miss.

362
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Where have I seen you?

363
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
You're so familiar.

364
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
What are you talking about?

365
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,480
You're so rude to girls.

366
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
What am I lying to you?

367
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
I've really seen her.

368
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
I remember.

369
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
You're Hu.

370
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,480
You're the fairy on the island.

371
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
How's your dad?

372
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Is he doing well?

373
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
He's doing well.

374
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
The fairy is very generous.

375
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,480
She's a little tiger.

376
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
Don't be like this.

377
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
Have you really seen her?

378
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
Is it strange?

379
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
Did she give you the fairy medicine

380
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
and saved you from the trouble?

381
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
I... I don't remember.

382
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Forget it.

383
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
I don't want to talk to you.

384
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,480
Do you have a boat?

385
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Can you take me back to Fairy Island?

386
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
I can give you my life if you want a boat.

387
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,480
Follow me.

388
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
Why are you following me?

389
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
I... I want to go to Fairy Island.

390
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
You're old.

391
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
No need.

392
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
No.

393
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
I don't know about your business.

394
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,480
I know it now.

395
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
I can't go there.

396
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
I'll take care of your business.

397
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
Let me ask you.

398
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Who am I?

399
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
You...

400
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Don't you want to say

401
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,480
that you're my wife?

402
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Are you sick?

403
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
I'm your wife.

404
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
You're my husband.

405
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
No, right?

406
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Yes.

407
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
No?

408
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
Yes.

409
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
I'm your wife.

410
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
You're my husband.

411
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
I'm not.

412
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
Yes.

413
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
You're a girl.

414
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
You're not shy to say that.

415
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
Yes.

416
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
I'm telling you.

417
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
Xiaoyao is our man.

418
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
Yes.

419
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Let's go.

420
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Are you annoying?

421
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
You're so...

422
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
It's weird.

423
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Why are you so calm?

424
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
What's wrong?

425
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,480
Yes.

426
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,480
I was very loud last time.

427
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Why?

428
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
That giant wolf was made by me.

429
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,480
He was here to prevent others from coming to Fairy Island.

430
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
But...

431
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,480
I'll never remove this magic.

432
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
Could it be...

433
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Xiaoyao, look!

434
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,480
Lao Long!

435
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,480
Wait!

436
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
Where are you going?

437
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
I don't know what's going on.

438
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Wait here.

439
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
I'll stay here.

440
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Take care of Ling'er.

441
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Okay.

442
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
Lao Long!

443
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
Ling'er!

444
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
Lao Long!

445
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
Lao Long!

446
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
Lao Long!

447
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Lao Long!

448
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Lao Long!

449
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,480
Lao Long!

450
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Lao Long, where are you?

451
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Lao Long!

452
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Lao Long!

453
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,480
Lao Long, where are you?

454
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
Ling'er is back!

455
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Lao Long!

456
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
Ling'er, don't be anxious.

457
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
Go there and look for him.

458
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
I'll go there and see him.

459
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Be careful.

460
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Lao Long!

461
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
Lao Long!

462
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Lao Long!

463
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Lao Long!

464
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Lao Long!

465
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
Lao Long!

466
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Lao Long!

467
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Lao Long!

468
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
I really came here.

469
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
No!

470
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Lao Long!

471
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Lao Long!

472
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,480
Lao Long!

473
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
Lao Long!

474
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,480
Lao Long!

475
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Lao Long!

476
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Lao Long!

477
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Lao Long!

478
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Lao Long!

479
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Lao Long!

480
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Lao Long!

481
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
Lao Long!

482
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
Lao Long!

483
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
Lao Long!

484
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,480
Lao Long!

485
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Lao Long!

486
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
Miss Ling'er!

487
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
How will they treat Lao Long?

488
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Miss Ling'er, don't be anxious.

489
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
Think about it.

490
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
What place do you usually go to?

491
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
I...

492
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Lao Long must love you.

493
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,480
He will wait for you there.

494
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,480
I see.

495
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Lao Long!

496
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,480
Lao Long!

497
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Lao Long!

498
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Lao Long!

499
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Lao Long, are you all right?

500
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
Ling'er.

501
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,480
I finally wait for you.

502
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
Lao Long, Ling'er has grown up.

503
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
I can protect you.

504
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
Lao Long, don't be afraid.

505
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
It's so cold.

506
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
Ling'er.

507
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,480
I really have no face to see your mother.

508
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
I made a decision myself.

509
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
I made you a marriage.

510
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480
I did it to make you depend on me.

511
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
I didn't expect that.

512
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Lao Long.

513
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
Don't listen to that man.

514
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
Is he still here?

515
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
He is still here.

516
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
But he has forgotten everything.

517
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
My child.

518
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
Lao Long knows that

519
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
Xiao Yao is not a bad person.

520
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,480
It must be that three-month-old man.

521
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,480
He lost his memory and looked at the bones.

522
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Is there any way to cure him?

523
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
If he really loves me,

524
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
he can forget everything.

525
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,480
But can he forget it?

526
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
As long as he lives,

527
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
everything can start from the beginning.

528
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
As long as he lives,

529
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,480
Lao Long, you must hold on.

530
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
Lao Long!

531
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
I'll get the gold belt.

532
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
No.

533
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
It's useless.

534
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
My blood is almost dried.

535
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
Lao Long!

536
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
It's useless to take any medicine.

537
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
I'll take the medicine for you.

538
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
Lao Long!

539
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,480
Lao Long!

540
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
Lao Long!

541
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
Xiao Yao!

542
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
Lao Long!

543
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Thank you.

544
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
Lao Long!

545
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
Ling Er.

546
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
Is he...

547
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
Is he very fast?

548
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
Nonsense!

549
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Lao Long won't die.

550
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
Xiao Yao.

551
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
You're right.

552
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
No!

553
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
Ling Er.

554
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
Calm down.

555
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Let Lao Long go.

556
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
Xiao Yao.

557
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Lao Long.

558
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Tell me what you have to say.

559
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
Xiao Yao.

560
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Take Ling Er back to Nanzhao.

561
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
Go to see Prince Wu.

562
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Prince Wu?

563
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
Who is he?

564
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
When I see him,

565
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
you'll know everything.

566
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
I'll do my best.

567
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
Come.

568
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,480
Ling Er.

569
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
Ling Er, be good.

570
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
Lao Long.

571
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
Lao Long.

572
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
I promise you everything.

573
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Please don't leave.

574
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
Okay?

575
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Lao Long.

576
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Ling Er.

577
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
Smile at me.

578
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Let me

579
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
always remember your smile.

580
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Okay?

581
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Take good care of him.

582
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
Xiao Yao.

583
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
Ling Er.

584
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
You're so beautiful.

585
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Lao Long.

586
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,480
What did you see?

587
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
The house.

588
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
The sky.

589
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
The river.

590
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
And the flower.

591
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,480
The flower we've been looking for.

592
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
It's so beautiful.

593
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
It's so beautiful.

594
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
Lao Long.

595
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Lao Long.

596
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
Lao Long.

597
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
Lao Long.

598
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
Lao Long.

599
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Lao Long.

600
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
The sky is bright.

601
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Wake up.

602
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
The sky is bright.

603
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Lao Long.

604
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
It's time

605
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
to send Lao Long away.

606
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
No.

607
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
Wait a little longer.

608
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,480
Lao Long will wake up.

609
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,480
He will come.

610
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
He will come.

611
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
Miss Ling Er.

612
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,480
Go.

613
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
Thank you for coming with me.

614
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
What's wrong?

615
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
I'm staying here with Lao Long.

616
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
Lao Long is dead.

617
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
He won't wake up.

618
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
Do you understand?

619
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
No.

620
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
What did you promise Lao Long?

621
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Did you forget?

622
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
I don't care.

623
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
I want Lao Long back.

624
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
I want everything to be the same as the past.

625
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
Lao Long.

626
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Be brave.

627
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
Ling Er.

628
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
From now on,

629
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
you will learn to face everything by yourself.

630
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
Ling Er.

631
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Lao Long.

632
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,480
He wants to know the river flow of the hometown.

633
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
The sky of the hometown.

634
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
The flowers of the hometown.

635
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
Ling Er.

636
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,480
You want to take him back to Gu Hui.

637
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
Then he can rest in peace.

638
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
You Huo.

639
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
Can you?

640
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,480
Of course.

641
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,480
Then where will Lao Long go?

642
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Back to the hometown.

643
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,480
But I'm afraid.

644
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,480
I've never been outside.

645
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,480
I don't understand anything.

646
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,480
Ling Er.

647
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
Listen.

648
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
Don't worry.

649
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
I promised Lao Long.

650
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
I'll always be with you.

651
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
I'll protect you.

652
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
Lao Long.

653
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
Lao Long.

654
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
Lao Long.

655
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
You're so cold-hearted.

656
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
What?

657
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
He's like you and me now.

658
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
He's innocent.

659
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
You think that Luo Shao is dead?

660
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
He's got a voice.

661
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
What?

662
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
Aren't you his husband?

663
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
Hey, don't laugh at me.

664
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
Am I?

665
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
He's serious.

666
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,480
I'm serious too.

667
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
OK.

668
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,480
Since you're serious,

669
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,480
I'll tell you.

670
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,480
If I fall in love with a girl,

671
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,480
I'll love her for life.

672
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
She can't leave.

673
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,480
OK.

674
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
I mean it.

675
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
So?

676
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,480
Stop kidding me.

677
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
Look.

678
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
I feel like she's done.

679
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
You're done?

680
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480
Don't be sad.

681
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,480
I promised Lao Long.

682
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
I'll always be with you.

683
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
Let's go.

684
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
I...

685
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
You're in trouble.

686
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
You should clean up.

687
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
Let's go.

688
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Hey, hey, hey.

689
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Don't be so serious.

690
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,480
I...

691
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
Didn't I tell you?

692
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,480
You can't step on Luo Wei's wild flower.

693
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,480
You have a little spirit.

694
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,480
Are you blind or deaf?

695
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
I told you so long ago.

696
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
I'm not like her.

697
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,480
I'm not like her.

698
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,480
I'm not like her.

699
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
I'm not like her.

700
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,480
I'm not like her.

701
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,480
I'm not like her.

702
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
I'm not like her.

703
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
You're almost there.

704
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Hey.

705
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Dear fellow villagers,

706
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
I'm here to announce that

707
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
my nephew, Li Xiaoyao,

708
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,480
is going to marry this Miss Ling'er.

709
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
Don't talk nonsense.

710
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,480
Thank you.

711
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,480
No, no.

712
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
No, no.

713
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
Thank you.

714
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,480
Thank you.

715
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
Hey, no.

716
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
What are you doing?

717
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Thank you.

718
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
What's wrong with you?

719
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,480
That's right.

720
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
That's right.

721
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
He is better now.

722
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
Yes.

723
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,480
Why?

724
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
How can I do that?

725
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,480
It can't be helped.

726
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
You're badly ill because ofize.

727
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,360
I think you've missed your ticket

728
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
even afterł卫力.

729
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
Have you missed your ticket?

730
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,480
Never.

731
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,480
You've missed your ticket.

732
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
But I know

733
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,480
that's not your fault.

734
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,560
I've been so заявab Bau, what should I do?

735
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,860
I have two books for you

736
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,840
I want the back Kylo

737
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,440
The best medicine.

738
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,500
Okay

739
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,640
Me first

740
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,340
Bird could put up with it

741
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,500
I'm just kidding.

742
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,340
It's strange.

743
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,380
I've never seen her

744
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,780
be so serious to others.

745
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,980
You're so bad.

746
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,460
You're the only one who likes to drink.

747
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,020
No way.

748
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,140
Why not?

749
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,980
I won't be wrong.

750
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,260
No matter what,

751
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,380
I've been in the martial arts world

752
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,940
for more than 20 years.

753
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,180
You're a good girl.

754
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,260
So I must take care of you.

755
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,060
I'll take care of you for the rest of my life.

756
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,340
I think you should respect Brother Xiaoyao.

757
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,580
He must be unhappy

758
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,020
when he was beaten by those two girls.

759
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,260
I think Brother Xiaoyao

760
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,580
must like those two girls very much.

761
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,340
I don't like them.

762
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,580
I like you.

763
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,580
I'll settle the marriage.

764
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,980
That year, Xiaoyao's father

765
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,700
was a bad person.

766
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,380
He insisted on marrying her.

767
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,020
They were married for a few years.

768
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,620
They didn't know where they were going.

769
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,460
Xiaoyao is a poor girl.

770
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:34,900
She and I are the same age.

771
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,020
Yes.

772
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,300
Xiaoyao is the only one in the family.

773
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,620
So she wants to find a good girl

774
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,780
to be her daughter-in-law.

775
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,940
Can I?

776
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,940
What do you mean?

777
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,220
You're just a stranger.

778
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,180
What?

779
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,820
You don't like her?

780
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,140
I do.

781
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,660
I like her ten years ago.

782
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,540
You...

783
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,460
You've met this monkey ten years ago?

784
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,420
I'll take you to a place in the west.

785
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,500
awakening

786
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,740
what is this?

787
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,900
This is a bamboo wantson.

788
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,860
When she was singing,

789
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,460
she's coming back to you.

790
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,180
Brother Xiaoyao, goodbye.

791
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,980
Here is I waiting for you.

792
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,660
Ms.

793
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,900
This is tooMs.

794
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,020
This means山has are a good couple.

795
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,620
It feels strange to see this monkey.

796
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,860
He's doing great.

797
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,300
But Wang Yougu has forgotten everything.

798
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,380
It's okay.

799
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,180
Just give him some antidote.

800
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,540
Old man said

801
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,340
this is a kind of magical bone in our family.

802
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,820
No antidote.

803
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,940
No antidote?

804
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,540
It's okay.

805
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,620
If it's not enough, go and rob it.

806
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,300
Rob it?

807
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,460
It's not robbing anything else.

808
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,540
It's robbing happiness.

809
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,820
What were you up to again?

810
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:32,640
달�

811
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,640
I've been fooled by you.

812
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,640
Who fooled you?

813
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,640
You said you didn't.

814
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
Do you like him?

815
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,640
Yes.

816
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,640
Then do you not like us?

817
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Of course I do.

818
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,640
Then do you really want to marry him?

819
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,640
No.

820
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,640
Then do you want to?

821
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
Actually I do.

822
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
You're too much.

823
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,640
Give it to me.

824
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Qian.

825
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
Qian.

826
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
I'm done.

827
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,640
I'm here to see you.

828
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,640
Why are you still angry?

829
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,640
I'm full of buns.

830
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,640
I'll treat you to a delicious meal later.

831
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,640
I'll treat you to a good meal.

832
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,640
Don't be angry.

833
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,640
Oh my god.

834
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,640
Sit.

835
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,640
I'll treat you to a delicious meal later.

836
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,640
What are you doing?

837
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,640
I'm going to Chong Dang.

838
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,640
You're leaving?

839
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,640
Where are you going?

840
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,640
I promised Ling'er.

841
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,640
I'll send her back to Nanzhao.

842
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,640
No.

843
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,640
Don't you understand?

844
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,640
This is a man's word.

845
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
It's a man's word.

846
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,640
Good.

847
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,640
It's not a man's word.

848
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,640
It's a man's word.

849
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,640
Since you've decided,

850
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,640
I'll play a game with you.

851
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,640
Good.

852
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,640
Good.

853
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,640
This might be the last time I've hit you.

854
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,640
Can you give me a big punch?

855
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,640
Come out with me.

856
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,640
Come out with me.

857
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,640
Are you scared?

858
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,640
What's wrong?

859
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,640
It hurts.

860
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,640
It hurts.

861
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,640
It hurts.

862
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,640
Where does it hurt?

863
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640
Let's see.

864
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,640
Let's see.

865
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,640
What's wrong with your heart?

866
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,640
It hurts.

867
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,640
It hurts.

868
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,640
It hurts.

869
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,640
It hurts.

870
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,640
Little tiger, do you know?

871
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
I hit you and you hit me.

872
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,640
It really hurts.

873
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,640
But...

874
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,640
I hit him and he lied.

875
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
So,

876
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,640
I'm not afraid of your love and support.

877
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,640
I'm sorry.

878
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,640
But can you let me hit you?

879
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
You dare?

880
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,640
Come on.

881
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,640
Does it hurt?

882
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,640
It hurts.

883
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,640
What's wrong with you?

884
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,640
Why are you so scared?

885
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,640
I hit you and you hit me.

886
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,640

00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,640
Scream.

913
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,640
I really don't want to know

914
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,640
I finally understand

915
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,640
I want to let go

916
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,640
