00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
hacer

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,200
Nothing good like this.

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,680
direito

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Doing fine?

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,840
Enough.

21
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,280
I have promised you all my best wishes.

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't be afraid with my trade say.

23
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,840
Attack.

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,680
Say the truth.

25
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,940
I've never seen master.

26
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Tell the truth.

27
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Tang Yu didn't go anywhere.

28
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,840
He didn't have a girlfriend,

29
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,840
no heart,

30
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
no secret,

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
no lies.

32
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,840
He didn't lie to anyone.

33
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,840
He didn't kill anyone.

34
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,840
Do you want to keep him from me forever?

35
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
But don't let me take him with me.

36
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
If I take him with me,

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,840
I'll take his skin and his gold.

38
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
I'll take him with me.

39
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
Tang Yu Xiaobao.

40
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
Why are you here?

41
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
I'm looking for you.

42
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Is there something delicious?

43
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
Don't do this.

44
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
Why?

45
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
It's not delicious.

46
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
Really?

47
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
Didn't you say that

48
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,840
tears are sweet when you're happy?

49
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,840
Tears are bitter when you're sad.

50
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,840
Why are you unhappy?

51
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
I'm not.

52
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
Listen to me.

53
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Listen to me first.

54
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,840
It must be that master has bullied you.

55
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Listen to me.

56
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Does it hurt?

57
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
I know that you must be very hurt.

58
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
I must find the master's theory.

59
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
Then I won't go.

60
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Don't be afraid.

61
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,840
Last time I only had an accident for his butt.

62
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,840
I'll tell him the truth this time.

63
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,840
Don't let him touch you.

64
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Tang Yu Xiaobao.

65
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
What's wrong with you?

66
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
A'nuo.

67
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,840
Did you find the princess?

68
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
No.

69
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Where is the princess?

70
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
I won't tell you.

71
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
A'nuo, don't make trouble.

72
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,840
I'm not afraid of that master's bones.

73
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,840
A'nuo, the Moon Sect has sent people to the Central Plains.

74
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
They're looking for the princess.

75
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
If the princess falls on their hands, it'll be a disaster.

76
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
What's the Moon Sect?

77
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,840
I'm a good friend of Uncle Hei.

78
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
I'm not afraid of him.

79
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
He's not what you think.

80
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
You're too complicated.

81
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
If the princess goes back with you,

82
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
it'll be even worse.

83
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
His majesty wants to take the princess.

84
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
He wants to fight.

85
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
If you fight back,

86
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
his fate will be as bad as his mother's.

87
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
You're still young.

88
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
You don't understand.

89
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,840
You're just a little bit older than me.

90
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,840
A'nuo, if the princess falls on the Moon Sect,

91
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
it'll be a disaster.

92
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
Don't talk about Uncle Hei's bad words.

93
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
I'll be angry.

94
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,840
I'll eat you up.

95
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Don't blame me.

96
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,840
So comfortable.

97
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,840
I used to like running around like this when I was a kid.

98
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
I sat down like this.

99
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,840
I looked at the sky and the clouds.

100
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
I felt so good.

101
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Really?

102
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
Yes.

103
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
It's the same as me.

104
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Why didn't I find you earlier?

105
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Sometimes, people are always in a hurry.

106
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
What's wrong?

107
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
You're unhappy again?

108
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Actually, I don't want to be a princess.

109
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Nor do I want to be a god.

110
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,840
I just want to be a normal person.

111
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,840
What's wrong with being a princess?

112
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,840
I can help many people.

113
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,840
I can give many people hope.

114
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,840
You're very important.

115
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
I haven't done anything.

116
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
Uncle Hei, you have to be cruel.

117
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
What's the matter?

118
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Come with me.

119
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Wait for me.

120
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Okay.

121
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
I'll go.

122
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,840
I'm a princess now.

123
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
No.

124
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
No, aunt.

125
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
Why?

126
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
You want to wear dirty clothes.

127
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
No.

128
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,840
I know you want to be a threat to me.

129
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
But how can I do that?

130
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,840
I'm responsible for sending you to the south.

131
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,840
I'll protect you like the egg.

132
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,840
Princess, think about it.

133
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840
If they come after you,

134
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,840
I'll fight with them.

135
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
If you're not worried about yourself,

136
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
you'll have to think about the baby.

137
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Aunt.

138
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
Okay.

139
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
You have to listen to me.

140
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,840
Okay?

141
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
Okay.

142
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Hair.

143
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
Okay.

144
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Let's go.

145
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Let's go.

146
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Princess.

147
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
So cold.

148
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Baby, don't be like your father.

149
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
I'll take care of your mother.

150
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Princess, are you okay?

151
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
I'm fine.

152
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Princess.

153
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
Princess.

154
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Princess.

155
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Brother Xiaoyao.

156
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Brother Xiaoyao.

157
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
You still want the bad egg?

158
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,840
You hate him, don't you?

159
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840
Princess, I can help you

160
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,840
to open up all the people who hurt you.

161
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
But if you hurt yourself,

162
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
I can't do anything.

163
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Do you know that?

164
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Let's go.

165
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Brother Xiaoyao.

166
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
Brother Xiaoyao.

167
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Every time you dream,

168
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
you call me Brother Xiaoyao.

169
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Brother Xiaoyao.

170
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
You like him very much.

171
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Why do you want to be separated?

172
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Brother Xiaoyao.

173
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Brother Xiaoyao.

174
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Brother Xiaoyao.

175
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
What is he doing?

176
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
How painful is it?

177
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,240
How painful it is.

178
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,000
It's bitter.

179
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,040
If I like someone,

180
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,400
I won't be like you.

181
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,240
If only one man could go and find a way.

182
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,360
What do you mean?

183
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,280
There is nothing in it.

184
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,440
What he happened to you is aloof.

185
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,360
But you're a fool.

186
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:32,920
Then I dare to say.

187
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,040
If nothing is he,

188
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,160
I carry on my finger all day greatest wish to keepكمph Illinois.

189
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,240
One seven four er.

190
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Let's go.

191
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
Master, how is it?

192
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Let's go.

193
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
Go.

194
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Tang Xiaobao.

195
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Are you okay?

196
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
I'm fine.

197
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Tang Xiaobao is the hero of Anuo.

198
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Your tone doesn't seem to be good.

199
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Do you want to take a rest?

200
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
Thank you.

201
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Miss Xiaobao, are you okay?

202
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
I'm fine.

203
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
This is Miss Xiaobao.

204
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
She's not in good health.

205
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,840
The soups and other things before were all because of her...

206
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
She's a girl.

207
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
Why are you staring at her?

208
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
Anuo, don't lie to me.

209
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
I'm here to ask you to forgive me.

210
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
She's not a princess.

211
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
She's a little...

212
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Anuo, you can't lie to me when you're sincere.

213
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,840
She's not a princess.

214
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,840
Anuo, you can call me Ling'er.

215
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
Please.

216
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,840
I can't call you by your name.

217
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,840
You're going to scare me?

218
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,840
I'm just a senior.

219
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
I'm just responsible for my duty.

220
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Why are you getting more and more like a senior?

221
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Princess.

222
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Princess Leia, you can go out.

223
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,840
Princess, do you want to...

224
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
I'm sorry.

225
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,840
I want to be quiet.

226
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Tang Yuhui is guarding the cave.

227
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840
Please take a good rest.

228
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Let Anuo accompany you.

229
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
You stay here and I'll take a rest.

230
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Princess, please.

231
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
I'm here to take a rest.

232
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
Please follow me.

233
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
Princess, please.

234
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
Are you hungry?

235
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Please eat some sweet potatoes.

236
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,840
When did I not feel hungry?

237
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
You don't want to eat?

238
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,840
There are stones.

239
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
I know.

240
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
I won't eat it when I'm old.

241
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Uncle is not here. You can eat it.

242
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,840
It's good that you eat it.

243
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
I'll finish it then.

244
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,840
Where is the Dashi Valley?

245
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,840
I said where is it?

246
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
Is the sweet potatoes good?

247
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
I know.

248
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,840
Tang Yu wants to take care of the house.

249
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,840
He wants to make a clear conversation with Dashi Valley.

250
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Dashi Valley is always shouting at you.

251
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
Anuo has long been blind.

252
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,840
Now Tang Yu has grown up.

253
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,840
He finally understands that Dashi Valley is just a big city.

254
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,840
It's ugly and old-fashioned.

255
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Anuo.

256
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,840
Don't say that.

257
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,840
Are you really on the side of Anuo or Dashi Valley?

258
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
I...

259
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Dashi Valley thinks you're a little stone.

260
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,840
You can't live without it.

261
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,840
His mother said he's a man who can't live without stones.

262
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,840
His mother also said that Tang Yu is a rich man.

263
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
You can be independent.

264
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Just like Anuo.

265
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,840
I've always respected my father.

266
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,840
I've been hungry for him.

267
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,840
That's why you've been angry with him.

268
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
What a pity.

269
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,840
Since he raised me, I've been angry with him.

270
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,840
No matter how difficult it is,

271
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,840
I, Tang Yu, will be the most capable man in the world.

272
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,840
I won't let him down.

273
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
You're right.

274
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Isn't that great?

275
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,840
I've always been a good teacher to him.

276
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,840
I don't dare to force him.

277
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,840
But I don't know how to do it.

278
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,840
I can never reach my father's request.

279
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Is it what he said?

280
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,840
I can't let him down.

281
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Tang Yu, you're so useless.

282
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,840
You can talk and talk to the girl.

283
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
That's great.

284
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
That's great.

285
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,840
That's great.

286
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
That's great.

287
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
Is it him?

288
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,840
You're not bad either.

289
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,840
Could it be that she's the princess' lover?

290
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840
I'm hungry.

291
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
Don't be anxious.

292
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Look, Tang Yi is already going to find something to eat.

293
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,840
That's great!

294
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
Look what he'll bring.

295
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,840
A mouse, a mouse, a tiger, or a star?

296
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
I'm starving to death.

297
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,840
I'm starving to death.

298
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
I'm starving to death.

299
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,840
I'm starving to death.

300
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,840
I'm starving to death.

301
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840
Brother Jingran!

302
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
Miss Ling'er, you're here.

303
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,840
We've found you. How are you?

304
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,840
I'm fine. Please don't mind.

305
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,840
I know where Master Li's master is.

306
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,840
I'll take you there.

307
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
You're with Master Li Xiaoyang, right?

308
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
You're still bullying the princess?

309
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Do you want me to beat you?

310
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
A'nu.

311
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,840
Miss, I think you've misunderstood.

312
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Brother Jingran is different from him.

313
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,840
Don't be like this.

314
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
Miss Ling'er, I think there must be some misunderstandings.

315
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,840
No matter what, I just don't want to see them.

316
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
I'm just with them.

317
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Wait.

318
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,840
I'm the only one here.

319
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
I'm not with them.

320
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,840
If you don't mind,

321
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,840
we can have a chat.

322
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,840
A'nu, you wait for me here.

323
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Don't bully the princess.

324
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,840
Otherwise, I won't be polite to Tang Yu and Xiaobao.

325
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,840
Miss, don't worry.

326
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
Brother Jingran,

327
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,840
do you know that brother Xiaoyao's monster you wanted to kill

328
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
is Ling'er?

329
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
That night,

330
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,840
the stone that Ling'er kept.

331
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
It was me.

332
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
I didn't mean to hide it.

333
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,840
I didn't even know myself.

334
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,840
I just met myself again.

335
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,840
Have you overcome it?

336
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
It must be hard.

337
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Why didn't you share your burden with us?

338
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
I'm so mad that I didn't do that.

339
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,840
Do you hate that you're the master of the palace?

340
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
If I were you, I would do the same.

341
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
I wouldn't.

342
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
I misunderstood you.

343
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
I thought you knew me.

344
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,840
I think I have to clear this matter.

345
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,840
The day you couldn't recognize me,

346
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,840
it was because of that fox demon.

347
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,840
It must be me who was confused.

348
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Why?

349
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,840
Before you met me,

350
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,840
the fox demon became the monster on the surface of Yue Ru.

351
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
It took us over.

352
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,840
It was master and cousin who saved me.

353
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
No way.

354
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
You and Yue Ru are childhood friends.

355
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,840
How could you not recognize her?

356
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,840
It was the fox demon who pretended to be her.

357
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
It was because of that thing that

358
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,840
you and master had a connection.

359
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
He thought that if it was the fox demon,

360
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,840
he would trick her into being her beloved.

361
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
I didn't mind that he killed me.

362
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,840
But I really mind that

363
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,840
he was with other girls

364
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,840
and was gentle.

365
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,840
Miss Lin,

366
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,840
did you pass the small pavilion that day?

367
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
That day,

368
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,840
he went to the pavilion to pick up Miss Lin's nose.

369
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,840
That move

370
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
was a secret between you and master Li.

371
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,840
I think he knows the meaning of this move.

372
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
You may know it,

373
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
but you may not know it.

374
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,840
That day,

375
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,840
master Li said to Yue Ru and his cousin

376
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,840
that every detail of yours,

377
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
every move of yours,

378
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,840
including that little move,

379
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,840
Miss Lin,

380
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,840
Jing Yuan wouldn't lie.

381
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,840
Master Li only had you in his heart

382
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
and only you.

383
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,840
He almost went crazy thinking of you.

384
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
That day,

385
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,840
he was just telling Yue Ru and his cousin

386
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,840
how deep his thoughts on you are.

387
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,840
Do you have any questions?

388
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,840
I hate myself.

389
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
I used to love him so much.

390
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
But I don't know him at all.

391
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
I don't understand him.

392
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,840
Miss Lin,

393
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,840
don't push all the blame

394
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,840
on yourself.

395
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
Master Li,

396
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,840
I don't know you either.

397
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Besides,

398
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
we are all mortals.

399
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Jing Yuan,

400
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
I'm not a mortals.

401
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
I'm not a mortal.

402
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,840
I don't think

403
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,840
I should love anyone.

404
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
What's the problem?

405
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
Xiao Yao and I

406
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
are always in the same world.

407
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
I think

408
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,840
you should tell him everything.

409
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
He has the right to choose.

410
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,840
Besides,

411
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
I don't think he would mind at all.

412
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
I don't think so.

413
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
But I do.

414
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
In such a short time,

415
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
many things have already

416
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
surpassed my imagination.

417
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Jing Yuan,

418
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
do you know

419
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
I'm really close to my ability

420
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
to stand up?

421
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
I can't stand any more.

422
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
Because I really can't stand it.

423
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
I'm just a weak person.

424
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
I can't rely on him.

425
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
Do you remember the last time in Suzhou?

426
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
I told you

427
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
to love someone

428
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,840
to another end?

429
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
Jing Yuan,

430
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
have you

431
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
reached that end?

432
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
This is a saying.

433
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Suddenly, I feel a little bit anxious.

434
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
I hope

435
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
I can give you some hint.

436
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
What is it?

437
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Tell Ling'er.

438
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
Love.

439
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
It's better to know each other.

440
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Love.

441
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
It's better to know each other.

442
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
Princess.

443
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,840
Princess.

444
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
Princess.

445
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
Princess.

446
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
Where did she go?

447
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
She's not feeling well.

448
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
Princess, you're back.

449
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,840
Love is better to know each other.

450
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
Rather than being obsessed with love,

451
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
it's better to be a blessing.

452
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Don't let your love

453
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,840
be a magic for your love.

454
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
Instead,

455
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
your love

456
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
will give her strength

457
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
to show her love.

458
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
If you really have someone,

459
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
even if you're separated from each other,

460
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,840
you'll still be together.

461
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
True love

462
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
is bound to be your happiness

463
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,840
with her happiness.

464
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
If someone

465
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,840
is able to give her a bigger happiness,

466
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840
you'll send her to that place.

467
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Love.

468
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
Love.

469
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
Bye.

470
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,840
Love.

471
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Nu.

472
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
Look what I brought you.

473
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Nu.

474
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
Nu.

475
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
Nu.

476
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,840
Nu.

477
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Nu.

478
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
What's this place?

479
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
Help.

480
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,840
Help.

481
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,840
Help.

482
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Nu, don't be afraid.

483
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Tang Yun Xiaofang.

484
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,840
Help me.

485
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Tang Yun Xiaofang.

486
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
Nu.

487
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,840
Nu.

488
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,840
Nu.

489
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,840
Help.

490
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
Nu, where are you?

491
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Nu.

492
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,840
Nu.

493
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,840
Nu.

494
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Nu.

495
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Nu.

496
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
Happy or not,

497
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
both die.

498
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Tang Yun is happy and happy.

499
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Ha ha.

500
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
Ha ha.

501
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Ha ha.

502
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
It's fun.

503
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
It's fun.

504
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
It's fun.

505
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
It's fun.

506
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
It's fun.

507
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
What's fun?

508
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
I'm not afraid of death.

509
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,840
I'm not afraid at all.

510
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
I'm not afraid of death.

511
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,480
I'm not afraid at all.

512
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,280
I'm not afraid.

513
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,040
Anu.

514
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Anu.

515
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Anu.

516
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,240
Tan Xiaofang.

517
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,280
Are you really down there?

518
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,360
Yes.

519
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,920
What's this place?

520
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,400
I'm going down.

521
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,760
The roof is moving.

522
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
The roof is moving.

523
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
Don't be afraid. Tan is here.

524
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,880
I'll keep going down.

525
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
Will you stay here forever?

526
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,880
No, I'll save you.

527
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
No, Tan Xiaofang.

528
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
Don't come down.

529
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
It's dangerous here.

530
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,880
Tan Yufan.

531
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,880
I won't let you down.

532
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,880
No, Tan Xiaofang.

533
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,880
Don't come down.

534
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,880
I can't.

535
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
No, Tan Xiaofang.

536
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,880
Don't come down.

537
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Don't come down.

538
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,880
Anu.

539
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
Tan Xiaofang.

540
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,880
Anu.

541
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,880
Tan Xiaofang.

542
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Tan Xiaofang.

543
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
Anu, I'm here. Don't be afraid.

544
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,880
Tan Xiaofang.

545
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
Tan Xiaofang.

546
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,880
Anu, I'm here.

547
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
Tan Xiaofang.

548
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
Tan Xiaofang.

549
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
Anu, catch him.

550
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
Anu.

551
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Anu, catch him.

552
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
Tan Xiaofang, are you okay?

553
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Catch Anu.

554
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
Be careful.

555
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,880
Anu.

556
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
Tan Yufan, you're a fool.

557
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,880
You're a fool.

558
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,880
Don't be afraid.

559
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,880
What should we do?

560
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,880
Anu, you're climbing up.

561
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Leave this place.

562
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,880
What about you?

563
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
I'm fine.

564
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,880
Anu, please.

565
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Anu and Tan Yufan are like this.

566
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
Anu, listen to me.

567
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Take a rest.

568
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,880
Then climb up and leave this place.

569
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
What should we do?

570
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,880
I...

571
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,880
I'm not leaving.

572
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
What should we do?

573
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,880
We can't find the two girls.

574
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,880
Boss, we've searched the whole town.

575
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,880
But we can't find the girls.

576
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,880
Princess and Anu will be punished first.

577
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,880
If they want to force us,

578
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,880
it's not easy to find them.

579
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,880
Is that how you teach the men to find excuses?

580
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,880
All the women are traitors.

581
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Where is Tang Yu?

582
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,880
He's gone to the hospital.

583
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Bastard.

584
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,880
He doesn't know where he went to.

585
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,880
I think he's not very likely.

586
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,880
He's always been very good at his job.

587
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,880
He's not like the way he is.

588
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,880
I'm worried.

589
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,880
Find them back.

590
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
I'll kill you if you don't come back.

591
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,880
Yes.

592
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,880
Tang Yu, you've been working all day.

593
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,880
Is he good?

594
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
He's good.

595
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,880
My Tang Yu is the best.

596
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,880
Anu, climb up.

597
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Don't stay here.

598
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,880
Then, Mom,

599
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,880
it's all because of Anu.

600
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Anu is the worst.

601
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
He deserves to die.

602
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,880
I like your skin.

603
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
Anu, Tang Yu,

604
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
you're different from me.

605
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
Why?

606
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,880
You treat me like a brother.

607
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,880
You treat me like a sister.

608
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,880
But I treat you as my lover.

609
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
You love me?

610
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,880
Don't say that.

611
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
Hurry up. I can't stand it anymore.

612
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
You have to hold on.

613
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
You can't die.

614
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
I'll find someone to save you.

615
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
I want to marry you.

616
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,880
What?

617
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,880
I want to marry Tang Yu.

618
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,880
Tang Yu.

619
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,880
My son,

620
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,880
you must hold on.

621
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,880
I'll save you.

622
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,880
Anu.

623
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
Open the door.

624
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,880
Don't be afraid.

625
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,880
I'm sorry.

626
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,880
I'm sorry.

627
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
I'm sorry.

628
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,880
I'm sorry.

629
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,880
I'm sorry.

630
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,880
If you have a future,

631
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,880
I'll marry you.

632
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,880
If you have a future,

633
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,880
I'll be with you.

634
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,880
I'm sorry.

635
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,880
I'm sorry.

636
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,880
Master Shen said that

637
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,880
I'll beat Uncle Di and Uncle Di to death.

638
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,880
No.

639
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
Maybe you won't go to heaven.

640
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,880
But what if Di Yu...

641
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,880
Don't be afraid.

642
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,880
I'll take care of you.

643
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,880
Anu.

644
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,880
Yizi.

645
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,880
I'm sorry.

646
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,880
I'll take care of you.

647
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
I'll come back to you.

648
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
I'll be back.

649
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,880
I'm sorry.

650
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,880
I'll be back.

651
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
I'm sorry.

652
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,880
I'm sorry.

653
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,880
I'll be back.

654
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,880
I'll take care of you.

655
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,880
How about a drink?

656
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,880
Fine.

657
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,880
You're so violent!

658
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,880
Are you all right?

659
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,880
I'm fine.

660
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,880
Do you want to try?

661
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
I'll help you.

662
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,880
Are you all right?

663
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
I said you're not all right.

664
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,880
You're just like this.

665
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,880
You're just like this.

666
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,880
You're just like this.

667
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,880
I haven't learned anything.

668
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,880
You should try it.

669
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,880
I'll find a doctor to help you.

670
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
Where's the village?

671
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,880
It's in the mountains.

672
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,880
There's a white river village.

673
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,880
You're so injured.

674
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,880
I'm wronged.

675
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,880
I didn't do anything.

676
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
He's biting me.

677
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,880
Think about it.

678
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,880
Did you hurt your fox before?

679
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
Fox?

680
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,880
Yes.

681
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,880
Everything in the world has its own reason.

682
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,880
God loves every kind of life.

683
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,880
But he's a monster.

684
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,880
How can he talk to a human?

685
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:56,880
Your leg is a sign that you can't watch the outside world.

686
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,880
I'm sorry.

687
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,880
I'm sorry.

688
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,880
I'm sorry.

689
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,880
I'm sorry.

690
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,880
I'm sorry.

691
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,880
I'm sorry.

692
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,880
I'm sorry.

693
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,880
I'm sorry.

694
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,880
I'm sorry.

695
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,880
I'm sorry.

696
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
I'm sorry.

697
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,880
I'm sorry.

698
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
I'm sorry.

699
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,880
I'm sorry.

700
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,880
I'm sorry.

701
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,880
I'm sorry.

702
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,880
I'm sorry.

703
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,880
I'm sorry.

704
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,880
I'm sorry.

705
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,880
I'm sorry.

706
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,880
I'm sorry.

707
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,880
I'm sorry.

708
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,880
I'm sorry.

709
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,880
I'm sorry.

710
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,880
I'm sorry.

711
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,880
I'm sorry.

712
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,880
I'm sorry.

713
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,880
I'm sorry.

714
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,880
I'm sorry.

715
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,880
I'm sorry.

716
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,880
I'm sorry.

717
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,880
Shan.

718
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,880
Shan, what's wrong?

719
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,880
Help!

720
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,880
Help!

721
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,880
Help!

722

Help me!

725
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,880
Help!

726
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,880
Help!

727
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,880
Help!

728
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,880
Help!

729
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,880
Help!

730
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,880
Help!
