1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,400
Leave here

2
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,600
The But Pulled

3
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,440
Episode 06

4
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,740
Oh, such a nice yeast.

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Why do you have it here?

6
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,180
Bitter egg!

7
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,180
Isn't this the Purple Gold Fox of the Dragon Pond?

8
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,180
I didn't expect that we saved him once.

9
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,180
He is still a skilled robber.

10
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,180
I think this Purple Gold Fox

11
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,180
might be his life curse.

12
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,180
I think he should have died long ago.

13
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,180
How is that possible?

14
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,180
He has become a bunch of white bones.

15
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,180
He needs at least a short time.

16
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,180
He is a commoner.

17
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,180
Don't you understand?

18
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,180
You are wrong.

19
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,180
If he died long ago,

20
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,180
his hands and luggage would have been gone long ago.

21
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,180
I think he should have died

22
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,180
less than an hour ago.

23
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,180
But why did he become like this

24
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,180
in such a short time?

25
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,180
This mud-headed fox

26
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,180
has a smell of sour and sour.

27
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,180
I think he should have died

28
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,180
of poison or some kind of monster.

29
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,180
His wife

30
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,180
is still watching him at home.

31
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,180
This monster

32
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,180
shouldn't have gone far away.

33
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,180
I think there might be danger nearby.

34
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,180
Chief,

35
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,180
when we go to South Zhao State,

36
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,180
we will pass through Chang'an.

37
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,180
Let's help him once more.

38
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,180
We will

39
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,180
take this mud-headed fox

40
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,180
to his wife's hand.

41
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,180
Okay.

42
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,180
But be careful on the way.

43
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,180
Let me do it.

44
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,180
Let me do it.

45
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,180
Sit down.

46
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,180
If you don't rest,

47
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,180
the baby will rest too.

48
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,180
Leave those things to them.

49
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,180
Okay.

50
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,180
Be good.

51
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,180
I will go find something delicious

52
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,180
for you.

53
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,180
Okay?

54
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,180
Miss,

55
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,180
do you know

56
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,180
Zhao Ling'er?

57
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,180
I mean,

58
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,180
do you know

59
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,180
a young man named Li Xiaoyao?

60
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,180
Who is he?

61
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,180
Yesterday,

62
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,180
a young man named Li Xiaoyao

63
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,180
came to see a girl.

64
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,180
He said he is Zhao Ling'er.

65
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,180
Your Highness,

66
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,180
let me say something.

67
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,180
Get up.

68
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,180
You should go find Li Xiaoyao.

69
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,180
I won't.

70
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,180
I won't see him again.

71
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,180
I won't see him again.

72
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,180
Miss,

73
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,180
it's too much.

74
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,180
Why do you say that?

75
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,180
I have forgotten

76
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,180
the past.

77
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,180
I just want to go back to Nanzhao as soon as possible.

78
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,180
I want to do something for my people.

79
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,180
This is the blessing of my people.

80
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,180
I will do my best.

81
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,180
You must understand.

82
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,180
You can only do your best

83
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,180
to accomplish everything.

84
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,180
You must face

85
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,180
your own problems

86
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,180
and get rid of your worries.

87
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,180
Actually,

88
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,180
Li Xiaoyao has been looking for you.

89
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,180
It's because

90
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,180
you don't have a clear answer.

91
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,180
This answer

92
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,180
is not only for Li Xiaoyao,

93
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,180
but also for the fate of all people

94
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,180
in Nanzhao.

95
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,180
I understand.

96
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,180
You are right.

97
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,180
The country has entered the age of crisis.

98
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,180
If you go back to your country

99
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,180
with the love of the princess,

100
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,180
you can't risk your life

101
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,180
to vent your worries.

102
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,180
After the country,

103
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,180
the life of the people

104
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,180
is in danger.

105
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,180
You are still hesitating.

106
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,180
Why don't you go back to your country

107
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,180
with Li Xiaoyao

108
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,180
and live your life with her?

109
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,180
I will report to His Majesty

110
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,180
that you are dead.

111
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
I can't let you

112
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,180
escape from this painful fate.

113
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,180
I won't go.

114
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,180
I have made my decision.

115
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,180
I will go back to my country with Li Xiaoyao.

116
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,180
You are here.

117
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,180
You are here.

118
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,180
I won't hurt you.

119
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
Let me out.

120
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,180
You are so cute, little baby.

121
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,180
Really?

122
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,180
I am only four years old.

123
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,180
You are only four years old.

124
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,180
You are so old.

125
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,180
How many times do you eat wild fruit?

126
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,180
I don't eat it.

127
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,180
Why are you so nice to me?

128
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,180
Why should I be nice to you?

129
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,180
Because

130
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,180
I am not human.

131
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,180
Then what are you?

132
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,180
I am

133
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,180
a good tea-talker.

134
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,180
Don't eat it.

135
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,180
Why?

136
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,180
Because my mother

137
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,180
poisoned all the wild fruit

138
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,180
that she gave me.

139
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,180
Poisoned?

140
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,180
Why did she poison it?

141
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,180
My mother said

142
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,180
all men in the world

143
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,180
are bad guys.

144
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,180
She wants to kill them.

145
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,180
Kill them?

146
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,180
Why are you so fierce?

147
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,180
No, my mother

148
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,180
loves me a lot.

149
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,180
That's good.

150
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,180
I want to tell you

151
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,180
that my name is Anu.

152
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,180
Thank you for telling me

153
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,180
that I would die if I didn't.

154
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,180
No need to thank me.

155
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,180
Let's be good friends.

156
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,180
Good friends.

157
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,180
That's great.

158
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
Where is the princess?

159
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,180
Didn't I tell you

160
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,180
that you shouldn't run around?

161
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,180
I won't run around.

162
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,180
If you

163
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,180
cause any trouble again

164
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,180
and cause the princess to be in danger,

165
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,180
I will be polite to you.

166
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,180
The princess won't hit me.

167
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,180
I will hit you now.

168
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,180
Where is the princess?

169
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,180
She needs to be quiet.

170
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,180
Don't disturb her.

171
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,180
Sit down.

172
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,180
I won't.

173
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
I will go to the tree with you.

174
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,180
What's the matter?

175
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,180
You are so fierce.

176
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,180
You are a coward.

177
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,180
Do you know

178
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,180
there is a demon in the tree?

179
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,180
His son said

180
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,180
that he is the most painful man.

181
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,180
I don't kill people.

182
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,180
I don't do anything bad

183
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,180
to make the princess feel so bad.

184
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,180
Be careful.

185
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,180
What are you doing?

186
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,180
Sit here.

187
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,180
Sister.

188
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,180
Sister.

189
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,180
It's dangerous

190
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,180
to be in such a deserted place.

191
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,180
Did you face any difficulties?

192
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,180
Why?

193
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,180
Why do you love someone?

194
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,180
You should say that.

195
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,180
Sister.

196
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,180
Can I help you?

197
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,180
I want to take care of my husband.

198
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,180
You are leaving with him?

199
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,180
No.

200
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,180
He abandoned me.

201
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,180
Why?

202
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,180
You

203
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,180
actually love another woman.

204
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,180
Since he is not loyal to you,

205
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,180
why do you want to see him?

206
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,180
You must kill him.

207
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,180
You must take his heart out

208
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,180
and take him to my son.

209
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,180
I am scaring you.

210
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,180
Is it really serious?

211
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,180
If you love someone,

212
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,180
but he is a demon,

213
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,180
forget all the past sad things

214
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,180
and love another woman.

215
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,180
What will you do?

216
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,180
You are not a human.

217
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
I am a human.

218
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,180
I am doing this

219
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,180
because of him.

220
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,180
Those men who hate you

221
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,180
and beg you for your love,

222
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,180
they are willing to do anything.

223
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,180
When the purpose is achieved,

224
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,180
they will turn away from you.

225
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,180
Don't kill me.

226
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,180
Don't kill me.

227
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,180
Come out.

228
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,180
Don't kill me.

229
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,180
I know I am wrong.

230
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,180
I am sorry.

231
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,180
Don't kill me.

232
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,180
Don't kill me.

233
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,180
I know I am wrong.

234
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,180
It's you.

235
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,180
I tell you.

236
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,180
He is a scoundrel.

237
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,180
He is so disgusting.

238
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,180
He is like this.

239
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,180
He will turn into a white bone in a while.

240
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,180
Are you disgusting?

241
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,180
I beg you.

242
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,180
I don't want to die.

243
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,180
Please save me.

244
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,180
It seems that

245
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,180
he hates you.

246
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,180
I don't know him.

247
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,180
Who said you know him?

248
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,180
We said

249
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,180
he killed your family

250
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,180
into a white bone.

251
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,180
He is a vicious man.

252
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,180
Yes.

253
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,180
The most vicious man is him.

254
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,180
Even if he is a monster,

255
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,180
he will have a reason.

256
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,180
A monster is a monster.

257
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,180
He is not human.

258
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,180
What reason?

259
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,180
Please.

260
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,180
Please take me away.

261
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,180
I don't want to die.

262
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,180
How about this?

263
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,180
I will give you half of my property.

264
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,180
You said it.

265
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,180
I want this treasure.

266
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,180
Okay.

267
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,180
I will give you.

268
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,180
And I will give you

269
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,180
500 taels of silver.

270
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,180
Is that okay?

271
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,180
Okay.

272
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,180
Deal.

273
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,180
Please take me away.

274
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,180
I am leaving.

275
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
Okay.

276
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,180
Can you two

277
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,180
wait for two hours?

278
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,180
Why?

279
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,180
There are so many things here.

280
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,180
How can we leave?

281
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,180
We have to leave.

282
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,180
We have to leave.

283
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,180
This is the most basic try.

284
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,180
Do you understand?

285
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,180
What a mess.

286
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,180
It's all a joke.

287
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,180
I believe

288
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,180
no one will joke about this.

289
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,180
I also believe

290
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,180
he really wanted to be with you forever.

291
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,180
But Tianyi is too old for that.

292
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,180
Sister,

293
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,180
you are so young.

294
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,180
Men are all defeated by your 16 groups.

295
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,180
They are all sweet secrets.

296
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,180
But one day,

297
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,180
like me,

298
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,180
you will know

299
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,180
how ugly and ugly

300
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,180
men are.

301
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,180
I trained him

302
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,180
to be a great emperor.

303
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,180
I successfully killed the Guoshan Lake.

304
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,180
I avenged the palace.

305
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,180
Then he should be grateful to you.

306
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,180
Before he saw me,

307
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,180
he was really

308
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,180
an ugly man.

309
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,180
I forced him

310
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,180
to be the ugliest man.

311
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,180
Although he married me

312
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,180
with the promise of success,

313
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,180
he lived a long life.

314
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,180
He married

315
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,180
a ugly woman

316
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,180
in the brothel.

317
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,180
Do you know?

318
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,180
At that time,

319
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,180
I...

320
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,180
I was pregnant with his child.

321
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,180
He didn't want to see me again.

322
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,180
He was angry with me.

323
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,180
He looked at me

324
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,180
every time.

325
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,180
He looked at me

326
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,180
and saw my blood.

327
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,180
The child in my belly

328
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,180
is too much because I trained him.

329
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,180
He died in my belly.

330
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,180
He didn't ask me.

331
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,180
He was still with me

332
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,180
and died with the woman.

333
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,180
Now,

334
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,180
you should know

335
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,180
why I hate men.

336
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,180
Especially the sister Liu.

337
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,180
Because I know

338
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,180
men are ugly.

339
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,180
You are so pitiful.

340
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,180
Let me help you.

341
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,180
Help me.

342
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,180
How can you help me?

343
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,180
I can remove the poison in your face.

344
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,180
No.

345
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,180
Why?

346
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,180
Isn't that poison

347
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,180
bring you pain?

348
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,180
Yes.

349
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,180
But

350
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,180
I don't need it anymore.

351
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,180
The so-called love

352
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,180
in the world

353
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,180
is the worst.

354
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,180
I don't need it anymore.

355
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,180
I want Liu Shi.

356
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,180
I want Yu Sheng to remember

357
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,180
that he made me like this.

358
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,180
He made me like this forever.

359
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,180
Why are you so bitter?

360
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,180
Because of this,

361
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,180
I can be happy.

362
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,180
No.

363
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,180
Listen to me.

364
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,180
You must let go of hatred

365
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,180
to be happy.

366
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,180
If I really

367
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,180
find Liu Shi

368
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,180
as you want,

369
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,180
will you help me find him?

370
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,180
Find him?

371
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,180
I just want to tell him

372
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,180
that I have to do this.

373
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,180
It's okay.

374
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,180
I won't chase after him.

375
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,180
I won't go to the Jijiang.

376
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,180
Okay.

377
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,180
I promise you.

378
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,180
Great.

379
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,180
But you must promise me.

380
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,180
You can't hurt him anymore.

381
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,180
Okay.

382
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,180
Okay.

383
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,180
Where is Elder Zhang?

384
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,180
Where is Elder Zhang?

385
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,180
Where is Elder Zhang?

386
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,180
Why are you so angry?

387
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,180
You want to hurt the princess?

388
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,180
Stop it.

389
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,180
What did you promise me just now?

390
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,180
Don't be so suspicious

391
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,180
about Liu Shi.

392
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,180
You are not just about Liu Shi.

393
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,180
You must do this to anyone.

394
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,180
I will remember you.

395
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,180
You can do this to anyone.

396
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,180
That's good.

397
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,180
Princess,

398
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,180
you are not a kind person.

399
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,180
You must be careful.

400
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,180
He didn't mean it.

401
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,180
I will ask you more.

402
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,180
Why did you bring this monster?

403
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,180
Didn't you see that he is pitiful?

404
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,180
I don't know.

405
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,180
Didn't you see that he is pitiful?

406
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,180
He needs help.

407
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,180
We can go back to the southern Zhao State.

408
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,180
We can't stay here for too long.

409
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,180
I understand.

410
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,180
I have my own reasons.

411
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,180
When I find his whereabouts,

412
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,180
I will be able to get up again.

413
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,180
This mountain is very heavy.

414
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,180
It is a flat.

415
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,180
We must leave here as soon as possible.

416
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,180
We can't stay here for too long.

417
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,180
I let these weapons go.

418
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,180
The purpose is to make him Liu Shi.

419
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,180
This manor is trapped in the woods.

420
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
Why are you...

421
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,180
You mean Liu Shi is trapped by you?

422
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,180
Unless he is a powerful person.

423
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,180
Otherwise, ordinary people

424
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,180
can't escape from the trap here.

425
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,180
That's good.

426
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,180
I think you will see your husband soon.

427
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,180
Mother.

428
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,180
Mother.

429
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,180
Mother.

430
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,180
My son.

431
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,180
Mother.

432
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,180
Little monkey.

433
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,180
Princess.

434
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,180
I found Liu Shi's beauty for you.

435
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,180
Really?

436
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,180
Sister Liu Shi.

437
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,180
You are the father.

438
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,180
It's him.

439
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,180
Anu.

440
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,180
Where did you find him?

441
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,180
I don't know.

442
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,180
This little friend told me.

443
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,180
My mother.

444
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,180
The woods are too big.

445
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,180
It's not easy to find him.

446
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,180
Let's see where the place is.

447
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,180
Why are they here?

448
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,180
So Li Xiao Yao is...

449
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,180
That woman is here.

450
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,180
I'm going to find her.

451
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,180
No.

452
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,180
Aren't you going to help me find her?

453
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,180
Where is that little friend?

454
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
Anu.

455
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,180
I'm going to find her.

456
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,180
I'm going to find her.

457
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,180
I'm going to find her.

458
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,180
I'm going to find her.

459
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,180
Where is that little friend?

460
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,180
Anu.

461
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,180
Let's not go to find her.

462
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,180
Princess, what's wrong?

463
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
Why?

464
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,180
Why don't you let Chen take her?

465
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,180
Princess.

466
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,180
Think about your business.

467
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,180
Don't worry.

468
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,180
I'll distract Li Xiao Yao first.

469
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,180
I'll go to find her.

470
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,180
I think I got it.

471
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,180
What a strong spirit.

472
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,180
Who is it?

473
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,180
Is it the teacher?

474
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,180
Yes.

475
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,180
Don't disturb them.

476
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,180
I'm afraid they're going to fall.

477
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,180
The head of the plague is beautiful.

478
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,180
I'll meet my mother in Shandong.

479
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,180
We'll solve the problem today.

480
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,180
Li Xiao Yao and...

481
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,180
That shameless sword-fighting Lin Yue Ru.

482
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,180
He's here to redeem himself.

483
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,180
Don't joke.

484
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,180
It's not funny at all.

485
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,180
It's true.

486
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,180
Look at it.

487
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,180
They're just scolding me.

488
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,180
No.

489
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,180
They're with Miaoyuan in the Han Majin.

490
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,180
So,

491
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,180
Lin Yue Ru is nearby.

492
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,180
Don't kill me.

493
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,180
Listen.

494
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,180
If you have anything to hide from us,

495
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,180
I'll be sorry.

496
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,180
I... I... I told you.

497
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,180
Let me ask you.

498
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,180
Where is Lin Yue Ru?

499
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,180
Ling Yue?

500
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,180
Who is she?

501
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,180
Is she with the Han Majin?

502
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,180
I really don't know what you're talking about.

503
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,180
What's the matter with her?

504
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,180
Look at it clearly.

505
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,180
What's the relationship between you and the Han Majin?

506
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,180
I don't want to go.

507
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,180
Why did he say you're a man of your word?

508
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,180
What did you do to him?

509
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,180
I... I didn't.

510
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
Say it.

511
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,180
If you don't say it, I'll kill you.

512
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,180
This monster, this ugly woman,

513
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,180
she can be his husband.

514
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,180
Think about it.

515
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,180
I'm a man of my word.

516
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,180
How can I be his husband?

517
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,180
I'm trying to escape from him.

518
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,180
I'm learning to be a woman every day.

519
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,180
Look at it.

520
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,180
It's too long.

521
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,180
I can't even change my mind.

522
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,180
You deserve it.

523
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,180
I deserve it?

524
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
That's right.

525
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,180
Anyway, that's right.

526
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,180
You're a man too.

527
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
Why did you ask me to marry a monster?

528
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,180
It's hard to make people happy by listening to your lies.

529
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
That's right.

530
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,180
So we have to go to the cave to clear things up.

531
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,180
Go to the cave?

532
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,180
I'm not going.

533
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,180
I'm not going.

534
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,180
Let me tell you.

535
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,180
If you were innocent,

536
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,180
you wouldn't be afraid.

537
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,180
I'm not going.

538
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,180
I'm not going.

539
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,180
Don't be so noisy.

540
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,180
I'll throw your gun down.

541
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,180
You're really a ghost.

542
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,180
You're here too, Li Xiaoyao.

543
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,180
Where's Ling'er?

544
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,180
Isn't she with you?

545
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,180
Yes, I'm here to see Ling'er.

546
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,180
I want to see you as soon as possible.

547
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,180
But it's not the right time yet.

548
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,180
Ling'er,

549
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,180
have you finally come to see me?

550
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,180
You said that Han Miao Gua is her?

551
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,180
Yes, it's her.

552
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,180
Take me away.

553
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,180
Take me away.

554
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,180
Don't hit me.

555
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,180
Please.

556
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,180
Look at our couple.

557
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,180
Please forgive us.

558
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,180
I don't want to die.

559
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,180
Please forgive us.

560
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,180
I don't want to die.

561
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,180
Please forgive us.

562
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,180
Anu,

563
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,180
what should I do?

564
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,180
When I'm hungry,

565
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,180
I always eat steamed buns

566
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,180
or scallion oil.

567
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,180
What will you do?

568
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,180
I don't know.

569
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,180
But I'll definitely go out.

570
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,180
After I arrive at the store,

571
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,180
I'll have an answer.

572
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,180
I'll go out.

573
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,180
I'll go out.

574
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,180
What are you doing?

575
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,180
You can't solve the problem.

576
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,180
You'll have an answer

577
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,180
if you go forward.

578
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,180
Do you know that

579
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,180
since that day

580
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,180
after that girl from Qingluo ran away,

581
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,180
I've been waiting for you every day.

582
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,180
Mei Yang,

583
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,180
don't push me.

584
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,180
You know that

585
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,180
we can't do it.

586
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,180
Why?

587
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,180
Because I'm human.

588
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,180
You are...

589
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,180
You can't do it.

590
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,180
I'm not human.

591
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,180
You're a man who can't do anything.

592
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,180
I'm a man who can't do anything.

593
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,180
Tell me.

594
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,180
Tell me.

595
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,180
You made her like this.

596
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,180
No wonder you're afraid of her.

597
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,180
You've done such a big thing.

598
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,180
You can't even answer me.

599
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,180
Mei Yang,

600
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
I was wrong.

601
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,180
You're punished by my parents.

602
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,180
I'm grateful to you.

603
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,180
You sacrificed yourself in the palace.

604
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,180
You...

605
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,180
You're great.

606
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,180
I'm a small man.

607
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,180
I'm not worthy of you.

608
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,180
Please let me go.

609
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,180
After you left,

610
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,180
our son just passed away.

611
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,180
How can you bear to leave us?

612
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,180
I'm afraid.

613
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,180
What are you afraid of?

614
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,180
Nothing.

615
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,180
You're afraid that he's not human.

616
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,180
You're afraid that he's like me.

617
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,180
He's a demon.

618
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,180
Right?

619
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:42,180
Our son has passed away.

620
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:48,180
He passed away on the day he was born.

621
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
Good.

622
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,180
I thought it was him.

623
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,180
You're still a man.

624
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,180
You're so arrogant.

625
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,180
You're so generous.

626
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,180
You're not worthy of him.

627
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,180
He's a demon.

628
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,180
He's so scary.

629
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,180
Don't go.

630
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,180
Right.

631
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,180
I'm a demon.

632
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,180
I'm a demon.

633
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,180
Stop.

634
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,180
Have you forgotten about your promise?

635
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,180
Don't blame me.

636
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,180
You're so arrogant.

637
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,180
What's your problem?

638
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,180
You're so selfish.

639
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,180
Are you stupid?

640
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,180
Is it worth doing this to him?

641
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,180
Because you love him.

642
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,180
Ling'er.

643
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,180
Ling'er.

644
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,180
I finally found you.

645
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,180
Do you know?

646
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,180
Although Mei Niang was in pain for Liu Shimei,

647
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,180
she never regretted it.

648
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,180
Because she recognized Liu Shimei as her husband,

649
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,180
so she decided to follow him for a lifetime.

650
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,180
No matter what she did to him,

651
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,180
as long as Liu Shimei returned to her side,

652
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,180
everything was settled.

653
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,180
He's a man like him.

654
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,180
He's a woman.

655
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,180
It's a pity that he's dead.

656
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,180
Really?

657
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,180
After Liu Shimei saw Mei Niang like this,

658
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,180
she never came back.

659
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,180
But Mei Niang's love for him is true.

660
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,180
She's afraid that she'll come back.

661
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,180
It's more painful than death.

662
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,180
Do you understand?

663
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,180
How could I not understand?

664
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,180
I'm afraid that you'll come back every day and reunite with you?

665
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,180
Really?

666
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,180
I saw that you were happy with another woman.

667
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
I didn't.

668
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,180
You're not like Liu Shimei.

669
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,180
You're as mean as her.

670
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,180
What do you know?

671
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,180
Ling'er.

672
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,180
You love only one person,

673
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,180
but you're against this kind of man.

674
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,180
I think that Ling'er is against Xiaoyao.

675
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,180
Ling'er, let me ask you.

676
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,180
Why do you keep avoiding Xiaoyao?

677
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,180
He's been looking for you.

678
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,180
But you don't want to see him.

679
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,180
Do you know that?

680
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,180
He's been suffering for you.

681
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,180
I've already expressed my attitude.

682
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,180
I hope that you can be with him.

683
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,180
Why?

684
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,180
I want you to know.

685
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,180
Sister, let Liu Shimei go.

686
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,180
People are like monsters.

687
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,180
It's impossible for us to be together.

688
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,180
You're not standing here.

689
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,180
You're helping me.

690
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,180
If we keep this secret,

691
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,180
we'll be in trouble.

692
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,180
So you're in the same team with him.

693
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,180
I'll kill you first.

694
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,180
Zhiliang.

695
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,180
Zhiliang.

696
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,180
Sister.

697
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,180
Sister.

698
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,180
How can you do this?

699
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,180
I won't help you.

700
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,180
You bastard.

701
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,180
You should kill him.

702
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,180
Why did you kill him?

703
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,180
Are you crazy?

704
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,180
If he's not dead,

705
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,180
we'll both die.

706
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,180
Sister.

707
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180
No.

708
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,180
Sister.

709
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,180
Sister.

710
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
Sister.

711
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,180
Sister.

712
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,180
Sister.

713
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
Sister.

714
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,180
Sister.

715
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,180
Don't die.

716
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,180
Sister.

717
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,180
Sister.

718
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,180
Sister.

719
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,180
Sister.

720
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,180
Don't be afraid.

721
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,180
promise me.

722
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,180
Don't let it go.

723
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,180
Okay?

724
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,180
Okay?

725
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,180
Sorry.

726
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,180
We've hurt you.

727
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,180
Why did you live so long?

728
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,180
Don't you feel good?

729
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,180
Is that okay?

730
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,180
Maybe it's a good thing for my mother.

731
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,180
For so many years,

732
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,180
she has been living in the pain and hatred.

733
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,180
She has been seeing herself

734
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,180
getting ugly every day.

735
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,180
She has been seeing her lover

736
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,180
and others getting hurt.

737
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:28,180
To her, death is a kind of relief.

738
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
I understand, Your Highness.

739
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,180
You think that

740
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,180
she's the same age as you.

741
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,180
But how can she

742
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,180
have a relationship with that man?

743
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,180
How can she have a relationship with you?

744
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,180
I think Li Xiaoyao is much stronger than Liu Shimu.

745
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,180
And you are not like her.

746
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,180
As for Yue Liu,

747
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,180
it's not important.

748
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,180
She won't take any action against you.

749
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,180
Your Highness,

750
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,180
since you've decided to go out,

751
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,180
you must solve all the problems

752
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,180
and make things more stable.

753
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,180
Tang Yu has prepared everything.

754
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,180
You can go to the town to rest.

755
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,180
Let's go together

756
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,180
to rest well

757
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,180
and have a good talk.

758
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,180
There is no solution to this.

759
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,180
I will go to the town to rest.

760
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,180
I will go to the town to rest.

761
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,180
I will go to the town to rest.

762
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,180
I will go to the town to rest.

763
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,180
I will go to the town to rest.

764
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,180
I will go to the town to rest.

765
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,180
I will go to the town to rest.

766
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,180
I will go to the town to rest.

767
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,180
I will go to the town to rest.

768
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,180
I will go to the town to rest.

769
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,180
I will go to the town to rest.

770
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,180
I will go to the town to rest.

771
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,180
Father,

772
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,180
prepare two rooms for the guest.

773
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,180
Yes, Mr. Tang.

774
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,180
Follow me.

775
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,940
Wipe voice and breathe

776
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:30,820
You sing

777
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,020
Wipe voice

778
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,660
Why are you so angry

779
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,900
Wipe voice

780
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,380
Wipe voice

781
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,620
Is it.

782
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,380
Wipe voice

783
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,220
Just separate them

784
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,980
Tang Yu lives opposite

785
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,540
A'nu lives on the side of Tang Yu

786
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,500
What about me

787
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,340
You can change it

788
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,780
Live here with me

789
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,140
Live in Xiangyang

790
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,420
The result, the result, the result

791
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:58,980
You

792
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,300
The cup is this

793
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,340
The cloth is this

794
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,820
Can you specifically do this

795
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,220
Lee Mongol, I will explain these to madam

796
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,220
What can you do

797
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,420
Upastun

798
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,020
The entire the world

799
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,900
Xin하

800
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,140
I not feel good

801
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,100
I don't know

802
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,100
I am the princess of the South Zhao State.

803
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,100
There are many complicated things in the country that I have to deal with.

804
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,100
In this day that I separated from you,

805
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,100
I saw clearly the feelings between us.

806
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,100
Actually, everything is because we are too young and don't know how to think.

807
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,100
Brother Xiaoyao,

808
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,100
I don't like you anymore.

809
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
I don't love you anymore.

810
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,100
If you follow me like this, you will love me forever.

811
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,100
Okay, then it's decided.

812
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
I will hold you in my arms.

813
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,100
Your cold expression will make me sad.

814
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,100
The rain of June is endless.

815
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,100
I will follow the little brother.

816
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,100
I will not believe the pain in my heart.

817
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Brother Xiaobao, you are here just in time.

818
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,100
Let's stop them from breaking up.

819
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,100
This is their business.

820
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,100
It's not what we can do.

821
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,100
Do you want to see the sad face of the princess?

822
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,100
I am afraid that there will be a little bit of you.

823
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,100
I think they should be sad.

824
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,100
I am just a little bit sad.

825
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,100
Go and have a good rest.

826
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,100
You too.

827
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,100
Why are you standing here?

828
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,100
Bring the princess back to the room immediately.

829
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,100
To deal with everything.

830
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,100
Yes.

831
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,100
The princess's room is here.

832
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,100
The princess's room is over there.

833
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,100
That's good.

834
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,100
We don't need to meet often.

835
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,100
I have the same feeling.

836
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,100
Actually I don't like you anymore.

837
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,100
Really?

838
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,100
If you don't understand, what are they going to do?

839
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:47,100
8 따라

840
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,100
Stinky egg, let's go have someaha sweet view after drinking last night.

841
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,100
Let's grab a drink as we play.

842
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,100
Stinky egg, you okay?

843
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,600
This is okey.

844
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,500
Go!

845
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:45,360

846
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,980

847
00:44:50,060 --> 00:45:00,700
Why! Why? why! why!

848
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,160
Why? Why? why? why?

849
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,160
Choudai.

850
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,440
Don't cry.

851
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,560
Remember.

852
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,760
Don't cry.

853
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,240
Youth Added

854
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,560
With your future

855
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,960
I'll forget the empty world

856
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,560
Don't say anything

857
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,960
I don't want to understand

858
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:31,560
At least I still have a beautiful dream

859
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,360
Don't say anything

860
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,160
I really don't want to understand

861
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:45,160
I finally understand that I should let go

862
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,160
Don't say anything

863
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,160
I don't want to understand

864
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:59,160
At least I still have a beautiful dream

865
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,160
Don't say anything

866
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,960
I really don't want to understand

867
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,960
I finally understand that I should let go
