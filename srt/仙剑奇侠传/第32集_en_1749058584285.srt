1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is our show.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is our show.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't be shameless.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't be shameless.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We can't do anything about it.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Go out!

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We can't do anything about it.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hurry up!

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hurry up!

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hurry up!

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hurry up!

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hurry up!

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I suspect that this time it was the sect leader who sent the order.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll immediately return to the palace to investigate the situation with His Majesty.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The situation is getting worse. Hurry up!

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hurry up!

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hurry up!

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hurry up!

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hurry up!

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hurry up!

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hurry up!

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What are you saying?

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Say it!

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Brother Yi Xi, don't get me wrong.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We were wrong.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hurry up!

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hurry up!

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hurry up!

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hurry up!

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Hurry up!

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hurry up!

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't be too much!

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let His Majesty investigate your case.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
May His Majesty withdraw.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Your Majesty, do not be too anxious.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Princess will arrive soon.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I want to get together as soon as possible.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Princess is here!

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
She's back.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
She's back!

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Your Majesty, I have urgent news to report to Your Majesty.

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No matter what, I'll talk to her later.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Your Majesty, the people in the capital are watching the Holy Gu.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Please handle it immediately.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What? The Holy Gu is my country's Holy Lady?

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Who's so bold?

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's the Moon Sect.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Princess, do you recognize Ling'er?

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No matter what you look like, I recognize her.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Are you ready?

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll go and get her.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll go and get her.

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll go and get her.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you ready?

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's go.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The hall is over there.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How do you know?

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll just go around when you change your clothes.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Princess!

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Princess, I have urgent news to report to Your Majesty.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
His Majesty can't see the Princess for now.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Why?

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The Holy Gu is being interrogated by a large number of people.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
His Majesty is rushing to handle it.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Take us there.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
His Majesty has ordered that you should wait for the Princess in the palace.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm already known by the Princess of the South State.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll tell you to go there immediately.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
His Majesty is here!

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Long live the Emperor!

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Rise!

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Who ordered the Holy Gu to interrogate the Princess?

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I just followed His Majesty's order.

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Your Majesty, the interrogation has been passed on by a hundred officials.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Is it possible? How dare you!

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Your Majesty, stop interrogating.

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm the mother of the slave.

95
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I was born and raised by the slave.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
General Nan, you just helped me to raise her.

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The Holy Gu?

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You really disappointed me.

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're doing this to poison the people's heart.

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're hurting the people's hearts.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm willing to bear all the responsibilities.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's too unfair to the Holy Gu.

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
How can he turn this crime into a crime?

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It must be a crime committed by the right-wingers of the agreement.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Don't you want me to betray anyone?

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Your Majesty, the medical law should be implemented.

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let it be passed on.

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The Holy Gu is a woman.

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't think it's necessary to be a victim.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I won't accept your request.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm coming!

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Don't touch her!

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Anu is my daughter and the Holy Gu.

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What do you want?

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
No, no, no!

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If you want to kill me, you must be alone.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't touch the Holy Gu.

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Your Majesty, don't listen to them.

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm here. You can do whatever you want.

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But you must let Anu go first.

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Otherwise, I won't be polite.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Master, is there anything wrong?

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Your Majesty, there is nothing wrong.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If there is nothing wrong, why would Chief of the Mohist School say so?

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Anu isn't imprisoned.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
How can he be released?

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I've already told everyone that Anu can be released from the Moon Sect.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
At this moment, Anu is dancing in a mess.

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't know where to go to play.

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're lying!

131
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Release Anu!

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I've seen her daughter.

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The Chief said she's good.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
She can be released.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yes, you've already made a mistake.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You should be punished for pushing Chief of the Mohist School.

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Kill them!

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Kill them!

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Kill them!

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Kill them!

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Kill them!

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Kill them!

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Kill them!

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Kill them!

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Kill them!

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Kill them!

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Kill them!

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Kill them!

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Greetings to Princess.

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Who is she?

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Who is she?

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't know her.

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
My Ling'er, you're finally back.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Father, I'm sorry that you let the previous seniors and the Holy Guards go.

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No!

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let them go!

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let them go!

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No!

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Why not?

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Why not?

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why not?

162
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
They're twins.

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
They're twins.

164
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
They're twins.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
They're twins.

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If they're going to be punished,

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
then your parents will have to bear you.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Are they going to be punished?

169
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I've decided

171
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
to ask the Chief of the Mohist School to be my witness.

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I've been a demonizer for years.

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll go to Anu's home.

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And I'll go to the Empress ten years ago.

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You can't say anything about these three crimes.

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Your Majesty,

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
you're a military officer.

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The people of the world

179
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
are all looking down on you.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You said I was a demonizer,

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
but I've been reminding the disciples

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
to love each other and protect each other.

183
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You said these were all bad things.

184
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
As for the Anu,

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
the people of the world can all be witnesses.

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
There's no way

187
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
to forget the Empress.

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm just a commoner.

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't care who's so powerful.

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's all your fault.

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's all your fault.

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Stop it.

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I've been a demonizer

194
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
since I was born.

195
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You and your men

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
will be punished by the law.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If that's the case,

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll follow your instructions.

199
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,040
Why don't we

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
take a look at his security

201
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
with our crown prince's future son?

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What's his dreams?

203
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Put a gun in his neck.

204
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Go away.

205
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,820
Our crown prince will

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,820
be punished by your last life.

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,340
the crime of killing the children?

208
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,560
Your Majesty, as you said,

209
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,960
we have over 200,000 children.

210
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,000
We all made a mistake.

211
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,800
We committed a crime of death.

212
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,120
Please punish us, Your Majesty.

213
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,160
My Lord,

214
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,720
I am going to kill you.

215
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,440
My Lord.

216
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
We have over 200,000 children.

217
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,560
We can't ignore the big picture.

218
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,440
I will kill you all.

219
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,560
Shi Jieren,

220
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,040
you are just threatening him with the name of Prince of Wuhu.

221
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,640
I don't have so many concerns.

222
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,240
From now on,

223
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,360
I will officially declare war against you.

224
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,800
Okay, Tu'er, I will help you.

225
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,040
Me too.

226
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,960
If the war is not good,

227
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,480
it will only cause the death of the disciples.

228
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,880
Don't talk nonsense.

229
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,720
I don't care what you think.

230
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:42,840
Today,

231
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,040
I must take Master and the Holy Bone away.

232
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,560
I just said that

233
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,000
everyone is involved.

234
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,960
You go.

235
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,640
I will kill you.

236
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,960
Okay.

237
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,560
Print...

238
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,400
Print...

239
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,640
What's wrong?

240
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,960
It's still intended.

241
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,040
Let's head back now.

242
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,320
Let's go.

243
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,840
Princess, don't be nervous.

244
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Relax.

245
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,240
Let me ask you.

246
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,080
I'm fine.

247
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,080
Did those people find here?

248
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,840
Yes.

249
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,480
General Nan's army is still fighting with those people.

250
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,040
But I believe they can hold on.

251
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,360
Then let's not give Xiao Yao any more pressure.

252
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,960
Got it?

253
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,320
I'm here.

254
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm here.

255
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,120
Master, I'm here.

256
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,760
I think...

257
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,600
I think it's a boy.

258
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,680
Come on.

259
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,200
Xiao Yao.

260
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,240
It's for your child.

261
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,240
I'm not afraid.

262
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,840
Be careful.

263
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
This is not going to work.

264
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,520
Look, you're all the father's people.

265
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,600
You can't take care of the child.

266
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,040
That's right.

267
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,480
Let me do it.

268
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,520
Excuse me.

269
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,480
Excuse me.

270
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,520
Let me try.

271
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,040
Be careful.

272
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,560
Be careful.

273
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,480
Look, how cute.

274
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:48,880
Princess.

275
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,080
It's just the baby.

276
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,720
Why did you get off the bed?

277
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,320
Ling'er.

278
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,400
Go back and rest.

279
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,880
Are you all right?

280
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,080
Go back.

281
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,840
Sit down.

282
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,800
I want to sit with you.

283
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,320
Sit down.

284
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,520
Come on.

285
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:58,960
Sit down.

286
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,640
Be careful.

287
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,240
Look.

288
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,520
Come on.

289
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:05,840
Hug me.

290
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:06,960
Come on.

291
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,520
Be careful.

292
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,160
Be careful.

293
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,680
This is our child.

294
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,560
Give your daughter a name.

295
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,280
Why don't...

296
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,680
It's called...

297
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,040
Yiru.

298
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,800
Good.

299
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,680
That's a good name.

300
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,840
Yihua Yueru.

301
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,520
We are always together.

302
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,920
Yiru.

303
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,080
Yihua Yueru.

304
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,320
You are my daughter.

305
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,920
You have to live a strong and brave life.

306
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,440
Princess.

307
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,280
What did you say?

308
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,240
Aunt.

309
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,920
Please take good care of Yiru.

310
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,800
Princess.

311
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,440
What are you doing?

312
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,160
There is something more important.

313
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,600
Today.

314
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,800
I want to do something for the country of Nanzhao.

315
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,040
Ling'er.

316
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,080
I'm afraid you can't support me.

317
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,760
As long as you have Yiru to support me.

318
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,800
That's enough.

319
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,600
Let me go this time.

320
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,360
Master.

321
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,160
Are you ready?

322
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
I'm ready.

323
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,600
Tang Yu.

324
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,800
You go and save General Nanzhang.

325
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:53,960
No.

326
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,000
Why?

327
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,080
The situation is serious.

328
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,320
I want to stay here.

329
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
A'nu needs you.

330
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,480
A'nu should grow up.

331
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,320
I should grow up too.

332
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,600
I don't want to be the Tang Yu and Xiaobao by A'nu's side.

333
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,920
We have to face everything.

334
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,080
But I'm very confident.

335
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,160
If we really have a relationship.

336
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,160
He will come back safely.

337
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,400
So now.

338
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,080
I want to stay here to protect Princess.

339
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,360
And Yiru.

340
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,200
I, Li Xiaoyao, have a friend like you.

341
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,720
We are rich and poor.

342
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,800
We have to save the world.

343
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:29,840
OK.

344
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,200
Don't worry.

345
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,080
I will save my daughter.

346
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:35,840
Be careful.

347
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,520
Thank you.

348
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,640
Yunqing, don't worry.

349
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,320
I won't let you down.

350
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,840
Take good care of Yiru.

351
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,720
Wait for my good news.

352
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,480
Xiaoyao, I support you.

353
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:54,880
Continue.

354
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Let's go!

355
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,380
Don't drink it. Be careful.

356
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,380
Face reality.

357
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,880
Do you know what reality is?

358
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,380
I know.

359
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,380
You know.

360
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,880
I know. You know.

361
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Yes.

362
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,380
I finally know what reality is.

363
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,380
Then face it bravely.

364
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,380
Yes.

didn't seek

381
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,500
a lantern

382
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,980
Wear the items

383
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,140
Wear the moment

384
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,160
Put the card

385
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Senior, please be quiet.

386
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,720
I'm fine. Anyway, I'm not the one in his heart.

387
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:37,720
No. I understand what he's really doing before he's in his soul.

388
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,720
I'm fine.

389
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Be careful.

390
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Yixing.

391
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,720
Yixing.

392
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Yifeng.

393
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,720
I brought the princess back.

394
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
Yifeng.

395
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
I'm not filial.

396
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
Without Senior,

397
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
there's no Ling'er today.

398
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,720
So Ling'er has always been a little girl who doesn't know how to do things.

399
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Senior,

400
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
please let me go.

401
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Ling'er has always been a little girl who doesn't know how to do things.

402
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Senior, please let me grow up.

403
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,720
I will never let you down.

404
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,720
Senior, don't worry.

405
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
I'm here with Li Xiaoyao.

406
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
The princess will be safe.

407
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Teacher, you're scolding me for being a woman.

408
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
I know I'm wrong.

409
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
I didn't follow your teachings

410
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,720
but helped His Majesty to govern the country.

411
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,720
That's why I'm like this.

412
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
General Nan,

413
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,720
do you still remember what Senior said?

414
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,720
We have to save people and save ourselves.

415
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
If we're still alive,

416
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
how can we save the people?

417
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Although Senior died,

418
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,720
he was always with us.

419
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Because of his spirit, he helped us.

420
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Senior never left us.

421
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
He was always with us.

422
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
That's right.

423
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
We can't give up.

424
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
We must live a strong life.

425
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,720
I will go down the mountain.

426
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
I will follow the teacher's advice

427
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,720
and help His Majesty and the enemy of Moon Sect.

428
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Zhang An,

429
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Zhang An,

430
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
Feixing.

431
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
Again.

432
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Feixing.

433
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,720
Do you remember how Li Yifu taught you?

434
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Where to fall?

435
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Where to stand?

436
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
To overcome all difficulties and to win the battle.

437
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
Good.

438
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
What should I do next?

439
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
What's the new spirit?

440
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
Concentrate on it.

441
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Good.

442
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Good.

443
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,720
The highest level of martial arts.

444
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,720
You are worthy of the power of the spirit.

445
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
What's the difference between human and spirit?

446
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
I am the master,

447
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
also the weapon,

448
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
the sky, and the earth.

449
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
I'm not here.

450
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,720
You understand.

451
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,720
In the past, I was just a martial artist.

452
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,720
I used to have the most powerful condition.

453
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,720
But now I lost everything.

454
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
I decided to teach my father again.

455
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,720
I only understood and understood the meaning of my father.

456
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,720
It seems that I am not here to save you.

457
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
I am not like you.

458
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,720
In some level,

459
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,720
father and I,

460
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,720
we are both a kind of love that I succeed.

461
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Good.

462
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
Remember all this.

463
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
I am proud of you.

464
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
From today on,

465
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,720
you have become a useful person.

466
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,720
Hai, you will become a great man in the future.

467
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
Yes.

468
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
Father.

469
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
In terms of feelings,

470
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
in my opinion,

471
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
Father,

472
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,720
you are too important to me.

473
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Too important.

474
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
Fourteen.

475
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Did you see Elder Shizhang again?

476
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
All right.

477
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
You have learned to be strong.

478
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
You are more mature than before.

479
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
I think you can rest assured.

480
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Although it is true,

481
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,720
I have filled the endless loneliness in my heart.

482
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,720
If you lose something,

483
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
you can't go back.

484
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
You have me,

485
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Ling'er,

486
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,720
we are all family.

487
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,720
I know you are all good friends.

488
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
I understand.

489
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
Qingqing is different from Ai Qing.

490
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
But that loneliness and coldness

491
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
must be filled by others.

492
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,720
It will warm you up.

493
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Princess.

494
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,720
You have to cherish what you have now.

495
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,720
You must have the fate and the fate.

496
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
Tang Yushan is gone.

497
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
Don't scare Yiru.

498
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Shenggu, look outside.

499
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Ling'er,

500
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
I have something to tell you.

501
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
I...

502
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
I have been thinking for a long time.

503
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Can you promise me one thing?

504
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
What is it?

505
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,720
Can we

506
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,720
complete the last bow?

507
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
What bow?

508
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
I...

509
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
I...

510
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,720
I...

511
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
I...

512
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
The bow is made in heaven and earth.

513
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,720
The second bow is made in high and low.

514
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,720
Every day,

515
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,280
I hope someone

516
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,440
to return the coldness.

517
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,720
Forward!

518
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Together!

519
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,320
Did I warn you,

520
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,720
it can be hereens pregnant?

521
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,720
Yes.

522
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,720
But I found out that love must have a misunderstanding

523
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,720
The world is still called

524
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
It's not right to know

525
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Okay

526
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:55,720
Why are you here? Why don't you come in and stay with the princess?

527
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
She asked me to come out to stay with you

528
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
Fang Chang is here to see you

529
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
She said so

530
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,720
Okay, let's practice

531
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,720
Let's find a revenge and save them

532
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,720
I'm sure you will

533
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,720
Fatty, you know I've worked hard all day

534
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
I've brought these buns

535
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
I'm starving

536
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
How dare you!

537
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,720
Who wants to go to your palace?

538
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,720
I think you want to die

539
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,720
I'll kill you

540
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,720
Uncle

541
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,720
Uncle

542
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720
Get up

543
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Thank you for your help

544
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
Have you finished your test?

545
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
I don't understand what you mean

546
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,720
It's time to tell me your purpose

547
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
You haven't told me your purpose?

548
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,720
Every stage of life has a new perspective

549
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,720
I want to know what you want to do

550
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,720
What is your purpose?

551
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Liu Meng has never chosen to be a minister

552
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,720
Because he has never believed in it

553
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,720
I've heard about it

554
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,720
I know that Ronghua is waiting for me in the Central Plains

555
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,720
But I know the true meaning of the people

556
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,720
So I want to follow you to the beautiful world

557
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,720
And let the ugly people think of me as beautiful

558
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,720
This is the best answer

559
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,720
But the answer I want to know is the answer of Qi

560
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,720
I'm so happy

561
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,720
I'm not being honest

562
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
I like your friend

563
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,720
But I can't believe you

564
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,720
Then I have no other choice

565
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
I'm not suspecting you

566
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,720
I don't understand

567
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,720
I can help you with your friend

568
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
Are you Li Xiaoyao?

569
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,720
I'm so happy to have you

570
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,720
Love is the best

571
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Love is the best

572
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,720
The world is so beautiful

573
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,720
I can't help you

574
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
You're so stupid

575
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,720
You hurt the world

576
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,720
But you can't imagine the consequences

577
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,720
Don't you believe it?

578
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
But I believe it

579
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
I believe it

580
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,720
But there is no sea-foot in the world

581
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,720
Maybe the sea-foot is not in reality

582
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,720
Maybe we should go inside

583
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
I understand

584
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,720
Why did your cousin save Li Xiaoyao?

585
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,720
And give up his life?

586
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
What?

587
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,720
I'm sorry, I almost forgot

588
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,720
You don't know it

589
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,720
What happened to my cousin?

590
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,720
Your cousin Lin Yueru

591
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,720
He was buried in the rock tower of Mount Zu

592
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Lin Yueru is dead

593
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:47,720
Shen'ai, please be my friend

594
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
I'm sorry

595
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,720
Shen'ai

596
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,720
No

597
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
Shen'ai

598
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,720
Shen'ai

599
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,720
Now I understand

600
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,720
There is a lot of love in the world

601
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Even if you're smart, you can't be safe

602
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,720
Brother Xiaoyao

603
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
What's wrong?

604
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
Brother Tangyu said he went to see Master Baiyue

605
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,720
And brought Anu back

606
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
I'll go to see Shisi

607
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,720
Shisi

608
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Why are you here?

609
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,720
Why don't you go back to accompany the princess?

610
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,720
Of course, I'll take care of her

611
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,720
But I can't save my sister

612
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,720
I've already seen her as my family

613
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,720
I'll take care of her in this world

614
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,720
I'm also very hurt

615
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,720
Let's go

616
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
What are you doing?

617
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
It's just a normal tree

618
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,720
Master Baiyue is a demon

619
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
He's been fighting

620
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
I'll kill you

621
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
You're looking at the map

622
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,720
Let's see what you've been doing

623
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,720
Kill

624
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,720
Kill

625
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,720
You've all seen it

626
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,720
It's just a normal tree

627
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,720
It's just a tree

628
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
Why do you believe in this tree

629
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,720
And not yourself?

630
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Everything is thanks to your efforts

631
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,720
I can give you happiness and freedom

632
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,720
It's your love and courage

633
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,720
Everyone, stop

634
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,720
Kill

635
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
You're here

636
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
We're going to avenge Master Baiyue

637
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,720
I'll avenge Master Baiyue

638
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,720
Give it to me

639
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,720
It's a small matter

640
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,720
I can let you go

641
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,720
Come with me

642
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,720
Brother Li

643
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,720
My good friend

644
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,720
You don't need to take my life

645
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,720
Let's work together

646
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,720
Who's your friend?

647
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,720
Actually, we've known each other 10 years ago

648
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,720
You know more than me the universe

649
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,720
We can share and share

650
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,720
We're Zhiying

651
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,720
Do you know what this is?

652
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,720
I don't know

653
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,720
Don't be emotional

654
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,720
It's an important time

655
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:05,720
All human beings are in your hands

656
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,720
I'm sorry

657
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,720
I'm sorry

658
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,720
I'm sorry

659
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,720
I'm sorry

660
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,720
I'm sorry

661
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,720
I'm sorry

662
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,720
I'm sorry

663
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,720
I'm sorry

664
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,720
I'm sorry

665
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,720
I'm sorry

666
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,720
I'm sorry

667
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,720
I'm sorry

668
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,720
I'm sorry

669
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,720
I'm sorry

670
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,720
I don't want to understand

671
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:59,720
I still have a beautiful dream

672
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,720
Don't say anything

673
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,720
I really don't want to understand

674
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,720
I finally understand

675
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,720
I should let go

676
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,720
Don't say anything

677
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,720
I don't want to understand

678
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:27,720
I still have a beautiful dream

679
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,720
Don't say anything

680
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:35,720
I really don't want to understand

681
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,720
I finally understand

682
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,720
I should let go
