1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Enough.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're here again.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Who are you?

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Who are you?

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Baby, hang him up.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Take care of yourself.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm going to kill you.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Jiu Jianshen.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What are you doing?

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Jianshen.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm dying.

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What are you doing?

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Are you all right?

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
When I wake up,

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll take care of you.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's good that you're all right.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you for saving me.

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You seem to care about me.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why are you talking to me?

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Jiu Jianshen.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Jiu Jianshen.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Who are you?

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Who are you?

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What's the relationships?

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Which generation?

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm not sure.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Jianshen.

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What am I?

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you're guilty, please forgive me.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Stop it.

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Stop it.

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Stop it.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,600
I tell you, girls like to sell their old boys.

51
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Do you think I know?

52
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Master!

53
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
I'm leaving.

54
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm warning you.

55
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,200
Be nice to Anu.

56
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Master!

57
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Senior!

58
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,400
Chief!

59
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,000
Master!

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,800
Senior!

61
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,000
Master!

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,800
Senior!

63
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
I can catch you.

64
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
I'll give you money to buy a broom.

65
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,200
Why are you so nervous?

66
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm afraid you'll get into trouble.

67
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Actually, we're afraid you'll fall into the pit.

68
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
That's great.

69
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
It's so boring to fall into the pit.

70
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,000
I've been living in the hotel for a long time.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I've been living in the hotel for a long time.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yuzhu,

73
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Chief,

74
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
there's something wrong with the wind and the lake.

75
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,800
Why don't we let him leave after he wakes up?

76
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Don't worry.

77
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,200
I'll punish you.

78
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
The lake!

79
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Wait a minute.

80
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Qi,

81
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,600
you're just recovered.

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,400
Don't go out.

83
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,800
Yes, I'll be back soon.

84
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,000
Have a good rest.

85
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
I've been living a life as a teacher.

86
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,600
Master Li and Yuru are leaving.

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,200
I'm not going to see them off.

88
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,600
I've told you before.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,800
You're not like my mom.

90
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,400
Don't be like my dear sister.

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,000
Master, I can't help you.

92
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
But you must keep this.

93
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,600
This is the peace service that you asked for.

94
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,000
You'll know if I'm useful now.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
All right.

96
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
You're getting more and more talented.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I know.

98
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Don't be so hard on me.

99
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
I have something to tell you.

100
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,800
Please remember it.

101
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,600
All right.

102
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Tell me.

103
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,200
When I see you, I must be polite.

104
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,400
He's a master of the mountain.

105
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I must be polite in every thing.

106
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
When I see him,

107
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,200
I'll take you to ask his parents.

108
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll kill you.

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Master Li,

110
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
you must be calm.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,400
Only when you're calm can you see the truth.

112
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Look,

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
you're a disciple of the emperor.

114
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,400
I don't know how you treat your master.

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,600
You're not the same.

116
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Cousin, I...

117
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,800
Unfortunately, I can't do it.

118
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,600
I just need to keep my hand.

119
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Take care.

120
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,800
All right.

121
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Let's go.

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,800
Come on.

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,800
The road changes.

124
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,800
La la la.

125
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,200
So fast.

126
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
La la la.

127
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
La la la.

128
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Don't bite.

129
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,800
So beautiful.

130
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,400
Look, so beautiful.

131
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,200
Is that the sea?

132
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,800
Look, look, look.

133
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,800
A big gold monster.

134
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,800
Two monsters.

135
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
I didn't catch it.

136
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Do you think you can catch

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,400
the thing you see every day?

138
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,800
Some things will only be in your hands.

139
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
You can't keep it.

140
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Understand?

141
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Idiot.

142
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,800
We're just stupid masters.

143
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,200
How can I be stupid?

144
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,200
I'm warning you.

145
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,600
Don't call me after you go to Mount Zu.

146
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Got it?

147
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,400
What do we call you?

148
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Idiot.

149
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
You brat.

150
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
Do you know the rules?

151
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,800
The disciples of Mount Zu are strict with their disciples.

152
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,400
To avoid the master's death.

153
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Got it?

154
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,000
You don't follow the rules, do you?

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I like to follow the rules after breaking the barrier.

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,800
Then I'll break the barrier again.

157
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
How's that?

158
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
You're not afraid of it?

159
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,200
I'm afraid of you, grandson.

160
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay.

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll call you master.

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
How's that?

163
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,200
Good.

164
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Master, what are you doing?

165
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm going back to the study.

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll find my grandson's wife.

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't go there.

168
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,200
We're doomed to be in master's hands.

169
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Okay.

170
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay, I won't call you master.

171
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
It's not you.

172
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,000
Turn around.

173
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Stop playing.

174
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Stop playing.

175
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Are you okay?

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Help.

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Master.

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Master, stop playing.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hold on tight.

180
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Look, it's so beautiful.

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's so beautiful.

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Master, why is there no one here?

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's downhill.

184
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Downhill?

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The ball is there.

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Ball?

187
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Master.

188
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Master.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Long time no see.

190
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Are you married?

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You're making money.

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Master, you still don't forget.

193
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I get it.

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes.

195
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Master, Shushan can make money.

196
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He can make money.

197
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The answer is in there.

198
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Let's go in.

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Why don't you go?

200
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You go to see the late Shen.

201
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll wait for you here.

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What are you doing?

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Take the girl to the living room.

204
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes, master.

205
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Please.

206
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You're the one who's in trouble.

207
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes.

208
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
She's the one who's talking.

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
She's not here yet.

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's right.

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Tell me.

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Let her give up her love.

213
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
She's a man of her word.

214
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Do you understand?

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
She's the one who's coming with you.

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
She's Yue Ru's great-grandma.

217
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You have someone to listen to your love story.

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You're the one who's coming with you.

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Tell me your love story.

220
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You fool.

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Who's going to listen to your love story?

222
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The one in there.

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He's my little brother Li Xiaoyao.

224
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
He's your new apprentice.

225
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I can't hide it from you.

226
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But he's...

227
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You see his face is so bright.

228
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But he's so tall and sharp.

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
He's so sharp and sharp.

230
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He's practicing my good skills.

231
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No wonder you only showed him the sword skill.

232
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He learned it.

233
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Senior.

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
All right.

235
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Since he's my disciple,

236
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
you can stay on the mountain and practice.

237
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You're the one who's playing the good skills.

238
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let me tell you.

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
First, I've promised someone

240
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
to play with him since he's dead.

241
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Second, I'm going to the mountain

242
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
to save Ling'er.

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So, Old Man,

244
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
you'd better tell me where Ling'er is.

245
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's what you mean.

246
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I...

247
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't know why you even know that.

248
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But I only know that

249
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
if you want to stop me,

250
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
even if you're so good,

251
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll give you a life.

252
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'll let you go.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But I'll wait until the 70th year

254
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and the 7th month.

255
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You...

256
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What are you talking about?

257
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Everything is just a trick.

258
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
A trick?

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
A trick?

260
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Don't think that anyone can be happy

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
when a trick comes.

262
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Old Man, I'm not afraid of you.

263
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
If you want to trap Ling'er,

264
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
just ask me.

265
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Come here.

266
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're right.

267
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You can't just tell me.

268
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You can't just tell me.

269
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm telling you,

270
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
you can't save Ling'er.

271
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's what you think.

272
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Zhao Ling'er is in the lock tower.

273
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Please.

274
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're so mean.

275
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
When I save Ling'er,

276
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll have to be a good liar.

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
How?

278
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Do you have any news?

279
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
They said that the lock tower is in there.

280
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You're going to be a monster to save Ling'er?

281
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
How would I know?

282
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That old bastard is so old-fashioned.

283
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'll have to take his skin and take his skin.

284
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Let's talk about it later.

285
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's save Ling'er.

286
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Let's go.

287
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's not too late to go.

288
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We have three guests.

289
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What?

290
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You want to stop me too?

291
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why are you talking so much?

292
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Come back and talk.

293
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Let's go.

294
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You're in the lock tower.

295
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Don't let your master know.

296
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Senior,

297
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
we're not going to have three guests.

298
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
See?

299
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
She's still a sensible girl.

300
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay, okay.

301
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You can talk.

302
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
This is the lock tower.

303
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
All the disciples of Mount Zu are in this place.

304
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But there's no one in the lock tower.

305
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The lock tower

306
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
is not allowed to enter.

307
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's because of it.

308
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Master,

309
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
you brought us here to say these scams?

310
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
No.

311
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We're here to say these scams.

312
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Thank you.

313
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Let's go.

314
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Go to the lock tower.

315
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You're not patient at all.

316
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You'll die.

317
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This is

318
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
the secret of the Mount Zu

319
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
that hasn't been out for a hundred years.

320
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You must be a little emotional.

321
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Senior,

322
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
drink more wine.

323
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You'll be emotional.

324
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
See?

325
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Okay, okay.

326
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Is it over?

327
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Can we talk about it later?

328
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
A hundred years ago,

329
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
the Mount Zu is in the world.

330
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's a blessing.

331
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The person who says that

332
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
is the King of the time.

333
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Return to the back side.

334
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
My people.

335
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Return to the king.

336
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Return to the king.

337
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Return to the capital.

338
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Return to the capital.

339
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The King of the time.

340
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The King of the time.

341
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Return to the king.

342
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Return to the capital.

343
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Return to the capital.

344
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,740
Three spear Base in torso, negative Awwiss,

345
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,760
the cure of H后人苏,

346
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,800
in .....

347
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,240
How am I to realize such an evil,

348
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,760
할些�vol是 sweetie satra

349
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,900

typed roguel

351
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,720
I bet this deal will get you all

352
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,080
All these

353
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
Perhaps it's God's test.

354
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,600
But I didn't expect that

355
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,720
Master Tai could even pass the whole Mount of Shushan.

356
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,280
Hwagen is actually a orphan who doesn't know how to come and go.

357
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,600
Shanshan has been cultivating for many years.

358
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,080
Master Tai, who is lonely,

359
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,880
has taken the support of his father with an unknown mysterious baby.

360
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,240
He took the baby back to the mountain

361
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,480
and changed it to Jiangming.

362
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,080
Master Tai passed all the blood of the Bi Sheng to Jiangming.

363
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,080
Jiangming is a man.

364
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,080
He is a man.

365
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,080
Master Tai is a man who is lonely,

366
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,080
has a long life.

367
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
He is the most profound one.

368
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
He is the most profound one.

369
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:58,080
He is the most profound one.

370
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,080
Perhaps Master Tai's destiny is because he is invincible.

371
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,080
He is not only a better opponent than his own.

372
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,080
Jiangming is like the most satisfying part of his Bi Sheng.

373
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,080
However, Jiangming is more ambitious than other people.

374
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
Master Tai is full of confidence.

375
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,080
He is able to make Jiangming into the final.

376
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,080
He is more recognized as the only blood of the next generation.

377
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,080
I didn't expect that he would be accompanied by a man

378
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,080
who is close to the door of Mount Zu.

379
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,080
The man who was the archer of the four years of his life

380
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,080
was always Jiangming's target.

381
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,080
He secretly hoped that he could have a plan

382
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,080
to compete with Jiangming on the square.

383
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,080
He was the only one who could achieve the darkness of Mount Zu

384
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,080
at the time.

385
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,080
At that time,

386
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,080
a very powerful disease was spreading in the mountains.

387
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,080
There were hundreds of people who died because of it.

388
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,080
Jiangming was so ambitious

389
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,080
that he asked Master Tai to save the people who suffered.

390
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,080
Master Tai agreed to save them.

391
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
He was the first to be a good example

392
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,080
of a powerful test before the next.

393
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,080
That's a good thing.

394
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,080
There is no simple good thing in this world.

395
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
I didn't expect that this time,

396
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,080
Jiangming would be the final one in this century.

397
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,080
Master Tai.

398
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
Master Tai.

399
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
Master Tai.

400
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
Master Tai.

401
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
Master Tai.

402
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,080
General Pi.

403
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,080
General Pi.

404
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Xiao Han,

405
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,080
Chief Elder monumental disproportion.

406
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,720
General empress is more beautiful than his sword

407
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,080
in his heart to the scholar in his systems.

408
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,600
It will be better if you eat it.

409
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,680
It's okay.

410
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Mr. Jiang.

411
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,080
You...

412
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
I...

413
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,580
Can I help you?

414
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,080
Aren't you afraid of the disease?

415
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
There's a gentleman here.

416
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

417
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,080
Your name is Fang Ming.

418
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
I'm Niu Yue.

419
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
Niu Yue?

420
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
Doctor.

421
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,080
You go over there.

422
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,080
Okay.

423
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

424
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

425
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

426
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

427
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

428
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

429
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

430
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

431
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

432
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

433
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

434
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

435
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

436
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

437
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

438
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

439
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

440
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

441
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

442
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

443
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

444
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

445
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

446
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

447
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

448
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

449
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

450
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

451
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

452
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

453
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

454
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

455
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,080
I'm not afraid of anything.

456
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
In a year,

457
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,080
the plague eventually cleared over the people of Jiang.

458
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
But

459
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
someone went back to Shu Mountain

460
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
with Jiang Ming

461
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,280
No.

462
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,360
Not allowed.

463
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,400
Why?

464
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Aunt Marchor

465
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,200
and her father are at episode 81 and 82

466
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,000
and her father is at episode 83.

467
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,440
Tell us!

468
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,160
We can't have our own family or woman

469
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,960
with tyle of men and women.

470
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,300
We can't have a Ukrainian woman

471
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,660
Why don't you send them to the mountains?

472
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,740
No!

473
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,840
About this, it's as easy as playing thawing.

474
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,380
But I will tell you neuron 114.

475
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,880
Modern Lu Ding used poison against his body.

476
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,620
Mr. Yuanyuan had consumed this disease

477
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,520
because he would dilute the immunity of the sick of the temple

478
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,920
He sacrificed himself to save thousands of people.

479
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Master, we are all in this world.

480
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,320
Are we going to let ourselves become selfish and helpless?

481
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,640
Can we still say we have the right?

482
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,560
I beg you to give me a big hand.

483
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,040
I hope you believe in me.

484
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,520
Send this girl to the back yard to rest.

485
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Thank you, master.

486
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,520
Thank you, master. I am grateful.

487
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
Yes.

488
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,520
From now on, no one can enter the back yard.

489
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,520
Only this woman can go down the mountain.

490
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,520
But her wound...

491
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
I am sure of it.

492
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
Yes.

493
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Remember, I am always thinking about you.

494
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,520
Master.

495
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
Miss Niu Yuan, are you all right?

496
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,520
Master, I am very ugly.

497
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
The appearance is the same as the appearance.

498
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,520
The appearance is not important.

499
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,520
I almost forgot.

500
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,520
I am not a bad person.

501
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
I am not a bad person.

502
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
I am not a bad person.

503
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,520
The appearance is not important.

504
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
I almost forgot.

505
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,520
Master, you are the daughter of the Daoist.

506
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,520
To be honest, I am not as good as you.

507
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,520
You should rest. I am leaving now.

508
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Miss Niu Yuan.

509
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
Tell me the truth.

510
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
I am ugly.

511
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,520
You don't like me anymore.

512
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Miss Niu Yuan.

513
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
Tell me.

514
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
You don't like me anymore.

515
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,520
You hate me.

516
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
You hate me.

517
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,520
You don't like me anymore.

518
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
You don't like me anymore.

519
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
You don't like me anymore.

520
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
Miss Niu Yuan.

521
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Tell me.

522
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,520
You don't like me anymore.

523
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
You hate me anymore.

524
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
Tell me.

525
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
You make me die.

526
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520
You make me die.

527
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,520
It's okay.

528
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,520
Miss Niu Yuan.

529
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
I am sorry.

530
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
I...

531
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,520
You go out.

532
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
I understand.

533
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Actually...

534
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,520
I am fine.

535
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
Have a good rest.

536
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
I am sorry.

537
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
I am sorry.

538
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Sorry.

539
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Ms. Niu Yuan.

540
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Sorry.

541
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,520
I...

542
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
I love you.

543
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Coming around?

544
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,120
Xie Ying is the whole world.

545
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,720
Xie Ying.

546
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,920
You and I are the whole world.

547
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,120
I'm sincere to you.

548
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,720
I believe you are the same.

549
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
I was too stubborn.

550
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,520
I was too stubborn.

551
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
I don't understand.

552
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,520
I just know that we are together.

553
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
This is the most real thing.

554
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Sir.

555
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,520
Do you like women?

556
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,640
Could you...

557
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,720
look at me?

558
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,420
To wait for the morning...

559
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,720
!

560
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,820
If you cannot destroy...

561
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,720
I'll kill you.

562
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,120
Open thefulness of life!

563
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,620

564
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,820
I'll kill you as you say!

565
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,620
I..

566
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,220
��....

567
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,620
No other choice!

568
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,560

Mycz the Hyp egg

00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,420
Everyone, take care

572
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,120
Yes

573
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,460
Get out of the way!

574
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,060
Yes.

575
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,180
I'm sorry, sir.

576
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,180
Who are you?

577
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,220
Sir, you...

578
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,460
Are you a human or a demon?

579
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,540
Dad...

580
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,820
Not like that.

581
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,340
But you're heartbroken.

582
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,620
I beg your pardon.

583
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,980
I beg you, please forgive me.

584
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,760
Su, you…

585
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,860
On guard.

586
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,500
Master!

587
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,120
Master!

588
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,560
Master!

589
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,820
Youatable.

590
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,660
Zongzi.

591
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,900
Listen.

592
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,740
Zongzi.

593
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,420
Zongzi.

594
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,100
Zongzi.

595
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,900
I've already become a relative to Miss Niuyuan.

596
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,300
What?

597
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,900
Master, I'm willing to be punished.

598
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,900
Do you know what you're doing?

599
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,500
What kind of punishment do you want to be punished?

600
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,300
You've been punished for a long time.

601
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,300
After 49 days, you've been expelled from the sect.

602
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,300
You can't go back to Mount Shu again.

603
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,300
You can't even mention the word Mount Shu.

604
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,700
You can't practice the martial arts of Mount Shu.

605
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,300
Wrong.

606
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,300
You're committing a crime of death.

607
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,300
It's a crime of death!

608
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,500
It's all because of this ungrateful woman.

609
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,500
She's a monster!

610
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,700
Master, I'm willing to be punished.

611
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,700
I'll be punished for everything.

612
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,900
Master!

613
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,300
Master, please help me!

614
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,300
Help me!

615
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,300
Master!

616
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,300
Master!

617
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,100
You know that I'm a monster.

618
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,700
You still love me so much?

619
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,900
This is love.

620
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,300
It's also a fact.

621
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,700
We're in love.

622
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,300
Why do you have to think so much?

623
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:23,500
Little Ghost, you've finally become a ghost.

624
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,300
Master, what's wrong with Jiang Ming?

625
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,300
What's the lesson of Mount Shu?

626
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:46,300
What do you want to follow in the cultivation of the Taoism?

627
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,300
I've taught you for 20 years.

628
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,300
What have you learned?

629
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,300
Say it!

630
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,300
Say it!

631
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,300
You...

632
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,300
Now, you...

633
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,300
Now, you...

634
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,300
Now, you...

635
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,300
Now, you...

636
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,800
Now, you...

637
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,700
The people of the world are all in the same boat.

638
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,300
The people of the world are all in the same boat.

639
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,900
The people of the world are all in the same boat.

640
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,700
The people of the world are all in the same boat.

641
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,700
The people of the world are all in the same boat.

642
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,300
The people of the world are all in the same boat.

643
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,700
The people of the world are all in the same boat.

644
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:58,700
The People of the World

645
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:26,700
The sky disappears

646
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,700
Don't say anything

647
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,700
I don't want to understand

648
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:40,700
At least I still have a beautiful dream

649
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,700
Don't say anything

650
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,700
I really don't want to understand

651
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:53,700
I finally understand that I should let go

652
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,700
Don't say anything

653
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,700
I don't want to understand

654
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:07,700
At least I still have a beautiful dream

655
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,700
Don't say anything

656
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,700
I really don't want to understand

657
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:20,700
I finally understand that I should let go
