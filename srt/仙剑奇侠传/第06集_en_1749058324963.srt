1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The whiteè‰².

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Who are you?

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,680
White.

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,600
wait for me.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I want to be a little bit more serious.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can't get out of this bad girl.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Good girl!

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What?

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I want to bet on you.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What?

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Look, we'll pick the one who wins first.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The loser will be the one who wins first.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What?

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The one who wins first.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Fine, who's afraid?

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I win.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You win?

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Look, my foot is in your shadow.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're kidding.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, I don't have your shadow.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's for your health.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Here, I got the bandage.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Take it.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Put down the fruit.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Go, go.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Go.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Go.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Hurry up.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Go, go.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Be careful.

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Come on, take it.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Come on.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Come on.

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I got it.

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Here it comes.

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I got it.

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hey, don't you dare to hit me.

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm done for.

56
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Look.

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're lying to me.

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Where are you running?

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Miss Zhao, these tonics are my good fortune.

60
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm really grateful for your care.

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm not qualified to say these.

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Miss Zhao, to be honest, I have a request.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No matter what, I'll keep it as long as I can do it.

64
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Miss Zhao, I'm a martial artist.

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I won't be silent.

66
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Although I admire you for your different temperament and style,

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I think you have a good fortune.

68
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But...

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I miss you, please leave me.

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're really kind.

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
To be honest, Li Xiaoyao won the competition.

72
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I should be with her.

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I understand.

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
As long as Miss Zhao agrees to leave,

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll send someone to escort Miss Zhao back to Gu Xiang.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I won't take care of Miss Zhao.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You can think about it.

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay?

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay.

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll leave you to it.

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Lianming.

82
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes.

83
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Lianming.

84
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes.

85
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Lianming.

86
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes.

87
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Miss Lianming.

88
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Thank you.

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Let me ask you.

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What's the fastest thing in the world?

91
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's thinking.

92
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Wrong.

93
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's crazy.

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You're wrong.

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Do you think it's crazy?

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
No.

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's crazy.

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's not crazy.

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But there's a little time for it.

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But it's thought.

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There's no place to go.

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There's nothing to do.

103
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You can think about it.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
My cousin is a bit more considerate than you.

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're not like others.

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sure he's a bad guy.

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Remember him.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He's right.

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Xiaoyao, stop talking.

110
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I want to say.

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Lianming.

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I want to see the real face of this guy.

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He's jealous of you.

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He's not.

115
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Miss Lianming.

116
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't go in.

117
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I know your mood.

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Don't pretend to be nice to me.

119
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't know.

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's your cousin.

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't go in.

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're a pervert.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You're trying to get me in.

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Xiaoyao.

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Why do you say that?

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Lianming.

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I won't be wrong.

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I've been in the Yunlun Inn for years.

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I've never seen anyone who's so noble.

130
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Mr. Li.

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I hope you can control your emotions.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He's a good guy.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He's trying to get my cousin in.

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You...

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Brother Jingyuan is a good guy.

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're the one who made him watch the show.

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What rice did you give him?

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Why does he keep talking to you?

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Mr. Li.

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There's always a limit.

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Take it.

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Look.

143
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He's in the circle.

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Xiaoyao.

145
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Stop talking.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't like you.

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Are you mad at me?

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You're so annoying.

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm helping you.

150
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Shut up.

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's not your business.

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Please respect yourself.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're a pervert.

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I won't let you get Ling'er.

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Stop it.

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Miss Ling'er.

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Don't be angry.

158
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Mr. Li is also a pervert.

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He'll be in trouble.

160
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I...

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't need your fake words.

162
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
When did you become so annoying?

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Fine.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You...

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You're a pervert.

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Do you like this bag?

168
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You're too much.

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

170
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You can bully my cousin.

171
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You can insult me.

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You can do anything you want.

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But Miss Ling'er is your lover.

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You say that.

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Not only insults yourself.

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You insult her.

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're insulting me.

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You're insulting yourself.

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't understand.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't understand.

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'll teach you a lesson today.

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Do you want to fight?

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm afraid you won't make it.

184
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Go out.

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

186
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Brother Jingyuan.

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I know you're doing this for my own good.

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But you don't need to do this.

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're my friend.

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I must make you angry.

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You can't defeat her.

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Don't be so mean.

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What are you doing?

194
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Come out.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

199
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Don't be so impulsive.

200
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Can you stop fighting?

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Don't worry about this.

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Cousin.

203
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Miss Ling'er.

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You can rest.

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Fight.

206
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What's wrong with you?

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't worry.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm fine.

209
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
How?

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll get you a rope.

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
pole

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,780
You want to fight with a tongue-rigging

213
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
pada

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Can I use the rope?

215
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'll let you have a fight.

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You use the sword.

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I use the sword?

218
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Are you insulting me?

219
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes.

220
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll win her.

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Not here.

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Brother.

223
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Brother.

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Are you okay?

225
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You bastard.

226
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You bully my cousin.

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
She can't stand it.

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Nan Nan Nan.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You see?

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
She's the one who's not good at it.

231
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's none of my business.

232
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You're too much.

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What did I do wrong?

234
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You did everything wrong.

235
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Brother Jian Yun is our friend.

236
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
How can you be like this?

237
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't have a friend like her.

238
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't care about you.

239
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Ling'er.

240
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Ling'er.

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't come with me.

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
How's the victory?

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't want to be a loser.

244
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Are you a loser?

245
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Can you talk so much?

246
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Shut up.

247
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Don't say it.

248
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I lost.

249
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Brother.

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What did I do wrong?

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What's wrong?

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Did I do wrong too?

253
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll show you the truth.

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You don't know me.

255
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm a flower.

256
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm a water.

257
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm a water.

258
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm a flower.

259
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I knew it long ago.

260
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Why did I have to wait for you?

261
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That dream.

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Where are you going?

263
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Ling'er.

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,500
What did you do wrong?

265
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The dream is true.

266
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Because of your courage,

267
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I was too insert and outdated.

268
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
All three of us have a JosÃ© to crush on

269
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,840
How could this happen to me

270
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,760
å‘€ Adam An

271
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,760
Jest

272
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,760
I feel so sick and sick.

273
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,760
I feel so weak.

274
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
You should be more patient.

275
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,760
If you want to be a great man, you should be strong and strong.

276
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,760
You can't achieve great things without strong power.

277
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Good.

278
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,760
So I decided to learn martial arts with you.

279
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
You're so cunning.

280
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
I'm asking you.

281
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Do you want to be your best friend?

282
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,760
I can't deny that.

283
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Fine.

284
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
I'll accept your offer.

285
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
You can do that.

286
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,760
Do you have other conditions?

287
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
Good boy.

288
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
You're so clever.

289
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Come on.

290
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,760
Mr. Li, tea.

291
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Anything else?

292
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Yes.

293
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
What?

294
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Are you stupid or stupid?

295
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,760
I'm sorry.

296
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,760
I thought it was sincerity.

297
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,760
Do you want me to be a man?

298
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,760
I don't know how many times I've told you.

299
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,760
I'll tell you what's most important.

300
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
You're a fool.

301
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,760
You're a fool.

302
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
You're a fool.

303
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
I'm not a fool.

304
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Mr. Li, please teach me.

305
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,760
Mr. Li, please teach me.

306
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,760
When will we start?

307
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
You guess.

308
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,760
After 3, 5, 7, 8 days.

309
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
What?

310
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
You've lost your face.

311
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
You're a fool.

312
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
If you want to be a man,

313
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,760
you need a long time.

314
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
You need to be a man.

315
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,760
You can't hide it.

316
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Understand?

317
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Ling'er.

318
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Ling'er.

319
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Ling'er.

320
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
Why are you angry?

321
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
Ling'er.

322
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
Mr. Li, you're late.

323
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
You're so busy.

324
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
You're so busy.

325
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,760
We can live in the island for years.

326
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,760
You can stay.

327
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
Others can leave.

328
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Others can leave? Why?

329
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,760
We can just take this and your sword.

330
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
Is that okay?

331
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
Let's go.

332
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,760
Come on.

333
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
Ling'er, you're so annoying.

334
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
You're so annoying.

335
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
How are we going to practice today?

336
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
What?

337
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
We can't stay in the place of fireworks.

338
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Besides, the moon is in the sky.

339
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
You're still thinking about the bad girl?

340
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,760
What's the most important thing in the world?

341
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,760
I think it's the flying fox.

342
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
Flying fox.

343
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
Flying fox.

344
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
And the knife.

345
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
Enough.

346
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
I'm telling you.

347
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
The most important thing is to be cool.

348
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Cool?

349
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
I'm telling you.

350
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,760
You're studying and writing.

351
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,760
Including me, the bad girl.

352
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
Is it for what?

353
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
It's just for being cool.

354
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Life is so simple.

355
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,760
You've been studying too much.

356
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,760
Don't think too much.

357
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
I just want to teach you a lesson.

358
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
Come on.

359
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
Have a drink with me.

360
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,760
Okay.

361
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Let's drink.

362
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
Okay.

363
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Let's have some Yaxin.

364
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
Okay.

365
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
A cup of wine.

366
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
A few pieces of love.

367
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,760
Don't be too much.

368
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
A cup of wine.

369
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
I don't know how to do it.

370
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
A thousand taels of gold.

371
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
A thousand taels of silver.

372
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,760
All belong to me.

373
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
What's the matter?

374
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
What's the matter?

375
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
You're so honest.

376
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
You're right.

377
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Of course.

378
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
One more.

379
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Okay.

380
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
I'm so proud of myself.

381
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,760
I'm so proud of myself.

382
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,760
I'm just waiting for the heart to be at ease.

383
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,760
You're thinking of the bad girl again.

384
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
Come on.

385
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
Listen to me.

386
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Okay.

387
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Come here.

388
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
Make more beautiful girls.

389
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,760
The round face only loves the pig's tail.

390
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
That's good.

391
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
That's good.

392
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,760
Of course.

393
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
Wait for me.

394
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,760
A life for saving people.

395
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,760
A life for making a good meal.

396
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
That's good.

397
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,760
I've got the book.

398
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Let's drink it.

399
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Come on.

400
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Master, come again next time.

401
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Wait for me.

402
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
I'm waiting for you.

403
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
Don't forget us.

404
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
So long.

405
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Master Li.

406
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Master Li.

407
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
Didn't you say you can drink a lot?

408
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
You...

409
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,760
You...

410
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
I can't drink anymore?

411
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,760
No.

412
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
Listen to me.

413
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
Okay.

414
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Tell me.

415
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,760
You...

416
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,760
Don't tell Ling.

417
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,760
You mean tonight?

418
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,760
I can't tell you.

419
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
I see.

420
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
A man's word...

421
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,760
It's hard to say.

422
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
A man's word is hard to say.

423
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
It's harder to say.

424
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
Master Li.

425
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
It's so late.

426
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
What's the matter?

427
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
What happened?

428
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,760
About tonight...

429
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,760
Don't tell Ling.

430
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
I see.

431
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
I see.

432
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
I see.

433
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
I see.

434
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Let me tell you.

435
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
A woman...

436
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,760
is troublesome.

437
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
I see.

438
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Master Li.

439
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
I'll take you to your room.

440
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
Good boy.

441
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,760
I'll teach you a lesson tonight.

442
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
What?

443
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
Tonight?

444
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
I'm so happy.

445
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
Master, let's wait till tomorrow.

446
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Let's practice better.

447
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
You're a big man.

448
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Tomorrow is tomorrow.

449
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Be nice.

450
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Come on.

451
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
What?

452
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
You've prepared everything for me and Brother Xiaoyao.

453
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
You want us to leave?

454
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Why change your mind?

455
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Don't worry.

456
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,760
I'll let you go.

457
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760
I'll let you go.

458
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
But I'll wait until you and my family

459
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
get married.

460
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Let's split up.

461
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
Let's practice.

462
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
The first move.

463
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,760
The world will be full of monsters.

464
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,760
You're rich.

465
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,760
I'll take you as my disciple.

466
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,760
Master Li, what's the move?

467
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
White paper.

468
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,760
I'll take you to your room.

469
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,760
I'll take you to your room.

470
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
I'll take you as my disciple.

471
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
Wait.

472
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,760
Master Li, open the door.

473
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
Let me out.

474
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
What's going on?

475
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
He's gone.

476
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,760
Master Li, you're not good at eating or sleeping.

477
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
You should sleep at a proper place.

478
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
What's wrong?

479
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
I'm not good at eating or sleeping.

480
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
Master Li.

481
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
Master Li.

482
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Brother Biao.

483
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,760
Brother Biao.

484
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
Miss Li.

485
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
What's wrong with her?

486
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
She's gone.

487
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
What?

488
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,760
Jingyuan, what happened?

489
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,760
I heard her shouting in Master Li's room.

490
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
I ran into her room,

491
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
so I was able to tell.

492
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,760
I heard her shouting.

493
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,560
I heard the voice of Miss Ling'er in the room.

494
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,760
I went to her room and saw a snake shadow.

495
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,160
I went out of the window and saw the light.

496
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,360
I fainted.

497
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,160
He must have taken the snake demon away.

498
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,360
You're a snake demon.

499
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
How dare you come to my house to mess with me?

500
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,960
Where is that stinky little demon?

501
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,360
That young master is still in the room.

502
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,960
You don't wake him up, you bastard.

503
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,360
That young master is drunk.

504
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,360
Drunk? His woman is not here. He can drink.

505
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,760
Don't blame him.

506
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,360
Actually, Master Li and Jingyuan are drunk.

507
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,960
I don't care about your master and your master.

508
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,560
Let him save others.

509
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,760
No need.

510
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,560
Now I order everyone in the house

511
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560
not to tell the truth about Lu Xiaoyao.

512
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,760
If he asks,

513
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,360
he will say that Zhao Ling'er left Lin's house at night.

514
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,160
Father.

515
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,560
I will arrange everything.

516
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,960
I will go.

517
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
It must be A'Qi Song.

518
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
She is coming.

519
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,160
Master Lin.

520
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,760
Why are you here?

521
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,160
Master Li, you should be aware that you know a lot.

522
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,960
You always want to marry your bad daughter, right?

523
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,160
No. I don't want to marry her.

524
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,760
I want to marry her.

525
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,720
Don't think about it.

526
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,040
I don't care if you're going or not.

527
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,240
I'm leaving now.

528
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,440
Hongyan's wife has left.

529
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,440
Do you think you have any choice?

530
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,680
What's wrong with you?

531
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,000
Don't worry.

532
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,200
I'll send her home.

533
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,680
I'll send you home now.

534
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,080
Diao Chong Xiao Ji.

535
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,320
Think it over for me.

536
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,880
I must get out of this place.

537
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,640
Diao Chong Xiao Ji.

538
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,520
Diao Chong Xiao Ji.

539
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,440
Diao Chong Xiao Ji.

540
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Let go of me.

541
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,280
Diao Chong Xiao Ji.

542
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:52,760
The King of the Five Kingdoms, Long live the King of the Five Kingdoms.

543
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,160
The King of the Five Kingdoms, Long live the King of the Five Kingdoms.

544
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,160
I'm here to announce one thing.

545
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,720
I forgot what is that.

546
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,040
Let's make golden sat fought.

547
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,880
From this day on,

548
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:48,680
This

549
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:56,500
If we lie to you secretly, do you know thatiy Peter can fuel the use of evidence against the Trump nationalist?

550
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,300
I guess it's like a murder populace.

551
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,120
But that is

552
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,420
You would like to go to droneEND...

553
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,160
Of the world

554
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,380
as the earth

555
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,880
Just Weird...

556
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,240
It's me who broke the mirror.

557
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,960
I didn't see the mirror was made by me.

558
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,840
We didn't see it.

559
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,280
It wasn't made by you.

560
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,640
We saw it.

561
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,440
It was made by you.

562
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,120
It was made by you.

563
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,280
But I saw it as made by you.

564
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,960
It was made by you.

565
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,840
See?

566
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,960
As I saw it,

567
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,280
it was made by you.

568
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,880
I didn't see it clearly.

569
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,880
Enough, enough. Stop arguing.

570
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
I know your general is biased.

571
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,880
But you can't blame him.

572
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
Your Majesty.

573
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
I haven't finished yet.

574
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,880
Today's case is a case of the general's murder.

575
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,880
I will punish him.

576
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,880
This has nothing to do with the general.

577
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Time flies.

578
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,880
It's been ten years.

579
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
It's been ten years.

580
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,880
The country is safe.

581
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,880
The people are well-off.

582
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
It's the credit of the general.

583
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Your Majesty.

584
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,880
Do you still miss the princess Ling'er?

585
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,880
Ling'er is my flesh and blood.

586
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,880
She is not a good person.

587
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,880
But as the general said,

588
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,880
every citizen in my eyes is my flesh and blood.

589
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,880
Now, the most important thing is the people of the country.

590
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,880
Time can change everything.

591
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,880
Now the Shenghu family has developed again.

592
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,880
There is a new scene.

593
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
Is it true?

594
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,880
Why don't you go to the hunting area?

595
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,880
Let the past happen.

596
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,880
Help.

597
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,880
Help.

598
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
Help.

599
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,880
Help.

600
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
Grandma.

601
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,880
Grandma, help Ling'er.

602
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Help Ling'er.

603
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Ling'er.

604
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
Ling'er is human.

605
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Ling'er is human, not snake.

606
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,880
Ling'er.

607
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,880
I'm not listening.

608
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,880
You even punished me.

609
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,880
I promise, you are not good.

610
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,880
I won't listen.

611
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
Grandma.

612
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Do you still have something to tell me?

613
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,880
Please help me.

614
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880
Please help me.

615
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
Please.

616
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Let's go.

617
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
Help.

618
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
How could this happen?

619
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,880
How could this happen?

620
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,880
No.

621
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,880
It's not like this.

622
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
Please help me.

623
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,880
This is the place where the Great Wall of Water was built.

624
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
I know.

625
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,880
Your Majesty.

626
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,880
The Great Wall of Water was built here.

627
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,880
The Great Wall of Water was built here.

628
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,880
The Great Wall of Water was built here.

629
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
I know.

630
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
But why?

631
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
Why did this happen?

632
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,880
Your Majesty, you are the one who called me a nightmare.

633
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,880
You are the one who called me a nightmare.

634
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,880
Your Majesty.

635
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Your Majesty.

636
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
Please help me.

637
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
I am the King of the Jin Dynasty.

638
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,880
I am the one who called me a nightmare.

639
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,880
I will do my best to protect the Great Wall of Water.

640
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,880
I will keep my word for the Great Wall of Water.

641
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,880
I will do my best to protect the Great Wall of Water.

642
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,880
Your Majesty.

643
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
Your Majesty.

644
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,880
Your Majesty.

645
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
Master.

646
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,880
Master.

647
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,880
Yes.

648
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
You are not changing.

649
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
You still like to talk like this.

650
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,880
No.

651
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,880
How could I know you?

652
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,880
Master.

653
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,880
You are still angry with me.

654
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,880
I am old.

655
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,880
I have forgotten my past.

656
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
Master.

657
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
I know I am wrong.

658
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,880
Please help me.

659
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,880
I will do as you say.

660
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,880
I am afraid you will not be satisfied with everything I want.

661
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,880
Tell me.

662
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,880
I will do my best.

663
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,880
I want a wise and wise emperor.

664
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,880
I want a ruler who can distinguish between the two.

665
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,880
I want a king who can be a wise and wise emperor.

666
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
Why do you inform me now?

667
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
I am not a king.

668
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,880
I am afraid you will not be satisfied with everything I want.

669
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,880
Rise.

670
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

671
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,880
How is it now?

672
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,880
Your Majesty.

673
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,880
The five counties in the east are in the earthquake.

674
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,880
I am going to distribute the disaster relief supplies to Your Majesty.

675
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
Eight provinces in the west are already washed and the mountain bandits are washed.

676
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
Please show me.

677
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,880
I have said it before.

678
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,880
You should deal with the disaster relief first.

679
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,880
Don't put the people in the water and fire.

680
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,880
Have you forgotten?

681
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,880
I am still a man.

682
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,880
You are all in the wrong.

683
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
Please calm down.

684
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,880
I have said that you should treat His Majesty first.

685
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,880
Where is the master?

686
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
He is sick.

687
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
He can't go to the court today.

688
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,880
I want you to solve all the problems.

689
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,880
If you can't solve them, don't come back.

690
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

691
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,880
I want to see what tricks you are playing.

692
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,880
Why can't I think of that.

693
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:30,880
It is normal that you know nothing about these 3 people.

694
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:43,880
How did you come here?

695
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:49,440
Go and have arÃ©e of the divine entity,

696
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,360
gas you theé¦™åœœ,

697
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,200
ray of ë¨¹ì–´ë¥¼ ë¨¹ìœ¼ë ¤,

698
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,160
it becomes an pry from the Gods that worship the thousands of beings.

699
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,340
Look here

700
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,020
Greetings, Your Majesty

701
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,700
Your Majesty

702
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,820
Welcome to my home

703
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:53,580
Last day, I accepted your invitation to

704
00:42:53,580 --> 00:43:04,820
the Imperial

705
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,780
I lied to you

706
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,440
to face our case

707
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,440
to make others live on.

708
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,800
Client, however,

709
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,500
he wanted me to make you guilty

710
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,820
However,

711
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,220
these years,

712
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,220
it was all wrong for me to do

713
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,960
We never thought of this

714
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,440
So what

715
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,540
do you want me to do

716
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:38,540
Your Majesty, you never thought about what you want.

717
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:44,540
All these years, I have completely trusted you.

718
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,540
Your opinions are all accepted by me.

719
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,540
Now you come to ask me.

720
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,540
You are so irresponsible.

721
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,540
All these years, you have done wrong.

722
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,540
You are so gentle.

723
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,540
Your Majesty, have you ever made any decision?

724
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,540
What do you want from me?

725
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,540
Your Majesty, your body is the most important.

726
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,540
Don't worry too much.

727
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,540
Don't come to this with me.

728
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:28,540
Then what do you mean by your Majesty?

729
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,540
I will do whatever I want.

730
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,540
Don't worry.

731
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,540
Tomorrow, you will have a hard time.

732
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,540
Let's go down to the next level.

733
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,540
Blood Protector

734
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:51,540
Episode 3

735
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,820
Shadow of Sombra

736
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,600
Episode 3

737
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,500
Baseless

738
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,500
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

739
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,500
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

740
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,500
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

741
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,500
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

742
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,500
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

743
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,500
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

744
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,500
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

745
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,500
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

746
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,500
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

747
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,500
Don't say anything.

748
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,500
I don't want to understand.

749
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:47,500
At least I still have a beautiful dream.

750
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Don't say anything.

751
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,500
I really don't want to understand.

752
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:01,500
I finally understand that I should let go.

753
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,500
Don't say anything.

754
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,500
I don't want to understand.

755
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:15,500
At least I still have a beautiful dream.

756
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,500
