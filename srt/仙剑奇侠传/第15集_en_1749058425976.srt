1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm not afraid of you.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm not afraid of you.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm not afraid of you.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Then I'll leave you alone.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Excuse me.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Hey.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Stop.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Someone Bean착人

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You?

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Do you know

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You want to see me?

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You want to be a girl?

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Forget it.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm not a big man.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
When did you become a woman?

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Last night,

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
a girl was taking care of me.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't know who she is.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Who knows your Feng Liuzhai?

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If I can meet her,

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I should thank her.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I drank too much last night.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't know if I should offend her.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If you drink too much,

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
you won't be able to tell her the truth.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What the hell is this?

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're a fatso.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
To be honest,

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
if I meet her,

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll say sorry to her.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Then she'll tell you.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's okay.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's bitter.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I've been drinking for a long time.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Come in.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Then drink it.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll be back.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The moon is red.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The moon is red.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So many flowers.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Finally, I feel a little bit of popularity.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The moon is red.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The moon is red.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The moon is red.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's do something serious.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll treat you to a meal.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's go.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Miss, take a look.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Miss, you're really good at dancing.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This is a great idea.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I bought it for a long time.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
How about this?

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Buy it if you like.

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This is it.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Here you are.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Did you eat it?

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Stop it.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This is a dowry.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A dowry? No way!

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're going to be her bride.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're still so naughty.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Take it.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Can't we play anymore?

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Marriage is a big deal.

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You can't do that.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Stop it.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll buy some jewelry, clothes and a dragon-slayer.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
No.

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm so annoyed.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
How can you do that?

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Marriage is the most important moment in every girl's life.

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Think about it.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're with your beloved one.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're in front of everyone.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You'll be with her forever.

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You'll be the most sincere blessing.

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That moment is the perfect balance

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
that everyone is pursuing.

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You must be very happy when you're married.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You're beautiful.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Actually, I'm not.

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That day, I was the only one who did the witness.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Although it was simple,

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
it was enough.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That day, I was still thinking about the book.

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The book is the best.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The book is the best.

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The book is the best.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This is the wedding of the Han people.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's the best blessing for the elders

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
to give the bridegroom the best wedding.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That day, Lao Lao especially made it for me.

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
When I'm married,

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
you must give me the book.

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Me?

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Why?

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The wedding is to find a happy and happy person

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
to give you the blessing.

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Princess, I'm not a happy person.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't care.

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The one who gives me the book will be the princess.

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But the princess must be a happy and happy person.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Anu, believe me.

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You'll be very happy.

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The wedding is so beautiful.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Xiao'er, you two.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You two.

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Anu and Miss Zhao.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm Miss Zhao.

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
How is it?

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This way, please.

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Please sit.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is what Mr. Tang Yu ordered.

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I've prepared everything for you.

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Please enjoy.

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's good.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Tang Yu is really nice to you.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Mom, look.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
These are all my favorite food.

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Wow.

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's so delicious.

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Try it.

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How is it?

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's delicious.

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Tang Yu is a good man.

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He's so good.

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What else?

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He asked me to bully him.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What else?

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's delicious.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm just concerned about his return.

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What else?

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What?

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What else?

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If there's dessert, it's fine.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I've prepared dessert for you.

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This is what Mr. Tang Yu ordered.

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Please enjoy.

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Are you satisfied with this?

173
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't know.

174
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm touched by the dessert.

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I can treat others to dinner.

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Everyone,

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll treat you to dinner.

178
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Great.

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What's wrong?

180
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Come on.

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Come on.

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Princess, don't bother them.

183
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You don't have to hide.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Come out.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Princess.

186
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Thank you.

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You're welcome.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
These dishes are for you.

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll treat you to dinner.

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Thank you.

191
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll treat you to dinner.

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Thank you.

193
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll treat you to dinner.

194
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Thank you.

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
These dishes are for you.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't dare to take them.

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Are you afraid that we'll run away?

198
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
No.

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No.

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Hurry up.

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't worry.

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We won't let the master know.

203
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Princess, you can go.

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We'll protect you.

205
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We won't give you any pressure.

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Hold it.

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Princess,

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
don't you think that

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
some people are always very uncomfortable?

210
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I think they both have their difficulties.

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Moreover,

212
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
these people are sent by Tang Yu.

213
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
They're very thoughtful.

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't be afraid.

215
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't hear it.

216
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I think he's a trustworthy person.

217
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No.

218
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Then what did he say

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
about everything he arranged for us?

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Then...

221
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Then...

222
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Then...

223
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Then...

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Then...

225
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Then the master and Tang Yu are very nice to the princess.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And the two who followed

227
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and the two who didn't follow

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
are also very nice to the princess.

229
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Are they all loving you

230
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and being jealous of you?

231
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No, you're talking nonsense.

232
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Then I'm asking you,

233
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
if everyone loves you,

234
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
what about Li Xiaoyao?

235
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Why are you still angry with her?

236
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Love is between the two of us.

237
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
How can you cover it up like this?

238
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You have a relationship

239
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
between you two.

240
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
When you're happy,

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
when you're not happy,

242
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
you're disappointed and proud.

243
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You always make me

244
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
feel so moved.

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I got it.

246
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Really?

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I want to kiss Tang Yu Xiaobao.

248
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You...

249
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The princess said that

250
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
kissing is a wonderful thing.

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I think I'll kiss her again

252
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and I'll know what she feels.

253
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Anu,

254
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
you have to be serious.

255
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay, I got it.

256
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Where's Tang Yu Xiaobao?

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I want to find her.

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Anu.

259
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Tang Yu Xiaobao.

260
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Anu, what's wrong?

261
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Anu, what are you doing?

262
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm doing something.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What is it?

264
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I want to kiss you.

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I want to run away.

266
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Anu, don't.

267
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Don't do this.

268
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Where should I hide?

269
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Anu,

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
don't do this.

271
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm coming.

272
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What are you doing?

273
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What are you doing?

274
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What are you doing?

275
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Get out of the way.

276
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Father.

277
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Father.

278
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Father.

279
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Mother!

280
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Mother,

281
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
look at you.

282
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Father.

283
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Uncle and Aunt.

284
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I can't believe you.

285
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You are upstairs.

286
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No, you can't get up.

287
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No, you can't get up.

288
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,800
You're so shameless.

289
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,280
Father, shut up.

290
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,160
Kneel.

291
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,960
And you.

292
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,120
I don't want it.

293
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,760
Kneel.

294
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,080
I don't want it.

295
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,640
Nu, listen to me.

296
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,600
You're so timid.

297
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,240
Why did you listen to Master Si?

298
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
How dare you!

299
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,160
You ungrateful men and women

300
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,440
have thrown our faces

301
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,720
into the lake.

302
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,880
Especially you.

303
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,040
I'm very disappointed in you.

304
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,360
I beg you to forgive me.

305
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,880
Nu, please forgive me.

306
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,200
Why should we forgive you?

307
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,600
Please forgive us.

308
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
You're shameless.

309
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,400
Father, we're not like you.

310
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,280
I've already decided to marry you.

311
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,680
I want to find a good time

312
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,720
to tell you.

313
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,080
You're ridiculous.

314
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,400
I'll do my best.

315
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,960
I won't agree.

316
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,040
I beg you, father.

317
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,680
Don't beg. I won't marry you.

318
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,800
You even like someone

319
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,760
who has to get his approval.

320
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,160
Do you think you're a man?

321
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,040
Nu.

322
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,880
Nu.

323
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,680
Calm down first, okay?

324
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,400
No.

325
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,040
You're lying.

326
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,680
You don't like me at all.

327
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,880
How could I?

328
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,680
Why did I ask you to avoid it?

329
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,760
Your Highness said

330
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,960
if you love me,

331
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,720
we'll have a good feeling.

332
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,360
But you avoided it.

333
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,960
It means you're upset.

334
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,400
You don't love me at all.

335
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,360
I don't like you either.

336
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,760
I won't marry you.

337
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,520
Wait.

338
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,600
Nu, listen to me.

339
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,320
I really like you.

340
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
Marry me.

341
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,640
Who do you choose between him and me?

342
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,200
Don't push me.

343
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,440
I know you like this master.

344
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,520
He's right.

345
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,800
I'm right.

346
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,880
If I marry you,

347
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,160
I won't do it.

348
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Nu, listen to me.

349
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,760
If you love him,

350
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,920
you'll marry him.

351
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,080
Nu, stop.

352
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,840
You're embarrassed.

353
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,960
I'll beat you to death.

354
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,720
Stop.

355
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,160
Your Highness, this is a family fight.

356
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,880
Don't fight.

357
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,280
Master, why did you object to them?

358
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,560
Because they're just making fun of me.

359
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,720
Master, I know you can't hear me

360
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,920
no matter what I say.

361
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,600
I'll use my princess' identity

362
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,480
to order you to stop hitting Tang Yu.

363
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,880
Okay.

364
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,680
From now on,

365
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,320
I won't even touch him.

366
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,200
I'll treat him like a princess

367
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,920
and take care of you.

368
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,720
Master.

369
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,120
I'll take my leave.

370
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,720
Master, what do you mean?

371
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,920
You're trying to help me.

372
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,080
You're not afraid of me being a mother.

373
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,280
How can I be afraid of you?

374
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,360
What are you trying to do?

375
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,920
You're not afraid of me being a mother.

376
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,200
Don't be so mean.

377
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,360
I'll beg for mercy.

378
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,160
Okay?

379
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,280
You have only one father in your eyes.

380
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,200
You don't love me.

381
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,760
I love you.

382
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,320
You're like your own sister.

383
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,280
But you're too much

384
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,560
when you're in trouble.

385
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,200
You're so serious.

386
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,640
It's not interesting at all.

387
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,360
Anu, stop making trouble.

388
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,320
Princess, I took you away.

389
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,440
I was afraid you'd be killed

390
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,480
if you hadn't returned to Nanzhao State.

391
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,400
I'm trying to be kind.

392
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,720
Stop.

393
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,080
Everyone, take a rest.

394
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,360
Master, I'm going to kill you.

395
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,440
I'll kill you.

396
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
I'll kill you.

397
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,760
I'm going to kill you.

398
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,200
Where are we going next?

399
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
Father, Yangzhou City is under siege.

400
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,200
The city is very secret.

401
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,000
Do you think...

402
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,600
A'Biao,

403
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,720
let's go around.

404
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,520
Yes.

405
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
I'm not going to Yangzhou.

406
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,120
I'm going to go.

407
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
You go first.

408
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,960
Hurry up.

409
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,320
Be careful.

410
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,400
Sister Ling'er,

411
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,840
is Sister Ling'er really in Yangzhou?

412
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,520
Hurry up.

413
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,040
Next.

414
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,120
If there's a chance,

415
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,560
I'll go there seriously.

416
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,960
Hurry up.

417
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,280
Get up.

418
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,720
Get up.

419
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,120
Father.

420
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,040
Let's go.

421
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,360
The seal is under siege.

422
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,840
The female thief is in a hurry.

423
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,880
The talisman is under siege.

424
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,400
The female thief is in a hurry.

425
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,840
Next.

426
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,960
Otherwise, everyone can only enter the city.

427
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,600
Open the gate.

428
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
You can't leave the city.

429
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,400
What if the spirit is not in it?

430
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,920
We're going to be trapped here.

431
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,120
Next.

432
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,280
The male and female thieves...

433
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,240
The female thieves are coming.

434
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,760
Go.

435
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,040
My family is fine.

436
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,560
What about you?

437
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:13,800
Go.

438
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,680
I'm free.

439
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,120
Hurry up.

440
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,840
Okay.

441
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,040
Let's go.

442
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,200
What's the matter?

443
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,720
Hurry up.

444
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,920
Stand still.

445
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,280
Hurry up.

446
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Hurry up.

447
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,920
Come here.

448
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,160
Hurry up.

449
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,680
Why are you so close?

450
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,080
Don't move.

451
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,600
Listen.

452
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Next.

453
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,640
This is the life.

454
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,280
There are many people

455
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,720
who are willing to take you.

456
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,960
Come on.

457
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,560
Go.

458
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,360
Don't move.

459
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,480
I'm telling you.

460
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,800
You don't have to be afraid now.

461
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,400
Next.

462
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,720
Come here.

463
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
There's a big money here.

464
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,480
I'll protect you.

465
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,360
I have a treasure.

466
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:00,960
Yes.

467
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,760
Look at the magic eyes.

468
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,560
You're a treasure.

469
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
You'll find the treasure.

470
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,320
Yes.

471
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,320
You can rest assured.

472
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,520
I'm telling you.

473
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,760
Now, the friends around you

474
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,400
are talking to me.

475
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,120
They know you're my friend.

476
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,360
They will look at you in the face.

477
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
They will give you a few points.

478
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,920
You can rest assured.

479
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,080
Next.

480
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,400
There are two big money.

481
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,280
We're in front of you.

482
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,520
I'll show you.

483
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,560
What do you mean?

484
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,760
It's a different team.

485
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,200
So many people.

486
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,880
Look.

487
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,840
They will look at you.

488
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,760
They will look at you.

489
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,800
It's so lively here.

490
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Of course.

491
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,480
It's Yangzhou's friend.

492
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,280
I'm not hungry.

493
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
Let's find something to eat.

494
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,800
Hey.

495
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,000
We're going out to find the treasure.

496
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,200
We can't find it without the treasure.

497
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
You can eat it yourself.

498
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,640
I'm telling you.

499
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,840
Yangzhou is a big city.

500
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
Be careful of the bandits.

501
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,280
You just stand there and wait for me.

502
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,120
Wait for me to come back.

503
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,080
Do you hear me?

504
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,360
Gosh.

505
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,800
I'm begging you.

506
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,720
Save it.

507
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,880
Oh, yes, can we appreciate you.

508
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,120
We are happy for what you have.

509
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,360
How many different тан讨.

510
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,560

00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,520
Four.

512
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
So many different sports RMBs for drone.

513
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,840
Cool.

514
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,800
Go see the workers inside.

515
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,380
Children.

516
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,200
They're all out ofryn.

517
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,900
You can even loop around.

518
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,640
They're here.

519
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,800
Thanks.

520
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,540
Thanks.

521
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,840
They're out ofryn.

522
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,100
Since they're out, they need to hear from the JR Hupen.

523
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,540
Come on.

524
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,020
Good.

525
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,260
I will help you

526
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,420
first.

527
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,100
Come on, brother.

528
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,860
Why are you here?

529
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,380
It's fine, come on.

530
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,300
I know it's time to debate.

531
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,300
You must have a conversation with them.

532
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,940
Stand up.

533
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,020
Come on.

534
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,780
Come on.

535
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,940
Come on.

536
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,900
It's better to stop eating

537
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Go, go, go.

538
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,900
Are you okay?

539
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,900
I'm fine. What about you?

540
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
I'm fine.

541
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,900
Then how should I thank you?

542
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Why don't you come to your mansion and have a drink?

543
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,100
Chou Da.

544
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
Chou Da.

545
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,900
Chou Da.

546
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Chou Da.

547
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,700
Chou Da.

548
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,500
Chou Da.

549
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,100
What are you looking at?

550
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,300
I'm so confused.

551
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,900
I just got in and I'm going to throw it away.

552
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,700
Happy birthday.

553
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Drink.

554
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,100
Okay, come again.

555
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,700
Come.

556
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,500
Happy birthday.

557
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,700
You lost. Drink.

558
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
Drink it.

559
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Come, come again.

560
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,700
Enough, enough.

561
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,700
Stop playing.

562
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,700
I've got your wine.

563
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,700
Okay.

564
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Let's play something else.

565
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,700
What?

566
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,300
Take off your clothes.

567
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,300
You're a good boy.

568
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,300
The fox tail is finally out.

569
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,700
No, we all play like this in the countryside.

570
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,500
Really?

571
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,100
Then where are you from?

572
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Hangzhou, Yunhang.

573
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,700
Where are you?

574
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,900
Don't lie to me.

575
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,100
How could this happen?

576
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,700
How do you know?

577
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Could it be that you're my classmate?

578
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,100
I'm not telling you.

579
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,700
I think you're still young.

580
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,900
You must not have a family.

581
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,700
You're so bad at listening to me.

582
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,900
Don't think too much.

583
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,700
I can be your mother.

584
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,300
Do you have a son?

585
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
Come on, come again.

586
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,300
Okay, I'll give you 300 rounds of battles.

587
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:06,900
Okay.

588
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,500
Come on.

589
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,300
Wash your hands.

590
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,900
Wash your hands.

591
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,300
I lost.

592
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,100
I'll take it off.

593
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,100
Wash your hands.

594
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Wash your hands.

595
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
Wash your hands.

596
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
Wash your hands.

597
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
You lost so much.

598
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
I'll win.

599
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,100
You're so generous.

600
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,100
I'm not a good girl.

601
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
You're so generous.

602
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,500
You...

603
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,100
It's late.

604
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
Miss, I'm going to rest.

605
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
You'd better go back to Marquis Qu.

606
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Your little sister.

607
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,100
Go back.

608
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
Marquis Qu

609
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
Miss Qu

610
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:36,220
Don'tMatG

611
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
Wishing to be called soon.

612
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,100
But you cast the spell to me later.

613
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,100
Gu tomorrow is New Year holiday.

614
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,100
Please allow me to tell you things.

615
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,100
This jade pendant suits your mother the best.

616
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,100
Why did she leave with my father?

617
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,100
Your father was a hero.

618
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,100
He left the south to the north.

619
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,100
Your mother can only marry a dog.

620
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
I must find my mother.

621
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
Okay.

622
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:29,100
If you want to find your mother, I'll give you two tips.

623
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,100
First, you must have a cure for your mother.

624
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,100
Second, you must have a tooth.

625
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,100
A tooth? You took it.

626
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,100
Is it a tail?

627
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,100
You were a little boy.

628
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,100
Your mother was holding you.

629
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,100
You were so cruel.

630
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,100
You were bleeding.

631
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,100
I couldn't bear to see her.

632
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,100
She refused.

633
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,100
You should have it.

634
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,100
You're so strange.

635
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,100
You have to take it every time.

636
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:08,100
The more you take it, the more you'll have a tooth.

637
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,100
You're so sensitive.

638
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:18,100
You should have a seal on your mother.

639
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,100
You can have it on your mother.

640
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
What's wrong?

641
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,100
I opened the shop when they left.

642
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,100
I went to steal and lie to them.

643
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,100
I wanted to keep them in contact with me.

644
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
And me?

645
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
Of course.

646
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
You're the same as them.

647
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,100
They're all looking for you.

648
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
You can't lose them.

649
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,100
I understand.

650
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,100
I'm sorry.

651
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,100
I'm sorry.

652
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,100
I'm sorry.

653
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
I'm sorry.

654
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
I'm sorry.

655
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,100
I'm sorry.

656
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,100
I'm sorry.

657
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,100
I'm sorry.

658
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,100
I'm sorry.

659
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,100
I'm sorry.

660
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,100
I'm sorry.

661
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,100
I'm sorry.

662
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
I'm sorry.

663
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,100
I'm sorry.

664
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,100
What a annoying guy.

665
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,100
Where did the fox go?

666
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,100
The rock is gone.

667
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,100
The rock is gone.

668
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,100
Look at my purple eye.

669
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
The rock is gone.

670
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,100
Look at the flower umbrella.

671
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,100
Look at it.

672
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
Look at it.

673
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
The bag.

674
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,100
The bag of the hot pot.

675
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,100
The bag.

676
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,100
The bag.

677
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,100
The bag.

678
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
The bag.

679
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
The bag.

680
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,100
The flower umbrella.

681
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,100
Miss, look here.

682
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,100
It's weird.

683
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
It's weird.

684
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
It's not.

685
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,100
It's weird.

686
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,100
It's weird.

687
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,100
It's weird.

688
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,100
It's weird.

689
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Are you okay?

690
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
Yes, I'm fine.

691
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
Miss, we'd like to ask a question.

692
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,100
Why do you ask this?

693
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,100
Are you looking for someone?

694
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,100
What's wrong with you?

695
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,100
I was asked to come to you by Young Hero.

696
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,100
Do you know that bastard?

697
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,100
He's just a friend.

698
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,100
I'll tell you later.

699
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,100
Where is he going to play?

700
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,100
You can't go to the inn to rest.

701
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,100
You're waiting for Young Hero Li?

702
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,100
No need.

703
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,100
We've already made an appointment at the inn.

704
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Then...

705
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,100
Let's go.

706
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,100
Look at me.

707
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,100
Thank you for saving me.

708
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
I'll eat it with you.

709
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,100
Why are you still here?

710
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,100
Eat some pork.

711
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,100
He'll be here soon.

712
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Fatty.

713
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Eat the steamed buns.

714
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,100
Otherwise, you won't beat him.

715
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,100
Who said that?

716
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,100
Fatty, don't you hate him?

717
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,100
Fatty.

718
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,100
Why are you staring at me?

719
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,100
I'm not.

720
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,100
Look at me.

721
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
I'm asking you a question.

722
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,100
You want to answer me.

723
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,100
You and that bastard, Li Xiaoyang.

724
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,100
He's a bastard.

725
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,100
Anyway, you two have a good relationship.

726
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,100
There are times when we're bad.

727
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,100
Do you have a lover?

728
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,100
No.

729
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,100
Do you have a hug?

730
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,100
No.

731
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,100
Do you have a kiss?

732
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,100
No.

733
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,100
Do you want to have a kiss with him?

734
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,100
No.

735
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,100
Do you want to be his wife?

736
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,100
No.

737
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,100
You...

738
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,100
You're a beautiful woman.

739
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,100
You've already had a lover.

740
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,100
You still love him.

741
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,100
Am I really that kind of person?

742
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
Yes. You're a bastard.

743
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,100
Don't you know that Ling'er is suffering?

744
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,100
Yes.

745
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,100
Then you must hate him.

746
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,100
No.

747
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,100
You're lying.

748
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,100
I always think he's more suitable for Xiaoyang than me.

749
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,100
He was not fair at first,

750
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,100
but now I think about it.

751
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,100
Love can't be forced.

752
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Then why are you still pestering him?

753
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,100
I didn't want to get anything.

754
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,100
I just want to see him smile and be happy.

755
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,100
I love him.

756
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,100
I can't be a fool.

757
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,100
You hit yourself 100 times,

758
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,100
yet you say that you're a scumbag.

759
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
You're a scumbag.

760
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,100
If you can't recover, don't blame me.

761
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,100
I'm a scumbag.

762
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,100
I'm a scumbag.

763
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,100
I'm a scumbag.

764
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
I'm a scumbag.

765
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,100
I'm a scumbag.

766
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
I'm a scumbag.

767
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,100
I'm a scumbag.

768
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
I'm a scumbag.

769
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
I'm a scumbag.

770
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,100
I'm a scumbag.

771
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
I'm a scumbag.

772
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,100
I'm a scumbag.

773
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,100
I'm a scumbag.

774
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,100
I'm a scumbag.

775
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,100
I'm a scumbag.

776
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,100
I'm a scumbag.

777
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
I'm a scumbag.

778
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,600
You barged into an argument,

779
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,100
but you still wear the lumps of Coulete,

780
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,100
outside of the court.

781
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
You were born when I left.

782
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,100
A young man told me that he knew you.

783
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,100
Where is he?

784
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,100
Did you get cheated by someone?

785
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,100
You were caught.

786
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,100
This guy... I killed him!

787
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,100
He didn't bully you.

788
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
I don't think it's possible.

789
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,100
Unless he's blind.

790
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,100
Tell me where you went.

791
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,100
Let's go.

792
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Princess, do you want some water?

793
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
No, thanks.

794
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,100
Princess.

795
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,100
Princess.

796
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,100
You're back.

797
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
Don't be afraid.

798
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,100
You're so stupid.

799
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Anyway, that A'nu is also fake.

800
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
How do you know?

801
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,100
Princess Tangyi told me.

802
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:41,100
She said that you're the best at changing yourself.

803
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,100
But look at that bald head.

804
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
How can you hide his eyes?

805
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,100
It seems that you've been able to take care of him.

806
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,100
A'nu, I'd better persuade you to change back.

807
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Because I almost got found by the mayor.

808
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,100
Luckily, he helped you to forgive me.

809
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
I'm sorry.

810
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,100
You're back.

811
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,100
Why are you so naughty?

812
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,100
I'm not talking to you.

813
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,100
A'nu.

814
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,100
I met someone in Yangzhou.

815
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,100
Who?

816
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,100
Li Xiaoyou and Lin Yueru.

817
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,100
I even made up a little bit.

818
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,100
A'nu, you can't bully Yueru.

819
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,100
She's not a fox.

820
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,100
Actually, I think she's not a bad person.

821
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,100
Actually, she's not a bad person.

822
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,100
Old man, you go away.

823
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,100
You're the one who's going to listen to women.

824
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
You're a woman.

825
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
You're just a woman.

826
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,100
You'll hate it.

827
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,100
Then we should be more confident.

828
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,100
One day, we'll prove it with actions.

829
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,100
We're not the useless people in her eyes.

830
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,100
It shows that you're not broke or stubborn.

831
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
Well, what are you saying?

832
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,100
He's a doll.

833
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,740
I suddenly went through three times when this guy

834
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,740
came out of nowhere in my life.

835
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,100
I was Dad's son.

836
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,100
Shui gek punctually stabbed you.

837
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
Tell me what happened.

838
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,100
Why should I tell you?

839
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,100
If you don't tell me, I'll be upset.

840
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,100
If I'm upset, I'll be angry with you.

841
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,100
So you won't be happy.

842
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,100
Fine.

843
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,100
Can I be happy with you?

844
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,100
You want me to leave?

845
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,100
I just want to remind you that you came here to look for Ling'er.

846
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,100
When did I say I didn't want to look for Ling'er?

847
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
You can go back.

848
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,100
I don't want to.

849
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,100
Unless you make it clear.

850
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,100
Can you be quiet?

851
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,100
Fine. I'll leave.

852
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,100
Let me tell you.

853
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,100
A woman should look like a woman.

854
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,100
Don't always be angry with her.

855
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,100
No one will be able to take care of you.

856
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,100
You can be yourself first.

857
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Why should I be?

858
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,100
I don't like you.

859
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,100
You're a dead man.

860
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,100
Oh, my god.

861
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,100
I've got all my treasures.

862
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
What should I do?

863
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,100
What's wrong?

864
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,100
Please help me.

865
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,100
The woman has stolen all my treasures.

866
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,100
Please help me.

867
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,100
Don't worry. I'll get you back.

868
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,100
Xiaoyang, what are you doing?

869
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,100
Here.

870
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,100
Oh, my god.

871
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,100
What's wrong?

872
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,100
It smells so special.

873
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,100
What's that?

874
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,100
Didn't you notice?

875
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,100
Chief Fan.

876
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,100
Qiu Dan.

877
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,100
We're still together.

878
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,100
It must be that woman.

879
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,100
Stop.

880
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,100
What are you doing?

881
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
Why don't you chase me?

882
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,100
Why don't you chase me?

883
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,100
Take it.

884
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
Thank you.

885
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,100
I'm so happy.

886
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,100
Xiaoyi, we're just going to the village to get the beads.

887
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,100
But the woman has run away.

888
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:06,100
You're not interested in my treasures?

889
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,100
I can give you...

890
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,100
What's wrong?

891
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,100
My gold is in the lake.

892
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,100
What lake?

893
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,100
Hand it over.

894
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,100
Hand it over.

895
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,100
Are you crazy?

896
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,100
You just gave us the treasure.

897
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,100
You want to frame us?

898
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,100
Fine.

899
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,100
You two chase each other.

900
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,100
You're a couple.

901
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,100
I want to get the gold.

902
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,100
I'll tell you.

903
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,100
You're not in our lake.

904
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,100
But I'll find you a partner.

905
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,100
Qiu Dan.

906
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,100
Wait for me.

907
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,100
Why are you running so fast?

908
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,100
Why are you following me?

909
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,100
I want to catch the gold lake.

910
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,100
You're so cruel.

911
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,100
I'll kill him.

912
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,100
Are you serious?

913
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,100
Go and catch the thief.

914
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,100
Go back.

915
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,100
I have my own way.

916
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,100
You...

917
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,100
Go.

918
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,100
I'm going to kill you.

919
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,100
I'm going to kill you.

920
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,100
I'm going to kill you.

921
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,100
I'm going to kill you.

922
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,100
I'm going to kill you.

923
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,100
I'm going to kill you.

924
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,100
I'm going to kill you.

925
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,100
I'm going to kill you.

926
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,100
I'm going to kill you.

927
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,100
I'm going to kill you.

928
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,100
I'm going to kill you.

929
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,100
I'm going to kill you.

930
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,100
I'm going to kill you.

931
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,100
I'm going to kill you.

932
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,100
I'm going to kill you.

933
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,100
I'm going to kill you.

934
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,100
I'm going to kill you.

935
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,100
I'm going to kill you.

936
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,100
I'm going to kill you.

937
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,100
What?

938
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,100
What are you doing?

939
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,660
Don't look at me!

940
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,900
Go away!

941
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,100
I'm not afraid of you

942
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,100
I'm not afraid of you

943
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,100
I'm not afraid of you

944
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,100
I'm not afraid of you

945
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,100
I'm not afraid of you

946
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,100
I'm not afraid of you

947
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,100
I'm not afraid of you

948
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,100
I'm not afraid of you

949
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,100
I'm not afraid of you

950
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,100
I'm not afraid of you

951
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,100
I'm not afraid of you

952
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,100
I'm not afraid of you

953
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,100
I'm not afraid of you

954
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:06,100
At least I still have a beautiful dream

955
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,100
Whatever you say

956
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,100
I really don't want to understand

957
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,100
I finally understand

958
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:20,100
I should let go

959
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,100
Whatever you say

960
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,100
I don't want to understand

961
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:34,100
At least I still have a beautiful dream

962
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:38,100
Whatever you say

963
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,100
I really don't want to understand
