1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
District kids

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Which episode will they speak?

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,560
First episode

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,760
She played the true story.

21
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,760
I have no thoughts or thoughts.

22
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,160
I can do nothing without good or evil.

23
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,160
I am good and have no fame.

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,560
I can do nothing without evil.

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,360
I am a native.

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,160
I can protect myself and give my life.

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,560
I can raise my family and give my life.

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,760
I can live with confidence.

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,760
I can think of my own life.

30
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,360
I can do evil and have no fame.

31
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,760
I can do good and have no fame.

32
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,360
I have always thought about my own life.

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,960
So, everything that happened to you in Jiangming

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,360
seems to be a blessing.

35
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,760
I am bold to say it.

36
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,360
Junior, when did you say that?

37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,960
You are so good at making a poem.

38
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,560
What a good poem.

39
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,160
No, Jiangming is a great man.

40
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,960
He will be relieved if I tell you a few words.

41
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,360
Junior, it seems that

42
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,360
you have spent thousands of years

43
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,560
to make a poem.

44
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,760
Yes.

45
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,560
We have spent thousands of years.

46
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,560
We are just trying to make a poem.

47
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,360
Now, Jiangming is relieved.

48
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,160
What about Xiao Yao?

49
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
We can do everything.

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,160
We can do everything.

51
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,560
Is it hard to be a god?

52
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,960
What is a god?

53
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,160
It is not a human being.

54
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,960
Everything is related to the body.

55
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,360
As a fate, it is the fate of the human.

56
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,560
It is an implies crossing the ring between human and human.

57
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,720
But the earth will be linked

58
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,160
and the red water will direction

59
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,560
and recognises the human.

60
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
Are the suffering people who the human self- kicked in the void?

61
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,960
If the person did not realise that

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,760
it is the particle, what would the result be?

63
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,960
What of the suffering notion is there?

64
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,560
Besides, it is natural to keep the body together.

65
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,760
It is just a type of strange attitude thatLAUGHTER Die is a personalют.

66
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,660
means to transform did the heart

67
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,180
It hurts

68
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,620
If you think more seriously

69
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,160
you can get it

70
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,640
Now I'm like Xiaoyao

71
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,900
trying to gain a little or theー

72
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,100
Ran away I can't run away

73
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,380
If you don't face nearby

74
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,340
then he will forever follow you

75
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,420
agents of your imagination

76
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,420
I choose to be happy and suffer.

77
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,420
Okay, next life.

78
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,420
I'm not my time.

79
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,420
Maybe you're really a good man.

80
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,420
You're here again. I don't want to hear it.

81
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,420
I just want you to bear the burden.

82
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,420
Don't ruin the next generation.

83
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,420
What are you talking about? I don't have a child.

84
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,420
I'm not your child.

85
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,420
I'm not your child.

86
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,420
I'm not your child.

87
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,420
I'm not your child.

88
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,420
I'm not your child.

89
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,420
I'm not your child.

90
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,420
I'm not your child.

91
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,420
I'm not your child.

92
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,420
I'm not your child.

93
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,420
Let me go.

94
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,420
Why does it feel like something is not right?

95
00:05:45,420 --> 00:06:01,540
Usually, города

96
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,460
We will solve these problems together

97
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,520
together

98
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,880
together

99
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,880
we will spoil others

100
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,000
we'll look after our country

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,940
and our people

102
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,980
and all others

103
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,880
in that situation

104
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,160
together

105
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,600
are no more than one

106
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,060
Don't take us back

107
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,580
I don't care

108
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,140
I'm very happy

109
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,100
Now we lose the Sunrying

110
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,920
Let's go

111
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,160
Wait for theans

112
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,520
What will you do now please

113
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,260
Listen to me

114
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,280
Little things go before tales

115
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,800
It's still cold

116
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,740
I feel so torture

117
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,740
to live until now

118
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,060
even yesterday

119
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,380
Our loved ones,

120
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,020
my family and friends

121
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,380
are� clip

122
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,080
No thunder

123
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
He's a slave.

124
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
He likes to play with me the most.

125
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
I must give him a surprise.

126
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,080
Candy, candy, candy, candy.

127
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,080
Candy, candy, candy, candy.

128
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Candy, candy, candy, candy.

129
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Candy, candy, candy, candy.

130
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Candy, candy, candy, candy.

131
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
You're so good.

132
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
I made this for you. You don't like it?

133
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,080
I just want to take this road.

134
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,080
No, it's far away.

135
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,080
We should be careful.

136
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
Okay.

137
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,080
Master, why did you get so crazy?

138
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
What a big wind.

139
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,080
It seems that someone misunderstood me.

140
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Father.

141
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Don't call me father.

142
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
I'm not. Don't call me...

143
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
Hurry up.

144
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
What's wrong?

145
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Go away.

146
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Go away.

147
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
Go away.

148
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,080
You're so stupid.

149
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,080
Go away.

150
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
Listen to me.

151
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Go away.

152
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Go away.

153
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Go away.

154
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Go away.

155
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Go away.

156
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
It's uncle Baiyue.

157
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
He's the enemy of the killer's man.

158
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Let's ask him.

159
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Go with me.

160
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
I'm the enemy of the killer's man.

161
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
We'll be safe when we reach Mount Zu.

162
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Finally, we can fly.

163
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
Uncle Baiyue.

164
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
Thank you, brother.

165
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Uncle Baiyue.

166
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,080
Master, what should we do now?

167
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,080
It seems that we only need some friends to help.

168
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,080
It's so beautiful.

169
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
It's so beautiful.

170
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,080
What's wrong with me?

171
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
Why are you crying?

172
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,080
Are you running away or watching the light?

173
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Uncle Baiyue is just playing with us.

174
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
He's not a bad guy.

175
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
I'm a bad guy.

176
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,080
If he catches me, I'm not afraid of him.

177
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm afraid of you.

178
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
What's wrong?

179
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
What's wrong?

180
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
I'm afraid of you.

181
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
Who told you that?

182
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
What?

183
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Why do you call me dad?

184
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,080
I told you before.

185
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,080
If anyone does something wrong, I'll call him dad.

186
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Nonsense.

187
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
I'm a family.

188
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
So what?

189
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:28,080
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad.

190
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,080
Let me ask you.

191
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Is Nanny Nanny really his mother?

192
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Of course.

193
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Is there anyone else?

194
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Do you know the Bi State?

195
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080
Yes, of course.

196
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,080
You, you, you two.

197
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
I haven't thanked you for saving me.

198
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,080
It's a good thing that you and I are together.

199
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,080
It's dangerous to save you many times.

200
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
I know.

201
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,080
I heard that you two will live in the Moon Palace when I was sleeping.

202
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Mr. Jianxian, didn't you ask them to go to Mount Zu?

203
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
I can go wherever I like.

204
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
I'll go to Nanzhao State now.

205
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,080
I want Nanny Nanny and Aunt Sheng.

206
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
Aunt Sheng?

207
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,080
What does Aunt Sheng have to do with you?

208
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
She's my master.

209
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,080
That pendant is given to Nanny Sheng.

210
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,080
It seems that there's a legend behind this pendant.

211
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,080
If half of the people meet each other,

212
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,080
they will create a white circle.

213
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,080
A horse.

214
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
Look.

215
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Mario Manor

216
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
Mario.

217
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Orhuhu?

218
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
It's Baiyue.

219
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:36,080
This Moon is not easy.

220
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,080
He won't hurt us.

221
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,080
What do you know?

222
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,080
Every time he looks like he's hurting us.

223
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,080
But it turns out to be a very strange thing.

224
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:53,080
The first time I went to the zoo, I and Tang Yu were on a beautiful grassland.

225
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
The second time I saw you.

226
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,080
This time I will share more beautiful things.

227
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,080
Uncle Tang Yu is just playing with us.

228
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Senior, you must protect the fox.

229
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
The path to the Moon is very difficult.

230
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Only my senior can compete with it.

231
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,080
Just go to the mountain.

232
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
Be careful.

233
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Go.

234
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,080
Go.

235
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,080
It's so cold.

236
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Are you okay?

237
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Is it cold?

238
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Is it better?

239
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,080
What? It's very cold.

240
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
I made it.

241
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
It can be kept warm for a while.

242
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,080
Eat it.

243
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Why don't you eat?

244
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
Senior, you eat.

245
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,080
I'm still young. I can hold it.

246
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,080
Don't look at me.

247
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
I didn't mean that.

248
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
It's just a mountaineering.

249
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
It's not.

250
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
Just push me.

251
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,080
But I found that I must have a chance.

252
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,080
It's so cold.

253
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,080
I'm still cold.

254
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,080
The Moon is not a palace.

255
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,080
It's a palace for the outside world.

256
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
It's a palace for the inside world.

257
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,080
It's a palace for the inside world.

258
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,080
No matter what, we can't get rid of it.

259
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
Little Ghost, be patient.

260
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,080
We are almost at Mount Shu.

261
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,080
It's so close to Mount Shu.

262
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,080
Don't worry.

263
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,080
I will take you to Mount Shu.

264
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,080
Silly girl.

265
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,080
I can't keep you in my life.

266
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,080
Little Ghost, are you cold?

267
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
I'm warm.

268
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
It's me.

269
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
Little Ghost.

270
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
It's done.

271
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,080
If we escape, I will...

272
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
Don't say that.

273
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,080
I don't want to get used to the palace.

274
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Zodiac?

275
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
What's the hurry?

276
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
Darkseer has come.

277
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
It's the beber.

278
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Uh huh.

279
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,920
Wait to leave the dramatically

280
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,760
Wait

281
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,660
Open the family

282
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,300
.

283
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,380
I have a thought.

284
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,900
Neormalia! Take this whoa!

285
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,380
This will protection the circuits.

286
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,760
Don't worry! I will protect myself!

287
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,480
It's not the ants'!" It's blood!

288
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,220
What do you want?

289
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,340
I've become the route after I go there.

290
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,860
After握了前面的那座山, kita meu na shunshan .

291
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,860
Senior, there is still a big distance between you and Shun Shan.

292
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,860
I know it.

293
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,860
I'm not allowed to hurt myself.

294
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,860
Everyone, be careful.

295
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,860
Especially you, A'Nu.

296
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,860
A'Nu, be careful.

297
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,860
You are no longer a child.

298
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,860
I believe you.

299
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,860
A'Nu, don't leave me.

300
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,860
A'Nu.

301
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:21,860
For the rest of your life, you can do anything you want.

302
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,860
When you see Xiao Yao, you will confess to her.

303
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,860
No.

304
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,860
No.

305
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,860
No.

306
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,860
What are you doing?

307
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,860
What are you doing?

308
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,860
Don't touch me.

309
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,860
What are you doing?

310
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,860
What are you doing?

311
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,860
What are you doing?

312
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,860
What are you doing?

313
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,860
She is doing this for you.

314
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,860
Do you want her to be ungrateful?

315
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,860
Xiao Yao.

316
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,860
I'm sorry. I have to do this.

317
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,860
Don't worry.

318
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,860
What's wrong?

319
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,860
Are you thinking about your father?

320
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,860
Although he was always full of resentment,

321
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,860
he is my father after all.

322
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,860
He can peek at him every day.

323
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,860
Did you see how your father was just now?

324
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,860
I've never seen him smile so brightly.

325
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,860
That's right.

326
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,860
I'm sorry.

327
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,860
I'm sorry.

328
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,860
I'm sorry.

329
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,860
That's right.

330
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,860
Your father is now in the entertainment world.

331
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,860
He should be happy for his daughter.

332
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,860
It's all because of you.

333
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,860
Brother Li, you helped me so much.

334
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,860
I decided to thank you in a human way.

335
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,860
I admit that I'm a very rich man.

336
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,860
But I think...

337
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,860
I'll let it go this time.

338
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,860
No. I'm not rich.

339
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,860
Then you are...

340
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,860
I'm going to marry you.

341
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,860
What?

342
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,860
I'm telling you.

343
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,860
I'm not thinking about it.

344
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,860
I just have to meet this man.

345
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,860
Why?

346
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,860
You're his wife.

347
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,860
Of course not.

348
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,860
He is my brother-in-law.

349
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,860
Because you're his brother-in-law.

350
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,860
Then I have no choice.

351
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,860
Aren't you going to find a girl named Ling'er?

352
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,860
Yes. Do you have a way?

353
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,860
We have to go to the top of the tower.

354
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,860
Except this, I've never been there.

355
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,860
But I have some magic.

356
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,860
I should be able to help.

357
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,860
This is the hidden path.

358
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,860
This is the探路.

359
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,860
And this.

360
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,860
This is a good sword.

361
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,860
This is my father's seven stars sword.

362
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,860
I give it to you.

363
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,860
I think this sword is too expensive.

364
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,860
You should leave it to yourself.

365
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,860
I don't know how to sword.

366
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
It's useless to leave it.

367
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,860
Besides, I can't marry you.

368
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,860
This sword is my love.

369
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,860
I'll take it.

370
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,860
But you have to take care of yourself.

371
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,860
Jia Bajing.

372
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,860
I'm so confused.

373
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,860
I hope to see you again.

374
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,860
But I hope you can leave safely.

375
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,860
Or...

376
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,860
Or not.

377
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,860
Take care.

378
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,860
What's wrong?

379
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,860
Don't you love beauty and Baojing?

380
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,860
I'm thinking.

381
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,860
How to use this sword to kill your father?

382
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,860
You can't do that.

383
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,860
Where are you going?

384
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,860
Why doesn't he sleep?

385
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,860
Where is he going to deal with the drug?

386
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,860
Some things can't be solved.

387
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,860
And some can't be solved.

388
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,860
The cousin said.

389
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,860
Don't guess what can't be solved.

390
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,860
Think about it.

391
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,860
I'm not a good girl.

392
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,860
I'm a good girl.

393
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,860
I'm a good girl.

394
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,860
I'm a good girl.

395
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,860
I'm a good girl.

396
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,860
Don't guess what can't be solved.

397
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,860
Don't think about what can't be solved.

398
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,860
If it's important.

399
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,860
When the time comes.

400
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,860
He will give you a chance.

401
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,860
That's a good idea.

402
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,860
I once loved a girl.

403
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,860
But I forgot her.

404
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,860
I can ignore her.

405
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,860
When the time comes.

406
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,860
Will she come back?

407
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,860
It's different.

408
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,860
Love has to be a different person.

409
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,860
Because she is really good.

410
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,860
But.

411
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,860
If you really love someone.

412
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,860
Can you forget her?

413
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,860
Of course not.

414
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,860
I think so.

415
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,860
You think about the fairy island.

416
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,860
Think about you and Ling'er.

417
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,860
Is it just a dream?

418
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,860
And you once loved her.

419
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,860
It's not strange.

420
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,860
If I'm a man.

421
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,860
I will love her.

422
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,860
She.

423
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,860
Can't let women be jealous.

424
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,860
Do you know who I think?

425
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
I know.

426
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,860
But not only one person.

427
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,860
I think of Ling'er.

428
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,860
I think of her.

429
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,860
I'm afraid of myself.

430
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,860
I've let her down.

431
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,860
So I have to find her.

432
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,860
To make up for my past.

433
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,860
I hope she is real.

434
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,860
Yue Ru.

435
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,860
Think about it.

436
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,860
If you really feel sad.

437
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,860
I will never let you go.

438
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,860
You just go.

439
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,860
Then.

440
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,860
Just go as the time comes.

441
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,860
I tell you.

442
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,860
I won't be so stupid.

443
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,860
Let you be with Ling'er.

444
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,860
Even if I die.

445
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,860
I will be your ghost.

446
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,860
You are so annoying.

447
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,860
You are so stubborn.

448
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,860
Don't die.

449
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,860
You.

450
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,860
I'm kidding.

451
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,860
Do you understand?

452
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,860
You.

453
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,860
So.

454
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,860
No matter what.

455
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,860
You are mine.

456
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,860
You are so stubborn.

457
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,860
Yes.

458
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,860
Don't think I'm a man.

459
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,860
This is called.

460
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,860
A pair of destiny.

461
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,860
Don't think so much.

462
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,860
Even if you are not.

463
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,860
I can live.

464
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,860
That's good.

465
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,860
Don't think I let you go so easily.

466
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,860
After you save Ling'er.

467
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,860
I will give you a big heart.

468
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,860
Okay.

469
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
Then.

470
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,860
You will be on the street.

471
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,860
Tell all my parents.

472
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,860
I don't want this.

473
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,860
Then you will be a good girl.

474
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,860
I'm leaving.

475
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,860
Look.

476
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,860
My son is giving it to us.

477
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,860
No one can help you this time.

478
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,860
Ling'er.

479
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,860
Are you willing to stay here?

480
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,860
Yes.

481
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,860
I will.

482
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,860
I will.

483
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,860
Senior.

484
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,860
Promise me.

485
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,860
You don't see Xiao Yong.

486
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,860
I will keep you.

487
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,860
You mean.

488
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,860
Or Li Ke?

489
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,860
Li Ke.

490
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,860
You are so naive.

491
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,860
You are so stubborn.

492
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,860
I am a woman.

493
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,860
But I am a man.

494
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,860
Please forgive me.

495
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,860
I will do my best.

496
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,860
I will do my best.

497
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,860
I will do my best.

498
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,860
Senior.

499
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,860
You are so naive.

500
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,860
I don't want you to be a woman.

501
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,860
I am just a woman.

502
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,860
I am a woman.

503
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,860
I can't live without you.

504
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,860
You are so naive.

505
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,860
You are so stubborn.

506
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,860
You are so stubborn.

507
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,860
You are so naive.

508
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,860
I will be a good girl.

509
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,860
I am being warned.

510
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,860
I am protecting you.

511
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,860
What do you mean?

512
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,860
You are good and evil.

513
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,860
The tower is a place of evil.

514
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,860
But it is full of senior's kindness.

515
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,860
I can't hide Ling'er's feelings.

516
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,860
Good.

517
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,860
We are also one.

518
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,860
I am willing to listen to you again.

519
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,860
I can't.

520
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,860
Love is more important than human's hair.

521
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,860
Love is just one of them.

522
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,860
It is important to have less hair.

523
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,860
But it is not a big deal.

524
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,860
If you don't have life,

525
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,860
you think this hair can grow.

526
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,860
You can still use this hair

527
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,860
to tie other hair together.

528
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,860
And make beautiful hair.

529
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,860
To beautify your appearance.

530
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,860
To make your life full.

531
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,860
You mean

532
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,860
someone will sacrifice in our life?

533
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,860
It is hard to say.

534
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,860
If Xiaoyao keeps running here,

535
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,860
then there will be one person

536
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,860
who will be in trouble.

537
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,860
Can it be me?

538
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,860
But there is an important person in the world.

539
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,860
It is the whole human being.

540
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,860
I can only tell you.

541
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,860
The more I think about it,

542
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,860
the higher the chance of sacrifice.

543
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,860
I don't object to you finding your life.

544
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,860
It is your choice.

545
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,860
But if you miss one of them,

546
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,860
it may be Xiaoyao.

547
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,860
It may be Yueyu.

548
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:30,860
Then this kind of happiness is considered happiness.

549
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,860
There is a sweet in the bitter, there is love in the grace.

550
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,860
If there is love in the suffering,

551
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,860
there is no love in the suffering.

552
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,860
How can we be free from love?

553
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,860
Sir,

554
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,860
can you save Yueyu and Xiaoyao?

555
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,860
Yes.

556
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,860
You should leave immediately.

557
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,860
You should never see Li Xiaoyao again.

558
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,860
Don't think about her again.

559
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,860
Really?

560
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,860
Only this?

561
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:08,860
It is not a big deal to have a good relationship.

562
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,860
Okay.

563
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,860
I am willing to.

564
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,860
Don't worry.

565
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,860
I will give you to the safest place.

566
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,860
I will give you to the safest place.

567
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,860
From now on,

568
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,860
unless the world is in danger,

569
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,860
the life and death of the two of us will be cut off.

570
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,860
Thank you for your help.

571
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,860
I will be grateful to you.

572
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,860
Xiaoyao.

573
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,860
Xiaoyao.

574
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,860
Goodbye.

575
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,860
Goodbye.

576
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,860
Why am I still here?

577
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,860
How is this possible?

578
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,860
Why am I still here?

579
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,860
You must still miss Xiaoyao.

580
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:07,860
I still can't forget her?

581
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,860
I have already reminded you.

582
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,860
You must forget everything.

583
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,860
Only the Yikun tree can be a city.

584
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,860
No.

585
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,860
I can't forget her.

586
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,860
Is this all destined?

587
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,860
I can't let Xiaoyao and Yueru sacrifice.

588
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,860
No.

589
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,860
I want to forget Xiaoyao.

590
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,860
Forget her.

591
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,860
I want to leave here.

592
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,860
Let me go.

593
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,860
I want to leave here.

594
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,860
I want to save them.

595
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,860
Let me go.

596
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,860
I want to leave here.

597
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,860
Senior.

598
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,860
Help Ling'er.

599
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,860
Ling'er is useless.

600
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,860
I can't forget her.

601
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,860
Ling'er.

602
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,860
You are in trouble.

603
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,860
I'm not afraid of trouble.

604
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,860
Please, you must save Xiaoyao and Yueru.

605
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,860
They are in trouble.

606
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,860
Ling'er is willing to take them.

607
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,860
Please, you are the senior.

608
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,860
Please.

609
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,860
Maybe, Sidan will help.

610
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,860
This is...

611
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,860
This is the listless.

612
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,860
Listless?

613
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,860
Is it the same as the one Xiaoyao and Yueru have?

614
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,860
But Sidan is stronger.

615
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,860
He can forget everything.

616
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,860
Everything.

617
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,860
Even himself.

618
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:36,580
So Pお願い

619
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,860
Everything you have done will be remembered by the heavens.

620
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,860
I don't want to understand

621
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:49,860
At least I still have a beautiful dream

622
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,860
Don't say anything

623
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,860
I really don't want to understand

624
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,860
I finally understand

625
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:03,860
I should let go

626
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,860
Don't say anything

627
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,860
I don't want to understand

628
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:18,860
At least I still have a beautiful dream

629
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,860
Don't say anything

630
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,860
I really don't want to understand

631
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,860
I finally understand

632
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,860
I should let go
