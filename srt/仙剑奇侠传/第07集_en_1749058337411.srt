1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's go to the next round.

18
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Nian.

19
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,920
How unfortunately hard is this game against the game from A to B?

20
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,460
The game lost so quickly on the Internet,

21
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,960
and you seem to forget it.

22
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,720
I used to tend to play

23
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,640
You, I want to be live on a foreign shore,

24
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,340
Who can group Power?

25
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,840
Let's go.

26
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,840
Put a token to this.

27
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,320
Yubo,

28
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,700
have a seat.

29
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,720
If you don't come, how dare you call my name?

31
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Elder, you're really great.

32
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
Elder, you're here to help me.

33
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,720
I'm confident in this game.

34
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Your Majesty, please understand.

35
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,720
I'm not going out for you alone, but for the country of Nan Zhao.

36
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,720
It's been a long time since I've seen you.

37
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Xu Jiren, please remember.

38
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,720
I'll be there in a day.

39
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,720
Don't be so anxious.

40
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,720
Father! Father, come out!

41
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Father! Father!

42
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,720
You must get rid of all the servants and let Li Xiaoyao go to Zhao Ling'er.

43
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
How dare you order your father?

44
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
You knew he was taken away by the snake demon.

45
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,720
But you can't see him and ask him to enter the city.

46
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Do you know that?

47
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
It's two things.

48
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,720
I'll take care of the snake demon.

49
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Are you going to force Li Xiaoyao to marry me?

50
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,720
You've never cared about me.

51
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,720
You only care about your own face.

52
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
I did all this for you.

53
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,720
You can't let a young man marry you in front of the army.

54
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
You're afraid that others will gossip.

55
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
You're afraid that you can't even manage a young man.

56
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,720
You're afraid that the leader of the martial arts world will be killed.

57
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
Is this what a woman said to her father?

58
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,720
The leader of the martial arts world is like this.

59
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,720
I even feel so ashamed.

60
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
I won't let you go.

61
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Let's go back to the room.

62
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
Go!

63
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
Go!

64
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
You're going to kill me?

65
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
I'll cover her up.

66
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
Go!

67
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Let go of me!

68
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
I won't marry you.

69
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
I won't marry you.

70
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
You're a old fox.

71
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,720
You're a leader of the martial arts world.

72
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,720
You can't marry someone if someone takes away the snake demon.

73
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,720
Yuzhang, you're too much.

74
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Shut up. I won't give you a head.

75
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
You're going to marry me in front of the army.

76
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,720
I'll force you to marry me.

77
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
I'll force you.

78
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
I'll force you.

79
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
There are two ways.

80
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
One is death.

81
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
The other is a good-for-nothing.

82
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Yuzhang, is that reasonable?

83
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
It's none of your business.

84
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
Stop!

85
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,720
This is the imperial decree.

86
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
It's as good as the emperor's.

87
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
It's not expensive.

88
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
It's a big head.

89
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,720
This marriage is not for sale.

90
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
It's not a favor for the emperor.

91
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Master Li, let's go.

92
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Let's go.

93
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Yuzhang, you can go.

94
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Yuzhang, you can go.

95
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,720
I'll force you to marry me.

96
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
I'll force you to marry me.

97
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
I'll force you to marry me.

98
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
I'll force you to marry me.

99
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
I'll force you to marry me.

100
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,720
I'll force you to marry me.

101
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,720
I'll force you to marry me.

102
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,720
I'll force you to marry me.

103
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
I'll force you to marry me.

104
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
I'll force you to marry me.

105
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
I'll force you to marry me.

106
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
I'll force you to marry me.

107
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
I'll force you to marry me.

108
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,720
You must leave the Lin family and never come back.

109
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,720
I won't come back.

110
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
We're leaving.

111
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
We didn't bring enough luggage.

112
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Cousin, you should have brought enough.

113
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Cousin, this is your first time out.

114
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
I'm a little nervous.

115
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,720
I'm a little experienced.

116
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
I'll take care of you.

117
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Okay, I'll take care of you.

118
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
I'll go to the market later.

119
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Okay, I'll buy tea, paper, ink and ink.

120
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Cousin, did you bring the bag?

121
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
I've been carrying it.

122
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
That's good.

123
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Otherwise, you won't be able to sleep.

124
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
What bag?

125
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
What's wrong with you?

126
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Ji Yuan, can you lend me your ID card?

127
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
No, I can't.

128
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Don't be so petty.

129
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Cousin, this is not a small issue.

130
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Brother Liao, you're talking nonsense.

131
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
You didn't see how he looks like.

132
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,720
He looks like a beggar.

133
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
He even hit the wheel.

134
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Let me tell you.

135
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,720
You said I was fine.

136
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,720
But don't forget that you're my subordinate.

137
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
If I were a beggar,

138
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
you'd be the boss.

139
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
You...

140
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
You're so petty.

141
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
My brain is broken.

142
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
I'll use this to cut the knife.

143
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Let's see what that little boy is like.

144
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
No!

145
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
No!

146
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Your Majesty, I'm a beggar.

147
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
I'm a beggar.

148
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
I'm a beggar.

149
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
I'm a beggar.

150
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
I'm a beggar.

151
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
What's wrong?

152
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
It's burnt.

153
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
It's not a snake.

154
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
It's not a snake.

155
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
Don't hit me.

156
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Don't hit me.

157
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
It's not a snake.

158
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Don't hit me.

159
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
Call someone else.

160
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
Call more people.

161
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Hurry up.

162
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
Hurry up.

163
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Hurry up.

164
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Hurry up.

165
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,720
I'm not a murderer. I'm not a murderer.

166
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
How could I be like this?

167
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,720
I'm a blood.

168
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
I'm a blood.

169
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
Why did you come here?

170
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
I'm a blood.

171
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Brother Xiaoyao.

172
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
Brother Xiaoyao.

173
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
Brother Xiaoyao.

174
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Let's meet again in the next life.

175
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Wait.

176
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Uncle, go away.

177
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
I'm a monster.

178
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
I'll bring you a killer.

179
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Miss Xiaoyao.

180
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,720
It's a happy thing to see you.

181
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
I didn't lie to you. Go away.

182
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Happy?

183
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
I want to be happy.

184
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Close your eyes.

185
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
I'm a blood.

186
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Zheng Taiyuan.

187
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Something unexpected is waiting for you.

188
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Come.

189
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Look.

190
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Why?

191
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
My stomach doesn't hurt.

192
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Uncle, who are you?

193
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,720
Why are you so scared?

194
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
I'm a monster.

195
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
I'm a monster.

196
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
I'm begging you.

197
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
I don't know what happened.

198
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
You're so scared.

199
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,720
You're going to kill me.

200
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
You have to save him.

201
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
You're the one who has to save them.

202
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
Me?

203
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Yes.

204
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
I'm a monster.

205
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
You've been so angry.

206
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
You must help them.

207
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Those who are angry and angry are all me.

208
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
I'm a monster.

209
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
I'm a monster.

210
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
I'm a monster.

211
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Don't ask me again.

212
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,720
I've never been so generous.

213
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,720
I've said everything.

214
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Miss Xiaoyao.

215
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,720
You're not a monster.

216
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,720
You're the descendant of the god clan.

217
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
A female monster?

218
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,720
The female monster is the mother of the land.

219
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
So when I think of those happy things,

220
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
the plants will die.

221
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,720
And the smart ones are so cunning.

222
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,720
But if you dare to go to the mountain,

223
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
you'll be hurt.

224
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Then you'll be killed.

225
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,720
Only you and your mother can make a living.

226
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
The world is open.

227
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
I have a mother.

228
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,720
You're the queen.

229
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,720
I don't know who I am.

230
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,720
I'm a monster.

231
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,720
The queen is a beautiful and beautiful girl.

232
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,720
She is a beautiful girl.

233
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,720
She is beautiful and beautiful.

234
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,720
She is a beautiful girl.

235
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,720
The queen is a beautiful girl.

236
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,720
She is beautiful and beautiful.

237
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,720
She is beautiful and beautiful.

238
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Since you're back,

239
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,720
you should save the life.

240
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
I see.

241
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
Uncle Shan Shan.

242
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Do you have any more lessons?

243
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Okay.

244
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Although I haven't read a book,

245
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
I'm not good at speaking.

246
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,720
I'll go to the past and enjoy the happiness.

247
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,720
You'll be happy.

248
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Come on.

249
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Yes.

250
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,720
Save the innocent villagers.

251
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
I'm sorry.

252
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
I'm sorry.

253
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
I'm sorry.

254
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
I'm sorry.

255
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
I'm sorry.

256
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
I'm sorry.

257
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
I'm sorry.

258
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
I'm sorry.

260
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
I'm sorry.

261
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
I'm sorry.

262
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
I'm sorry.

263
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
I'm sorry.

264
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
I'm sorry.

265
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
I'm sorry.

266
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
I'm sorry.

267
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
I'm sorry.

269
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
I'm sorry.

271
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
I'm sorry.

272
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
I'm sorry.

273
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
I'm sorry.

274
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
I'm sorry.

275
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
I'm sorry.

276
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm sorry.

278
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
I'm sorry.

280
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Do you want to know something?

281
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
Brother Xiaoyao.

282
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,720
Your brother Xiaoyao must be a good person.

283
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
But

284
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
he seems to forget me.

285
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,720
It's the most important thing in the world to not turn back time.

286
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,720
What about love?

287
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Who is the one who raised you?

288
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
I'm the mother of the father.

289
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
I'm the mother of the father.

290
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,720
I've been a mother since I was a child.

291
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
I'm also a mother.

292
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,720
You are the father of the father.

293
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
What does it mean?

294
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
I want to be with him.

295
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
That's right.

296
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
But the mother of the child.

297
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Are they good people?

298
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Very good.

299
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,720
Then it means they can be happy soon.

300
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
They can be happy soon.

301
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Do you feel it?

302
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
Yes.

303
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
They...

304
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,720
Little girl.

305
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,720
You can't exercise with children.

306
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,720
I really have children?

307
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Yes.

308
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,720
So I can show you my true self.

309
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,720
I'm the one who is the mother of the father.

310
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
Great.

311
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
I have a child.

312
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Little girl.

313
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
When your child is born,

314
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
you should tell him

315
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,720
what I told you today.

316
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
It's a happy life.

317
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
It's a happy life.

318
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,720
It's a happy life.

319
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
That's right.

320
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
The emperor is in the palace.

321
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
The ancestors are in the palace.

322
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
Who are you?

323
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,720
Shi Gonghu.

324
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
It's been ten years since the last time I saw you.

325
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
You're finally back.

326
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Come.

327
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Your Majesty.

328
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
You'll have a body if you don't drink.

329
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,720
I'll wait for someone.

330
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
I'll go to the prison.

331
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,720
I'll go to the prison to pay the price.

332
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
You can leave.

333
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Yes.

334
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Senior.

335
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
You're the third prince.

336
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Get up.

337
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
You can't be less.

338
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,720
Get up.

339
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
I have a plan.

340
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Your Majesty needs three thousand soldiers.

341
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,720
You can lead the tiger school

342
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,720
to eliminate the Moon Sect.

343
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
Let's not talk about this.

344
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,720
I'm here to discuss this matter.

345
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
Your Majesty.

346
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,720
How can we not talk about it?

347
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
I want to ask you.

348
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,720
What is the importance of saving and eliminating?

349
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
What is the importance of saving and eliminating?

350
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Why do you ask me this?

351
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
I'm thinking about it.

352
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Moon Sect can't be eliminated.

353
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
But you can't be eliminated.

354
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
I still don't understand.

355
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
I'm willing to do anything.

356
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,720
My mother told me that her daughter, A'Du,

357
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
was in danger.

358
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
I think you should go save her.

359
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
Your Majesty, you're asking me

360
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,720
which is more important reason to save and eliminate?

361
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
Exactly.

362
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,720
But you can't be eliminated

363
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
by the Moon Sect.

364
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,720
It's the same as saving and eliminating Zhao.

365
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
Your Majesty.

366
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,720
It's more important to save and eliminate

367
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,720
one person.

368
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

369
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
I didn't want to save her.

370
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,720
As long as I save the princess,

371
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
I'll do my best

372
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,720
to deal with Moon Sect with you.

373
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Of course, I understand.

374
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
The new king of the South Zhao State

375
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
is the new king of the South Zhao State.

376
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
If your son has a problem,

377
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
how can you take it?

378
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
Of course, you'll choose to design it.

379
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,720
It's not fair.

380
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,720
If Your Majesty wants to do something more important,

381
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,720
it's not far from the country.

382
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
I'll go to the capital.

383
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,720
I'll go to the capital.

384
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,720
I've made up my mind.

385
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,720
I can't convince Your Majesty.

386
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Fine.

387
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
I'll let you go.

388
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
I'll help you save the princess.

389
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Take care of the country.

390
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
I'll give you a handkerchief

391
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
to make a good painting.

392
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
After the trial,

393
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,720
I'll reward you with a lot.

394
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,720
It's not necessary.

395
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,720
Within three months,

396
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
I'll finish the trial.

397
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
After that,

398
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,720
you can't go to the mountain again.

399
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,720
I'll do my best

400
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720
to help you.

401
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Leading Rep invitation

402
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,720
is a great gift.

403
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
Thank you so much.

404
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
Go!

405
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Go!

406
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
One, two, three.

407
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Go!

408
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
One, two, three.

409
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
Go!

410
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
Go!

411
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Go!

412
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Why did you lose your hand?

413
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Father, it's because of your wife.

414
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
Because of the blood of the South Manchurian,

415
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
it's so cruel.

416
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
Father, please forgive me.

417
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
My family is going to be destroyed.

418
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
It's because of you.

419
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,720
You're so useless.

420
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,720
General, Tang Yu has been dressed up.

421
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,720
You were taught by the senior master.

422
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,720
You should know his temper.

423
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
He is a good man.

424
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,720
I will try to satisfy his request.

425
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,720
Sometimes, his request is too much.

426
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
You just have to do it.

427
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Tang Yu won't let you down.

428
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,720
I will help you to bring her back safely.

429
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,720
I believe you will be in a good mood.

430
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
I am relieved.

431
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
General!

432
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
Are you ready?

433
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Yes.

434
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,720
You are the most powerful and most powerful men in my family.

435
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
I won't let you down.

436
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
Don't worry, General.

437
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
I will do my best.

438
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
Okay, let's go.

439
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
Go and meet the senior master.

440
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Yes, sir.

441
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Tang Yu.

442
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,720
Do you have anything else to tell me?

443
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Bring back the girl from Anu.

444
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Anu has gone to the Central Plains.

445
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
I have prepared something for her.

446
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,720
Take her to the Central Plains.

447
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
If she doesn't listen to me, you will punish her.

448
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
Yes, sir.

449
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
How embarrassing to kill you.

450
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
Though you want to beat me,

451
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,720
I will hate you.

452
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,720
But I will do my best.

453
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
Okay, on my knees.

454
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,720
Do the troops in the central Plains listen to me.

455
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,720
We don't dare to disobey the law.

456
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
You don't dare to obey the law.

457
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Not that you don't dare to obey the law,

458
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
but you don't dare to obey the law.

459
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,720
Because what you heard is just a rumor.

460
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
The King of the City

461
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
Your Majesty.

462
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,720
I'm not here to serve the court or to learn medicine.

463
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,720
You have better than me.

464
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
You have better than me.

465
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,720
You have better than me.

466
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,720
I'll listen to you.

467
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
I'll do whatever you say.

468
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,720
I want the perfect task to bring the princess back.

469
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Your Majesty.

470
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,720
To ensure the princess' safety,

471
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,720
we must keep this action in mind.

472
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,720
We can't expose ourselves to the public.

473
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Understand?

474
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
Yes.

475
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
Keep moving.

476
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
Yes.

477
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,720
Hey, can you two walk faster?

478
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
I knew you would do it.

479
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
You bought it?

480
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
You bought it?

481
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
You even bought a bag?

482
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
You even said you wanted me?

483
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
Hey, I bought a pair of 17-piece.

484
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,720
And you bought it?

485
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
You bought it?

486
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
It's all the necessities.

487
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
The necessities?

488
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,720
Li.

489
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Master.

490
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,720
What?

491
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
Li.

492
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,720
Li?

493
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,720
I can't see my body.

494
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
It's really him.

495
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,720
A walking dog, a thinking dog.

496
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,720
If they don't die, they'll die.

497
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Hey, do you have any snake demon?

498
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
No.

499
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Have you seen a girl who is 15 or 16 years old?

500
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,720
She's pretty.

501
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
She's probably here.

502
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,720
There are many pretty girls here.

503
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,720
Her name is Ling.

504
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
She's pretty like a fairy.

505
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Ling?

506
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,720
No.

507
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
No one here.

508
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Thank you.

509
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
Hello.

510
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
Sir.

511
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
Have you seen a girl who is 16 years old?

512
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,720
She's a young and mature girl.

513
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
She's a noble girl.

514
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,720
Hey, hey.

515
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Don't talk nonsense.

516
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,720
I said no.

517
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
There are many snakes here.

518
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
They're here to catch the demon.

519
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Then you should stay here.

520
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
I'm talking about the girl.

521
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Okay, okay.

522
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
You...

523
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,720
How can you get up?

524
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
You're so stubborn.

525
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,720
I'll go to the next room.

526
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
I can open the door for you.

527
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
Hey, how can they come here?

528
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
How can they come here?

529
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,720
It's a young and mature girl.

530
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,720
She's here to catch the demon.

531
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
She's in the cage.

532
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
She's got a little snake.

533
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
She's got a tiger's fin.

534
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
She's got a lion fin.

535
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,720
It's aきのいいin.

536
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
It's a poor man.

537
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Come over.

538
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,720
At the Create GOT�� care is the best in the world.

539
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,720
I'm not a bad girl.

540
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
What's wrong?

541
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,720
Who told you to walk so fast?

542
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,720
You two are so slow.

543
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,720
You should be careful.

544
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,720
Master Li, Yue Ru is worried about you.

545
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,720
So she wants to talk to you.

546
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,720
I'm worried that you two won't be able to walk so fast.

547
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
I understand.

548
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Enough! I've never seen such a bad person before.

549
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
I'm sorry.

550
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
What are you doing?

551
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Remember, they're loyal people.

552
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
I know.

553
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
My money.

554
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Wait!

555
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
What's wrong?

556
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Did you get caught?

557
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,720
He stole your money.

558
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
You can't let him go.

559
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,720
He stole my money.

560
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
It's not easy.

561
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,720
Could he be the one who controlled the enemy?

562
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,720
He must be the one who killed the enemy.

563
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,720
He must be the one who killed Yue.

564
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,720
We can't let him go.

565
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,720
But the loyal people are also caught, right?

566
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Yes.

567
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,720
I told you to keep it a secret.

568
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,720
No, I should be the one who got caught.

569
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,720
He was stealing nowadays like this.

570
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,720
I felt like I'll lose my money when I was精ed.

571
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
What?

572
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,720
What are you saying?

573
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,720
That's why I was careful.

574
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,720
I'm afraid he'll see through me after he's done with it.

575
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,720
Inside this pool,

576
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,720
you can600 orバッ 방.

577
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,720

Is it crazy or stupid, old man

582
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,460
Why he doesn't resonate when I peeked at him twice

583
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,840
Haven't you heard that,

584
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,240
bearded man of Aviation

585
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,900

Why is he not willing to give up ab hältou

600
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,920
What are you doing

601
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
How is it?

602
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,920
Do you like your wife?

603
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,920
Ah Qi, you're here.

604
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,920
You brat.

605
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
You don't even want to go out?

606
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,920
I? Who is going out?

607
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,920
Those who left the house are all evil women.

608
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,920
You're not only a woman, but also a woman who can pretend to be a girl.

609
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
You even want to steal her money.

610
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,920
This is called self-reliance.

611
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,920
We have money to buy Shan Zheng Hai Wei.

612
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,920
At least we can have money to buy a steamed bun.

613
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,920
I haven't paid you yet. Why did you want to kill me and my cousin?

614
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,920
I'll take your heart out and see if it's black.

615
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,920
I knew I wouldn't go to find that old man.

616
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,920
If it was someone else, you'd be arrested.

617
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
Don't come to me.

618
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,920
You're always so wild.

619
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,920
That old man stole her three times and didn't even pay her.

620
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
He's not a fool.

621
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
Have you ever heard of it?

622
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,920
I don't care if you're a cultured or a rich man.

623
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,920
What are you doing?

624
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,920
You're a man of your own right. What is this nonsense?

625
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,920
You're a woman who can pretend to be a girl.

626
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,920
You can steal her money or steal her money.

627
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,920
You're a woman who can pretend to be a girl.

628
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,920
If you don't like her, you can stop being a man.

629
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Who are you?

630
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,920
I'm the one.

631
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
You're taking me with you?

632
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,920
You...

633
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,920
Come here.

634
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,920
You're a woman who can pretend to be a girl.

635
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
Come here.

636
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,920
I thought you were a woman.

637
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,920
You're a woman who can pretend to be a girl.

638
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
Don't move.

639
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,920
You're a woman who can pretend to be a girl.

640
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,920
Hello.

641
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,920
Hello, young master.

642
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,920
Was that rude?

643
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
It's serious.

644
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,920
Good night.

645
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,920
Good night.

646
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,920
What are you doing?

647
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
It's fun.

648
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
What is it?

649
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,920
Come out.

650
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,920
It's a hand-to-hand game.

651
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,920
Okay.

652
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Okay.

653
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,920
Okay.

Okay.

665
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,920
Okay.

666
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,920
Okay.

Okay.

673
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,920
Fine, you sign it.

674
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,320
The symbol on the top of your sleeve.

675
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,280
Correct in Chinese, doesn't matter.

676
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,760
They are both także

677
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,920
we are responsible

678
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,160
for this application.

679
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,920
I know how to read it.

680
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
You've learnt it just now.

681
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
We know that.

682
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,920
Right.

683

who is the best cook?

686
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,480
Everyone dreamed

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,180
You can call it by your name.

688
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,480
When shall we meet?

689
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:39,920
Our place has become much smaller.

690
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,320
It's Ochin.

691
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:54,460
While starting to get some comfortableheels here,

692
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,460
So powerful.

Help!

694
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,460
Brother!

695
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,460
Who killed you?

696
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,460
So wild.

697
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,460
Lady, you should leave.

698
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,460
There are snake and demon.

699
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,460
Yes, there are many people.

700
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,460
They are all dead.

701
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,460
Snake and demon?

702
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,460
Where is the snake and demon?

703
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,460
In the forest over there.

704
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,460
Go with them.

705
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,460
Go with them.

706
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,460
Little butterfly,

707
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,460
you are happy for me, too.

708
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,460
Let's go.

709
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,460
Brother, I'm leaving.

710
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,460
Let's go to the river.

711
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,460
Brother.

712
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,460
Brother.
